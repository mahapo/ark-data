00:00:24.888 --> 00:00:26.680 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.900 align:middle line:10%
You know, we have
many incredible guests

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.880 align:middle line:10%
on this program, and
we have over the years.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.550 align:middle line:10%
But in this program
today, we're going

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.130 align:middle line:10%
to talk with an individual
who is on the cutting

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.950 align:middle line:10%
edge of where we
will be in terms

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.510 align:middle line:10%
of the future of humanity.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.280 align:middle line:10%
His name is Daniel Pinchbeck.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.990 align:middle line:10%
He's the bestselling
author of "Breaking

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:49.510 align:middle line:10%
Open the Head," "2012, The
Return of Quetzalcoatl,"

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:50.770 align:middle line:10%
and "How Soon is Now?"

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.680 align:middle line:10%
And his new book is called
"When Plants Dream."

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.590 align:middle line:10%
He's featured in the
2010 documentary,

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.000 align:middle line:10%
"2012, Time for Change."

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.240 align:middle line:10%
And he's one of the most
incredible human minds

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.080 align:middle line:10%
I've ever talked to.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.700 align:middle line:84%
Daniel, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.379 align:middle line:84%
>>DANIEL PINCHBECK: Yeah, thank
you for those nice accolades.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:06.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How've you been?

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.440 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: I've been
good-- good, yeah.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Boy, this planet
continues to change and evolve,

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:10.740 align:middle line:90%
doesn't it?

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.210 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: It seems
like it's doing something.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.660 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You have looked at what
we call ecological emergencies

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.460 align:middle line:10%
on this planet.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.880 align:middle line:10%
What do you mean by that?

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:20.680 align:middle line:10%
>>PINCHBECK: Yeah.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.970 align:middle line:10%
Well, I mean, it's
not just me obviously.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.150 align:middle line:10%
The UN just issued
a report recently

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.240 align:middle line:10%
saying that we had
about 10 to 12 years

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.780 align:middle line:10%
to make a major shift
in the amount of CO2

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.495 align:middle line:10%
that we're producing
if we are going

00:01:34.495 --> 00:01:38.650 align:middle line:10%
to avoid catastrophic
warming and temperature rise.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.110 align:middle line:84%
And many scientists
already believe

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.640 align:middle line:84%
that it's too late to prevent
really catastrophic effects.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we in an earth
cycle, or is this all man-made?

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.248 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: Well, yeah, I
think that's a good question.

00:01:53.248 --> 00:01:54.790 align:middle line:84%
Maybe some of both,
but we definitely

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.380 align:middle line:84%
can attribute it
to human causes.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.560 align:middle line:84%
I know there are
some commentators who

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.880 align:middle line:90%
still argue against that.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.430 align:middle line:84%
But you know, we put
a million tons of CO2

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.080 align:middle line:90%
into the atmosphere every hour.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.960 align:middle line:84%
We can measure the amount
of CO2 in the atmosphere.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.283 align:middle line:84%
We know the impact
that we're having.

00:02:11.283 --> 00:02:13.200 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of what we're
doing is pretty clear--

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.903 align:middle line:90%
I mean, also deforestation.

00:02:14.903 --> 00:02:17.070 align:middle line:84%
And then we're seeing forest
fires around the world.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.780 align:middle line:84%
So even now, I think we're 1.2
Celsius warmer, or something

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.910 align:middle line:84%
like that, than we were
in pre-industrial times.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:22.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, that's a lot too.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:23.960 align:middle line:90%
That's a big increase.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.400 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: Yes, but if
we go to 2, 3 degrees,

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.550 align:middle line:90%
it truly could be catastrophic.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.540 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we're learning how meshed
together the fabric of life

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.030 align:middle line:84%
is on the planet
as, unfortunately,

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.042 align:middle line:84%
our industrial civilization is
kind of tearing it to shreds.

00:02:40.042 --> 00:02:41.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know,
mankind has been

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.200 align:middle line:84%
pumping all kinds of
things into the atmosphere

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.720 align:middle line:90%
since the Industrial Revolution.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.020 align:middle line:84%
In the earlier days, during
the dinosaur era and stuff,

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.490 align:middle line:90%
we had a lot of CO2 too.

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.330 align:middle line:10%
So those people who are against
man-made ecological change

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.560 align:middle line:10%
will use those reasons to cite.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.370 align:middle line:90%
How do we argue with that?

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.170 align:middle line:90%
>>PINCHBECK: What?

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.070 align:middle line:84%
You mean there was more
CO2 in other epochs?

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm-hmm.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.700 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: Well, yeah,
but the whole climate

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.640 align:middle line:90%
was totally different.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.473 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've been in
the sort of Goldilocks

00:03:09.473 --> 00:03:12.250 align:middle line:84%
period where we've been
very lucky that we've

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.620 align:middle line:84%
had a few 100,000 years
with a climate that

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.770 align:middle line:84%
has been very temperate and has
allowed for human civilization

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.290 align:middle line:90%
to evolve in this way.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And now we've thrown things
radically out of balance.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And what I argue in
"How Soon Is Now?"

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.980 align:middle line:84%
is that unless we
really undertook this

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.610 align:middle line:84%
as a collective project
for the future of humanity

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.440 align:middle line:84%
and the sake of
the planet, we're

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.060 align:middle line:84%
probably going to go into
extinction in the next century

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.860 align:middle line:90%
or so.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:36.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.360 align:middle line:90%
>>PINCHBECK: Yeah.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
say extinction,

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.890 align:middle line:84%
you're saying that's
it for all of us.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.930 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: Well, I mean
the problem is that--

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.800 align:middle line:84%
so for instance,
oxygen. Like, the Amazon

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.480 align:middle line:84%
produces 20% of our oxygen.
The plankton in the ocean--

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For the whole planet?

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:52.530 align:middle line:90%
>>PINCHBECK: Yeah.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.310 align:middle line:84%
The plankton in
the ocean produced

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.800 align:middle line:84%
60% of the oxygen
we breathe roughly.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.150 align:middle line:84%
So you know, if we go to 2
to 3 degrees Celsius warmer,

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.910 align:middle line:84%
we lose about 40% of the
Amazon just from the heat.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're already
deforesting the Amazon.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.920 align:middle line:84%
We're losing seven football
fields of jungle per minute,

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.020 align:middle line:84%
according to some
estimates, every day.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.720 align:middle line:84%
So we'd lose at least
10% of our oxygen

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.160 align:middle line:90%
from what happens to the Amazon.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.399 align:middle line:84%
Plus the plankton in the
ocean, their life cycle

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:20.980 align:middle line:84%
is also being negatively
impacted by the amount of CO2

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.520 align:middle line:90%
that the oceans are taking in.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.380 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, we could really
sort of asphyxiate ourselves.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And we know there's
been massive species

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.040 align:middle line:90%
extinctions in the past.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.810 align:middle line:84%
It's just unfortunate because
if we were to collectively shift

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.990 align:middle line:84%
this direction-- basically
what I argue in the book,

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.380 align:middle line:84%
and which many non-profit
movements are now saying,

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.930 align:middle line:84%
is that we need a
climate mobilization.

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.840 align:middle line:84%
We need to look at what
the US did in World War II

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.600 align:middle line:84%
after Pearl Harbor
bombing, when they shifted

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.790 align:middle line:84%
all of the industrial
manufacturing

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.760 align:middle line:84%
from everything else they were
doing-- toys, personal cars,

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.830 align:middle line:84%
or whatever-- it all
went into the war effort.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:57.747 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:04:57.747 --> 00:04:59.930 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: So this
would be the opposite.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.990 align:middle line:84%
It would have to be almost
a global effort where

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.500 align:middle line:84%
we would say, OK,
we're all going

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.610 align:middle line:84%
to sink together
unless we massively

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.760 align:middle line:84%
redirect our social
powers, our creativity,

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.140 align:middle line:84%
our technical capacities,
our resources to making

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.990 align:middle line:90%
a regenerative system.

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.740 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Do you think
the planet can react

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.095 align:middle line:10%
quickly once that happens?

00:05:20.095 --> 00:05:21.970 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: Well, I
mean, some of the damage

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.178 align:middle line:90%
is already locked into place.

00:05:23.178 --> 00:05:25.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we're going
to be able to prevent

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.330 align:middle line:84%
the loss of a lot
of the coastal land

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.400 align:middle line:84%
from flooding and so on
over 50 years or something.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.620 align:middle line:90%
But we don't know.

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.990 align:middle line:84%
We are a very, very
creative species.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.180 align:middle line:90%
And we just have to--

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.590 align:middle line:84%
you know, the smartphone
was impossible 30 years ago,

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.140 align:middle line:90%
and then they figured it out.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.080 align:middle line:84%
On the negative side, the atom
bomb required this huge coming

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.880 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.297 align:middle line:84%
But essentially,
at the moment, we

00:05:48.297 --> 00:05:52.290 align:middle line:84%
have a political and
corporate structure

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:56.580 align:middle line:84%
that is obstructing our capacity
to focus our energy where

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:57.870 align:middle line:90%
it needs to focus.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.362 align:middle line:84%
And we're in kind of
like a trance of denial

00:06:00.362 --> 00:06:01.320 align:middle line:90%
about what's happening.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your book,
"How Soon is Now?"

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.335 align:middle line:84%
you take a look at
this ecological crisis.

>>PINCHBECK: My name
is Daniel Pinchbeck.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.100 align:middle line:90%
I was born in New York City.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.715 align:middle line:10%
I'm a writer and a thinker
and sometimes an entrepreneur.

"How Soon is Now" looks
at the ecological crisis

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:30.540 align:middle line:10%
as a kind of rite of
passage or initiation

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:34.710 align:middle line:10%
for the human species to reach
another level of consciousness

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:35.985 align:middle line:10%
and another level of society.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.040 align:middle line:84%
One of the main things that
compelled me to write this book

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.085 align:middle line:84%
is a study of the evidence
around the ecological crisis.

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:56.980 align:middle line:10%
elected a president
who denies that we

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:00.480 align:middle line:10%
are in a crisis of ecology
and climate and so on.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.100 align:middle line:84%
But the evidence from a vast
preponderance of scientists

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.730 align:middle line:84%
is that we have passed a lot of
critical thresholds and tipping

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:06.530 align:middle line:90%
points.

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:11.800 align:middle line:90%


00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.390 align:middle line:84%
We're also losing 10% of the
Earth's remaining biodiversity

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:17.406 align:middle line:90%
every 10 to 15 years.

00:07:17.406 --> 00:07:21.760 align:middle line:84%
We're losing 100 to 150 species
a day out of little more than 8

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.120 align:middle line:90%
million total species.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.570 align:middle line:84%
And we now know how tightly
meshed together the web of life

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:29.800 align:middle line:90%
is on the planet.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.440 align:middle line:10%
So as we pull it
apart, eventually it's

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.770 align:middle line:10%
going to break down, and
we'll enter a different cycle

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:37.780 align:middle line:10%
where the Earth just
won't be very hospitable

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.660 align:middle line:10%
and won't support large
mammals such as ourselves.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.910 align:middle line:90%


00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:48.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And regardless, Daniel,
of how we got there, I think

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.545 align:middle line:84%
there's no argument
that it's happening.

00:07:50.545 --> 00:07:51.420 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's obvious.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.370 align:middle line:90%
The data is the data.

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:57.990 align:middle line:10%
Why can't we come together
as a world and say,

00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:59.340 align:middle line:10%
we have a problem--

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:00.510 align:middle line:10%
we all admit it--

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:02.970 align:middle line:10%
how we got to it,
that's debatable.

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:03.840 align:middle line:90%
But let's fix--

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:04.410 align:middle line:90%
>>PINCHBECK: It's not debatable.

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:05.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --but let's
fix the problem.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:06.460 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: It's actually
not very debatable.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:07.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, I know.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:07.770 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: It's
very straightforward.

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:09.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But there is that camp
that will always fight that.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.520 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: Yeah, but that
camp happens to be not dealing

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.395 align:middle line:90%
with actual evidence.

00:08:12.395 --> 00:08:14.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But why does that
camp say and admit there

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:15.610 align:middle line:90%
is a problem.

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:17.010 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: The
reason is basically

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:19.350 align:middle line:84%
we have an operating system
for our global civilization

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:22.200 align:middle line:84%
that's based on
corporations that

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.090 align:middle line:84%
make money based on
quarterly earnings

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:25.710 align:middle line:90%
and short-term profits.

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:29.280 align:middle line:84%
And so if the function
of those corporations--

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.280 align:middle line:84%
in a way they're like robots
or like artificial lifeforms.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:36.780 align:middle line:84%
They have to keep forcing
increased profits.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:43.710 align:middle line:84%
And the way to do that requires
getting more consumer goods,

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:47.100 align:middle line:84%
extracting more natural
resources, and so on.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.010 align:middle line:84%
So we have an extractive and
exploitative economic model.

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's not going to
give us the opportunity

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.130 align:middle line:84%
to address the crisis we're
facing at the base level

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.110 align:middle line:90%
that we have to address it at.

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:01.333 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Are we learning
anything from this disaster?

00:09:01.333 --> 00:09:03.750 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: Well, I mean,
there's a lot of amazing things

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:04.890 align:middle line:90%
happening--

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:07.350 align:middle line:84%
incredible developments
and technologies, solar.

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:08.150 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we know--

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:09.483 align:middle line:90%
as I write in "How Soon is Now?"

00:09:09.483 --> 00:09:11.120 align:middle line:90%
I look in every area.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.597 align:middle line:84%
We know all of
the things that we

00:09:12.597 --> 00:09:14.430 align:middle line:84%
would have to do to
actually deal with this.

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:17.850 align:middle line:84%
Like, we have to shift
from industrial farming

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:21.360 align:middle line:84%
back to no-till
agriculture, permaculture.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.270 align:middle line:84%
They are much more
labor intensive.

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:28.470 align:middle line:84%
We have to shift to
renewable energy obviously,

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:31.080 align:middle line:90%
cradle to cradle manufacturing--

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in every area we know
what we would need to do.

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:36.000 align:middle line:84%
It's just that we
haven't summoned up

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.775 align:middle line:84%
the collective will, and there's
a kind of blockage in people.

00:09:39.775 --> 00:09:41.400 align:middle line:10%
You know, you're just
mentioning you're

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.570 align:middle line:10%
having a great granddaughter.

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:42.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.820 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: Well, sadly,
unless we address this,

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.278 align:middle line:84%
she's not really going to have
a world that's going to be--

00:09:47.278 --> 00:09:49.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, what
do we give them?

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:50.592 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: So that
that's what I've

00:09:50.592 --> 00:09:53.820 align:middle line:84%
been trying to do in my
work over the last 10 years.

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:55.910 align:middle line:84%
I'd written a
bestselling book, "2012."

00:09:55.910 --> 00:10:00.240 align:middle line:84%
I could have become a kind
of different type of Tony

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.740 align:middle line:84%
Robbins-ish figure,
talking about how everybody

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.150 align:middle line:84%
can have maximum
success and live

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:08.590 align:middle line:90%
the secret and all that stuff.

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:11.490 align:middle line:84%
But actually, I became much
more concerned with the fact

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:13.860 align:middle line:84%
that our hyper-individual
culture based

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.200 align:middle line:84%
on this destructive
economic system

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.550 align:middle line:84%
was really killing the
planet for our descendants,

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:21.270 align:middle line:84%
and I still really
can't fathom why

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:22.800 align:middle line:84%
everybody's attention
hasn't shifted

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.160 align:middle line:90%
in that direction at this point.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.410 align:middle line:90%
But I understand it also.

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:27.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it fixable?

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:29.460 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: It's
not really fixable,

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:32.530 align:middle line:84%
but it's certainly something
that we need to address.

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:35.370 align:middle line:84%
In the book "2012, The
Return of Quetzalcoatl,"

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:38.040 align:middle line:84%
I also looked at it from
the more metaphysical side

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.220 align:middle line:84%
of the street, like looking
at the indigenous prophecies

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.140 align:middle line:84%
of cultures like the
Hopi and the Maya.

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:44.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, what
did they teach us?

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:44.760 align:middle line:90%
>>PINCHBECK: What's that?

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did they teach
us, these indigenous people?

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:49.110 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: Well, they
talked about transition.

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:51.672 align:middle line:84%
Like, the Maya talked
about the fourth world--

00:10:51.672 --> 00:10:53.630 align:middle line:84%
the Hopi talked about
the fourth world entering

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:54.940 align:middle line:90%
into the fifth world.

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:57.630 align:middle line:84%
The Nahuatl, the Aztecs, talked
about the age of the fifth sun

00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:59.120 align:middle line:90%
and the age of the sixth sun.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.140 align:middle line:84%
So they understood
that we were going

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:03.450 align:middle line:84%
to go through this intense
transformational process.

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:07.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, according to some
of the Aztec prophecies,

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:11.730 align:middle line:84%
we're shifting from a sun of
light to a sun of darkness.

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And in their understanding
of the cyclical movements

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:17.370 align:middle line:84%
of energies and so
on, the sun of light

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:21.540 align:middle line:84%
is more of a time where
waking consciousness,

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.910 align:middle line:84%
rationality, interest
in the material world,

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:27.270 align:middle line:84%
those become
mankind's fixations.

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:30.442 align:middle line:84%
And during the time when it's
back into a sun of darkness,

00:11:30.442 --> 00:11:32.400 align:middle line:84%
it's more about the
dreamworld and the psychic,

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.590 align:middle line:84%
and we realize that
reality becomes

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:36.120 align:middle line:84%
more like a waking
dream, where it's

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:40.260 align:middle line:84%
more permeable to our intentions
and our thoughts and so on.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.900 align:middle line:84%
So I feel many
people are grasping

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.060 align:middle line:84%
this, more and more
people in Western society.

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:48.000 align:middle line:84%
They use concepts like
synchronicity or manifestation.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.580 align:middle line:84%
So that is one element
of what's happening,

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.240 align:middle line:90%
and that is fascinating to me.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:56.190 align:middle line:84%
But the other element is that
we have to address this system

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:57.643 align:middle line:90%
crash that we've created.

00:11:57.643 --> 00:11:59.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your book
"How Soon is Now?"

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:01.480 align:middle line:10%
you kind of tie in
human consciousness

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.280 align:middle line:10%
with some of this.

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.390 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:07.320 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: In the book, I
talk about visiting a community

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.570 align:middle line:84%
in Colombia,
indigenous community.

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:11.910 align:middle line:84%
We worked with the Kogi
and the Arawak people, who

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:14.160 align:middle line:84%
live high up in the
mountains of Colombia,

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.620 align:middle line:90%
and they come down to meet us.

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.845 align:middle line:84%
They walk, like, 25 hours
down from the mountain top.

00:12:19.845 --> 00:12:20.645 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 25 hours?

00:12:20.645 --> 00:12:21.645 align:middle line:90%
>>PINCHBECK: Yeah, yeah.

00:12:21.645 --> 00:12:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And they basically were
trying to convey to us

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.873 align:middle line:90%
that from their perspective--

00:12:25.873 --> 00:12:28.290 align:middle line:84%
there's actually a really good
film about them called "The

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:29.832 align:middle line:84%
Elder Brothers'
Warning to Humanity."

00:12:29.832 --> 00:12:30.720 align:middle line:90%
It's worth seeing.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.360 align:middle line:84%
They see themselves as an elder
civilization, like pre-Incan,

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.540 align:middle line:84%
and they see our civilization
as like a younger one, immature.

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:39.000 align:middle line:84%
But they said that,
from their perspective,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.230 align:middle line:84%
what we experience as reality
is a direct reflection

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:47.720 align:middle line:84%
of our level of spirituality
and consciousness development.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.340 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
very fascinating.

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:52.970 align:middle line:84%
And when you see them,
really the elders

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:57.260 align:middle line:84%
in that tribe, every movement
they make is very graceful.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.740 align:middle line:84%
You feel like they're
always in sacred time.

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:04.020 align:middle line:84%
Whereas we've created this whole
idea of profane time and work

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:04.820 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:08.210 align:middle line:84%
And we're very rarely
in sacred time.

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:10.632 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Are they aware
of what we're doing

00:13:10.632 --> 00:13:11.465 align:middle line:10%
to the environment--

00:13:11.465 --> 00:13:11.810 align:middle line:10%
>>PINCHBECK: Yeah.

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:13.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --these
indigenous people?

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:14.390 align:middle line:90%
How do they sense that?

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:15.770 align:middle line:90%
How do they know it's us?

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:17.853 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: Well, the
indigenous people have been

00:13:17.853 --> 00:13:19.248 align:middle line:90%
aware, all around the planet--

00:13:19.248 --> 00:13:21.290 align:middle line:84%
well, first of all, I
mean, we've colonized them.

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:22.220 align:middle line:90%
We've exploited them.

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.020 align:middle line:84%
We've driven them
out of their lands.

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:26.780 align:middle line:84%
So they understand that we are
a culture that's based on--

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:27.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Taking.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.617 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: --what
the Algonquins

00:13:28.617 --> 00:13:32.660 align:middle line:84%
call "wetiko," which is kind
of like a vampiric, parasitic

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:38.440 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, or spirit, that
seeks to exploit and devour.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And, yeah, the indigenous
cultures all around the world

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:43.730 align:middle line:84%
have been the first
line of defense

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:47.800 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the planet's
ecological resources--

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.390 align:middle line:84%
the Ogoni people in Nigeria
who were assassinated

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:53.660 align:middle line:84%
by the oil companies
and so on, in Ecuador,

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:57.870 align:middle line:84%
the local tribes who were
poisoned by Texaco and so on.

00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:58.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sheesh.

00:13:58.670 --> 00:13:59.600 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: Well,
but that's how

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.892 align:middle line:90%
we keep our thing going, right?

00:14:00.892 --> 00:14:02.540 align:middle line:90%
Like, you flew here today.

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:05.050 align:middle line:90%
I flew here last night.

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:07.610 align:middle line:84%
We're part of this
whole machinery

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:09.748 align:middle line:84%
of extraction and
exploitation, unfortunately.

00:14:09.748 --> 00:14:11.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: "How Soon is
Now?" your book, of course,

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:15.907 align:middle line:84%
looks at a range of solutions
to the ecological emergency.

00:14:15.907 --> 00:14:17.240 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at this topic.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:22.050 align:middle line:90%


00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:23.058 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:23.058 --> 00:14:25.350 align:middle line:10%
>>PINCHBECK: What I seek to
offer in "How Soon is Now?"

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:31.440 align:middle line:84%
is a blueprint for how this
transformation could happen.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:35.070 align:middle line:84%
How social systems
are constructed

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:40.420 align:middle line:84%
has a lot to do with what
type of media is available.

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:43.270 align:middle line:84%
The internet is now a new type
of media and a new phenomenon

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:44.740 align:middle line:90%
to reorganize our society.

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:50.080 align:middle line:90%


00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:53.630 align:middle line:84%
Democratic decision making
could be continuous.

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:57.010 align:middle line:84%
We could all be part of some
social infrastructure, where

00:14:57.010 --> 00:15:00.600 align:middle line:84%
we make decisions
together all the time,

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:04.520 align:middle line:84%
it's possible that capitalism is
actually a transitional system.

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Capitalism has brought
the world together

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.080 align:middle line:90%
into one global market.

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.930 align:middle line:84%
It's unified humanity
in a certain sense.

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:14.480 align:middle line:84%
Everyone can communicate with
each other instantaneously.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:19.250 align:middle line:84%
But capitalism is inherently
unstable and also unsustainable

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:21.680 align:middle line:84%
because it constantly
forces more growth and more

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.720 align:middle line:90%
development.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.540 align:middle line:84%
Now we've reached the limit
on the finite resources

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:28.590 align:middle line:90%
of the planet.

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:30.880 align:middle line:84%
We can't develop
like that anymore.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:34.267 align:middle line:84%
So we need to think about a new
model of what development is

00:15:34.267 --> 00:15:35.850 align:middle line:84%
and that form of
development would not

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:41.030 align:middle line:84%
be more buildings, bigger
skyscrapers, more mining.

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:43.920 align:middle line:84%
It would be creating a
society that really worked

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:46.110 align:middle line:84%
for the individual
and provided them

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:49.400 align:middle line:84%
with a much deeper
level of satisfaction,

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:54.651 align:middle line:84%
cultural pursuits, maybe
explorations of eroticism even.

00:15:54.651 --> 00:15:57.300 align:middle line:90%


00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think the things that
truly make people happy

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:03.890 align:middle line:84%
are love, community, and the
ability to give their gifts

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:06.355 align:middle line:84%
and feel that they have purpose
and meaning in their lives.

00:16:06.355 --> 00:16:09.310 align:middle line:90%


00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:12.000 align:middle line:84%
There's nature, and then
there's human constructs.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.520 align:middle line:10%
And those human
constructs, we actually

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:20.190 align:middle line:10%
have the ability to
redesign, rewrite, revise.

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:23.550 align:middle line:84%
We just forget that
we have that power.

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:25.170 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
crucial things is

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:29.330 align:middle line:84%
going to be kind of
reinventing community, creating

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:31.910 align:middle line:84%
local communities
or joining community

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:35.420 align:middle line:84%
groups as a way of breaking
through the separation

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:39.285 align:middle line:84%
and the alienation that our
capitalist culture has created.

scene where you had

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:56.020 align:middle line:10%
some young people all sitting
around together in a circle,

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:59.915 align:middle line:10%
will our youth carry the torch
and help fix this problem?

00:16:59.915 --> 00:17:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: Well, that's
definitely happening right now.

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:03.565 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure you've heard
about Greta Thunberg?

00:17:03.565 --> 00:17:04.839 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm-hmm.

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:07.329 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: So she's a
16-year-old Swedish high school

00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:10.690 align:middle line:84%
student who, I think she has
a little bit of Asperger's

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:12.609 align:middle line:84%
syndrome, and I believe
one of her ancestors

00:17:12.609 --> 00:17:15.609 align:middle line:84%
actually was the one who
discovered the greenhouse

00:17:15.609 --> 00:17:17.619 align:middle line:90%
syndrome, greenhouse gases.

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:19.849 align:middle line:84%
And she started this
movement that now you

00:17:19.849 --> 00:17:21.760 align:middle line:84%
have probably
hundreds of thousands

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:28.420 align:middle line:84%
of kids who are beginning
to move into direct action,

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:30.867 align:middle line:84%
recognizing that their
future is in jeopardy,

00:17:30.867 --> 00:17:32.950 align:middle line:84%
and that the, quote,
unquote, "adults in the room"

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:36.040 align:middle line:84%
are not capable of doing
what needs to be done.

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.580 align:middle line:90%
They've been stepping forward.

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:40.240 align:middle line:84%
I think that's something
that's going to become more

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.980 align:middle line:90%
powerful in the next few years.

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:44.110 align:middle line:84%
There's no place else
for us to go right now.

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, kids
are more aware

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:47.920 align:middle line:84%
because it's their
future extends further

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:49.690 align:middle line:84%
into this disaster
that we've created.

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:52.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or do they
fall into this trap

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:55.687 align:middle line:84%
where they become more
corporatized and they change?

00:17:55.687 --> 00:17:57.520 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: I think
it's too late for that.

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:00.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, honestly, we're in
an existential risk situation

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.140 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:03.613 align:middle line:84%
There's this
interesting movement

00:18:03.613 --> 00:18:05.030 align:middle line:84%
called Extinction
Rebellion, which

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:06.880 align:middle line:84%
was started in the
UK, which they just

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:09.462 align:middle line:84%
had 1,000 people arrested
recently in London.

00:18:09.462 --> 00:18:11.170 align:middle line:84%
You know, people are
beginning to wake up

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:15.910 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that this is not
business as usual anymore.

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:17.370 align:middle line:90%
This is existential.

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:19.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, until we
can move off the planet,

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:21.880 align:middle line:84%
this is it for us right now,
and we got to make it work.

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.547 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: Yeah,
moving off the planet

00:18:23.547 --> 00:18:26.532 align:middle line:84%
is an extravagantly
difficult endeavor.

00:18:26.532 --> 00:18:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And I think that if we
can't make it work here,

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:31.450 align:middle line:84%
where all of the conditions for
life are remarkably perfect,

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:32.950 align:middle line:90%
it's like--

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:35.680 align:middle line:84%
Buckminster Fuller talked
about this as Spaceship Earth.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.520 align:middle line:84%
It's like we're
actually on a spaceship.

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:38.320 align:middle line:90%
We've woken up.

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:39.737 align:middle line:84%
We're the crew of
this spaceship.

00:18:39.737 --> 00:18:41.320 align:middle line:84%
Everything we need
is provided for us,

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.690 align:middle line:84%
except we don't have
an instruction manual.

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:46.930 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we're
trying to figure out.

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:48.430 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, if we can't
make it work here,

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:49.730 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to make
it work anywhere else.

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:51.310 align:middle line:84%
I think space is just a
fantasy at this point.

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:53.143 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: When I think
of Buckminster Fuller,

00:18:53.143 --> 00:18:55.630 align:middle line:10%
I think of the geodesic
dome that he created.

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:58.450 align:middle line:10%
But he was much more elaborate
than just that, wasn't he?

00:18:58.450 --> 00:18:59.290 align:middle line:10%
>>PINCHBECK: Yeah.

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:02.080 align:middle line:10%
He basically looked at
how nature builds things.

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And he and he realized
that nature basically

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:06.220 align:middle line:90%
never uses right angles.

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And so humans are always seeking
to kind of like dominate,

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:13.570 align:middle line:84%
control nature, put on these
right angles and so on.

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And so he wanted to create
a whole system of design

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:17.680 align:middle line:84%
that was more in accord
with nature's principles.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.360 align:middle line:84%
That's the geodesic dome,
and a lot of his other work

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.380 align:middle line:90%
came out of that.

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whole
legacy of his work.

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:24.018 align:middle line:84%
There's the Buckminster
Fuller Institute.

00:19:24.018 --> 00:19:26.110 align:middle line:84%
There's thousands of
ecological designers

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:28.630 align:middle line:84%
around the world who are
creating new ideas based

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:29.770 align:middle line:90%
on his principles.

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:31.228 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What would
you do, Daniel,

00:19:31.228 --> 00:19:33.010 align:middle line:10%
to start making
this change where

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:37.037 align:middle line:10%
you would feel comfortable
that something's working here?

00:19:37.037 --> 00:19:38.620 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: You
know, the easiest way

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:41.590 align:middle line:84%
would be for a major social
network like Facebook or Google

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:44.230 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that this is
the situation that we're

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:47.082 align:middle line:84%
in because Facebook can reach
2 billion people in a minute.

00:19:47.082 --> 00:19:48.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And instantly.

could simply on their home page

00:19:50.498 --> 00:19:52.510 align:middle line:84%
say, dear human
family, we recognize

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:55.245 align:middle line:84%
that we've entered an
ecological emergency together,

00:19:55.245 --> 00:19:57.370 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to have to
make significant changes

00:19:57.370 --> 00:19:58.578 align:middle line:90%
in the way we live our lives.

00:19:58.578 --> 00:20:01.780 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be including
growing food locally, learning

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:05.380 align:middle line:84%
bioremediation, learning
permaculture, not doing

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:07.750 align:middle line:84%
things that are destructive
for the environment,

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:10.330 align:middle line:84%
redesigning our
manufacturing systems,

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:13.600 align:middle line:84%
training people to
install renewable energy.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to put
all the tools for all

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:17.862 align:middle line:90%
of that available online.

00:20:17.862 --> 00:20:19.570 align:middle line:84%
Everyone will access
this, and we'll also

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:23.650 align:middle line:84%
create a decision-making
system using the internet

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:26.117 align:middle line:84%
that everybody can help
make local decisions,

00:20:26.117 --> 00:20:28.450 align:middle line:84%
regional decisions, and even
planetary decisions better.

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:31.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you would use
new technology, social media,

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.270 align:middle line:84%
as a platform to help
get this word out?

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>>PINCHBECK: Yes.

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:38.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think that's our
best option because in a sense,

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:41.800 align:middle line:84%
the internet points towards
the capacity for us to--

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:43.750 align:middle line:84%
a tool like Facebook
is so incredible.

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:46.070 align:middle line:84%
It points towards how
we can all be connected.

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:47.800 align:middle line:90%
We can all find each other now.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.620 align:middle line:84%
But it restricts our
capacity to use it

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:53.980 align:middle line:84%
for regenerative social purposes
unfortunately because they're

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:56.878 align:middle line:84%
trapped in a limited
profit-making model.

00:20:56.878 --> 00:20:59.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have looked at
blockchain, where of course

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:00.940 align:middle line:90%
Bitcoin comes from.

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:02.860 align:middle line:84%
You think that has
some effect on what

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:04.925 align:middle line:90%
we can do in the future?

00:21:04.925 --> 00:21:07.810 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK:
Blockchain is complex.

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:10.510 align:middle line:84%
You know, Bitcoin
has pros and cons.

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:11.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right, it's scary.

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:12.280 align:middle line:90%
>>PINCHBECK: What's that?

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:13.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's scary
as an investment.

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:15.040 align:middle line:84%
You don't know what's
going to happen.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.470 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: Yeah,
it's kind of--

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:21.870 align:middle line:84%
the whole thing is very
interesting, very speculative.

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:23.620 align:middle line:84%
Some of it will become
just infrastructure

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:28.240 align:middle line:84%
because it's a way
for supply chains

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.670 align:middle line:84%
to track all their
dealings and so on.

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:32.290 align:middle line:84%
Or for philanthropy,
it's interesting.

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:35.560 align:middle line:84%
There's a tool called Giveth.io,
where if you put money in,

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:38.230 align:middle line:84%
you can track it all the
way down to like, oh, look,

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:42.160 align:middle line:84%
I bought this pencil for this
African refugee or something.

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:45.790 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's some really
interesting uses for it.

00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's good that some
of the hype has dissolved.

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:50.130 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What's
fascinating about it

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:54.960 align:middle line:10%
is it's been created not by
institutions, but by people,

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.970 align:middle line:10%
and people are
driving it right now.

00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:58.320 align:middle line:90%
>>PINCHBECK: That's true.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:01.260 align:middle line:84%
And also, you know, for
democratic decision making,

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:04.500 align:middle line:84%
there's one group, a great one,
called Democracy Not Earth.

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is to
really create tools

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.420 align:middle line:84%
that would allow people to
make ongoing decisions together

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:10.500 align:middle line:90%
in a new way.

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:13.600 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Tell me about
the Tamera in Portugal.

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.480 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: Yeah,
so Tamera in Portugal

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:19.730 align:middle line:84%
is a community that I've visited
a few times that basically it's

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:21.480 align:middle line:90%
started by German radicals.

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:25.730 align:middle line:10%
They were trying to figure out
why the great utopian movements

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:27.690 align:middle line:10%
of the '60s didn't succeed--

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:31.130 align:middle line:10%
like the green movement and
so on and the left and so on--

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:33.630 align:middle line:10%
and so they began to realize
that underlying everything were

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:36.690 align:middle line:10%
core issues of
love and sexuality

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:40.680 align:middle line:10%
that led to communities to
collapse, the jealousies

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:41.600 align:middle line:10%
to envies.

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:45.408 align:middle line:84%
So they call themselves
a Peace Research Center.

00:22:45.408 --> 00:22:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
what they're about.

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:49.440 align:middle line:84%
But they say that we're never
going to have peace on Earth

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:53.220 align:middle line:84%
until we have peace between
the genders and peace and love.

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And for them, that
involves developing

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:59.400 align:middle line:84%
a whole new social model for
how relationships are organized.

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.150 align:middle line:84%
That includes, like,
most people there are

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:03.940 align:middle line:90%
in multi-partner relationships.

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:07.020 align:middle line:84%
Everything that people
do in the private realm

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:09.420 align:middle line:84%
is actually expressed in the
public sphere and community

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:11.040 align:middle line:90%
forums, community gatherings.

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.325 align:middle line:90%
It's a very interesting--

00:23:12.325 --> 00:23:13.950 align:middle line:84%
it's like you definitely
feel that it's

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:15.992 align:middle line:84%
a different world when
you go there, that they've

00:23:15.992 --> 00:23:18.600 align:middle line:90%
created their own new culture.

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And they do peace marches
in Guatemala, peace work

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.670 align:middle line:84%
in Israel and
Palestine and so on.

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:25.750 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, I'm
fascinated by them.

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:26.970 align:middle line:90%
And I'm fascinated by it.

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:30.450 align:middle line:84%
As I said, it's like I
feel that it's not just

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:31.940 align:middle line:90%
reforming the current system.

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:35.380 align:middle line:84%
There's a deeper level system
change that needs to happen,

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:36.960 align:middle line:84%
and so we need
templates for that,

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:42.300 align:middle line:84%
both on how organizations
can work collaboratively

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:47.580 align:middle line:84%
and how communities maybe can
deal with sexuality and love

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:49.950 align:middle line:84%
in different ways
because obviously we're

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:52.482 align:middle line:84%
seeing a lot of chaos
around that right now.

00:23:52.482 --> 00:23:54.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As you mentioned,
during the 60s, of course,

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:57.000 align:middle line:84%
was love and peace
and everything else.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.543 align:middle line:90%
That fizzled, didn't it?

00:23:59.543 --> 00:24:00.960 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: Well,
love and peace,

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:04.020 align:middle line:84%
it turns out, require
an infrastructure.

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:07.060 align:middle line:84%
You need a structure that
allows that to succeed.

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:08.820 align:middle line:84%
You can't just
impose love and peace

00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:12.570 align:middle line:84%
on a military
domination-based empire

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:15.900 align:middle line:84%
that's based on extraction
and exploitation of resources.

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:16.950 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:17.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:20.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we saw what
happened at Tiananmen Square

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.260 align:middle line:90%
with love and peace.

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:25.590 align:middle line:90%
It just doesn't work sometimes.

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:28.350 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: My hope would be
that if you could demonstrate

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:34.350 align:middle line:84%
models for the future that
really made people happier,

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:36.480 align:middle line:84%
then you could get
everybody onboard.

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:38.190 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Tell me about
your book, "2012,

00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:40.470 align:middle line:10%
The Return of Quetzalcoatl."

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:42.330 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: So
that book was really

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:47.595 align:middle line:84%
an effort to understand
the indigenous cultures

00:24:47.595 --> 00:24:49.470 align:middle line:84%
all around the world
who see this time as one

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:52.080 align:middle line:90%
of intense transformation.

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking at
the Mayan calendar,

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:58.590 align:middle line:84%
which the Long Count of the
Tzolkin, a 5,100-year cycle,

00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:00.240 align:middle line:90%
ended in 2012.

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.647 align:middle line:90%
We're in the next cycle.

00:25:01.647 --> 00:25:02.730 align:middle line:90%
I was looking at the Hopi.

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:04.260 align:middle line:90%
I visited them in Arizona.

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:06.780 align:middle line:84%
I was looking at
other phenomenon that

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:09.870 align:middle line:84%
seemed to relate, like the crop
circles in England, which often

00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:14.460 align:middle line:84%
had information related
to the Mayan calendar

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:16.500 align:middle line:90%
and so on embedded in them.

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And, yeah, I do think that
we're in the process of going

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:25.677 align:middle line:84%
through this intense
transformation as a species.

00:25:25.677 --> 00:25:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And all these different
factors are at play.

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:32.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the development
of esoteric knowledge

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:36.363 align:middle line:84%
and how everyone now does yoga,
knows about Kabbalah and Sufism

00:25:36.363 --> 00:25:38.280 align:middle line:84%
and so on, and that's
moving around the world.

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:42.960 align:middle line:84%
The rapid accelerated evolution
of technologies that we now

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.340 align:middle line:90%
can communicate with everybody.

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:49.590 align:middle line:84%
And we can potentially scale
up renewable energy systems

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:53.310 align:middle line:84%
or whatever we need to do
to help save the planet--

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:56.070 align:middle line:84%
distributed manufacturing,
automation so that we can

00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:58.255 align:middle line:90%
liberate people from drudgery.

00:25:58.255 --> 00:25:59.130 align:middle line:90%
That's the sad thing.

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:01.860 align:middle line:84%
It's like if we were to
make this systemic change

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:03.930 align:middle line:84%
and create this new
operating system now,

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:05.760 align:middle line:84%
we could actually look
forward to a future

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:09.150 align:middle line:84%
that really liberates
humanity from a lot of misery,

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:12.060 align:middle line:84%
where people are really free
to cultivate themselves,

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:14.100 align:middle line:84%
to explore their
unique individuality,

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:15.720 align:middle line:90%
express themselves.

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:18.943 align:middle line:84%
It's just we're in this
bifurcation moment right now.

00:26:18.943 --> 00:26:20.610 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, yeah, so
"2012" looked at it

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:22.590 align:middle line:84%
at more of a
metaphysical level--

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:26.850 align:middle line:84%
like, what does this shift mean
in terms of psychic realities,

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:29.033 align:middle line:90%
consciousness, philosophy?

00:26:29.033 --> 00:26:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And "How Soon is Now?" is
more on a pragmatic level.

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:34.950 align:middle line:84%
How would we bring about this
change on a systems level?

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:37.500 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Daniel, ironically,
we're in the Gaia studios.

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.840 align:middle line:10%
And Gaia, of course,
meaning that this planet is

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:43.090 align:middle line:10%
a living organism-- it's alive.

00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:45.900 align:middle line:10%
Do you think that's true,
that this planet truly

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.938 align:middle line:10%
is alive like we are right now?

00:26:47.938 --> 00:26:50.480 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: Well, I think it's
alive but maybe in a slightly

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.737 align:middle line:90%
different way than we are.

00:26:52.737 --> 00:26:54.320 align:middle line:84%
You know, there may
be a lot of things

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:58.340 align:middle line:84%
that have forms of
consciousness in ways

00:26:58.340 --> 00:26:59.900 align:middle line:84%
that we don't quite
understand yet.

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:02.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the ancients all
thought that the sun--

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:04.520 align:middle line:84%
they worship the sun
because they saw the sun

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:08.555 align:middle line:90%
as an immense, sentient being.

00:27:08.555 --> 00:27:09.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They may be right.

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:12.263 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: Well, I think they
might be right yeah, actually.

00:27:12.263 --> 00:27:14.660 align:middle line:84%
Because if you think
about how the solar rays

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:17.320 align:middle line:84%
and the solar cycles
and how that influences

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:19.130 align:middle line:84%
the development, I
mean, maybe the sun

00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:20.588 align:middle line:84%
and the Earth and
the other planets

00:27:20.588 --> 00:27:23.040 align:middle line:84%
are in this very
complex interplay,

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:26.810 align:middle line:84%
and there is a level of
awareness or intelligence

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:29.400 align:middle line:84%
beyond what we can
understand that's operative.

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:34.660 align:middle line:84%
That's also-- ayahuasca, which
is the subject of my new book,

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:36.770 align:middle line:84%
"When Plants Dream,"
that's also--

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:37.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I love that
title, by the way.

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:38.110 align:middle line:90%
>>PINCHBECK: Thank you so much.

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:39.830 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's also
very much a message

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:43.760 align:middle line:84%
that one gets from
drinking ayahuasca,

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.640 align:middle line:84%
that the planet
is alive, that it

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:47.390 align:middle line:84%
has an evolutionary
trajectory, that we're

00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:49.630 align:middle line:84%
part of this
evolutionary trajectory,

00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:52.340 align:middle line:84%
and that the whole thing
is very sacred in a way.

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:54.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Graham Hancock, one
of our dear friends, of course,

00:27:54.920 --> 00:28:00.190 align:middle line:84%
talked about your
book way back in 2010.

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:04.540 align:middle line:10%
>>GRAHAM HANCOCK: Is it possible
to summarize in relatively few

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:08.350 align:middle line:10%
words what the essential
thesis of your book "2012"

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:12.840 align:middle line:10%
is and also the subtitle, "The
Return of Quetzalcoatl?" "

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:15.430 align:middle line:10%
Why that subtitle?

00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:19.360 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: Yeah, well,
I'll start with the subtitle.

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:25.670 align:middle line:10%
Quetzalcoatl is a Aztec
name for a creator deity

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:28.185 align:middle line:10%
who's known in the Mayan
language as Kukulkan.

00:28:28.185 --> 00:28:30.310 align:middle line:10%
And it's the feathered
serpent, the plumed serpent.

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:32.680 align:middle line:10%
So it's the meeting of
the bird and the snake,

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:35.950 align:middle line:10%
which also could be seen
as the meeting of heaven

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:38.830 align:middle line:10%
and earth, air and
matter, spirit and matter.

00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:41.200 align:middle line:10%
But also what I
argue in the book

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:43.630 align:middle line:10%
as a theory is it
could also symbolize

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:49.210 align:middle line:10%
the integration of previously
seemingly opposed opposites--

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:52.480 align:middle line:10%
in this case, the
Western materialist

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:55.720 align:middle line:10%
scientific knowledge
system, which

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.030 align:middle line:10%
would be kind of the Earth,
the material-based one,

00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:00.820 align:middle line:10%
with more of this intuitive,
Shamanic or Eastern

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:04.220 align:middle line:10%
mystical way of knowing reality.

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:06.580 align:middle line:10%
And I think that as these
two forms of knowing

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:08.840 align:middle line:10%
are melding and coming together.

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:12.333 align:middle line:10%
It's leading towards this
next form of consciousness.

00:29:12.333 --> 00:29:14.500 align:middle line:10%
So that was one element,
and the other element was--

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:15.520 align:middle line:10%
>>HANCOCK: That's the return--

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:16.470 align:middle line:10%
>>PINCHBECK: The
return of Quetzalcoatl.

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:17.170 align:middle line:10%
>>HANCOCK: --that's
what's symbolizing that?

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:18.280 align:middle line:10%
>>PINCHBECK: Symbolizing, yeah.

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:20.863 align:middle line:10%
And then the other element for
me personally was an experience

00:29:20.863 --> 00:29:24.100 align:middle line:10%
that I'd had in Brazil, on
the Amazon, where I received

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:27.088 align:middle line:10%
this transmission of prophecy.

00:29:27.088 --> 00:29:28.630 align:middle line:10%
There was a voice
speaking in my head

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:31.030 align:middle line:10%
that proclaimed that
it was Quetzalcoatl,

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:33.820 align:middle line:10%
that this was the apocalypse,
that I had this mission

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:35.460 align:middle line:10%
to get out these
ideas and information

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:37.390 align:middle line:10%
and stuff like that.

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:40.990 align:middle line:10%
So it had resonance for me
both symbolically and then more

00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:42.760 align:middle line:10%
of this personal experience.

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:45.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many people
get what we just saw,

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:46.960 align:middle line:84%
you and Graham
Hancock talking about?

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:49.810 align:middle line:84%
How many people really
understand what's going on?

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:51.205 align:middle line:90%
>>PINCHBECK: I have no clue.

00:29:51.205 --> 00:29:52.080 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if I do.

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:52.880 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:53.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's honest.

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:55.652 align:middle line:90%
You better.

00:29:55.652 --> 00:29:56.860 align:middle line:90%
>>PINCHBECK: I go in and out.

00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:58.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, sometimes I
toggle back, you know,

00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:02.950 align:middle line:84%
because I had all these
incredible visionary

00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:05.703 align:middle line:84%
experiences and
synchronicities, and everything

00:30:05.703 --> 00:30:07.870 align:middle line:84%
seemed to be building to
some type of amazing thing,

00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:09.880 align:middle line:84%
and then that sort
of melts away.

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:12.820 align:middle line:84%
Then I'm back in my
small New York apartment,

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:16.840 align:middle line:84%
trying to figure
out what's next.

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:19.240 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: For a guy who's
so earthy and concerned

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:22.210 align:middle line:10%
about the planet, what
are you doing in New York?

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:23.060 align:middle line:90%
There's no grass.

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:24.250 align:middle line:90%
It's all pavement.

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:27.410 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: Well, I mean,
I'm indigenous to New York.

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:28.210 align:middle line:90%
I grew up there.

00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:29.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean,
I love New York.

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:30.910 align:middle line:84%
But I would think
I would see you

00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:32.842 align:middle line:84%
in Montana or
Oregon or something.

00:30:32.842 --> 00:30:34.050 align:middle line:90%
>>PINCHBECK: I'm not really--

00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:37.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm an urban bohemian and
an intellectual or whatever.

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:40.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm not really a
nature person, per se.

00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:41.007 align:middle line:90%
I love cities.

00:30:41.007 --> 00:30:43.090 align:middle line:84%
I love the density of them,
and I grew up in them.

00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:44.010 align:middle line:90%
My dad was an artist.

00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:46.000 align:middle line:84%
My mother was a
writer and an artist.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.280 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it's my
natural habitat.

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:54.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm not really
some nature person.

00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:57.970 align:middle line:84%
The reason I'm talking about all
this stuff around the ecology

00:30:57.970 --> 00:30:59.530 align:middle line:90%
is that I have a daughter.

00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:01.210 align:middle line:90%
You have a granddaughter.

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:05.470 align:middle line:84%
Whatever is going
on in our brains,

00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:08.800 align:middle line:84%
we are actually missing
the plot here because if we

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.210 align:middle line:90%
don't actually deal--

00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:13.068 align:middle line:84%
and that unfortunately would
need substantive changes

00:31:13.068 --> 00:31:14.110 align:middle line:90%
to everybody's lifestyle.

00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:14.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, dramatic changes.

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:16.210 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: Like,
we'd have to reel back

00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:18.040 align:middle line:90%
in a lot of the excess.

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:21.260 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you'd have to shoot
this on Skype or something

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:22.510 align:middle line:90%
rather than flying every week.

00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:25.090 align:middle line:90%


00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:26.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm only doing this--

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:28.313 align:middle line:84%
and I wish, as I
said, at this point,

00:31:28.313 --> 00:31:30.730 align:middle line:84%
I wish I'd just gone the Tony
Robbins route and been like,

00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:34.960 align:middle line:84%
yeah, we could all
have incredible lives.

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:37.780 align:middle line:84%
Again, the other sad
thing is the excess

00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:40.420 align:middle line:84%
that the Western world
has used has really

00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:41.860 align:middle line:90%
cost the developing world.

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:45.400 align:middle line:84%
Like Bangladesh, let's
say, 170 million people who

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:48.670 align:middle line:90%
live very close to sea level.

00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:52.630 align:middle line:84%
They are the ones who are
most likely to be wiped out

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:55.360 align:middle line:84%
as the seas start to rise
because they're not going

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:56.590 align:middle line:90%
to be able to farm and so on.

00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:58.060 align:middle line:90%
That's really us who did that.

00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:00.340 align:middle line:84%
The US used something
like 25% or more

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:02.800 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth's
resources and carbon.

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:04.810 align:middle line:90%
Europe also used a lot.

00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:08.530 align:middle line:84%
Even though China and India
and so on are now catching up,

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:11.410 align:middle line:84%
we're very much responsible
for a lot of what's

00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:13.540 align:middle line:84%
happened to the
planet, and we're still

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:14.750 align:middle line:90%
not taking responsibility.

00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:16.840 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we've elected
somebody who represents

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:18.640 align:middle line:90%
like total irresponsibility.

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:21.892 align:middle line:84%
So we have to take this as
something very personal.

00:32:21.892 --> 00:32:23.350 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: There was
an area, I think

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:25.392 align:middle line:10%
it might have been India,
where a quarter million

00:32:25.392 --> 00:32:29.140 align:middle line:10%
farmers committed suicide
because they weren't

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:32.650 align:middle line:10%
happy with the way their crops
were coming because they were

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:35.020 align:middle line:10%
genetically modified
and everything else.

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:36.370 align:middle line:90%
That's horrible.

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:39.220 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: Well, yeah,
corporations have unfortunately

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:42.940 align:middle line:84%
been willing to do a lot
of things for profit--

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:46.870 align:middle line:84%
whether it's denying
generic AIDS drugs to Africa

00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:50.440 align:middle line:84%
or giving Indian
farmers seeds that

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:52.390 align:middle line:84%
have to be rebought
every year and so on.

00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:53.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sure, or
cancer-causing herbicides.

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:54.970 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: You know,
it just shows you

00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:56.620 align:middle line:84%
how ridiculous the
system is because we

00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:58.540 align:middle line:84%
have these incredible
technologies,

00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:00.050 align:middle line:84%
and we could be
sharing them, but we

00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:04.220 align:middle line:84%
can't do it under the current
economic political model.

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:07.760 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: When you look at where
you've come over the last years

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:09.710 align:middle line:10%
since your books
have been coming out,

00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:12.073 align:middle line:10%
have you changed too?

00:33:12.073 --> 00:33:13.490 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: Yeah,
I'm still going

00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:14.690 align:middle line:90%
through a lot of changing.

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:15.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You are?

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:15.940 align:middle line:90%
>>PINCHBECK: Yeah.

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:17.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In what direction?

00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:21.110 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: Well, one thing is,
in the wake of the whole MeToo

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:24.800 align:middle line:84%
movement, addressing my own
areas of toxic masculinity

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:29.480 align:middle line:84%
and facing that and
realizing that I

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:31.730 align:middle line:84%
made a lot of mistakes
in how I dealt

00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:34.180 align:middle line:90%
with women and the feminine.

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:37.280 align:middle line:84%
That's been a major
ongoing area that I've

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:38.810 align:middle line:90%
been seeking to address.

00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And then also, in a way,
I'm in a more nebulous zone

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:43.458 align:middle line:84%
of uncertainty
because I was trying

00:33:43.458 --> 00:33:45.500 align:middle line:84%
to start a whole company
and a movement, Evolver.

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:48.110 align:middle line:90%


00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:49.880 align:middle line:84%
Then that, for
whatever reasons--

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:52.213 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's still going, but
I'm not actively involved.

00:33:52.213 --> 00:33:54.870 align:middle line:84%
So I'm kind of open to
the mystery at this point.

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:57.500 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You had mentioned
earlier about crop formations.

00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they're
all over the planet.

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:02.060 align:middle line:90%
What's your take on that?

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:03.320 align:middle line:90%
Who's doing these things?

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.570 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: Yeah, well,
I definitely think that--

00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:08.540 align:middle line:84%
I spent one solid
summer and then

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:10.580 align:middle line:84%
part of another
summer in Glastonbury

00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:14.659 align:middle line:84%
going to them as they
popped up and researching,

00:34:14.659 --> 00:34:17.100 align:middle line:84%
talking to all the people
involved with them.

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:21.689 align:middle line:84%
And I do think that there's
a non-human intelligence--

00:34:21.689 --> 00:34:22.489 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do?

00:34:22.489 --> 00:34:24.239 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: --that
is involved with this.

00:34:24.239 --> 00:34:26.719 align:middle line:84%
There's some higher
form of intelligence

00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:29.600 align:middle line:84%
that is using this as a
medium for communication

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:30.790 align:middle line:90%
and a very playful one.

00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:33.031 align:middle line:90%
And it seems to be in a way--

00:34:33.031 --> 00:34:34.489 align:middle line:84%
what I took from
it, after spending

00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:35.989 align:middle line:84%
so much time looking
at it, was it's

00:34:35.989 --> 00:34:39.530 align:middle line:84%
like a kind of a teaching
on the nature of reality

00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:41.870 align:middle line:84%
and the nature of
consciousness and giving us

00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:45.350 align:middle line:84%
these very gentle hints
about the importance

00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:48.710 align:middle line:84%
of sacred geometries,
the importance of symbols

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:50.449 align:middle line:90%
from ancient cultures and so on.

00:34:50.449 --> 00:34:52.885 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you do think
it's an ET presence?

00:34:52.885 --> 00:34:54.218 align:middle line:90%
>>PINCHBECK: Well, I don't know.

00:34:54.218 --> 00:34:56.719 align:middle line:84%
I think ET is a
complicated word.

00:34:56.719 --> 00:34:58.610 align:middle line:84%
I think that there
may be other levels

00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:00.920 align:middle line:84%
of galactic intelligence,
and there also

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.730 align:middle line:90%
may be other dimensions.

00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:06.260 align:middle line:84%
We know that, according
to contemporary physics,

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:09.530 align:middle line:84%
they talk about there being
10 dimensions of space time.

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:12.770 align:middle line:84%
What we're experiencing now
is the fourth dimension.

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:14.690 align:middle line:84%
If there were forms
of consciousness

00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:16.580 align:middle line:84%
that were in the sixth
or seventh dimension,

00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:19.280 align:middle line:84%
they would be able to
potentially move through time

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:21.580 align:middle line:90%
as we move through space.

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:24.255 align:middle line:84%
They might be us in
another dimension

00:35:24.255 --> 00:35:25.380 align:middle line:90%
in what we call the future.

00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:28.900 align:middle line:84%
But they would just be
existing in their relationship

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:32.070 align:middle line:90%
to their dimensional reality.

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:36.290 align:middle line:84%
We've tended to make a very
literalistic and reductive

00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:38.900 align:middle line:84%
discussion around subjects
like ETs and so on,

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:40.887 align:middle line:90%
and it may be much more complex.

00:35:40.887 --> 00:35:42.720 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What about the
possibility, Daniel,

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:45.320 align:middle line:10%
that this planet--
again, the Gaia Theory--

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:49.790 align:middle line:10%
is alive, and it's the
planet sending us messages.

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:51.838 align:middle line:10%
That's how it
communicates with us--

00:35:51.838 --> 00:35:52.880 align:middle line:10%
through these formations.

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:53.120 align:middle line:90%
>>PINCHBECK: Right.

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:54.690 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't really
make sense to me.

00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:56.315 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think the
planet communicates

00:35:56.315 --> 00:35:59.870 align:middle line:84%
to us through flowers and
bumblebees and streams

00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:01.430 align:middle line:90%
and clouds and so on.

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:04.725 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And mosquitoes.

00:36:04.725 --> 00:36:08.435 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: And mosquitoes
and ticks and moles and snakes.

00:36:08.435 --> 00:36:10.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't think the planet
needs to communicate

00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:12.460 align:middle line:84%
with us through these types
of geometric patterns.

00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:14.180 align:middle line:84%
These suggest more
of an ordered,

00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:17.330 align:middle line:84%
kind of civilizational
imposition in a way.

00:36:17.330 --> 00:36:20.930 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: In your new book, of
course, "When Plants Dream,"

00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:23.510 align:middle line:10%
you talk about the global
spread of ayahuasca.

00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:25.680 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what it
is, first of all.

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:28.250 align:middle line:84%
What is ayahuasca,
and what does it do?

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:32.630 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: Yeah, so ayahuasca
is a visionary potion from

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:36.140 align:middle line:84%
the Amazon basin, a tea in a
sense that's usually brewed

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:37.820 align:middle line:84%
together from two
different plants--

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:41.090 align:middle line:84%
the ayahuasca vine,
Banisteriopsis caapi,

00:36:41.090 --> 00:36:44.450 align:middle line:84%
which contains certain compounds
that are like harmaline,

00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:46.030 align:middle line:90%
which are MAO inhibitors.

00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the leaves
of the chacruna, which

00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:55.718 align:middle line:84%
contain Psychotria
viridis, which contain

00:36:55.718 --> 00:36:57.010 align:middle line:90%
Dimethyltryptamine, or GMT DMT.

00:36:57.010 --> 00:36:59.780 align:middle line:90%


00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:04.590 align:middle line:84%
DMT, if you try to eat it, it's
normally inactivated by enzymes

00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:07.070 align:middle line:84%
But if you put it
together in this potion,

00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:08.180 align:middle line:90%
then it can be taken in.

00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:09.222 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you drink it?

00:37:09.222 --> 00:37:10.898 align:middle line:90%
>>PINCHBECK: You drink it.

00:37:10.898 --> 00:37:12.440 align:middle line:84%
Usually the ceremonies
are all night.

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:14.790 align:middle line:84%
Usually you have a
shaman or a group of them

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:16.370 align:middle line:90%
who preside over it.

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:17.360 align:middle line:90%
Often they're singing.

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:20.210 align:middle line:90%
Often there's healing rituals--

00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:22.750 align:middle line:90%
prayers, tobacco, chanting.

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And you know, many
people find this

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:28.843 align:middle line:84%
to be a very, very powerful
and profound experience--

00:37:28.843 --> 00:37:30.260 align:middle line:84%
in some cases, a
very healing one.

00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:32.797 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Does it knock you out?

00:37:32.797 --> 00:37:34.130 align:middle line:90%
>>PINCHBECK: It knocks you down.

00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:38.450 align:middle line:84%
Definitely you're in a different
state of consciousness.

00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:39.480 align:middle line:90%
You're conscious.

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:39.950 align:middle line:90%
You're awake.

00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:41.640 align:middle line:84%
But it's almost like
you're in like a--

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:42.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A different zone?

00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:44.240 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: --visionary
dream cocoon,

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:46.850 align:middle line:84%
where you're seeing into
these other realities.

00:37:46.850 --> 00:37:49.610 align:middle line:84%
And sound has an
incredible effect on you,

00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:50.750 align:middle line:90%
or smell, or whatever.

00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:51.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everything's enhanced?

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:53.550 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: Everything
is enhanced, yeah.

00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:56.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you get in a
car and drive after doing this?

00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:57.470 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: After doing
it, you could, sure.

00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:58.940 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the next
day most people

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:01.310 align:middle line:84%
feel really very
much in their bodies.

00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And also the MAO inhibitors
that the ayahuasca vine

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.630 align:middle line:84%
contains have a natural
antidepressant effect.

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:11.055 align:middle line:84%
So they really lift your
spirits, often generally.

00:38:11.055 --> 00:38:12.825 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're a little more
energetic and everything else.

00:38:12.825 --> 00:38:13.625 align:middle line:90%
>>PINCHBECK: Yeah.

00:38:13.625 --> 00:38:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying that
it's for everybody.

00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:19.100 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has an individual
decision around it you.

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:20.925 align:middle line:84%
It is a very
profound experience.

00:38:20.925 --> 00:38:21.725 align:middle line:90%
It can be jarring.

00:38:21.725 --> 00:38:24.230 align:middle line:90%


00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:27.890 align:middle line:90%
So it's an individual decision.

00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:29.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have
a program on Gaia

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:34.343 align:middle line:84%
called "Psychedelica" which
addresses this exact topic.

00:38:34.343 --> 00:38:36.800 align:middle line:10%
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:39.290 align:middle line:10%
>> Deep in the
heart of the Amazon,

00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:44.240 align:middle line:10%
out of generations of indigenous
people from mysterious origins,

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:47.690 align:middle line:10%
birth from a specific
combination of plants comes

00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:52.340 align:middle line:10%
a visionary experience, an
ancient healing tradition--

00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:54.710 align:middle line:10%
modern controversy
and massive interest

00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:58.850 align:middle line:10%
from younger generations all
surrounding a sacred brew

00:38:58.850 --> 00:39:03.790 align:middle line:10%
called ayahuasca, a
beverage that contains DMT.

00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:07.550 align:middle line:10%
DMT is a tryptamine that
even our brain produces.

00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:10.520 align:middle line:10%
But the chacruna leaves
contains much more.

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:13.550 align:middle line:10%
Left alone, this molecule
will be metabolized

00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:15.600 align:middle line:10%
before having any effect.

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:18.740 align:middle line:10%
So the sacred vine is
added to protect its entry

00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:23.270 align:middle line:10%
through the body into the
brain and into our experience.

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:28.050 align:middle line:90%


00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:31.020 align:middle line:10%
From scientists to
shamans, many theories

00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:34.380 align:middle line:10%
abound regarding the strange
effects of ayahuasca.

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:37.800 align:middle line:10%
And yet it still is
not fully understood.

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:40.320 align:middle line:10%
>>DENNIS MCKENNA:
So ayahuasca is--

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:44.910 align:middle line:10%
it's a whole bunch of things,
but on the nuts and bolts

00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:46.380 align:middle line:10%
level, it's a beverage.

00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:50.100 align:middle line:10%
It's made from two plants
at least, one of which

00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:53.310 align:middle line:10%
contains Dimethyltryptamine.

00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:56.460 align:middle line:10%
At the cultural level, it's
much broader than that.

00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:58.680 align:middle line:84%
These are essentially
shamanic practices,

00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:02.820 align:middle line:84%
and ayahuasca is at
the center of that kind

00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:07.410 align:middle line:84%
of traditional medicine,
which is really

00:40:07.410 --> 00:40:10.170 align:middle line:90%
a mind-body kind of medicine.

00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:13.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Daniel, is ayahuasca
legal in this country, or is

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:15.250 align:middle line:90%
it considered a narcotic?

00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:16.290 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:40:16.290 --> 00:40:17.260 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: The
legality is something

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:18.210 align:middle line:90%
that we track in the book.

00:40:18.210 --> 00:40:19.543 align:middle line:90%
And it's actually quite complex.

00:40:19.543 --> 00:40:22.163 align:middle line:90%


00:40:22.163 --> 00:40:23.580 align:middle line:84%
There's a couple
of religions that

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:25.300 align:middle line:84%
started in Brazil
in the 1920s that

00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:27.690 align:middle line:84%
are syncretic religions,
that mix together

00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Christian and
indigenous elements.

00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:32.130 align:middle line:84%
One of them is called
Uniao do Vegetales,

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:37.110 align:middle line:84%
and they actually won a Supreme
Court case a number of years

00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:42.720 align:middle line:84%
ago allowing them to use their
ayahuasca tea as a sacrament.

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:46.980 align:middle line:84%
Based on that decision,
a court in Oregon

00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:48.750 align:middle line:84%
allowed another
religion, Santo Daime,

00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:51.900 align:middle line:84%
to have protection for
their use of the sacrament.

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And at the moment, there
seems to be a general sense

00:40:57.210 --> 00:40:59.200 align:middle line:90%
that it's OK.

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:02.140 align:middle line:84%
People have been
advertising publicly.

00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:05.400 align:middle line:10%
This guy in Florida has been
very public about putting

00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:07.200 align:middle line:10%
Facebook ads on about it.

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And it seems like
as long as there's

00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:15.180 align:middle line:84%
some type of religious
connection, sacramental use

00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:18.015 align:middle line:84%
of it, it seems like it's
being allowed at this point.

00:41:18.015 --> 00:41:19.140 align:middle line:90%
But it's still a gray area.

00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:21.510 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: If you were driving
and got stopped by police,

00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:24.977 align:middle line:10%
and you had a little container
of it, what would they do?

00:41:24.977 --> 00:41:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: They
wouldn't know what it was.

00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:28.170 align:middle line:90%
It's a very minor--

00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:30.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's not
meth or anything.

00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:33.090 align:middle line:84%
A very small group of
people are doing it,

00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:35.060 align:middle line:84%
and they're doing
it in ceremony.

00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:36.850 align:middle line:84%
You're not going
to do it and drive.

00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:38.100 align:middle line:90%
It's just not going to happen.

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:39.990 align:middle line:90%
It would be a very stupid idea.

00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:42.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But it seems to
enhance your abilities

00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:43.560 align:middle line:90%
for all kinds of things.

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:45.360 align:middle line:90%
Does it make you more intuitive?

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:46.160 align:middle line:90%
>>PINCHBECK: Yes.

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:48.370 align:middle line:84%
I think it can help you
enhance your intuition.

00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:50.787 align:middle line:84%
What I've been very fascinated,
which we track in the book

00:41:50.787 --> 00:41:56.220 align:middle line:84%
also, is how some people who
are very successful or come

00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:59.820 align:middle line:84%
from wealthy backgrounds,
the ayahuasca

00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:05.130 align:middle line:84%
really changes their thinking
about how they use their power

00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:06.917 align:middle line:90%
in relationship to the planet.

00:42:06.917 --> 00:42:08.500 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, we
talked about there

00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:12.450 align:middle line:84%
was a CEO who was running
a soft drink company.

00:42:12.450 --> 00:42:14.508 align:middle line:84%
He drank ayahuasca,
and then he realized

00:42:14.508 --> 00:42:16.050 align:middle line:84%
that he didn't wanted
to do something

00:42:16.050 --> 00:42:18.697 align:middle line:84%
that was just sugar drinks
that were for mass consumption.

00:42:18.697 --> 00:42:19.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He changed?

00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: So
he shifted to more

00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:24.561 align:middle line:84%
of a health-based product that
had more herbal benefits and so

00:42:24.561 --> 00:42:24.650 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:26.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He probably
ended up making more money

00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:27.370 align:middle line:90%
in the long run.

00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:31.080 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: Well that's
also arguably possible.

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:33.950 align:middle line:90%
But it does seem to really--

00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:36.960 align:middle line:84%
it's a powerful tool both
for inner exploration,

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:40.140 align:middle line:84%
for discovering that there
maybe are these other layers

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:42.283 align:middle line:84%
or dimensions of
spiritual reality.

00:42:42.283 --> 00:42:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And then also for
some people, it really

00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:49.500 align:middle line:84%
helps them to address, yeah,
how they use their resources--

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:52.168 align:middle line:84%
recalibrate based on
having a deeper connection

00:42:52.168 --> 00:42:54.210 align:middle line:84%
to the Gaian intelligence
of the planet, perhaps.

00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:55.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:57.210 align:middle line:84%
Your first book was called,
"Breaking Open the Head?"

00:42:57.210 --> 00:42:57.960 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: "Breaking
Open the Head."

00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:59.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which dealt with this.

00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:01.335 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: Yeah, that
book was an overview.

00:43:01.335 --> 00:43:05.870 align:middle line:84%
So that really was about
my own journeys, discovery

00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:07.067 align:middle line:90%
starting in my late 20s.

00:43:07.067 --> 00:43:08.650 align:middle line:84%
I was a journalist,
and I went through

00:43:08.650 --> 00:43:11.443 align:middle line:90%
a spiritual existential crisis.

00:43:11.443 --> 00:43:13.860 align:middle line:84%
I remembered that I had taken
LSD and mushrooms in college

00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:15.700 align:middle line:90%
and decided to explore that.

00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:17.700 align:middle line:84%
But this was back in
the 1990s in New York,

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:20.520 align:middle line:84%
and you couldn't even talk
about psychedelics in public

00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:21.870 align:middle line:90%
without people laughing at you.

00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:23.415 align:middle line:84%
Or if I brought it
up to my friends

00:43:23.415 --> 00:43:25.290 align:middle line:84%
who were journalists or
editors or whatever--

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:26.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was
too "foo-foo" then.

00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:27.530 align:middle line:90%
>>PINCHBECK: Yes.

00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:29.430 align:middle line:84%
There had been a
huge cultural effort

00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:34.780 align:middle line:84%
to ridicule psychedelics,
to make them seem absurd.

00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:38.190 align:middle line:84%
Once they were outlawed
in the '60s and '70s, you

00:43:38.190 --> 00:43:39.180 align:middle line:90%
couldn't even--

00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:42.010 align:middle line:84%
basically science had
made them totally taboo.

00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:46.080 align:middle line:84%
So basically from the early
'70s to the late '90s,

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:50.130 align:middle line:84%
there were basically no
tests using human subjects

00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:52.758 align:middle line:84%
with psychedelics,
even though in the '50s

00:43:52.758 --> 00:43:54.300 align:middle line:84%
psychologists were
talking about them

00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:56.340 align:middle line:84%
as the most incredible
tools we had ever

00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:59.520 align:middle line:84%
found for studying the
human mind and so on.

00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:01.030 align:middle line:84%
So it's only in
the last 15 years,

00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:02.550 align:middle line:84%
actually since "Breaking
Open the Head" came out,

00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:04.140 align:middle line:84%
and I think that
that book may have

00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:07.440 align:middle line:84%
helped to shift the
cultural tonality maybe

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:09.470 align:middle line:90%
around the psychedelics.

00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:11.910 align:middle line:84%
Now we're seeing this massive
psychedelic Renaissance,

00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:15.533 align:middle line:84%
and the discoveries
are really amazing.

00:44:15.533 --> 00:44:16.950 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I think
mushrooms are now

00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:19.007 align:middle line:10%
legal in this state,
Colorado, aren't they?

00:44:19.007 --> 00:44:21.340 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: I think it's--
is it just in Denver, maybe?

00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:22.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe.

00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:24.535 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: Yeah, that just
happened a few weeks ago.

00:44:24.535 --> 00:44:25.410 align:middle line:90%
That's extraordinary.

00:44:25.410 --> 00:44:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And they've done
some great studies.

00:44:28.270 --> 00:44:32.270 align:middle line:84%
Johns Hopkins did a study where
they gave mushrooms to people

00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:34.270 align:middle line:84%
who'd never had a psychedelic
experience before,

00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:36.910 align:middle line:84%
then over a series of years
charted them-- you know,

00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:39.940 align:middle line:84%
went back to them and did
psychological testing--

00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:41.530 align:middle line:84%
and found that people
remembered them

00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:43.930 align:middle line:84%
as one of the greatest
experiences of their lives,

00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:46.300 align:middle line:84%
in parallel with the
birth of their first child

00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:51.220 align:middle line:84%
or their wedding, and had
permanent positive changes

00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:52.480 align:middle line:90%
to their psychological makeup.

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:54.760 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, they
permanently had more openness

00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:58.240 align:middle line:90%
to new experience as a factor.

00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:00.310 align:middle line:90%
So that's very exciting.

00:45:00.310 --> 00:45:03.180 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing treatments for
obsessive compulsive disorder,

00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:04.200 align:middle line:90%
for depression.

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:05.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Autism?

00:45:05.890 --> 00:45:08.920 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: Autism is an
interesting possibility.

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:11.980 align:middle line:84%
In the book on
ayahuasca, we found

00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:15.370 align:middle line:84%
a researcher who's
demonstrated that ayahuasca

00:45:15.370 --> 00:45:19.938 align:middle line:84%
can help actually grow new
brain cells, neurogenesis.

00:45:19.938 --> 00:45:20.980 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's dramatic.

00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:21.790 align:middle line:10%
>>PINCHBECK: Yeah.

00:45:21.790 --> 00:45:23.920 align:middle line:84%
So that might have really
interesting implications

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:26.530 align:middle line:84%
down the line when we
can isolate some of that.

00:45:26.530 --> 00:45:30.100 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: PTSD-- huge problem
with our military, huge problem

00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:31.640 align:middle line:10%
with individuals as well.

00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:32.440 align:middle line:90%
>>PINCHBECK: Yeah.

00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:38.980 align:middle line:84%
So MAPS has been running
clinical trials with MDMA

00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:40.690 align:middle line:84%
for treating
post-traumatic stress

00:45:40.690 --> 00:45:43.730 align:middle line:84%
disorder in veterans from the
Iraq and Afghanistan wars.

00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think they've had
something like a 60% success

00:45:47.170 --> 00:45:51.280 align:middle line:84%
rate where you give MDMA in
therapy-assisted sessions

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:52.810 align:middle line:90%
three times.

00:45:52.810 --> 00:45:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And you don't even
really do that much.

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:58.000 align:middle line:84%
You just wait for the
repressed emotions

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.330 align:middle line:84%
and experiences to surface
and hold container for them.

00:46:03.330 --> 00:46:05.860 align:middle line:84%
And ayahuasca, actually
there's a wonderful film

00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:07.510 align:middle line:84%
that just came out
called "From Shock

00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:11.870 align:middle line:84%
to Awe" which traces
some Iraq war veterans.

00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And they show these
huge medicine cabinets

00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:16.990 align:middle line:84%
full of all these
pharmaceuticals and so on.

00:46:16.990 --> 00:46:17.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Horrible, yeah.

00:46:17.530 --> 00:46:19.370 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: And then they drink
ayahuasca for a few months,

00:46:19.370 --> 00:46:20.620 align:middle line:84%
so they just throw
away all those pills.

00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:22.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Throw the
other stuff out--

00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:23.540 align:middle line:90%
that's dramatic.

00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:26.230 align:middle line:84%
Can it hurt you
at all, ayahuasca?

00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: So like any
powerful psychoactive

00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:35.635 align:middle line:84%
or psychedelic, it
has the potential to--

00:46:35.635 --> 00:46:38.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it can
cause psychological harm

00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:41.230 align:middle line:84%
or if it really just
opens up maybe stuff

00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:42.700 align:middle line:90%
that you'd repressed or so on.

00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:46.450 align:middle line:84%
But I do know people who've had
psychological breakdowns after.

00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:48.880 align:middle line:84%
But it's very rare, but it
does happen where people end up

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:49.795 align:middle line:90%
in a mental institution.

00:46:49.795 --> 00:46:50.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe
they had too much?

00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:51.848 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: Or they
maybe drank too much

00:46:51.848 --> 00:46:53.570 align:middle line:84%
in a short period
of time or whatever.

00:46:53.570 --> 00:46:55.930 align:middle line:84%
We're really just
learning about it.

00:46:55.930 --> 00:46:59.260 align:middle line:84%
But we also do have to remember
that even in the Amazon,

00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:01.480 align:middle line:84%
it's not like everybody
would take ayahuasca.

00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:03.730 align:middle line:84%
Often, it was really only
the shamans who would do it,

00:47:03.730 --> 00:47:05.660 align:middle line:84%
and they would diagnose
their patients.

00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:08.020 align:middle line:84%
But then also when you
took these types of things,

00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:10.720 align:middle line:90%
they were initiations.

00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:12.940 align:middle line:84%
Initiations are
meant to be scary.

00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:16.140 align:middle line:84%
It's like you're going into this
liminal world between the life

00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:16.940 align:middle line:90%
and death--

00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:18.790 align:middle line:84%
into the spirit world
to get knowledge,

00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:22.150 align:middle line:90%
to mature, to understand.

00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And those are
dangerous journeys,

00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:27.820 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes they can
cause negative consequences.

00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:29.650 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Daniel, if
you had a magic wand,

00:47:29.650 --> 00:47:32.380 align:middle line:10%
and you could just wave it over
the planet, what would that

00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:34.280 align:middle line:10%
wish be with that wand?

00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:36.970 align:middle line:10%
What would you
like to see happen?

00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:39.465 align:middle line:10%
>>PINCHBECK: Yeah,
I think we need--

00:47:39.465 --> 00:47:41.590 align:middle line:10%
I've mentioned Extinction
Rebellion and the Sunrise

00:47:41.590 --> 00:47:42.670 align:middle line:10%
Movement before--

00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:47.650 align:middle line:10%
we basically need a mass
global citizen movement,

00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:50.750 align:middle line:10%
you could say an uprising
or rebellion to some sense--

00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:53.080 align:middle line:10%
not a violent one, not
a destructive one--

00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:56.230 align:middle line:10%
but to recognize that
the system is broken,

00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:57.730 align:middle line:10%
and if we continue
along this path,

00:47:57.730 --> 00:47:59.647 align:middle line:10%
we're going to bring
about our own extinction.

00:47:59.647 --> 00:48:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we have a very
small window of opportunity

00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:07.540 align:middle line:84%
to redesign our operating
system so that we

00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:12.430 align:middle line:84%
shift from exploitation and
extraction and domination

00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:15.875 align:middle line:84%
to really working to create
a regenerative system

00:48:15.875 --> 00:48:16.750 align:middle line:90%
on a planetary scale.

00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:18.310 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How much
time do we have?

00:48:18.310 --> 00:48:21.210 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: I think we better
get to it the next five years.

00:48:21.210 --> 00:48:22.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That soon?

00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:23.100 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: Well,
I mean, that's

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:24.577 align:middle line:84%
what all the science
is telling us.

00:48:24.577 --> 00:48:25.660 align:middle line:90%
It couldn't be more clear.

00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:27.250 align:middle line:90%
We're in big trouble right now.

00:48:27.250 --> 00:48:28.490 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Daniel, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:48:28.490 --> 00:48:29.170 align:middle line:10%
>>PINCHBECK: Thanks
for having me.

00:48:29.170 --> 00:48:29.740 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I really appreciate it.

00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:30.360 align:middle line:10%
>>PINCHBECK: Nice
to talk to you.

00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:32.735 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And for people who
want more information on what

00:48:32.735 --> 00:48:34.345 align:middle line:10%
you do, how do they find you?

00:48:34.345 --> 00:48:36.220 align:middle line:10%
>>PINCHBECK: I'm on all
the normal channels--

00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:38.720 align:middle line:10%
Instagram, Twitter,
Daniel Pinchbeck,

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:41.860 align:middle line:10%
Facebook, Daniel Pinchbeck.

00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:43.120 align:middle line:90%
I guess those are the ways.

00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:44.590 align:middle line:90%
Pinchbeck.io is my website.

00:48:44.590 --> 00:48:46.330 align:middle line:90%
They can message me there.

00:48:46.330 --> 00:48:50.482 align:middle line:84%
We have howsoonisnow.info
is for my last book.

>>NOORY: Daniel, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief,"

00:48:52.690 --> 00:48:53.990 align:middle line:10%
really appreciate it.

00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.740 align:middle line:10%
>>PINCHBECK: Thanks
for having me.

00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:56.282 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: So as Daniel
has said, we've

00:48:56.282 --> 00:48:59.680 align:middle line:10%
got five years to really
start fixing this.

00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:00.910 align:middle line:90%
Let's start right now.

00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:03.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
