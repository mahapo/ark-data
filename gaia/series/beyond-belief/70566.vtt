>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.312 --> 00:00:08.770 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.600 align:middle line:84%

really happened.

>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.408 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.408 --> 00:00:19.200 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

of X-PPAC, a political
action committee devoted

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.720 align:middle line:84%
to the politics surrounding
the extraterrestrial presence

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.820 align:middle line:84%
and the government truth
embargo about that.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.800 align:middle line:84%
The government's not
telling you the truth

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.320 align:middle line:84%
about the ET presence, if
you don't already know that.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.220 align:middle line:10%
I invite you to go to Paradigm
Research Group's website

00:00:51.220 --> 00:01:00.730 align:middle line:10%
at www.paradigmresearchgroup.org
or www.x-ppac.org and read

You will quickly figure out
there's something to this.

00:01:15.415 --> 00:01:16.620 align:middle line:90%
This is real.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.270 align:middle line:90%
This is transcendent.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.889 align:middle line:84%
And with your help, we can bring
about the disclosure event,

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:23.930 align:middle line:84%
where the United States
government finally admits

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.170 align:middle line:84%
to this ET presence and lets
us all in on what's easily

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.120 align:middle line:84%
the most extraordinary
transition and event

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.320 align:middle line:90%
in human history.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.530 align:middle line:84%
We need to do this now,
because the world's not

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.181 align:middle line:90%
getting a nicer place to live.

00:01:34.181 --> 00:01:35.430 align:middle line:90%
Things are not getting better.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.469 align:middle line:90%
They're getting worse.

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And part of the reason is too
many important things are being

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.551 align:middle line:84%
withheld from the
people of the world

00:01:40.551 --> 00:01:43.020 align:middle line:84%
about the world they live in
so they can make decisions

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.410 align:middle line:84%
about their nation, about their
religion, about their actions.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.580 align:middle line:84%
What do they want to
do with their lives?

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:50.675 align:middle line:90%
Do they want to hate?

00:01:50.675 --> 00:01:51.550 align:middle line:90%
Do they want to kill?

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.670 align:middle line:84%
Or do they want to take
this planet forward,

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.645 align:middle line:84%
solve the environment,
and maybe even enter

00:01:56.645 --> 00:01:58.610 align:middle line:90%
a galactic community?

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:59.960 align:middle line:90%
Think about this.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.850 align:middle line:84%
You could be part of the most
profound and extraordinary

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.260 align:middle line:90%
moment in history.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.550 align:middle line:84%
But first, you've
got to get informed.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:07.549 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

welcome to this edition

of "Beyond Belief."

00:02:10.131 --> 00:02:12.900 align:middle line:10%
What you just saw
was Stephen Basset,

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.470 align:middle line:10%
who has spent his life
trying to break the truth

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.420 align:middle line:10%
embargo about what
the government knows

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.940 align:middle line:10%
about extraterrestrials
and that presence.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.000 align:middle line:84%
With us tonight,
Stephen Bassett.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.212 align:middle line:90%
Stephen, always a pleasure.

00:02:26.212 --> 00:02:27.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Yes, indeed.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
years have you and I

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.780 align:middle line:84%
been talking about
the truth embargo?

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.460 align:middle line:84%
Gosh, it's got to
be 16, 17 years.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.335 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: It's basically--
yeah, almost 18 years.

00:02:36.335 --> 00:02:37.710 align:middle line:84%
I started talking
to you when you

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:38.980 align:middle line:90%
were on the show in St. Louis.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:39.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In St. Louis.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.350 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that's right.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And you were doing this even
before that, weren't you?

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.160 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: A bit before.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.280 align:middle line:10%
I entered the field
on January the 26th

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.510 align:middle line:10%
of 1996, when I
arrived at the offices

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.390 align:middle line:10%
of the Program for
Extraordinary Experience

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.270 align:middle line:10%
Research in Cambridge
that was set up

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.495 align:middle line:10%
by Dr. John Mack to
study contactees--

00:02:57.495 --> 00:02:58.892 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: God rest his soul.

00:02:58.892 --> 00:02:59.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Yes, indeed.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:00.560 align:middle line:90%
A great man.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.180 align:middle line:90%
And it was four months.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.560 align:middle line:10%
And it was amazing just
to be around that work

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.340 align:middle line:10%
and be around Dr. Mack a bit.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.147 align:middle line:90%
And he gave me a lot of energy.

00:03:10.147 --> 00:03:12.480 align:middle line:84%
But it was from there that I
left and went to Washington

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.560 align:middle line:84%
and arrived on July
the 4th of 1996--

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fitting.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Why not-- and set
up the Paradigm Research Group

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.970 align:middle line:84%
and registered as a lobbyist on
this issue, the first to do so.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And the political press
check all those lobbying

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.710 align:middle line:90%
registrations.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.561 align:middle line:84%
And when they saw mine and
they saw "extraterrestrial,"

00:03:29.561 --> 00:03:30.810 align:middle line:90%
they came out to interview me.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:31.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They loved that.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:32.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Got a
front-page article

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.381 align:middle line:84%
in the business section of the
Post, and the rest is history.

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:37.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've never
given up, Stephen, ever.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.820 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Well, no.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.930 align:middle line:84%
Usually, when you're
an activist and you

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:48.080 align:middle line:84%
get involved in a major
issue, it's hard to leave it.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.620 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to go, OK,
I've given it 10 years.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And think of the
Civil Rights Movement.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.170 align:middle line:84%
Most of the people that got
involved in the Civil Rights

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.332 align:middle line:84%
Movement in the
'40s and '50s, they

00:03:59.332 --> 00:04:01.790 align:middle line:84%
were not going to stop until
they got the Civil Rights Act.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.331 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Until they
got the solution.

00:04:03.331 --> 00:04:03.890 align:middle line:90%
Gotcha.

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Sometimes
you don't make it.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.070 align:middle line:84%
We've lost a lot of colleagues
in the last 18 months,

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.050 align:middle line:90%
which always pains me.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.280 align:middle line:84%
But I happen to believe
that the goal is doable,

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.547 align:middle line:84%
that ending this truth
embargo can happen.

00:04:17.547 --> 00:04:18.630 align:middle line:90%
It could happen this year.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.494 align:middle line:90%
It could happen early next year.

00:04:20.494 --> 00:04:21.910 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
reasons for that.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.960 align:middle line:84%
I talk about this
all over the world.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't feel too
bad about 18 years in.

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.550 align:middle line:84%
But did I think it
would take this long?

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:30.320 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.860 align:middle line:90%
But I understand why it did.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Stephen, what do you
suspect the government knows

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.370 align:middle line:84%
about the
extraterrestrial presence?

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.860 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: A lot.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.480 align:middle line:10%
They've known about
the ET presence

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.320 align:middle line:10%
since the-- probably the Foo
Fighter events of World War II.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.140 align:middle line:10%
And there's some evidence,
maybe, even before that,

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.340 align:middle line:10%
going back into the
very late 1930s.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.220 align:middle line:84%
They were certainly
aware by early '47.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.190 align:middle line:84%
They had a crash
vehicle and bodies

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.020 align:middle line:84%
and a living alien turn
up in the Roswell area

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.880 align:middle line:90%
in July of '47.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.115 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot right there.

00:05:03.115 --> 00:05:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
from then, they've

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.230 align:middle line:84%
been engaging the issue
with all their might

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.680 align:middle line:84%
and all their resources in
deep secrecy for 67 years.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.687 align:middle line:84%
I assure you, they
know a huge amount.

00:05:14.687 --> 00:05:16.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isn't it
amazing that they've

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.789 align:middle line:84%
been able to keep a lid
on this for so long?

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:21.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: I've said
many times, it's

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.510 align:middle line:84%
the most extraordinary
manipulation

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.460 align:middle line:84%
of public perception in
the history of humanity.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.220 align:middle line:84%
Look, propaganda and governments
lying to their people--

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They do
it all the time.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: They do
it all the time.

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:32.000 align:middle line:90%
Goes back forever.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.170 align:middle line:84%
But you go back a
few thousand years,

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.030 align:middle line:84%
and it's the king
and his court lying

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.830 align:middle line:84%
to a bunch of poor peasants
that can't read or write.

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.350 align:middle line:84%
They have had to contain
this issue for 67 years

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.180 align:middle line:84%
with a highly educated
public, with increasing,

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.200 align:middle line:84%
multiplying media,
in a country that

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.600 align:middle line:84%
has some pretty good laws
about freedom of speech

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.600 align:middle line:84%
and everything else and
freedom of the press,

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.780 align:middle line:90%
and pulled it off.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.080 align:middle line:84%
It was an amazing
accomplishment.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Catholic church was
able to suppress the Copernican

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.135 align:middle line:90%
Revolution for about 200 years.

00:06:03.135 --> 00:06:05.510 align:middle line:84%
But they weren't up against
what our government's been up

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:06.880 align:middle line:90%
against since '47.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.770 align:middle line:90%
And so I applaud them.

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:09.510 align:middle line:90%
It was great.

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.230 align:middle line:90%
But it needs to end.

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.247 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
they afraid of?

00:06:14.247 --> 00:06:16.705 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Look, fundamentally,
it's all national security.

00:06:16.705 --> 00:06:19.420 align:middle line:90%


00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.930 align:middle line:84%
All of this started
in '47, pretty much.

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.394 align:middle line:84%
That's the big explosion
of the modern era because

00:06:25.394 --> 00:06:26.810 align:middle line:84%
of all the sightings
that emerged.

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.080 align:middle line:10%
Kenneth Arnold's
the most famous.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.080 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They
couldn't hide that.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.996 align:middle line:10%
>>BASSETT: Yeah, thousands
all over the world.

00:06:30.996 --> 00:06:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And this is happening
while they're

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.470 align:middle line:84%
completing the work on
their hydrogen bomb.

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.928 align:middle line:84%
They know the Soviets are going
to be testing the atom bomb

00:06:36.928 --> 00:06:38.730 align:middle line:90%
soon, their own hydrogen bomb.

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:41.060 align:middle line:84%
They know they have
a major foe there.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:42.990 align:middle line:84%
There's an Iron
Curtain across Europe.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure the national
security analysts were assuming

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.117 align:middle line:84%
that the Second World
War, as all wars do,

00:06:50.117 --> 00:06:52.200 align:middle line:84%
had already set the stage
for the Third World War.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.000 align:middle line:84%
But this would be a
nuclear world war.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.390 align:middle line:84%
This is kind of a big problem
that they were facing.

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.631 align:middle line:84%
And these are very important,
powerful, intelligent men,

00:06:59.631 --> 00:07:02.130 align:middle line:84%
pretty much all men, that were
running the national security

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.000 align:middle line:90%
structures.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, they've
got a crashed vehicle,

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.195 align:middle line:90%
alien technology, and bodies.

00:07:07.195 --> 00:07:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And they've got sightings
all over the world.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:09.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Put in their lap.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:11.864 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: In the lap,
in the middle of this.

00:07:11.864 --> 00:07:12.560 align:middle line:90%
And so what?

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.570 align:middle line:84%
They're going to just run right
out and say, oh, yeah, yeah,

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:15.530 align:middle line:90%
there's aliens here, too.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know what
Stalin's going to do.

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we're going
to have a nuclear war?

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.490 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.550 align:middle line:90%
So they had to contain this.

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:21.870 align:middle line:90%
And initially, it wasn't easy.

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:23.710 align:middle line:90%
And they made a lot of mistakes.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:25.510 align:middle line:84%
But they got better
and better at it,

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:29.050 align:middle line:84%
until they knew more
about this ET reality

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:30.880 align:middle line:84%
and they knew more
where this situation was

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.930 align:middle line:84%
going to go with
the Soviet Union.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.220 align:middle line:84%
Totally understandable
and totally legal,

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:38.740 align:middle line:84%
which is why I have
discontinued the use

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:40.236 align:middle line:90%
in my world of a cover-up.

00:07:40.236 --> 00:07:41.110 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a cover-up.

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:42.200 align:middle line:90%
It was a truth embargo.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.930 align:middle line:90%
It was a policy of containment.

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:45.820 align:middle line:90%
It was legal.

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:50.269 align:middle line:84%
Did they know that we weren't
going to have a World War III,

00:07:50.269 --> 00:07:51.810 align:middle line:84%
but we were going
to have a Cold War,

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:54.130 align:middle line:84%
and it was going to last 44
years and cost $10 trillion?

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:54.400 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.375 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know that.

00:07:55.375 --> 00:07:56.041 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No way.

00:07:56.041 --> 00:07:59.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: And so as the Cold
War develops and got worse year

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:03.750 align:middle line:84%
after year, the national
security issue was paramount.

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.830 align:middle line:84%
And so anybody inside would
raise their hand and say,

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:09.370 align:middle line:84%
maybe it's time to tell the
people about those ET things

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:10.370 align:middle line:90%
that we're dealing with?

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:11.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And somebody
would say, no, no.

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:12.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: And they'd say,
are you out of your mind?

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And so the fact is
that, by the time

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:18.340 align:middle line:84%
the Cold War finally
ends in late '91,

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:21.480 align:middle line:84%
the truth embargo, which they
had worked so assiduously

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.880 align:middle line:84%
to develop, was
institutionalized.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.610 align:middle line:90%
It basically ran itself.

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:28.260 align:middle line:90%
It was part of our culture.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:29.247 align:middle line:90%
You didn't cover that.

00:08:29.247 --> 00:08:30.080 align:middle line:90%
You didn't say that.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:30.825 align:middle line:90%
You didn't go there.

00:08:30.825 --> 00:08:31.829 align:middle line:90%
You didn't speak that.

00:08:31.829 --> 00:08:32.870 align:middle line:90%
You didn't say that word.

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:34.220 align:middle line:90%
It was just understood.

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:34.970 align:middle line:90%
Too awkward.

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And there wasn't a
compelling reason

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:40.820 align:middle line:84%
do it, because, by and
large, in the lives of most

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.580 align:middle line:84%
Americans, the presence
of extraterrestrials

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.800 align:middle line:84%
doesn't really mean anything
to them on a day-to-day basis.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.330 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't affect their lives.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And so the truth
embargo, since '91,

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:55.010 align:middle line:84%
has been pretty much moving
forward on sheer momentum,

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:59.590 align:middle line:84%
though they're still doing a lot
to keep things under control.

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:01.860 align:middle line:84%
But that momentum
is running out.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And the ability to maintain the
embargo is also running out.

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:08.284 align:middle line:84%
So it's near the end, I
believe, of its life span.

00:09:08.284 --> 00:09:09.700 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: When I
think back, Steve,

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.220 align:middle line:10%
to the '60s, when
I was a little boy,

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:15.360 align:middle line:10%
and I was into UFOs
even at that time,

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:19.070 align:middle line:10%
ever since my mother brought
home this book by Walter

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:22.120 align:middle line:10%
Sullivan, who was the then "New
York Times" science editor,

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.180 align:middle line:10%
"We Are Not Alone,"
and then "Look"

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:27.050 align:middle line:10%
magazine did its
"Interrupted Journey"

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:28.890 align:middle line:10%
spread on Betty
and Barney Hill--

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:29.010 align:middle line:10%
>>BASSETT: I read that.

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:31.135 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --the abduction
case out of New Hampshire,

00:09:31.135 --> 00:09:32.380 align:middle line:90%
I was hooked.

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:38.890 align:middle line:84%
But it seemed, at that
time, that society

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:44.140 align:middle line:84%
seemed to handle UFO stories
a little better than they

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.470 align:middle line:90%
do today.

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:49.230 align:middle line:84%
You're one of the rare
breeds that keeps this alive.

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:52.500 align:middle line:84%
But heck, I remember
people like Frank Edwards

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.900 align:middle line:84%
writing his incredible
books on UFOs.

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:59.385 align:middle line:84%
I remember Project Blue
Book and J. Allen Hynek

00:09:59.385 --> 00:10:01.504 align:middle line:84%
and the seriousness
of investigating--

00:10:01.504 --> 00:10:02.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Sure.

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:04.545 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --even though it may
have been a cover-up there.

00:10:04.545 --> 00:10:07.310 align:middle line:84%
But it just seemed
like the media

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:13.250 align:middle line:84%
and the people really seemed to
be into UFO reports and stories

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:14.900 align:middle line:90%
back in the '60s and '70s.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.594 align:middle line:90%
Then it seemed to die away.

00:10:16.594 --> 00:10:17.260 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Yeah.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.840 align:middle line:84%
Look, if you were to examine
the whole history of the truth

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.950 align:middle line:84%
embargo, going back to
'47, you can divide it up

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:24.490 align:middle line:90%
into kind of sections.

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:28.250 align:middle line:84%
The way things were going--
being conducted, say, from '47

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:32.190 align:middle line:84%
to '67-- actually, '69,
when they closed down

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:33.690 align:middle line:90%
Blue Book-- was one era.

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And then, from '69 to '91
is another, and '91 forward.

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:39.850 align:middle line:84%
In the early days,
the truth embargo

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:41.460 align:middle line:90%
took awhile to put together.

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:43.780 align:middle line:84%
This was not
something easy to do.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:47.250 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they were kind of lazy
about it between '47 and '52.

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:48.547 align:middle line:90%
They had things under control.

00:10:48.547 --> 00:10:50.130 align:middle line:84%
They had changed the
story at Roswell.

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:51.630 align:middle line:90%
Everything was fine.

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:53.450 align:middle line:10%
And then, of course,
the ETs started

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:55.677 align:middle line:10%
turning up over
Washington in July of '52,

00:10:55.677 --> 00:10:56.926 align:middle line:10%
and that scared them to death.

00:10:56.926 --> 00:10:58.020 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: '52, huge story.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.728 align:middle line:10%
>>BASSETT: They held
the Robertson Panel,

00:10:59.728 --> 00:11:02.220 align:middle line:10%
reanalyzed everything, and
then got really serious.

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:06.030 align:middle line:10%
But in those days, you had Helen
Cotter on the board of NICAP,

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:10.702 align:middle line:10%
you had top scientists being--
hearing lectures from Dr. James

00:11:10.702 --> 00:11:12.860 align:middle line:10%
McDonnell all over the country.

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.210 align:middle line:84%
So it was in a
kind of transition

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:17.400 align:middle line:84%
where the embargo was
starting to be put together.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.816 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, plenty
of serious people were going,

00:11:19.816 --> 00:11:21.050 align:middle line:90%
this needs to be examined.

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the government
wanted that serious to stop

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.380 align:middle line:84%
and for their
program to continue.

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:29.590 align:middle line:84%
So in those days,
it was different.

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And it could very well
have gone the other way.

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:34.270 align:middle line:84%
It's possible that
the truth embargo

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:35.797 align:middle line:90%
could have ended by '69.

00:11:35.797 --> 00:11:36.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right then.

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.045 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: But it didn't happen.

00:11:39.045 --> 00:11:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And there's something else that
was very different back then.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.830 align:middle line:84%
This may be hard for you to
remember, but try very hard.

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:51.730 align:middle line:84%
Back then, particularly, I
think, between certainly 1947

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:56.310 align:middle line:84%
and 1962, '63, people
trusted their government.

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:57.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They did.

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:58.100 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Do you remember that?

00:11:58.100 --> 00:11:59.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Until
Kennedy was killed--

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:00.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Very vague, I know.

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:01.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --people
trusted their government.

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:02.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: I recall it.

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:03.540 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they trusted the
government, actually

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:04.790 align:middle line:90%
at a pretty high level.

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:08.089 align:middle line:84%
And if the government
was doing something,

00:12:08.089 --> 00:12:10.130 align:middle line:84%
you accepted that, you'd
try to go along with it,

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:11.590 align:middle line:90%
you'd try to be supportive.

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:13.140 align:middle line:90%
Now, that ship has sailed.

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:16.830 align:middle line:84%
But that made it
much easier for them

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:20.010 align:middle line:84%
to maintain this-- to develop
the basis for this embargo

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:21.410 align:middle line:90%
and get it underway.

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:22.667 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:12:22.667 --> 00:12:23.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Totally opposite.

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:25.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: --67 years
later, trust in government's

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:25.820 align:middle line:90%
collapsed.

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:26.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's gone.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: We're in
another world now.

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:33.477 align:middle line:84%
And so they could never
have started and maintained

00:12:33.477 --> 00:12:36.060 align:middle line:84%
the truth embargo they launched
back then in this environment.

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm not sure, if
the government came out

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:41.480 align:middle line:84%
today and said,
we've been visited,

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.894 align:middle line:84%
people would believe
them anymore.

00:12:43.894 --> 00:12:45.060 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Well, all right--

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:47.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because we
doubt everything.

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: That's
an irony, isn't it?

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:48.520 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:49.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is.

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:52.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: But the fact is is
that it's not like they're just

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:58.220 align:middle line:84%
going to send out a memo
and do nothing else.

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:01.370 align:middle line:84%
If the disclosure event,
which we've talked about,

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:03.380 align:middle line:84%
which is the formal
acknowledgement of ET

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:07.640 align:middle line:84%
presence-- it's not a process;
it's the event, capital D,

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.500 align:middle line:84%
it will be done with
a lot of splash.

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.465 align:middle line:84%
There will be evidence
provided, material

00:13:12.465 --> 00:13:14.555 align:middle line:84%
that maybe our researchers
don't even have.

00:13:14.555 --> 00:13:16.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gosh, but they're
going to have to explain

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:17.610 align:middle line:90%
the deception--

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:18.190 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: That's later.

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:18.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --over all these years.

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:19.020 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: That's later.

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:21.165 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about getting the
fundamental issue out there.

00:13:21.165 --> 00:13:22.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they're just
going to announce it first.

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:22.930 align:middle line:90%
And when they do--

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:24.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: And they're going
to provide the evidence.

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:27.052 align:middle line:84%
And I can assure you that, in
this case, particularly given

00:13:27.052 --> 00:13:29.260 align:middle line:84%
how much has already been
accomplished by the citizen

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.117 align:middle line:84%
science and the
activists-- we've

00:13:31.117 --> 00:13:32.700 align:middle line:84%
built up a massive
amount of evidence.

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:34.012 align:middle line:90%
The people are already there.

00:13:34.012 --> 00:13:36.470 align:middle line:84%
So when the government finally
says the ETs are really here

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:39.630 align:middle line:84%
and acknowledges it, they are
actually going to believe that.

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And this is why this activism
gets really important,

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.980 align:middle line:84%
because, when you have
a situation this bad,

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:50.760 align:middle line:84%
when you have
multi-system dysfunction

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:53.790 align:middle line:84%
across your whole society,
where everything is coming apart

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:55.880 align:middle line:84%
and people are
starting to-- when

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:57.880 align:middle line:84%
one of the lead shows
in reality right

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:03.430 align:middle line:84%
now is "Preppers," people that
are preparing for the end,

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:08.710 align:middle line:84%
and at the core of that is
an institutionalized distrust

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:11.560 align:middle line:84%
from the people, a break
of the social contract,

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.847 align:middle line:84%
there is only one way
you fix that, George.

00:14:13.847 --> 00:14:15.430 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing
if you have a kid.

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:17.471 align:middle line:84%
If you have a teenager
and he's been lying to you

00:14:17.471 --> 00:14:19.770 align:middle line:84%
or she's been lying to
you for a couple of years,

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:22.360 align:middle line:84%
and the relationship
is being destroyed,

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.900 align:middle line:84%
there is only one
way that gets fixed.

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:27.760 align:middle line:84%
The child has to start telling
the truth to the parent,

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:28.670 align:middle line:90%
and vice versa.

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:30.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's going to
take you time to believe them.

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:32.180 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: And they have to do
it not once, but twice, many

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:32.680 align:middle line:90%
times.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:33.750 align:middle line:90%
That is the only way.

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:36.550 align:middle line:10%
Now, interestingly
enough, Washington, DC,

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:38.560 align:middle line:10%
in its infinite
wisdom, as it started

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.890 align:middle line:10%
to confront this
emerging problem

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:45.130 align:middle line:10%
of institutionalized lying
and a collapse of trust,

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:48.410 align:middle line:10%
got together and
said, we have got

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:52.460 align:middle line:10%
to make a concerted
effort to lie better.

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:56.410 align:middle line:84%
If we could lie better, we
could get them back on our side.

00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:58.020 align:middle line:90%
Wrong.

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:01.290 align:middle line:84%
So what happens if
we are successful

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:03.290 align:middle line:84%
and the government finally
essentially announces

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:06.230 align:middle line:84%
the most profound
truth in human history?

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:07.870 align:middle line:90%
You know what's going to happen?

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:10.950 align:middle line:84%
They're going to get such
positive feedback from hundreds

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:12.820 align:middle line:84%
of millions of people
around the world.

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:16.210 align:middle line:84%
They're going to send them
congratulation notes and stuff.

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:18.980 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
say, they like us.

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:21.976 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It may build government
credibility back up again.

00:15:21.976 --> 00:15:23.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: It
starts the process.

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:25.726 align:middle line:84%
And once you get that going,
sort of like, you know,

00:15:25.726 --> 00:15:27.180 align:middle line:84%
you tell the truth,
they like you.

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:28.140 align:middle line:90%
Let's tell them more truths.

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:28.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:29.340 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: They'll
like us even more.

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:30.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is fun.

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Now, this
sounds kind of silly.

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:33.480 align:middle line:90%
But it's not silly.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:36.940 align:middle line:84%
There is only one way
back from where we are.

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:40.520 align:middle line:84%
The government, the president,
the Congress, the corporations,

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:43.910 align:middle line:84%
the IMF, the Fed, all
of these institutions,

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:47.830 align:middle line:84%
have got to start telling the
truth about the way things are,

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:49.940 align:middle line:90%
even if it's bad.

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:53.510 align:middle line:84%
You know, if they had told us
the truth about the emerging

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:57.070 align:middle line:84%
financial debacles that we
were headed towards in 2008,

00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:58.622 align:middle line:84%
about the situation
with the housing,

00:15:58.622 --> 00:16:00.330 align:middle line:84%
with the derivatives
and everything else,

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:02.750 align:middle line:84%
we would have been upset,
but the American people

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:04.960 align:middle line:84%
might have gotten
together and started

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:08.410 align:middle line:84%
pressing for
solutions, for reform.

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And we might have gotten some
help and some solutions there

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:14.590 align:middle line:84%
and wouldn't had
this catastrophe.

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:18.362 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't know you've
got cancer, how do you cure it?

00:16:18.362 --> 00:16:20.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's going to
be a lot a work, though.

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:24.490 align:middle line:84%
Even the 9/11 situation,
whether you believe it was just

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:28.860 align:middle line:84%
these fundamentalists that did
it or government was involved,

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:31.624 align:middle line:84%
it's going to take a long time
to build up this faith again.

00:16:31.624 --> 00:16:32.290 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Yeah.

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:35.150 align:middle line:84%
That's a really
particularly sticky wicket.

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:37.570 align:middle line:84%
One of the nice things
about the truth embargo

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:40.379 align:middle line:84%
is that there is so much
positive associated with it.

00:16:40.379 --> 00:16:42.420 align:middle line:84%
There's not a lot of
positive with the government

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:44.040 align:middle line:84%
finally coming out
and saying, here's

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.370 align:middle line:90%
the real truth about 911.

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Mostly, there are just a lot
of indictments and prison

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:48.420 align:middle line:90%
sentences.

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:51.189 align:middle line:84%
But with the case
of the ET issue,

00:16:51.189 --> 00:16:53.230 align:middle line:84%
the announcement of the
extraterrestrial presence

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:57.140 align:middle line:84%
opens up a vast array
of new possibilities

00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:58.150 align:middle line:90%
for the human race.

00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:59.220 align:middle line:90%
This is positive.

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:00.490 align:middle line:90%
This is extraordinary.

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:04.710 align:middle line:84%
So this upside is what I think
makes this the one to go.

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:07.130 align:middle line:84%
If you want to tell a big
truth and start getting back

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:08.797 align:middle line:84%
in the truth business,
pick this one

00:17:08.797 --> 00:17:10.630 align:middle line:84%
if you're inside
government, because there's

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:13.710 align:middle line:84%
so much upside that it
will mitigate the downside.

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:16.306 align:middle line:84%
And there's plenty of that,
plenty of explaining to do.

00:17:16.306 --> 00:17:17.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it's exciting.

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:18.420 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Oh, god, yes.

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:19.069 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's exciting.

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:20.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Is there
anything more exciting?

00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:22.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It opens up
science and technology.

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:25.950 align:middle line:84%
Of course, people are going to
start asking for free energy.

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:27.681 align:middle line:84%
If they can do
it, what about us?

00:17:27.681 --> 00:17:28.930 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Of course they are.

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to
get it, hopefully.

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:33.650 align:middle line:84%
It won't be free, but
it'll be damn cheap.

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:36.250 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
aside from the fact

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:38.210 align:middle line:84%
the disclosure could
lead to contact--

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:40.010 align:middle line:84%
and I don't mean
covert contact; I

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:42.760 align:middle line:84%
mean open contact-- there's
plenty of contact going on,

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.870 align:middle line:90%
George, but it's not on CNN.

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:47.022 align:middle line:90%
It's in people's bedrooms.

00:17:47.022 --> 00:17:47.980 align:middle line:90%
That's another problem.

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:49.229 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's another issue.

00:17:49.229 --> 00:17:50.335 align:middle line:90%
We'll address that later.

00:17:50.335 --> 00:17:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: If it
leads to open contact,

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.500 align:middle line:84%
that theoretically could lead
to technology exchange that

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:55.500 align:middle line:90%
could be transformative.

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.410 align:middle line:84%
But even without that,
there's enough in our labs

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:01.570 align:middle line:84%
right now that they've
spent billions developing,

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:03.550 align:middle line:84%
researching,
re-engineering, which

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:06.985 align:middle line:84%
they have to hold close,
because truth embargo, right?

00:18:06.985 --> 00:18:08.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can't announce it.

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:09.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: No way they could
come out and say, guess what?

00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:11.840 align:middle line:84%
We have figured out
antigravitic drive.

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:12.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:13.970 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: And we have craft.

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:15.387 align:middle line:84%
But it has nothing
to do with ETs.

00:18:15.387 --> 00:18:16.678 align:middle line:90%
No one's going to believe that.

00:18:16.678 --> 00:18:18.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You remember
these computer chips?

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:20.239 align:middle line:90%
Guess where they came from.

00:18:20.239 --> 00:18:22.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: So they know
they can't do that.

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And so they have to
hang onto the technology

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:25.579 align:middle line:90%
until the truth embargo ends.

00:18:25.579 --> 00:18:27.120 align:middle line:84%
But they won't end
the truth embargo.

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:30.290 align:middle line:84%
And so we're all wrapped--
it's a giant Gordian Knot.

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And the advocacy movement's
job is to do what Alexander did

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:37.350 align:middle line:90%
and cut that knot, just cut it.

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And you cut it by just
saying, yes, there's

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.640 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrials here.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.475 align:middle line:84%
And could you give
us a couple of weeks

00:18:43.475 --> 00:18:45.400 align:middle line:84%
before the next
press conference?

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:48.620 align:middle line:84%
We need to get our
information in order.

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:50.140 align:middle line:90%
That's kind of what's going on.

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:53.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Stephen,
let's go back to 1947.

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And also, you have looked
at three major UFO cases

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:04.240 align:middle line:84%
that you believe may be at
the top of the truth embargo--

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:07.950 align:middle line:84%
Roswell, Rendlesham
in the United Kingdom,

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:09.440 align:middle line:90%
and the Phoenix Lights.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:12.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Well, they
are three very powerful,

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:15.490 align:middle line:84%
well-known examples
in which the cat

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:18.330 align:middle line:84%
was trying to get out
of the bag, no question.

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:19.480 align:middle line:90%
So they're important.

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So '47, Roswell.

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:25.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Well,
Roswell is the event.

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:28.499 align:middle line:84%
It is the best known, probably
most significant event.

00:19:28.499 --> 00:19:30.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, it may not be
the most important

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.790 align:middle line:90%
in terms of other factors.

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:35.180 align:middle line:84%
But it is the event where the
average person, even around

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.457 align:middle line:84%
the world, has
connected to this issue,

00:19:37.457 --> 00:19:39.040 align:middle line:84%
so much so they have
a festival there.

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:42.630 align:middle line:84%
People go in the
thousands every year.

00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:44.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: 67 years
now, this year.

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.730 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: 67 years.

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:49.667 align:middle line:90%
And it has everything.

00:19:49.667 --> 00:19:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Of course, several movies
have been done about it.

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:53.124 align:middle line:84%
And there'll be
more movies done.

00:19:53.124 --> 00:19:55.960 align:middle line:84%
But essentially,
a vehicle crashes.

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:58.650 align:middle line:90%
And it crashes near Roswell.

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:01.650 align:middle line:90%
Civilians get there first.

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:03.030 align:middle line:90%
Some people are contacted.

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:04.420 align:middle line:90%
It's '47.

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:07.420 align:middle line:84%
Even though it's the only
nuclear air base in the world,

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:11.760 align:middle line:84%
it hasn't probably been fully
briefed on the whole ET thing.

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:15.450 align:middle line:84%
In other words, while they
may have known before '47

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:17.549 align:middle line:84%
that this ET thing
is real, that doesn't

00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:19.340 align:middle line:84%
mean they're sending
out memos to everybody

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:22.540 align:middle line:90%
in the Army and the Navy.

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:25.310 align:middle line:84%
So a press release gets put
out, the famous press release

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:26.980 align:middle line:84%
announcing that they
found this saucer.

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:28.786 align:middle line:90%
The headline is now a legend.

00:20:28.786 --> 00:20:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's in the Roswell
newspaper at the time.

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:33.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Pristine copies
of that original paper

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:35.950 align:middle line:90%
sell for some serious dollars.

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:41.580 align:middle line:10%
Well, of course, this
catches the political class

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:43.694 align:middle line:10%
by surprise, Truman, of course.

00:20:43.694 --> 00:20:45.360 align:middle line:10%
They were-- oh, my
god, what's happened?

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:48.510 align:middle line:84%
So they send an order,
almost certainly from Truman,

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:50.730 align:middle line:84%
to Roger Ramey -- you
have got to fix that.

00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:52.440 align:middle line:90%
They fixed it the same day.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:55.840 align:middle line:84%
They pulled some people
into Dallas-Fort Worth.

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.490 align:middle line:84%
They hold another
press conference.

00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:59.920 align:middle line:84%
They hold up a raw wind
balloon and say, no, it

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.560 align:middle line:90%
was a raw wind balloon.

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:02.820 align:middle line:90%
We mistook it.

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:06.035 align:middle line:84%
Now, again, if that
had been done today,

00:21:06.035 --> 00:21:09.060 align:middle line:84%
if they had been trying
to pull that stunt today,

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:10.445 align:middle line:84%
a million bloggers
who would have

00:21:10.445 --> 00:21:11.570 align:middle line:90%
rained down hell upon them.

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:13.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The social network
would have crushed them.

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:14.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Yes.

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the media
probably would have.

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.651 align:middle line:10%
>>BASSETT: You're saying that
your intelligence officer

00:21:17.651 --> 00:21:21.587 align:middle line:10%
mistook the silver saucer
craft for this Reynolds Wrap?

00:21:21.587 --> 00:21:23.170 align:middle line:10%
Is that what you're
trying to tell me?

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:25.935 align:middle line:10%
But back then,
remember, it was '47.

00:21:25.935 --> 00:21:28.840 align:middle line:84%
And people believed
in this government

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:30.770 align:middle line:84%
that had defeated
the Axis powers, that

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:32.730 align:middle line:84%
was building this
wonderful economy at home.

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:34.590 align:middle line:90%
They believed them.

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And so that is, for me,
the informal beginning

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:39.060 align:middle line:90%
of the truth embargo.

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And one of the interesting
things about it

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:44.860 align:middle line:84%
is that the moment
that first headline

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:48.800 align:middle line:84%
goes out over the Reuters
AP, whatever, reporters were

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.234 align:middle line:84%
getting into trains
and planes and cars,

00:21:51.234 --> 00:21:52.650 align:middle line:84%
and they were
heading for Roswell.

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:52.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were
coming this way.

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:54.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: They
were on their way.

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:55.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: And if somehow
things had not gotten together

00:21:57.830 --> 00:22:01.950 align:middle line:84%
quickly enough, and Ramey
had needed another 24 hours,

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:03.750 align:middle line:84%
and those press had
gotten and started

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:06.244 align:middle line:84%
interviewing the
people in the town,

00:22:06.244 --> 00:22:07.410 align:middle line:90%
it would've been out in '47.

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:08.534 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my gosh, yeah.

00:22:08.534 --> 00:22:11.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: The ET presence
would have been known in '47.

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:15.949 align:middle line:84%
And somebody is going to write
a book-- probably not me,

00:22:15.949 --> 00:22:17.240 align:middle line:90%
because I don't sit still well.

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:19.390 align:middle line:84%
But it'll be somebody,
maybe Richard Dolan.

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And it'll be a book about what
the 20th century's second half

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:26.950 align:middle line:84%
would have been like if the ET
announcement had occurred then

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:28.320 align:middle line:90%
as opposed to not yet now.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:28.945 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:22:28.945 --> 00:22:30.426 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't back down.

00:22:30.426 --> 00:22:31.925 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: It could
have been awful.

00:22:31.925 --> 00:22:33.175 align:middle line:90%
It could have been a disaster.

00:22:33.175 --> 00:22:34.750 align:middle line:84%
It could have led
to nuclear war.

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:37.270 align:middle line:84%
Or it could have
avoided the Cold War.

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:39.860 align:middle line:84%
It could have
transformed the society.

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:41.950 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't have spent
15, 20 trillion dollars

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:45.190 align:middle line:84%
on the whole Cold War
thing and the proxy wars.

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:48.649 align:middle line:84%
That money could have gone to
develop the human condition.

00:22:48.649 --> 00:22:49.940 align:middle line:90%
That would be a hell of a book.

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:51.904 align:middle line:84%
But that's why that
event is so profound.

00:22:51.904 --> 00:22:53.820 align:middle line:84%
That is the beginning,
the informal beginning,

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:55.150 align:middle line:90%
of the truth embargo.

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:57.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Rendlesham.

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.550 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that.

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:00.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Rendlesham,
another case

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:02.690 align:middle line:84%
in which an incident takes
place near a facility that's

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:04.640 align:middle line:90%
nuclear connected.

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:09.270 align:middle line:90%
It happens 33 years later.

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:10.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Americans are there.

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:11.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Oh,
Americans are involved,

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.481 align:middle line:90%
the British are involved.

00:23:12.481 --> 00:23:16.210 align:middle line:84%
It's an extraordinary
event, many witnesses.

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:19.530 align:middle line:90%
Recordings, notes, and so forth.

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:24.970 align:middle line:10%
So this had a lot of
substance in a time

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.100 align:middle line:10%
when the media was
far more developed.

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And so Rendlesham, the
Bentwaters case, all of that

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:32.490 align:middle line:84%
had the potential to
maybe blow this issue out.

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:34.840 align:middle line:10%
But on the other hand, by
1980, the truth embargo

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:36.920 align:middle line:10%
was well established.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:39.600 align:middle line:84%
All the bells and
whistles were in place,

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.910 align:middle line:84%
the media was pretty
much under control.

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And so they got through
Rendlesham Forest.

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:48.570 align:middle line:84%
But the reason it's so
important is it never went away.

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:49.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And
incredible witnesses.

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:51.266 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Books were
written, most of the witnesses

00:23:51.266 --> 00:23:54.230 align:middle line:90%
are still alive.

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:58.140 align:middle line:84%
It's turning up in a
number of forums, so--

00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:01.960 align:middle line:84%
and that case is easier to
revisit than Roswell now.

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And so Bentwaters is
certainly a significant threat

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:07.260 align:middle line:90%
to the truth embargo.

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:09.065 align:middle line:84%
And something could
emerge out of that

00:24:09.065 --> 00:24:10.852 align:middle line:90%
that could help end this--

00:24:10.852 --> 00:24:13.185 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Incredible story,
what they witnessed out there

00:24:13.185 --> 00:24:15.050 align:middle line:90%
in the forest.

00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:15.980 align:middle line:90%
And it took off.

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:17.465 align:middle line:84%
They got close
enough to touch it.

00:24:17.465 --> 00:24:18.090 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Yes.

00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:19.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They got sick.

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:20.200 align:middle line:90%
It's got it all.

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:21.991 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: You know
what I love about this?

00:24:21.991 --> 00:24:24.080 align:middle line:84%
Again, tried and
true methods, right?

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.550 align:middle line:84%
But these methods become more
ludicrous with each passing

00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:27.580 align:middle line:90%
decade.

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:30.350 align:middle line:84%
As you know, the Army
Air Force, the Air Force

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:32.660 align:middle line:84%
have come up with three
explanations for Roswell.

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:34.030 align:middle line:84%
Every 10 years or 15 years,
they would change it.

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:35.613 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right, they
keep changing it.

00:24:35.613 --> 00:24:37.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: The last one
was the Mogul balloon,

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:39.950 align:middle line:84%
which doesn't help
the credibility.

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:42.000 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing
with Bentwaters.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.800 align:middle line:84%
Debunkers jumped in, of
course, doing their thing.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.931 align:middle line:84%
And I think the very first
one was the lighthouse.

00:24:47.931 --> 00:24:49.180 align:middle line:90%
They did the lighthouse thing.

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:50.049 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:24:50.049 --> 00:24:52.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: And then there
was a thing-- no, there

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:53.960 align:middle line:84%
was-- I think it
was a number of guys

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.509 align:middle line:84%
were out, driving
around in cars.

00:24:55.509 --> 00:24:58.050 align:middle line:84%
And they were just having a good
time, and it was car lights.

00:24:58.050 --> 00:24:59.633 align:middle line:84%
But the one I love
the most-- and this

00:24:59.633 --> 00:25:03.630 align:middle line:84%
came out about three
years ago, made a story

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:10.140 align:middle line:84%
in the British press-- a farmer
came forward and stated that,

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:13.250 align:middle line:84%
on the night of these events,
that he had a fertilizer

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:16.200 align:middle line:84%
truck that he was moving,
and the thing caught on fire.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And so what they were seeing
was flaming fertilizer.

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:19.164 align:middle line:90%
I kid you not.

00:25:19.164 --> 00:25:20.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unbelievable.

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:21.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: And so
in other words,

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:22.770 align:middle line:90%
things haven't really changed.

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:24.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Talk about the manure
they've thrown our way, right?

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:27.544 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Yeah, major events,
unbelievable explanations.

00:25:27.544 --> 00:25:28.710 align:middle line:90%
The people go along with it.

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:30.126 align:middle line:84%
The press are to
go along with it,

00:25:30.126 --> 00:25:31.650 align:middle line:90%
because it's institutionalized.

00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:33.660 align:middle line:84%
But yet-- and this
is where the internet

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:38.110 align:middle line:84%
comes in-- all this
ludicrousness used to just fade

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:40.105 align:middle line:84%
into the background
in the old days.

00:25:40.105 --> 00:25:40.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not anymore.

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:42.000 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: Not anymore.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.620 align:middle line:84%
You want to make a
stupid explanation?

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:44.250 align:middle line:90%
Fine.

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:46.922 align:middle line:84%
It will live on the internet
until the day you die.

00:25:46.922 --> 00:25:47.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:51.540 align:middle line:84%
1997, Phoenix-- an
incredible story,

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:55.280 align:middle line:84%
where even the governor at
the time made a mockery of it

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:56.630 align:middle line:90%
and changed his mind.

00:25:56.630 --> 00:26:00.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Another major event,
all the same kind of patterns.

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:05.060 align:middle line:84%
But now it's '97, the beginning
of the internet explosion

00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:07.830 align:middle line:84%
and email and everything else
and, of course, cable news.

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:09.730 align:middle line:10%
So now you have
an event happening

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:14.170 align:middle line:10%
in an even more intense,
rich environment.

00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:16.650 align:middle line:10%
The challenge was formidable.

00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:20.850 align:middle line:10%
So this event, of
course, got huge press.

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:22.050 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: A lot of witnesses.

00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:22.720 align:middle line:10%
>>BASSETT: A lot of witnesses.

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:23.070 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: A lot of witnesses.

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:24.480 align:middle line:10%
>>BASSETT: Tons of witnesses.

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.305 align:middle line:10%
There were two events, though,
one in the early evening,

00:26:26.305 --> 00:26:27.140 align:middle line:10%
one in the late evening.

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:29.190 align:middle line:84%
Late evening was the
lights seen over the city.

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:31.870 align:middle line:90%


00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:36.840 align:middle line:84%
The government, first of all,
denied that anything was there.

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:38.724 align:middle line:84%
They denied that any
jets were in the area.

00:26:38.724 --> 00:26:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And then, later, they
realized, wait a minute.

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:41.440 align:middle line:90%
That's not going to work.

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And so they came back
and said, oh, yeah,

00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:43.400 align:middle line:90%
there were jets in the area.

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:44.430 align:middle line:90%
They were dropping flares.

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:45.290 align:middle line:90%
They used the flare.

00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:50.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, the flare explanation,
I think, has been debunked.

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:51.550 align:middle line:90%
I don't think it was flares.

00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:55.910 align:middle line:84%
But it was a fairly
compelling option.

00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:57.140 align:middle line:90%
So they did all that.

00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:59.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But why do
flares fly in unison?

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:00.710 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: A good question.

00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:04.470 align:middle line:84%
But they had no explanation
for the huge triangle that

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:06.050 align:middle line:90%
flew across the entire state--

00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:06.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That they all saw.

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:08.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: --from the north
to the south and then east,

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.469 align:middle line:84%
that was seen by
a lot of people.

00:27:10.469 --> 00:27:11.760 align:middle line:90%
That one they couldn't explain.

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.140 align:middle line:90%
So they said nothing.

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:15.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's where
Frances Barwood comes in.

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:17.605 align:middle line:10%
She jumps into the
middle of this.

00:27:17.605 --> 00:27:21.780 align:middle line:10%
She's kind of a bit of a rogue,
independent member of the city

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:22.280 align:middle line:10%
council.

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.290 align:middle line:10%
I think she was even
the chairman of council.

00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:26.100 align:middle line:84%
And she decided,
I'm not buying this.

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And so she jumps into this,
which brings the press back in.

00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:30.890 align:middle line:90%
That made it a political story.

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:33.770 align:middle line:84%
That expanded the whole
impact of Phoenix.

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:37.650 align:middle line:10%
But ultimately, you have people
like the former governor--

00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:38.650 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Fife Symington.

00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:43.800 align:middle line:10%
>>BASSETT: --Fife Symington III,
who did something very brave.

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:45.975 align:middle line:10%
In an interview many years
later-- this was 2007,

00:27:45.975 --> 00:27:48.856 align:middle line:10%
'08-- he came forward
and said, look,

00:27:48.856 --> 00:27:49.980 align:middle line:10%
I'm sorry I made fun of it.

00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:52.675 align:middle line:10%
I was trying to sort of
defuse the situation.

00:27:52.675 --> 00:27:55.300 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Because he had an alien
with him at a news conference,

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:55.710 align:middle line:10%
right?

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:57.085 align:middle line:10%
>>BASSETT: Yeah,
brought in a guy

00:27:57.085 --> 00:27:59.740 align:middle line:10%
with a big, giant alien
outfit, the whole nine yards.

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:02.680 align:middle line:10%
Which, by the way, again,
'97, that's not going to fly.

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:03.880 align:middle line:90%
Got a lot of blowback.

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And they were going, ooh,
this doesn't work so well.

00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:07.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did we do wrong?

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:09.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: But he came back and
said, look, I saw the thing.

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:10.442 align:middle line:90%
I was called out.

00:28:10.442 --> 00:28:11.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm the governor.

00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:13.400 align:middle line:84%
They called me-- something's
flying over Arizona.

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.610 align:middle line:84%
They called him out, and
he watched it go over.

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:18.724 align:middle line:84%
Now, again, what did the media
really have to do about that?

00:28:18.724 --> 00:28:20.390 align:middle line:84%
Was he called to the
Hill for a hearing?

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:22.070 align:middle line:84%
Did the president
want to talk to him?

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:23.320 align:middle line:90%
Did the Pentagon want to talk?

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:23.820 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no.

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:26.610 align:middle line:84%
You're just a former
governor, famous.

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:28.390 align:middle line:84%
You saw a giant
triangle fly over.

00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:31.960 align:middle line:84%
It was probably just a
huge flock of black geese.

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:32.950 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:36.650 align:middle line:84%
But you see, every
time that happens,

00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:38.739 align:middle line:84%
the sinews of the truth
embargo are stretched.

00:28:38.739 --> 00:28:40.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It gets
crazier and crazier.

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:41.696 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: The
media is irritated,

00:28:41.696 --> 00:28:43.075 align:middle line:90%
and the public gets mad.

00:28:43.075 --> 00:28:44.866 align:middle line:84%
And so, in that sense,
particularly because

00:28:44.866 --> 00:28:48.400 align:middle line:84%
of its timing in '97, which
is really when-- '96, '97

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:51.917 align:middle line:84%
is when I believe the exo
politics of the advocacy

00:28:51.917 --> 00:28:52.750 align:middle line:90%
movement gets going.

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:53.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really kicked up.

00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:55.164 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: It's kind
of a launch event,

00:28:55.164 --> 00:28:56.900 align:middle line:84%
and that's why it's
very important.

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:59.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Three incredible cases.

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:01.560 align:middle line:90%
But there are many, many more.

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.210 align:middle line:10%
>>BASSETT: Well,
there is one more area

00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:06.770 align:middle line:10%
that's the most
important of all.

00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:11.660 align:middle line:10%
And it's been featured a
lot in the last eight years.

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:16.590 align:middle line:10%
And the reason it's important
is that it is unambiguously

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:19.090 align:middle line:10%
unavoidable as a
massive news story

00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:21.920 align:middle line:10%
by any reporter,
editor, producer,

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:23.790 align:middle line:10%
unless they're complete idiots.

00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:26.950 align:middle line:84%
And that is there is now
overwhelming evidence

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:30.960 align:middle line:84%
that these craft-- in most
cases, almost certainly piloted

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:34.620 align:middle line:84%
by the ETs-- have been tampering
with our nuclear weapon systems

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:37.494 align:middle line:90%
over and over again.

00:29:37.494 --> 00:29:38.410 align:middle line:90%
And we have witnesses.

00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:39.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we have
witnesses there.

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:40.886 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: And
these witnesses are

00:29:40.886 --> 00:29:44.890 align:middle line:84%
captains in the Air Force with
SAC-based security clearances

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:47.520 align:middle line:84%
who have given press
conferences and written books.

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:49.850 align:middle line:90%
And the media's going, eh?

00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And the Congress is
going, I don't know.

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And the president
has nothing to say.

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:56.031 align:middle line:84%
But that's not
going away, either.

00:29:56.031 --> 00:29:57.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's a
huge story, Stephen.

00:29:57.780 --> 00:29:59.000 align:middle line:90%
>>BASSETT: It's a huge story.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And the seminal book
is "UFOs and Nukes"

00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:03.670 align:middle line:84%
by Robert Hastings, one of
the most important books ever

00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:05.250 align:middle line:90%
written on this subject.

00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:07.590 align:middle line:84%
Anybody that reads
that book and says,

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:11.240 align:middle line:84%
no news here, no
national interest here,

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.390 align:middle line:90%
is obviously completely deluded.

00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And so that, though it
doesn't have the visuals

00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:19.970 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't have
the specificity

00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:24.260 align:middle line:84%
of these other events, the
ongoing tampering of our nukes

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:29.410 align:middle line:84%
and what that means is probably
the most important evidentiary

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:32.250 align:middle line:84%
area of all and maybe
one of the things

00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:34.715 align:middle line:84%
that will, in fact, trigger
congressional hearings.

00:30:34.715 --> 00:30:37.500 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And we will talk more
about congressional hearings

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:41.410 align:middle line:10%
on our next edition of "Beyond
Belief" with Stephen Bassett.

00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:42.940 align:middle line:10%
You don't want to miss it.

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:45.740 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:48.790 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:30:48.790 --> 00:31:01.600 align:middle line:90%
