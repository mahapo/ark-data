We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:17.031 --> 00:00:18.780 align:middle line:84%

people the information.

>> GEORGE NOORY: Welcome to
"Beyond Belief" where tonight,

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.660 align:middle line:84%
we're going to talk about the
unusual mysteries, ghosts,

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.990 align:middle line:84%
life after death, and what
happens to us when we leave

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.170 align:middle line:90%
this planet.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.230 align:middle line:84%
One of the world's foremost
paranormal investigators

he investigates all kinds

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.790 align:middle line:84%
of unusual phenomena,
Joshua P. Warren.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.546 align:middle line:90%
Hey, Josh, come on out here.

00:01:01.546 --> 00:01:03.260 align:middle line:90%
>> [APPLAUSE]

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.709 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Good to see you.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:06.000 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSHUA P. WARREN: Thank you.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.130 align:middle line:90%


00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.722 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How did you get
interested in ghost hunting?

00:01:12.722 --> 00:01:14.930 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: Well, you know,
I grew up in the mountains

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.240 align:middle line:90%
of Asheville, North Carolina.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.910 align:middle line:84%
And there are lots of
legends and stories there

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.790 align:middle line:84%
that go back hundreds of
years about spooky things.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And as a teenager, I became
interested in writing.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.160 align:middle line:84%
I started writing articles about
some of these ghost stories.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And I wondered if there
was some truth there.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.480 align:middle line:84%
So to become a
better journalist,

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.320 align:middle line:84%
I learned to become
a better scientist

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.570 align:middle line:84%
so I could start measuring
some of these odd energy fields

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.580 align:middle line:90%
at these haunted places.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.370 align:middle line:84%
And I found,
surprisingly, there are

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.690 align:middle line:84%
things that you can
objectively document

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.250 align:middle line:84%
at sites where people have
these profound experiences.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.800 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What do you think
these things are, Josh?

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.175 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: Well, you know,
there are many different types

00:01:53.175 --> 00:01:56.150 align:middle line:84%
of paranormal entities, whether
we call them ghosts or angels

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.910 align:middle line:90%
or demons or aliens.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And what we have found most
interesting of all, I think,

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.810 align:middle line:84%
is that, yes, it does
appear that there

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.540 align:middle line:84%
is a part of the human
consciousness that

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.199 align:middle line:84%
exists outside of
the physical body.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.350 align:middle line:84%
But what we are
finding more and more,

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.570 align:middle line:84%
as we do deeper
technological research,

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.430 align:middle line:84%
is that people have had these
experiences for thousands

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.640 align:middle line:84%
of years, even before there
were artificial power supplies,

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.260 align:middle line:84%
batteries, wires,
man-made radio waves.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.020 align:middle line:84%
So we asked ourselves,
what is the power

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.660 align:middle line:90%
supply for these things?

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when a ghost appears,
it takes a lot of energy.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.060 align:middle line:84%
You could have
objects flying around,

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.700 align:middle line:84%
you can have bright light
forms, people getting touched.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:37.820 align:middle line:90%
Where does it come from?

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're finding more
and more that it seems,

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.430 align:middle line:84%
we, ourselves, literally
power these entities

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.190 align:middle line:90%
with our own bioenergy.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's essential
for a human observer

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.540 align:middle line:84%
to be present for that
mind/body, environment

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.430 align:middle line:84%
relationship to
actually charge up

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.244 align:middle line:84%
this ghost with the bioenergy
it requires to appear.

00:03:01.244 --> 00:03:03.160 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: If one believes
in life after death,

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.990 align:middle line:84%
and then we ask ourselves this
age old question, who are we?

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.120 align:middle line:90%
What are we doing here?

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.480 align:middle line:90%
How did we get here?

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.530 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it just a
natural occurrence

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.690 align:middle line:84%
to believe that this
energy, this spirit world,

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.030 align:middle line:84%
is just a natural
form of existence?

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.164 align:middle line:90%
It's just always been here?

00:03:22.164 --> 00:03:23.080 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: Absolutely.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really, physicality
is a relative thing.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.120 align:middle line:84%
You and I are physical
to each other right

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.690 align:middle line:84%
now, because we're resonating
at a similar frequency.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.110 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Don't be too physical.

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.026 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: No problem.

00:03:33.026 --> 00:03:34.340 align:middle line:90%
We have a table here.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.327 align:middle line:84%
But if we were resonating
at a much different rate,

00:03:37.327 --> 00:03:39.160 align:middle line:84%
then we would slip right
through each other,

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.830 align:middle line:84%
almost like hugging
Casper the Friendly Ghost.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.640 align:middle line:84%
He goes through you, just
like a radio wave does.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.160 align:middle line:84%
So I became interested
in that connection

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.870 align:middle line:84%
between the physical
body and the energy body.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.770 align:middle line:84%
And I did an experiment
that I think's

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.440 align:middle line:84%
quite fascinating, that ties
in nicely to some of the things

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.190 align:middle line:90%
we'll discuss today.

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.090 align:middle line:84%
I've studied people who are
bioenergy practitioners.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.540 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What does that mean?

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.340 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: These are people who
say that they can channel more

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.180 align:middle line:84%
energy from the environment
and use it for either healing

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.900 align:middle line:84%
purposes or to harm someone,
like a martial artist

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.230 align:middle line:90%
in a self-defense scenario.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.740 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They're
like an antenna?

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.410 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: Absolutely, they're
an antenna and a magnifier.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.769 align:middle line:84%
They can control
this flow of energy.

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.660 align:middle line:84%
So I travelled to
Chicago, Illinois,

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.130 align:middle line:84%
and spent a lot of time
investigating and researching

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.590 align:middle line:84%
a fellow named
Grandmaster Tom Cameron.

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And he does these
controversial demonstrations

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.620 align:middle line:84%
in which he projects
energy fields

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.160 align:middle line:84%
and can sometimes knock people
down without touching them.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.710 align:middle line:84%
He is a practitioner
of what they

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.090 align:middle line:84%
call Dim Mak, the
Chinese Death Touch.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.300 align:middle line:84%
And I started measuring him as
he was producing these energy

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.970 align:middle line:90%
projections.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.303 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure you've seen him before.

00:04:46.303 --> 00:04:49.960 align:middle line:84%
There's a picture of Grandmaster
Cameron producing a break.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And I'm standing there
with a meter and that

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.360 align:middle line:84%
taking some measurements, with
a colleague, as he does this.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, we decided to do an
experiment in which we took

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.730 align:middle line:84%
a subject, a friend of mine,
who is an investigator named Joe

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.246 align:middle line:84%
Sutherds, and figured we
would let him be knocked out.

00:05:05.246 --> 00:05:06.870 align:middle line:84%
It's great to work
with me on projects.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.160 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Did he know you
were going to do this him?

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.840 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: Yeah, he agreed.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:09.545 align:middle line:90%
He agreed.

00:05:09.545 --> 00:05:09.980 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.146 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: Joe is a big guy.

00:05:11.146 --> 00:05:12.400 align:middle line:90%
He's 6 foot 5.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.620 align:middle line:84%
He's a big, hefty, good
old, Tennessee boy.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And Grandmaster
Cameron said, I'm

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.050 align:middle line:84%
going to build up an
enormous amount of energy

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.400 align:middle line:84%
and I can either just project
it, and not touch him.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.960 align:middle line:84%
Or I can tap him so you'll
know the precise moment when

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.720 align:middle line:90%
I deliver it.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.332 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
how about this.

00:05:29.332 --> 00:05:30.540 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you give him a tap.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.300 align:middle line:84%
But here's what's going to
make this a special experiment.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.300 align:middle line:84%
First, we are going to
photograph Joe's fingertip

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.284 align:middle line:90%
using a Kirlian camera.

00:05:39.284 --> 00:05:39.950 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.690 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: Now a Kirlian
camera works by taking

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.180 align:middle line:84%
the guy's finger, you put inside
of a box that's light sealed.

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And he places his
finger directly

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.040 align:middle line:90%
on the photographic plate.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And I, as the camera operator,
would then send a voltage

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.870 align:middle line:84%
through his body of
about 5,000 volts.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:57.560 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What?

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.660 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: Yeah, but
it's very low amperage.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:00.970 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah, right.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:01.890 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: We always
disclaim it that way.

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:03.530 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Did you ever
make a mistake doing that?

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:03.920 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: No.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:04.461 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:06:04.461 --> 00:06:05.550 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: Not so for.

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.842 align:middle line:84%
And so for a split second
we send the voltage

00:06:09.842 --> 00:06:10.550 align:middle line:90%
through the body.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And what you end up with
is a nice ring of light.

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:15.685 align:middle line:90%
And that is his fingertip, OK?

00:06:15.685 --> 00:06:16.310 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Whoa!

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.840 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: So there is no
light being exposed here.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:19.530 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And it's all
around the fingertip?

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.820 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: That's just the
electricity flowing through

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.010 align:middle line:90%
the fingertip, right?

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:24.080 align:middle line:90%
So that's a control.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.370 align:middle line:84%
That is how Joe's
fingertip looked

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.540 align:middle line:90%
at a normal resting state.

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:33.430 align:middle line:84%
Then Grandmaster Cameron
came up and he tapped Joe,

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.230 align:middle line:84%
after building up
this energy blast.

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:36.410 align:middle line:90%
He tapped Joe.

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.830 align:middle line:84%
Instantly, Joe was
knocked back, almost out.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.400 align:middle line:84%
We had another guy there, an
investigator, Dean Warsing,

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.010 align:middle line:84%
who caught big Joe and
lowered him to the ground.

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:48.510 align:middle line:84%
Now at the very moment that
that tap was delivered,

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.520 align:middle line:84%
I took a second
Kirlian photograph.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.144 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:06:51.144 --> 00:06:53.060 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: And I've taken
thousands of Kirlian

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.730 align:middle line:84%
photographs, and I've never
seen one that looks like this.

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.530 align:middle line:84%
At the very instant
when Joe went out,

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:06.292 align:middle line:84%
we have a Kirlian that shows
not one, but two fingertips.

00:07:06.292 --> 00:07:07.075 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:07.075 --> 00:07:07.520 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Look at that, huge.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.610 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: Now notice
this is not a smear,

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.390 align:middle line:84%
this is not a motion streak,
because it was a split second.

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:16.230 align:middle line:84%
We have two distinct,
independent, separate

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.259 align:middle line:90%
impressions of his fingertip.

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:19.800 align:middle line:84%
I believe what you're
looking at here

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.060 align:middle line:84%
is possibly the
first photograph ever

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:26.170 align:middle line:84%
that shows the physical body
and an energy body that's

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:29.379 align:middle line:90%
being knocked ajar.

00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:30.920 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And it's
emitting from him.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.680 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: It's actually
removed from his body.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.930 align:middle line:84%
Now this may be
possible by literally,

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:38.730 align:middle line:90%
violently striking somebody.

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:42.590 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe controlling
the rate at which

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:44.670 align:middle line:90%
the energy leaves the body.

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:48.850 align:middle line:84%
So if we have basically
proven, to some extent,

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:50.970 align:middle line:84%
that we have this
energy body that

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:54.680 align:middle line:84%
overlays the physical body,
and that that energy body can

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:59.060 align:middle line:84%
be removed and
transmitted, then it also

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:03.180 align:middle line:84%
would tend to indicate
that we may actually power

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:06.070 align:middle line:84%
some of these
paranormal experiences

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:10.410 align:middle line:84%
by either consciously or
subconsciously sending some

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:13.540 align:middle line:84%
of our own energy
out into the ether.

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:16.090 align:middle line:84%
Or later, when I show you
some of the technology I've

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:20.190 align:middle line:84%
brought for you, you'll see that
this is mind-powered technology

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:23.510 align:middle line:84%
that is designed to tap
into that bioenergy field

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:26.460 align:middle line:84%
and allow you to direct
it to a particular place

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:29.460 align:middle line:84%
at a particular time
if you want to enhance

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:31.090 align:middle line:90%
the paranormal activity there.

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:34.570 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Joshua, at
the time of death,

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:37.549 align:middle line:84%
what would a picture like this
look like if somebody died?

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:39.190 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: I think it would
look very similar to that.

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:40.981 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You'd still
see the energy burst?

00:08:40.981 --> 00:08:43.190 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: I think that
you would-- and of course,

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:45.410 align:middle line:84%
technologically, there's
no reason that we cannot

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:48.100 align:middle line:84%
photograph a person
right as he or she dies.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.020 align:middle line:84%
There are,
unfortunately, some sort

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:53.750 align:middle line:84%
of ethical issues about handling
that kind of an operation.

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:58.030 align:middle line:84%
But there have been similar
experiments done using plants.

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And the phantom leaf effect
is the effect created

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:04.890 align:middle line:84%
when a leaf is photographed
with a Kirlian camera,

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:08.230 align:middle line:84%
you see energy around it, then
you tear a part of the leaf

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:10.570 align:middle line:84%
away and photograph
it a second time,

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:14.110 align:middle line:84%
and that portion that was
torn away still develops.

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:17.900 align:middle line:84%
And so if we consider that
there may be an energy

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:21.040 align:middle line:84%
field that we can
project ourselves,

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:25.540 align:middle line:84%
and that reality, due
to what we now consider

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:27.820 align:middle line:84%
the holographic
universe principle,

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:31.170 align:middle line:84%
is this conscious, sensitive,
medium that we are sort

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:34.070 align:middle line:84%
of wandering around in, that
we're not separate from,

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:37.560 align:middle line:84%
that we're a part of, we ask
the question, to what extent

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.890 align:middle line:90%
can we control these things?

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:44.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, now this is a picture from
our laboratory of a plasma that

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.630 align:middle line:84%
was created between a
couple of electrodes.

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:52.010 align:middle line:84%
Now a plasma is a highly
energized state of matter.

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:54.920 align:middle line:84%
It looks like a glowing
ball of light, there.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.670 align:middle line:84%
And we were experimenting with
this plasma, a group of us

00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:00.030 align:middle line:84%
were, because we
think this plasma is

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:02.510 align:middle line:84%
similar to what a
ghost is made out,

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:04.694 align:middle line:90%
when people see a glowing form.

00:10:04.694 --> 00:10:06.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, at one point,
we're standing

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:08.900 align:middle line:84%
there looking at
that ball of plasma

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.750 align:middle line:84%
and we started talking
about flying saucers.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And something absolutely
mind boggling happened.

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:19.490 align:middle line:84%
That plasma, before
our eyes, transformed

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:23.519 align:middle line:90%
into a saucer shape.

00:10:23.519 --> 00:10:24.435 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Interesting.

00:10:24.435 --> 00:10:26.735 align:middle line:84%
And it seems a little
more illuminated.

00:10:26.735 --> 00:10:27.360 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: Yes.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.961 align:middle line:84%
It's a little brighter and
it's taken on that nice saucer

00:10:29.961 --> 00:10:30.460 align:middle line:90%
shape.

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:35.240 align:middle line:84%
Now this was astounding to us,
because if we can demonstrate,

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:40.580 align:middle line:84%
as I'm attempting to here, that
we have this energy field which

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.896 align:middle line:84%
can be transmitted
outside the body.

00:10:42.896 --> 00:10:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Whether
you're alive or dead.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:45.660 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: That's right.

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And that this field,
which is connected

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:50.580 align:middle line:84%
with our consciousness,
can, in fact,

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:57.620 align:middle line:84%
shape the space-time holographic
medium that were walking in,

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:02.650 align:middle line:84%
then this would explain why that
we have such great technology,

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:05.020 align:middle line:84%
but we still don't
understand so much

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:06.970 align:middle line:90%
about ghosts and the paranormal.

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:10.070 align:middle line:84%
The reason is,
Newtonian physics has

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:14.120 align:middle line:84%
done a great job of allowing us
to build a better mouse trap.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.300 align:middle line:84%
But we still don't
understand consciousness,

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.290 align:middle line:90%
this stream of information.

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:22.000 align:middle line:84%
If paranormal phenomena
are the product

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.510 align:middle line:84%
of this intimate
relationship between the mind

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:27.750 align:middle line:84%
and the body and
the environment,

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:31.410 align:middle line:84%
but every single person
is a unique individual,

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:33.030 align:middle line:90%
how do you standardize that?

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:34.500 align:middle line:90%
How do you customize that?

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:38.790 align:middle line:84%
Science requires that level
of consistent repeatability.

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:41.600 align:middle line:84%
But if this is something which
depends on the individual,

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.220 align:middle line:84%
and it's different
for everybody,

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.640 align:middle line:84%
that explains why the
Newtonian approach has not

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:46.580 align:middle line:90%
been effective.

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And now people who
are looking into more

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:53.020 align:middle line:84%
mental and holographic
universe oriented principles

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.750 align:middle line:84%
are taking us closer
to understanding how

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:59.670 align:middle line:84%
that we cooperate in
this process of making

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:01.970 align:middle line:90%
these things appear.

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:06.766 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: When somebody dies,
and we get these stories--

00:12:06.766 --> 00:12:09.940 align:middle line:84%
we saw grandma at the
corner of our bed--

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:11.450 align:middle line:90%
why aren't they leaving?

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:13.490 align:middle line:84%
Why aren't they going
off to that other energy

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:14.480 align:middle line:90%
plane of existence?

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.420 align:middle line:90%
What do they hang around for?

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.880 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: Well, you know, there
are two basic types of ghosts.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:23.440 align:middle line:84%
You have some ghosts
that we call imprints.

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And these are ghosts
that almost seem

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:28.280 align:middle line:84%
like some type of
information that

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:31.050 align:middle line:84%
has been recorded in
the environment, that

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:33.340 align:middle line:84%
replays itself
from time to time.

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:35.550 align:middle line:84%
So a ghost that is
an imprint seems

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:38.880 align:middle line:84%
redundant,
non-interactive, unaware.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, a lot
of imprints are even

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:46.720 align:middle line:84%
inanimate objects, ghost ships,
ghost cars, a ghost stagecoach,

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.390 align:middle line:84%
as well as the horse
that's pulling it.

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:49.790 align:middle line:90%
So that's one type of ghost.

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:52.450 align:middle line:84%
If you see grandma, it might
be there was a moment there

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:54.940 align:middle line:84%
when there was some
emotional imprint,

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.200 align:middle line:90%
and you're seeing that.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.640 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, are we bringing
grandma on, or is she doing it

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:00.182 align:middle line:90%
to herself?

00:13:00.182 --> 00:13:02.640 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: Well, if it's an
imprint, I don't think grandma,

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:04.830 align:middle line:84%
necessarily, has
anything to do with it.

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:09.170 align:middle line:84%
But if it's an entity, which
means that grandma appears

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:11.807 align:middle line:84%
to be interactive, she seems
conscious, she seems aware.

00:13:11.807 --> 00:13:14.140 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Maybe gives you a
message from the other side.

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:15.140 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: That's right.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:17.050 align:middle line:84%
In that case, this
would actually

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:19.800 align:middle line:84%
be the stream of
information that

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:23.010 align:middle line:84%
is grandma being
picked up by you.

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And you are determining,
to a certain extent,

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.210 align:middle line:84%
how that will be projected
into a visualization.

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:30.350 align:middle line:84%
So you might see
grandma the way that she

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:32.780 align:middle line:84%
looks in your favorite
photograph of her,

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:35.420 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to how she
looked the moment she died.

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:39.846 align:middle line:84%
And that's also why ghosts don't
usually appear naked, right?

00:13:39.846 --> 00:13:40.720 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Good point.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:41.860 align:middle line:90%
Always dressed.

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:42.684 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: Yeah.

00:13:42.684 --> 00:13:44.100 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, you
don't, you know, it

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.210 align:middle line:90%
depends on what you want to see.

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:52.250 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, all that
said, if you take something

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:56.640 align:middle line:84%
like a television and you
were to hand it to a caveman,

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.600 align:middle line:84%
and he's looking at all the
little people dancing around.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And he opens up
the top of the set

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:03.792 align:middle line:84%
and looks inside to
find the little people,

00:14:03.792 --> 00:14:05.500 align:middle line:84%
he's not going to see
anything like that.

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.730 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: He'll be very upset
when he doesn't find them.

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:09.900 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: He'll just have
a bunch of wires and nuts

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:11.870 align:middle line:84%
and bolts and things,
where are the people?

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:13.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, the people
are not in the box.

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:16.900 align:middle line:84%
They are a stream of
information that the box

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.750 align:middle line:84%
is sort of projecting
and interpreting

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:21.950 align:middle line:90%
in a temporary form.

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And we are the same sort
of device, if you will.

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:29.270 align:middle line:84%
This is like the television
box, this physical body.

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:31.180 align:middle line:84%
But it seems that
our consciousness

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:32.720 align:middle line:84%
is a stream of
information that's

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.940 align:middle line:84%
coming from a larger
body of signals.

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And some people have
a clearer connection

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:40.800 align:middle line:84%
to that body of
signals, which is

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.650 align:middle line:84%
why some people are
more psychic, I think.

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:45.674 align:middle line:84%
They can use that to connect
into other people's signals.

00:14:45.674 --> 00:14:47.840 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I want to talk
with you about demons, too.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:48.370 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: Sure.

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:49.460 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Because that
has a lot to do with it.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:52.260 align:middle line:84%
But let's take some
questions from the audience.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:53.070 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: Great.

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:55.840 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Questions from any
of you for Joshua P. Warren?

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.240 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.340 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Have you
ever been truly frightened

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:02.212 align:middle line:90%
by an experience that you had?

00:15:02.212 --> 00:15:03.670 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: That's
a great question,

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:07.920 align:middle line:84%
and I have been frightened a
couple of times by experiences

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.920 align:middle line:90%
that I've had.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.130 align:middle line:84%
You know, the funny thing
is, the very first time

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:15.210 align:middle line:84%
I saw a ghost in person,
I was so close to it,

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:17.600 align:middle line:84%
I was able to reach
out and touch it.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And it was cold on the inside,
made the hair on my knuckles

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:21.250 align:middle line:90%
stand up.

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:24.540 align:middle line:84%
But that was not scary
for me, because I

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:27.750 align:middle line:84%
was in an attic with another
fellow, and when we saw it,

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:29.520 align:middle line:90%
it blew our minds.

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:30.500 align:middle line:90%
I almost felt numb.

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:31.570 align:middle line:90%
I was mesmerized.

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:33.400 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't believe
what I was seeing.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.040 align:middle line:84%
The time that I
actually probably felt

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:38.830 align:middle line:84%
the most frightened was when
I was spending the night

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:43.410 align:middle line:84%
by myself at Myrtle's
Plantation in Louisiana.

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:47.697 align:middle line:84%
I had the entire property
to myself for a whole night.

00:15:47.697 --> 00:15:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And about 10 o'clock at night,
we turned out the lights.

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:50.820 align:middle line:90%
It was very dark.

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:51.819 align:middle line:90%
I turned out the lights.

00:15:51.819 --> 00:15:53.270 align:middle line:90%
It was very dark.

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And I'm videotaping
with my camera.

00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:00.300 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I
start hearing this banging

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:01.222 align:middle line:90%
on the wall.

00:16:01.222 --> 00:16:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And I thought somebody else
had apparently showed up,

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:05.000 align:middle line:84%
but there was nobody
on the property.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, it got to the
point where I would say,

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:07.940 align:middle line:90%
bang on that table.

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:08.440 align:middle line:90%
Boom!

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:08.940 align:middle line:90%
Boom!

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:10.100 align:middle line:90%
Boom!

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:11.160 align:middle line:90%
Can you do that again?

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:11.420 align:middle line:90%
Boom!

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:11.650 align:middle line:90%
Boom!

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:12.200 align:middle line:90%
Boom!

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.220 align:middle line:90%
Now bang on that wall.

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:13.470 align:middle line:90%
Boom!

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:13.710 align:middle line:90%
Boom!

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:14.209 align:middle line:90%
Boom!

00:16:14.209 --> 00:16:15.800 align:middle line:90%
This would happen over and over.

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And when the reality sunk in
that I believed I was alone,

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:21.960 align:middle line:84%
but I knew there was
something else there with me

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.280 align:middle line:84%
that was conscious,
that was interactive,

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.460 align:middle line:84%
and that I couldn't
see it, some kind

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:29.470 align:middle line:84%
of animalistic fight or
flight instinct kicked in.

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:31.140 align:middle line:90%
I was so unnerved.

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And even though I had no
real reason to be afraid,

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:36.670 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't help it,
it was an instinct.

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:38.320 align:middle line:90%
And I overcame that, though.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.050 align:middle line:90%
And this went on for four hours.

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And it was a life altering
experience for me,

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:45.200 align:middle line:84%
because it showed
me that this was

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.780 align:middle line:84%
a true entity, a
disembodied intelligence.

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:50.760 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Another question
for Joshua Warren?

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.270 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:55.220 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Joshua, how can
you explain feeling a calm,

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:59.230 align:middle line:84%
loving touch on your shoulder
in an emotional situation?

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:02.100 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: Well, you know, I
think it's actually very common

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:07.430 align:middle line:84%
for a touch to be delivered by
some type of a spiritual form

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:10.970 align:middle line:84%
or presence at an
emotional moment.

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:14.099 align:middle line:84%
You see, in our laboratory,
we became very interested

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:16.920 align:middle line:84%
in the process of
how a ghost might

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:19.240 align:middle line:90%
physically interact with us.

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:22.720 align:middle line:84%
And what we found is that by
using electrostatic charges

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.829 align:middle line:84%
in the laboratory, that you
can make hair stand on end,

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:29.220 align:middle line:84%
you can move physical objects,
you give people cold chills.

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And if you hold an electrostatic
charge up to someone's back,

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:35.140 align:middle line:84%
it feels like they're
being touched on the back.

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And we know that there is this
powerful electrical element

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:41.620 align:middle line:84%
that accompanies
ghostly activity.

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:46.190 align:middle line:84%
So if you are in a state when
you need some type of support,

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:49.070 align:middle line:84%
a little extra care, and there
is a spiritual entity there

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:51.420 align:middle line:84%
that wants to maybe
comfort you, it

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:54.310 align:middle line:84%
makes sense that the
easiest thing it could do

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:56.870 align:middle line:84%
would be to muster
up just enough

00:17:56.870 --> 00:18:00.950 align:middle line:84%
of that electrostatic charge
for that physical force

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:03.650 align:middle line:90%
to give you that tender touch.

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:07.330 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Josh, when we watch
some of these paranormal TV

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:10.550 align:middle line:84%
shows, and you're on
"Paranormal Paparazzi,"

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:13.780 align:middle line:84%
sometimes it always seems
like, they have to have a ghost

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:14.570 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:17.480 align:middle line:84%
Now we know, being
on investigations,

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.880 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't happen
all the time.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:25.220 align:middle line:84%
Do those kinds of shows hurt or
help paranormal investigating?

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:29.090 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: I think they
both hurt and help.

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:32.270 align:middle line:84%
The thing that is
ironic about those shows

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:37.140 align:middle line:84%
is that paranormal phenomena
is called paranormal phenomena

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:38.940 align:middle line:90%
because it hardly ever happens.

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.310 align:middle line:84%
So how do you crank it
out every week, you know?

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:44.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think that when
you are on a deadline--

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:46.785 align:middle line:84%
and fortunately, I've never
worked on a show where I've

00:18:46.785 --> 00:18:49.640 align:middle line:84%
had to do that, even "Paranormal
Paparazzi" doesn't require

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:52.400 align:middle line:84%
us to go out and find
a ghost, necessarily.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.680 align:middle line:90%
Some shows do.

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:57.170 align:middle line:84%
And on those shows, it's
very important, I think,

00:18:57.170 --> 00:18:58.777 align:middle line:84%
for them to meet
these deadlines.

00:18:58.777 --> 00:19:00.235 align:middle line:84%
And they get a
little too creative.

00:19:00.235 --> 00:19:02.530 align:middle line:84%
You know, it comes
down to deadline and--

00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:03.450 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Got to have
something, right?

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:05.160 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: They hear some
little staticky noise, oh,

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.130 align:middle line:90%
did you hear that?

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:07.540 align:middle line:90%
It said, get out.

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:09.970 align:middle line:84%
And it just sounds
like shh to me.

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:12.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm very critical of that.

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:13.790 align:middle line:84%
So even though, you
have to realize,

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:15.825 align:middle line:84%
TV is first and
foremost entertainment.

00:19:15.825 --> 00:19:17.505 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: A little
ratings driven.

00:19:17.505 --> 00:19:18.380 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: Of course.

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:21.430 align:middle line:84%
You know, at the end of the
day, everybody has to get paid.

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:26.770 align:middle line:84%
But the good thing is, it
does inspire a lot of people

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:30.240 align:middle line:84%
to want to go out and
search for themselves.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, most people
are not naive enough

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:35.290 align:middle line:84%
to believe everything
they see on these shows

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:36.690 align:middle line:90%
and believe it's all true.

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:41.740 align:middle line:84%
But anything that kind of
A, inspires people, and B,

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:45.130 align:middle line:84%
brings this stuff into the
mainstream consciousness

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:48.246 align:middle line:84%
more so that you're not
considered so much of a freak

00:19:48.246 --> 00:19:50.120 align:middle line:84%
if you come out and tell
your story, is good.

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.050 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Maybe by the
time this show's over,

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:53.690 align:middle line:90%
we'll have a ghost show up here.

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:54.640 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: Well, it's possible.

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:54.740 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You know what?

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:56.890 align:middle line:84%
We'll be back, "Beyond
Belief" with Joshua P

00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:58.180 align:middle line:90%
Warren in just a moment.

00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:03.636 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:03.636 --> 00:20:07.108 align:middle line:90%
>> [BACKGROUND MUSIC]

00:20:07.108 --> 00:20:13.060 align:middle line:90%


00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:15.367 align:middle line:90%
>> [APPLAUSE]

00:20:15.367 --> 00:20:17.700 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Welcome back to
"Beyond Belief" with Joshua P.

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:20.210 align:middle line:90%
Warren, Paranormal Investigator.

00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:25.790 align:middle line:84%
Joshua, demons-- you talked
about imprints, entities, what

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:26.870 align:middle line:90%
about these demons?

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:29.870 align:middle line:90%
These evil, possessed things.

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:32.380 align:middle line:90%
What the heck are they?

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:36.500 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: Well, if you consider
that the human brain is really

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:41.480 align:middle line:84%
just a machine that seems
to channel this stream

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.300 align:middle line:84%
of information we
call consciousness,

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:50.990 align:middle line:84%
I believe that there are beings
out there which can almost act

00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:56.400 align:middle line:84%
like parasites and tap into that
stream of energy and feed off

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.469 align:middle line:84%
of it, even when you
don't want them to.

00:20:58.469 --> 00:20:59.760 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They need to do that.

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:00.426 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: Yeah.

00:21:00.426 --> 00:21:03.390 align:middle line:84%
You know, we get energy by
putting something in our mouths

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:05.620 align:middle line:84%
and chewing it up
and swallowing.

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:07.810 align:middle line:84%
But there is no
reason to believe

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:11.810 align:middle line:84%
that all life that may
exist has to look like us

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:13.330 align:middle line:90%
and exist at this frequency.

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:16.460 align:middle line:84%
I think that there
are entities that

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:19.590 align:middle line:84%
take their energy in a
more direct way, that they

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:21.630 align:middle line:84%
don't have to eat
food to get it.

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:23.890 align:middle line:84%
It's a pretty crude way
of doing it, frankly.

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, a lot of times
when a person is sleeping,

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:32.490 align:middle line:84%
these kind of dark forms will
be attracted to a sleeping

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:34.394 align:middle line:84%
individual and absorb
that person's energy.

00:21:34.394 --> 00:21:36.810 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is that why some
people wake up and they're more

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:37.860 align:middle line:84%
tired than when
they went to sleep?

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:38.820 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: Absolutely.

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:40.970 align:middle line:84%
In fact, during the
Victorian times,

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:43.350 align:middle line:84%
when the psychical
research was being born,

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:45.050 align:middle line:90%
as we know it, in England.

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:46.860 align:middle line:84%
It was common to
go on a ghost hunt

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:48.820 align:middle line:90%
and bring a sleeper with you.

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And this is an individual
whose job was solely to sleep.

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And the idea was that
the dormant bioenergy

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:58.910 align:middle line:84%
would be utilized
by the apparition.

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:01.660 align:middle line:84%
So all that said,
I think there are

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:06.530 align:middle line:84%
some very sort of
dark entities, not

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:09.960 align:middle line:84%
necessarily that they
might have bad intentions,

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:12.770 align:middle line:84%
it's just that what they
do for us is an invasion.

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:13.270 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:17.960 align:middle line:84%
They're coming and they are
using us for a food supply,

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:22.160 align:middle line:84%
and draining on you and
making you depressed.

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And if you hang out with
certain types of people

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.650 align:middle line:84%
and you go to certain
types of places

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:30.050 align:middle line:84%
where they engage in
activities that sort of lower

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:31.995 align:middle line:84%
your resistance, like
bars, for example--

00:22:31.995 --> 00:22:34.370 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, I've been to
places where you're standing

00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:36.830 align:middle line:84%
next to somebody and
you feel exhausted.

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:37.499 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: Yeah.

00:22:37.499 --> 00:22:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They haven't even said
anything and you have to run

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:40.710 align:middle line:90%
away from them.

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:41.450 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: That's right.

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:42.315 align:middle line:90%
Like an energy vampire.

00:22:42.315 --> 00:22:42.940 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:43.840 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: Yeah.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:46.160 align:middle line:84%
When you are in
those scenarios, I

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:49.410 align:middle line:84%
believe that over time,
you lower your resistance.

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, you
know, we're not far

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:54.510 align:middle line:84%
from the Stanley Hotel,
the Shining hotel.

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And it reminds me of
that sort of, I guess,

00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:00.340 align:middle line:84%
that model in "The Shining"
that some places might

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:02.980 align:middle line:84%
lower your resistance
and wear you down,

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:06.840 align:middle line:84%
and you become possessed,
because these things are

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.970 align:middle line:90%
able to access you more easily.

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:11.890 align:middle line:84%
So I tend to think that
most of what people call,

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:15.510 align:middle line:84%
quote, unquote, "demonic" are
these parasitic entities that

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:16.500 align:middle line:90%
latch on that way.

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:18.875 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: If Jack Nicholson
sticks his head through here,

00:23:18.875 --> 00:23:19.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm out of here.

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:20.965 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: Yeah,
you and me both.

00:23:20.965 --> 00:23:22.716 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:22.716 --> 00:23:25.090 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I had a friend of
mine who died in a motorcycle

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:27.330 align:middle line:90%
accident.

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:28.650 align:middle line:90%
I went to the funeral.

00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:31.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't like going to
funerals, but I went.

00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And you look at the
body in the casket,

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:37.880 align:middle line:84%
and they hardly ever look like
they did when they were alive.

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And for a split second,
a believer in life

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:45.830 align:middle line:84%
after death, I looked at him
and I said, what if this is it.

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:50.430 align:middle line:84%
He's done, nothing else
exists beyond that?

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:53.460 align:middle line:90%
One, he doesn't know that.

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:59.040 align:middle line:84%
It was, to me, for that
split second, the coldest,

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:03.950 align:middle line:84%
most loneliest feeling I
have ever felt in my life.

00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:09.460 align:middle line:84%
Do you think for a moment that
religion and people of the past

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:13.570 align:middle line:84%
created the feeling of
life after death in order

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:17.020 align:middle line:90%
to fix that hole of loneliness?

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:19.140 align:middle line:90%
Or do you think it's real?

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:20.390 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: Both, actually.

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:24.400 align:middle line:84%
Because I think that
people created that belief

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.620 align:middle line:84%
because they needed
that reassurance.

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:30.070 align:middle line:84%
I think these beliefs were
also created to control people,

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:33.040 align:middle line:84%
to govern people, because
religions have often

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:35.440 align:middle line:84%
been used for that purpose
throughout history.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:39.680 align:middle line:84%
But it just so happens to
turn out that we are seeing,

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.860 align:middle line:84%
the more intelligent we
become, that it's true.

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And you can look at
it philosophically,

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:47.350 align:middle line:84%
or you could look
at it physically,

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:50.970 align:middle line:84%
but, essentially, we know that
energy can be neither created

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:54.440 align:middle line:84%
nor destroyed-- simply
conserved and transformed

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.660 align:middle line:90%
from one version into another.

00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, if we are
self-aware of this very moment,

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:03.990 align:middle line:84%
then it seems to me that
that awareness will always

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:05.270 align:middle line:90%
exist in some form.

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:07.250 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't
necessarily have to be

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:10.880 align:middle line:84%
in a form with two arms and two
legs, wearing a jacket, right?

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.660 align:middle line:84%
It could end up in
a mug, if we really

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:14.830 align:middle line:90%
wanted to get that creative.

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:18.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the funny thing is,
if you start breaking down

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:21.960 align:middle line:84%
the human body, all the stuff
that we can actually measure,

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:24.090 align:middle line:84%
put under a
microscope, it doesn't

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:26.580 align:middle line:84%
look that different at the
smallest levels from all

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:28.500 align:middle line:84%
the other matter
in the universe,

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:31.900 align:middle line:84%
inanimate objects
as well as animals,

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:35.320 align:middle line:84%
microorganisms, we all look
the same at the very smallest

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:35.820 align:middle line:90%
levels.

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:37.820 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You do
not want to die.

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:40.540 align:middle line:84%
You want to enjoy
this existence.

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:43.640 align:middle line:84%
But are you prepared
to join the other side?

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:44.670 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: I think I am.

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:47.100 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm prepared,
because, you know,

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:49.860 align:middle line:84%
I was having a conversation
with a friend last night.

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:53.520 align:middle line:84%
And he was saying that the
scariest part about dying

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.870 align:middle line:84%
is that here you spend all
these years, all these decades,

00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:59.980 align:middle line:84%
learning things, if you're
that type of person,

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:04.510 align:middle line:84%
and becoming more and more
enlightened, and then you die

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:08.390 align:middle line:84%
and you have to be reborn
and start it all over again.

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:10.580 align:middle line:84%
So that's the stressful
part, like, oh,

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:12.042 align:middle line:84%
do I have to go
back to square one

00:26:12.042 --> 00:26:13.250 align:middle line:90%
in a whole new manifestation.

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:15.200 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I got to go to
second grade all over again.

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:15.620 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: Yes,
I've got to go back

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:15.830 align:middle line:90%
to--that's precisely--yeah.

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:17.050 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Josh,
hold that thought.

00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:19.091 align:middle line:84%
We're going to come right
back on "Beyond Belief"

00:26:19.091 --> 00:26:21.870 align:middle line:84%
with Joshua Warren
in just a moment.

00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:23.850 align:middle line:90%
>> [APPLAUSE]

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:27.810 align:middle line:90%
>> [BACKGROUND MUSIC]

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:36.225 align:middle line:90%


00:26:36.225 --> 00:26:37.031 align:middle line:90%
>> [APPLAUSE]

00:26:37.031 --> 00:26:38.780 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Josh, they
love you with ghosts.

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:42.170 align:middle line:84%
We're with Joshua P Warren
here at "Beyond Belief."

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:46.700 align:middle line:84%
There are some who claim that
you can talk to the dead.

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:48.940 align:middle line:84%
I wrote a book called
"Talking to the Dead."

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:51.085 align:middle line:84%
There was an old device
called the Spirit Com,

00:26:51.085 --> 00:26:54.020 align:middle line:84%
there's another one
called Frank's Box.

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:56.580 align:middle line:90%
Is it just electronics?

00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:58.520 align:middle line:90%
Can you truly talk to the dead?

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:02.200 align:middle line:84%
We've heard EVP sounds, the
Electronic Voice Phenomena

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:05.870 align:middle line:84%
of voices, little ones, that
say, hello there, and stuff

00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:06.380 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:08.200 align:middle line:90%
What is all that?

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:11.970 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: Well, there is
no reliable way to talk

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:12.830 align:middle line:90%
to the dead.

00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:15.880 align:middle line:84%
I think that you can use
a lot of different tools.

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And because of that mind/body
environment relationship,

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:23.790 align:middle line:84%
if you happen to be in
tune with these entities,

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:26.440 align:middle line:84%
then you can use a lot
of different devices

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:27.910 align:middle line:90%
as an interface.

00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:30.790 align:middle line:84%
The problem, however, with
many of these devices that

00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:33.820 align:middle line:84%
rely on electronics,
is that, for one thing,

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:36.990 align:middle line:84%
we live in a highly contaminated
world, where, I mean,

00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:39.997 align:middle line:84%
we just have tons of radio
waves and satellite signals.

00:27:39.997 --> 00:27:41.080 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: From everywhere.

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:42.621 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: We're
bombarded with them.

00:27:42.621 --> 00:27:44.584 align:middle line:84%
So that makes it
almost impossible

00:27:44.584 --> 00:27:46.000 align:middle line:84%
to determine whether
or not you're

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.620 align:middle line:84%
getting a contaminated reading,
unless you were in a Faraday

00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:51.870 align:middle line:84%
cage, or something, which
they never use that.

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:56.600 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest problem is
that if I were walking down

00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:01.080 align:middle line:84%
the street and I handed a
cell phone to a stranger

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:04.180 align:middle line:84%
and that stranger got
on the line and somebody

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:06.830 align:middle line:84%
said I'd like to order
a pizza, you know.

00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:10.810 align:middle line:84%
That stranger would hear
exactly what that person said.

00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:15.772 align:middle line:84%
I require that level of
clarity and consistency.

00:28:15.772 --> 00:28:17.730 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And we're not
getting that right now.

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:18.790 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: No, we're
nowhere near that.

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:19.805 align:middle line:90%
And same thing with EVP.

00:28:19.805 --> 00:28:21.180 align:middle line:84%
If you could walk
down the street

00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:23.620 align:middle line:84%
and play an EVP for
five different people

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:26.455 align:middle line:84%
and they all immediately repeat
to you what you think it says,

00:28:26.455 --> 00:28:27.580 align:middle line:90%
then you've got a good EVP.

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:28.840 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: No, you're right.

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:31.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've tried
playing EVPs on the radio

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:33.460 align:middle line:90%
and you know how hard that is.

00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:36.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's hard enough
just to hear with your ear.

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:38.470 align:middle line:84%
But then when you hear
it through a radio,

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:40.290 align:middle line:90%
it's even more difficult.

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:42.130 align:middle line:84%
I will tell you,
though, that some

00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:44.470 align:middle line:84%
of the scariest
sounds I've heard

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:47.830 align:middle line:84%
are the sounds of children
who have passed on.

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:50.650 align:middle line:90%
Why is that so eerie?

00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:55.000 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: Well probably
because they are confused.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.419 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's the same reason--

00:28:56.419 --> 00:28:57.210 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's sad.

00:28:57.210 --> 00:29:01.040 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: Yeah, I mean,
they're scared to death.

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:04.040 align:middle line:84%
Generally, we become
less and less frightened

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:04.870 align:middle line:90%
as we get older.

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:08.557 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I remember not being
able to watch horror movie

00:29:08.557 --> 00:29:09.640 align:middle line:90%
trailers when I was a kid.

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.250 align:middle line:84%
You know, Mom would
cover the eyes up,

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:12.570 align:middle line:90%
because it'd be too scary.

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:14.930 align:middle line:84%
But as you get older
you become desensitized.

00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:19.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think that, yeah, when a
child is removed dramatically

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:23.160 align:middle line:84%
from this realm and maybe
alone for a period of time,

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure it's terrifying.

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, one reason I
think that a lot of the ghosts

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:31.970 align:middle line:84%
out there are ghosts associated
with a negative person,

00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:35.640 align:middle line:84%
some murderer, or somebody
who's done something bad,

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:41.150 align:middle line:84%
is because, if, when
you die, hypothetically,

00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:43.862 align:middle line:84%
there actually is some kind
of tunnel of light there.

00:29:43.862 --> 00:29:44.820 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That you see.

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:47.810 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: That you have
the option to go to.

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:50.610 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of whether
or not there actually

00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:53.240 align:middle line:84%
is some God sitting there
that's going to judge you

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:56.480 align:middle line:84%
on the other side, if
you believe there is,

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:58.820 align:middle line:84%
that might be enough
to make you not

00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:01.490 align:middle line:84%
want to take that step
through that doorway yet.

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:05.840 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Tell me the story
of Robert the haunted doll.

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:10.620 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: Robert the haunted
doll is the most famous spooky

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:13.720 align:middle line:84%
little doll, probably,
in the world.

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.760 align:middle line:90%
He is over 100 years old.

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:19.447 align:middle line:84%
And he sits currently in a
museum in Key West, Florida.

00:30:19.447 --> 00:30:21.780 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And I only speak
nicely of the little guy from

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:22.310 align:middle line:90%
here on in.

00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:23.434 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: You and me both.

00:30:23.434 --> 00:30:24.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:28.420 align:middle line:84%
Robert, he's a big doll,
he's about three feet tall.

00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:30.060 align:middle line:90%
He looks like a little sailor.

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:33.270 align:middle line:84%
He is sitting in a chair
and he has a stuffed lion.

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And the story behind
him is that there

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:39.330 align:middle line:84%
was a wealthy family
that lived in Key West.

00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And they had a little boy
named Robert Eugene Otto.

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:47.160 align:middle line:90%
They call him Gene.

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:51.830 align:middle line:84%
And they had a servant who was
from somewhere in the islands

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:53.630 align:middle line:90%
where voodoo was practiced.

00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And at some point the
servant became disgruntled

00:30:56.490 --> 00:31:00.440 align:middle line:84%
with the family and, perhaps, as
a bit of vengeance or something

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:03.270 align:middle line:84%
like that, she
created a doll that

00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:05.550 align:middle line:90%
looked like the little boy.

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And the little boy became
obsessed with this doll,

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:12.500 align:middle line:90%
almost like a big voodoo doll.

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:14.490 align:middle line:84%
We don't know exactly
what her intention was,

00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:17.060 align:middle line:84%
did she use something
organic, some hair clippings

00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:18.130 align:middle line:90%
from the boy, who knows?

00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:20.410 align:middle line:84%
But the doll is call Robert
because the little boy's

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:21.680 align:middle line:90%
first name is Robert.

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:24.280 align:middle line:84%
So the little boy became
obsessed with this doll.

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.410 align:middle line:84%
He would never part with
the rest of his life.

00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:30.550 align:middle line:84%
He treated it just like
it was a real person.

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:32.830 align:middle line:84%
Even when he got
married to his wife,

00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:35.250 align:middle line:84%
they almost got a
divorce because he

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:36.630 align:middle line:90%
carried the doll everywhere.

00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:39.540 align:middle line:84%
He had a whole room made for
the doll with little furniture.

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:40.140 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Wow.

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:44.350 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: And the rumor I've
heard is that once in awhile

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:48.330 align:middle line:84%
the wife, his wife, would end
up around town with bruises.

00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:51.497 align:middle line:84%
And people would go to
her husband and say,

00:31:51.497 --> 00:31:52.830 align:middle line:90%
have you been beating your wife?

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:53.663 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Of course.

00:31:53.663 --> 00:31:57.130 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: And he would
say, Robert did it.

00:31:57.130 --> 00:32:01.970 align:middle line:84%
So this doll kind of
became a scapegoat, maybe,

00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:03.790 align:middle line:90%
for a lot of negative energy.

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:07.240 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, is it possible
that while they were asleep,

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:10.935 align:middle line:84%
Robert, the haunted doll,
clubbed her or did something

00:32:10.935 --> 00:32:11.435 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:32:11.435 --> 00:32:15.620 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: You know, I have
talked to so many people who

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:17.732 align:middle line:84%
seem to be perfectly
rational people,

00:32:17.732 --> 00:32:20.190 align:middle line:84%
who have set right there, looked
me in the eye and told me,

00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:23.272 align:middle line:84%
I have seen this doll get
up and move around the room.

00:32:23.272 --> 00:32:24.230 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's scary.

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:27.700 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: And it's so
unbelievable, and yet,

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:29.380 align:middle line:90%
you have to keep an open mind.

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:30.760 align:middle line:90%
Is it possible?

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:32.840 align:middle line:90%
I have to say it's possible.

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:35.720 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen
that happen myself.

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:38.260 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that when
you go see Robert the doll

00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:41.170 align:middle line:84%
for the first time-- and
for me, because I was doing

00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:44.780 align:middle line:84%
an investigation, they removed
the glass case that's usually

00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:48.440 align:middle line:84%
on top of him so I could really
get up close and personal.

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.394 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't feel like
an inanimate object.

00:32:50.394 --> 00:32:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: He kind of
looks at you, doesn't he?

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:55.030 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: Yeah, you feel like
you're looking at a living

00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:55.547 align:middle line:90%
little guy.

00:32:55.547 --> 00:32:57.130 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You bought
a little replica.

00:32:57.130 --> 00:32:57.680 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: Yes, I did.

00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:58.630 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And mailed it to me--

00:32:58.630 --> 00:32:59.080 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: That's right.

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:00.100 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: --in Los Angeles.

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:01.516 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: Yeah,
you didnn't know.

00:33:01.516 --> 00:33:03.014 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Are you crazy?

00:33:03.014 --> 00:33:03.680 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: Well?

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.930 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: This thing
was hideous looking,

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:13.580 align:middle line:84%
and some woman wrote in and said
I want Robert the Haunted Doll.

00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:15.580 align:middle line:90%
And we gave it to her.

00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And now the doll and this
woman, her name is Maryann,

00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:22.657 align:middle line:90%
are inseparable.

00:33:22.657 --> 00:33:23.740 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: Oh, no, really?

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:25.990 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: The best of friends.

00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:28.360 align:middle line:84%
And she will never
part with this thing.

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:29.080 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: Yeah.

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:33.120 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But when I saw that
come in in a box, I said,

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:36.240 align:middle line:84%
this could very well be Joshua's
last appearance on "Coast

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:37.850 align:middle line:90%
to Coast."

00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:39.690 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: I feared
that might happen.

00:33:39.690 --> 00:33:42.040 align:middle line:84%
I think you should have put
a little mustache on him,

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:43.620 align:middle line:84%
and then set him right
next to you in the booth.

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:45.320 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Just like me,
a little voodoo doll.

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:46.060 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: Yes,
yes. that's right.

00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:47.684 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Some have
said that about me.

00:33:47.684 --> 00:33:51.670 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: But I really think
that sometimes these objects

00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:54.030 align:middle line:90%
can become charged with energy.

00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:56.150 align:middle line:84%
It's very similar
to, let's say if you

00:33:56.150 --> 00:34:00.950 align:middle line:84%
take a piece of steel,
maybe a nail, and a magnet,

00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:04.100 align:middle line:84%
and you stroke that nail
over and over and over.

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:04.960 align:middle line:90%
After a while--

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:05.910 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It becomes magnetized.

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:06.505 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: It
becomes magnetized.

00:34:06.505 --> 00:34:07.046 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:34:07.046 --> 00:34:08.570 align:middle line:90%
It becomes polarized.

00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:11.219 align:middle line:84%
And so, I think, when you're
around certain objects

00:34:11.219 --> 00:34:13.850 align:middle line:84%
and you project a
certain wavelength,

00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:16.400 align:middle line:84%
for lack of a better word,
into them over and over

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:19.389 align:middle line:84%
and over, eventually,
either they

00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:22.310 align:middle line:84%
are able to retain
a bit of that,

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:24.429 align:middle line:84%
or they just align
with it, so they

00:34:24.429 --> 00:34:26.800 align:middle line:84%
start channeling the very
same energy they were given.

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.050 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You want
to Transylvania.

00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:28.675 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: Yes.

00:34:28.675 --> 00:34:31.030 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You went
to Dracula's castle.

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:31.659 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: Yes.

00:34:31.659 --> 00:34:33.360 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: How did that feel?

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:35.580 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: It felt just
like I hoped it would.

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:36.330 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Perfect.

00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:38.180 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: It was
unbelievable, I mean--

00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:40.221 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: (ROMANIAN ACCENT)
I'm going to bite you

00:34:40.221 --> 00:34:40.850 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: Yes.

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:41.730 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:44.190 align:middle line:84%
The setting was exactly
as you would hope.

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:47.109 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're going for
these quaint villages

00:34:47.109 --> 00:34:48.900 align:middle line:84%
and these houses have
these pointy turrets.

00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And in the background
there are soaring mountains

00:34:51.730 --> 00:34:54.850 align:middle line:84%
with bare rock faces and
snow caps in the background.

00:34:54.850 --> 00:34:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And you have little old
ladies with their bundles,

00:34:57.590 --> 00:34:59.100 align:middle line:84%
and sheep herders
in the streets.

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And it was like
stepping back in time.

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:03.570 align:middle line:84%
But you know, this is a
great topic to bring up,

00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:07.220 align:middle line:84%
because we investigated
a castle in Transylvania

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:10.924 align:middle line:84%
called Hunyad Castle in
a place called Hunedoara.

00:35:10.924 --> 00:35:12.340 align:middle line:84%
It's a big, spooky
looking castle.

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:15.370 align:middle line:84%
I'll show you a picture of
it, as a matter of fact.

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:17.250 align:middle line:84%
This is a photograph
of me standing

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:19.118 align:middle line:84%
in front of Hunyad
Castle, there.

00:35:19.118 --> 00:35:20.576 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: God, when
was that built?

00:35:20.576 --> 00:35:21.460 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: Oh, gosh.

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:25.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking the
1600's maybe 1500's.

00:35:25.210 --> 00:35:26.210 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's gorgeous.

00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:27.501 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: 1500's I'm thinking.

00:35:27.501 --> 00:35:33.230 align:middle line:84%
And so it is just
a very impressive,

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:34.970 align:middle line:90%
striking, intimidating place.

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:38.400 align:middle line:84%
Now knowing we were going
to have most of the night

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.234 align:middle line:84%
to investigate this
place all to ourselves--

00:35:40.234 --> 00:35:41.858 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You spent
the night in there?

00:35:41.858 --> 00:35:42.580 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: Yes.

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:43.210 align:middle line:90%
I was with a group of--

00:35:43.210 --> 00:35:43.680 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Are you crazy?

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:45.660 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: Well,
yeah, a little bit.

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:47.000 align:middle line:90%
It's required.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And so I talked to
a colleague of mine

00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:55.010 align:middle line:84%
who works with some
of the technology

00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:57.682 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to
be talking about soon.

00:35:57.682 --> 00:36:00.690 align:middle line:84%
A type of device, it's
called a spectralizer,

00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:05.980 align:middle line:84%
it's a radionics box that
you hook to your mind.

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And you set a
target, a location.

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:13.640 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, it would
be this particular castle.

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And you set some dials-- I'll
explain later how it works--

00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:19.970 align:middle line:84%
and you send your energy
and your intention

00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:23.210 align:middle line:84%
to that place to enhance
paranormal activity.

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:26.550 align:middle line:84%
So a month before you went
to this castle, my friend,

00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:28.370 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Molder we call him--

00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:30.001 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Mm, hm.

00:36:30.001 --> 00:36:30.500 align:middle line:90%
Fitting.

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:31.270 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: Yeah.

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:36.000 align:middle line:84%
He built this device and
focused it on this castle.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And that night, we
had nonstop activity.

00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:44.090 align:middle line:84%
Not only did we have several
people who saw apparitions,

00:36:44.090 --> 00:36:47.400 align:middle line:84%
but the most prevalent thing was
that, even though the property

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:50.280 align:middle line:84%
was locked down and
very controlled,

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:54.370 align:middle line:84%
all night long something
was throwing rocks

00:36:54.370 --> 00:36:56.440 align:middle line:90%
at us, rocks and pebbles-- hard.

00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:58.182 align:middle line:84%
I mean zinging them
out of the shadows.

00:36:58.182 --> 00:36:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, here we
are in an empty room.

00:36:59.890 --> 00:37:01.840 align:middle line:84%
You're looking out
round with night vision.

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:03.080 align:middle line:90%
Where are these coming from?

00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:04.829 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You could
hear them or see them?

00:37:04.829 --> 00:37:08.044 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: There's a picture of
one, right there, that landed.

00:37:08.044 --> 00:37:09.460 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: A rock,
a little pebble.

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:09.870 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: Yeah.

00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:10.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:13.256 align:middle line:84%
I mean just being
horizontally zinged.

00:37:13.256 --> 00:37:15.380 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How do you know
the people at the castle,

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:19.850 align:middle line:84%
who are putting on these events,
aren't doing that to trick you?

00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:21.580 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: Well, in
this particular case,

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:23.940 align:middle line:84%
like some of the
ones that I saw,

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:26.660 align:middle line:84%
these were occurring
in a sealed room.

00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And I was in there
with two other people.

00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:29.650 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: So there's no way?

00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:30.330 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: No.

00:37:30.330 --> 00:37:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And plus, we've
got devices, we've

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:34.860 align:middle line:84%
got gadgets that will
allow us to pick up energy.

00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:36.215 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, I want to
see some of these gadgets

00:37:36.215 --> 00:37:38.860 align:middle line:84%
in a moment, Josh, but let's
take some more questions from

00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:40.210 align:middle line:90%
the audience.

00:37:40.210 --> 00:37:41.364 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:41.364 --> 00:37:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Josh,
you talked about that

00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:46.930 align:middle line:84%
there's, in your opinion, two
different types of ghosts.

00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:50.000 align:middle line:84%
But how do you
explain an orb verses

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.710 align:middle line:84%
an apparition, verses
an energy field?

00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:56.870 align:middle line:84%
Is it how the ghost
chooses to show itself?

00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:58.902 align:middle line:90%
Or is it something different?

00:37:58.902 --> 00:38:00.360 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: That's
a great question.

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And in one of my books
called "How to Hunt Ghosts,"

00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:07.220 align:middle line:84%
I actually talked about five
different types of ghosts.

00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:10.270 align:middle line:84%
Entities and imprints would
be the most common general

00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:11.220 align:middle line:90%
divisions.

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:14.160 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to the
way in which they manifest,

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:17.770 align:middle line:84%
how they appear, I think
that there are really

00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:19.740 align:middle line:90%
two issues involved.

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:24.870 align:middle line:84%
In the photograph that showed
Joe's energy field being

00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:27.610 align:middle line:84%
knocked out of his
body, the energy field

00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:29.530 align:middle line:84%
looked just like
the physical field,

00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:32.210 align:middle line:90%
because the two were overlaid.

00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:36.400 align:middle line:84%
But I think, as time goes on,
if the energy field is removed

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:38.990 align:middle line:84%
from the body, it
begins to break down.

00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:41.150 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like
sand that's dumped out

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:43.860 align:middle line:84%
of a plastic mold
for a sand castle.

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:47.300 align:middle line:84%
You have that nice crisp
sand castle of sand,

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:49.220 align:middle line:84%
and then it begins to
get crumbly and rough

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:50.390 align:middle line:90%
around the edges.

00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the
longer your energy field

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:55.810 align:middle line:84%
is outside of this
physical form,

00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:59.150 align:middle line:84%
then the more it kind of
breaks down into a misty form.

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And once it's loosened
into a misty form,

00:39:01.890 --> 00:39:04.130 align:middle line:84%
it would make sense
that, eventually, it

00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:05.970 align:middle line:84%
would become more
and more condensed

00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:09.100 align:middle line:90%
into a perfect balanced sphere.

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:11.210 align:middle line:84%
Because if you, right
now, had the ability

00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:15.310 align:middle line:84%
to snap your fingers and morph
into any form you wanted,

00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:18.500 align:middle line:84%
what would be more perfect
than a ball of light that

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:21.380 align:middle line:90%
could zip around at any speed?

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:24.150 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't have to worry
about gravitational forces

00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:26.800 align:middle line:84%
that we deal with here,
with our awkward bodies.

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.710 align:middle line:84%
And so, I think, to
a certain extent,

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:31.040 align:middle line:84%
you might be able
to determine the age

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:34.000 align:middle line:84%
of a spiritual manifestation,
that is to say,

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.920 align:middle line:84%
how long it's been
outside of a physical body

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:40.960 align:middle line:84%
by whether it appears as a
distinct form, a misty form,

00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:42.400 align:middle line:90%
an orb, et cetera.

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
the other variable

00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:48.580 align:middle line:84%
would be, how does the
ghost want to be seen,

00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:51.290 align:middle line:84%
and how do you choose
to perceive it?

00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:54.790 align:middle line:84%
As in the example of, maybe
seeing a clothed ghost

00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:57.400 align:middle line:84%
if you don't want to see a naked
person, for whatever reason.

00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:58.405 align:middle line:90%
And who wouldn't, but hey.

00:39:58.405 --> 00:40:00.405 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How about another
question for Joshua?

00:40:00.405 --> 00:40:01.440 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir.

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:03.900 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Josh, you mentioned
during an investigation

00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:09.940 align:middle line:84%
it's possible for a dark entity
or a parasite to attach itself

00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:11.160 align:middle line:90%
to you.

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:13.490 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe you
can take that away

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:19.260 align:middle line:84%
from the location to
possibly your own residence

00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:21.830 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, and this
thing could stay attached?

00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And if so, what could you
do before the investigation

00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:29.595 align:middle line:84%
to kind of protect yourself from
getting these things attached

00:40:29.595 --> 00:40:30.170 align:middle line:90%
to you?

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:31.200 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Two good
questions, Josh.

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:32.220 align:middle line:90%
Do they follow you?

00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:33.650 align:middle line:90%
And how can you stop it?

00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:34.370 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: Yes.

00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:37.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, I used to think
that these things could not

00:40:37.310 --> 00:40:37.990 align:middle line:90%
follow you.

00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:41.130 align:middle line:90%
And then I found out otherwise.

00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:42.850 align:middle line:84%
I came back after
an investigation

00:40:42.850 --> 00:40:46.160 align:middle line:84%
one night from a very
haunted, negative place.

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:49.410 align:middle line:84%
And 5 o'clock in the morning
I was sitting in my office,

00:40:49.410 --> 00:40:50.920 align:middle line:90%
and all of a sudden, boom!

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:52.840 align:middle line:90%
My door flies open.

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:55.740 align:middle line:84%
A cold blast of air comes
in, papers fly everywhere,

00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:58.627 align:middle line:84%
and my stereo, which was turned
off, turns on full blast.

00:40:58.627 --> 00:40:59.710 align:middle line:90%
Scared the heck out of me.

00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And I realized,
there's something

00:41:01.330 --> 00:41:03.250 align:middle line:90%
that's just come into this room.

00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:05.300 align:middle line:84%
Now that's a dramatic
example, but the point

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:08.870 align:middle line:84%
is, whether you get something
stuck on you in your,

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:11.170 align:middle line:84%
what I call your wormhole
brain, that little connection

00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:14.340 align:middle line:84%
to consciousness, or you have
something big and dramatic

00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:18.720 align:middle line:84%
that storms in, I do think
that you can be followed.

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:22.520 align:middle line:84%
But you have to also realize
that if these things are

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:26.500 align:middle line:84%
dependent on our energy field
in order to have the strength

00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:30.390 align:middle line:84%
to interact with this
particular realm, then

00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:33.170 align:middle line:84%
you have a bit of control
over how much strength

00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:34.670 align:middle line:90%
you give to them.

00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:37.330 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of the
simplest things that you can do

00:41:37.330 --> 00:41:42.020 align:middle line:84%
is just have a good basic diet,
the same type of diet that

00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:44.290 align:middle line:84%
will prevent you from getting
a cold, maybe, you know.

00:41:44.290 --> 00:41:45.539 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Why would that work?

00:41:45.539 --> 00:41:48.290 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: Well, because
your entire system has better

00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:48.790 align:middle line:90%
energy.

00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:52.210 align:middle line:84%
Your weakness is not allowing
these things to work on you.

00:41:52.210 --> 00:41:54.632 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is that what
is a major factor?

00:41:54.632 --> 00:41:56.840 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: I think having
a great diet and your state

00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:57.740 align:middle line:90%
of mind.

00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:01.180 align:middle line:84%
Because if you are
a depressed person,

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:06.760 align:middle line:84%
it is going to weaken
your tolerance for ideas.

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:09.600 align:middle line:84%
If you're a strong person,
I mean, you have to realize,

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:13.420 align:middle line:84%
if we're dealing with an
energy field that's spiritual,

00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:15.470 align:middle line:84%
and we are spiritual
beings up here,

00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:17.467 align:middle line:84%
we have to combat it
on a spiritual level.

00:42:17.467 --> 00:42:19.050 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people of
envision themselves

00:42:19.050 --> 00:42:22.962 align:middle line:84%
circled with a shield of
white light, or say a prayer.

00:42:22.962 --> 00:42:24.670 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They say
throw sage around you?

00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:27.128 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: Yeah, well, all
these things are very intriguing

00:42:27.128 --> 00:42:32.790 align:middle line:84%
because, you know, for thousands
of years human beings have

00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:37.830 align:middle line:84%
relied on the concept that
faith of some kind is important

00:42:37.830 --> 00:42:40.360 align:middle line:90%
to combat the negative forces.

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And things that
symbolized this would

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:45.290 align:middle line:84%
be a crucifix, or a
Bible, or whatever.

00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:48.160 align:middle line:84%
It's not to say that
these things actually

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:50.390 align:middle line:90%
change the physical environment.

00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:52.350 align:middle line:84%
It's that these are
kind of trigger objects,

00:42:52.350 --> 00:42:55.390 align:middle line:84%
you might say, to
help you sort of focus

00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:57.160 align:middle line:84%
your mental intent
on whatever it

00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:59.924 align:middle line:84%
is that brings you
that sense of strength.

00:42:59.924 --> 00:43:01.590 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You brought
us some equipment.

00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:02.850 align:middle line:90%
I want you to pull it out.

00:43:02.850 --> 00:43:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to
test it on me and you

00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:08.398 align:middle line:84%
when we come right back
on "Beyond Belief."

00:43:08.398 --> 00:43:13.278 align:middle line:90%
>> [APPLAUSE]

00:43:13.278 --> 00:43:16.694 align:middle line:90%
>> [BACKGROUND MUSIC]

00:43:16.694 --> 00:43:24.502 align:middle line:90%


00:43:24.502 --> 00:43:25.071 align:middle line:90%
>> [APPLAUSE]

00:43:25.071 --> 00:43:27.570 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And welcome back to
"Beyond Belief" with Joshua P.

00:43:27.570 --> 00:43:28.070 align:middle line:90%
Warren.

00:43:28.070 --> 00:43:32.160 align:middle line:84%
OK, Josh, you brought me a World
War II helmet, or something.

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:33.237 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:43:33.237 --> 00:43:35.820 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: Well, you know, over
the years we have talked about

00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:37.620 align:middle line:90%
a lot of weird technology.

00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:41.915 align:middle line:84%
And I decided to bring you
maybe the weirdest thing I have.

00:43:41.915 --> 00:43:45.450 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You may have topped
yourself on this stuff.

00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:47.300 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: This little
box, right here,

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:52.300 align:middle line:84%
is the most
simple/complicated thing.

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:56.490 align:middle line:84%
It's called a radionics
box-type device.

00:43:56.490 --> 00:43:59.730 align:middle line:84%
But it is actually
what we specifically

00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:02.250 align:middle line:90%
call a spectralizer.

00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:05.140 align:middle line:84%
Because this is designed
to try to intensify

00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:08.640 align:middle line:84%
paranormal activity
using mind power alone.

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:10.045 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Mind power alone.

00:44:10.045 --> 00:44:13.140 align:middle line:84%
So the electricity from the
mind, basically, fuels that.

00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:15.710 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: Thay same energy that
we were showing that escaped

00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:18.824 align:middle line:84%
the body when we made the
Kirlian photo is presumably

00:44:18.824 --> 00:44:19.740 align:middle line:90%
what would power this.

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:20.698 align:middle line:90%
There are no batteries.

00:44:20.698 --> 00:44:22.990 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't plug into a wall.

00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:28.542 align:middle line:84%
The idea is that this thing can
actually tune your intention.

00:44:28.542 --> 00:44:32.250 align:middle line:84%
Now we don't know
exactly how this works.

00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:34.470 align:middle line:84%
But I wouldn't have it
here if it didn't work.

00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:36.570 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You want me to
put something on my head

00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:39.405 align:middle line:84%
that's electrical, and you
don't know exactly how it works?

00:44:39.405 --> 00:44:41.780 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: If I had it plugged
in, that would be a little

00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:48.490 align:middle line:84%
scary, but this is
actually a device that,

00:44:48.490 --> 00:44:50.990 align:middle line:90%
it enhances ghostly activity.

00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:54.460 align:middle line:84%
Just like it did at that
castle in Transylvania.

00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And even though we're
not certain, precisely,

00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:58.719 align:middle line:84%
how it works, because
it does work so well,

00:44:58.719 --> 00:45:00.010 align:middle line:90%
we're really intrigued with it.

00:45:00.010 --> 00:45:03.740 align:middle line:84%
We think that this
helps us, as a conduit,

00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:06.540 align:middle line:84%
between that
mind/body relationship

00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:09.320 align:middle line:84%
and the environment
that essentially,

00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:11.910 align:middle line:84%
if we are living in this
sort of holographic medium

00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:14.850 align:middle line:84%
here, that there are
devices out there which

00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:17.960 align:middle line:84%
can tune the way that your
energy is being focused.

00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:19.380 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Who invented this?

00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:23.040 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: This was developed in
the early 1900s by a physician

00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:24.640 align:middle line:90%
named Albert Abrams.

00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Yeah, and
so you duplicated it?

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:29.590 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: Well, Dr. Molder
makes a lot of different

00:45:29.590 --> 00:45:31.919 align:middle line:84%
devices that are
radionically oriented.

00:45:31.919 --> 00:45:32.460 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:35.300 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: But the spectralizer
is the one that is specifically

00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:37.879 align:middle line:84%
designed for enhancing
the paranormal.

00:45:37.879 --> 00:45:39.170 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Does it make a noise?

00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:39.753 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: No.

00:45:39.753 --> 00:45:44.480 align:middle line:84%
It's a completely passive
device by all those standards.

00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And what you do,
basically, is use this

00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:53.690 align:middle line:84%
as a feedback and tuning
mechanism for your intention.

00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:55.640 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of
like, I could tell

00:45:55.640 --> 00:46:01.360 align:middle line:84%
you to drive from
here to New Mexico,

00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:03.921 align:middle line:84%
and you could probably drive
around and find your way there

00:46:03.921 --> 00:46:04.420 align:middle line:90%
eventually.

00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:07.179 align:middle line:84%
But if I give you a map, you're
going to get there much more

00:46:07.179 --> 00:46:07.970 align:middle line:90%
quickly, all right?

00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:08.690 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:12.990 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: And so this is almost
like a more efficient form

00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:17.140 align:middle line:84%
of trying to determine how
your intention is projected

00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:19.460 align:middle line:90%
in a paranormal scenario.

00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:23.080 align:middle line:84%
So here is essentially
how this thing would work.

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:24.820 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Should I put it on?

00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:25.864 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: Oh, not yet.

00:46:25.864 --> 00:46:27.280 align:middle line:84%
We don't want that
to happen, yet.

00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:28.821 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Don't want
to do that, yet.

00:46:28.821 --> 00:46:29.680 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: No.

00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:32.316 align:middle line:90%
This is called a stick pad.

00:46:32.316 --> 00:46:33.250 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:37.240 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: And you see how it's
made of a plastic material?

00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And if you stroke
it, you'll find

00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:41.860 align:middle line:84%
that it feels a little
bit sticky, right?

00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:44.529 align:middle line:84%
There's just a little bit
of surface adhesion there.

00:46:44.529 --> 00:46:46.570 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Yeah, it's got
little resistance to it.

00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:50.580 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: And this
is an input plate.

00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:54.280 align:middle line:84%
So because we're dealing
with a subjective science, so

00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:57.220 align:middle line:84%
to speak, what we
would do is figure out

00:46:57.220 --> 00:47:01.670 align:middle line:84%
what place that we want to
focus our intention on first.

00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:05.330 align:middle line:84%
So let's say we want to focus
on Hunyad Castle, right?

00:47:05.330 --> 00:47:07.080 align:middle line:84%
So the simplest
thing we could do

00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:09.730 align:middle line:84%
is put a picture
of Hunyad Castle

00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:12.090 align:middle line:84%
right here, or maybe some
objects from Hunyad Castle.

00:47:12.090 --> 00:47:12.856 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:47:12.856 --> 00:47:15.230 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: And it's almost
like a voodoo specimen, right?

00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:17.860 align:middle line:84%
This is going to represent
what we're focusing on.

00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:21.390 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing we want
to do is tune the device so

00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:24.530 align:middle line:84%
that you're directing your
intention onto that spot.

00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:26.700 align:middle line:84%
So next you would
put the helmet on.

00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:28.256 align:middle line:84%
Here we go folks,
drum roll, please.

00:47:28.256 --> 00:47:32.037 align:middle line:90%


00:47:32.037 --> 00:47:33.729 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: How I do I look?

00:47:33.729 --> 00:47:34.520 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Great.

00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:37.520 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: A Martian
miner, perhaps, right?

00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:38.020 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:39.890 align:middle line:84%
Actually, you know, George,
it looks good on you.

00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:41.855 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: We should do
this to Richard Hogland,

00:47:41.855 --> 00:47:42.896 align:middle line:90%
that's what we should do.

00:47:42.896 --> 00:47:44.480 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: Yeah,
he would like that.

00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:46.600 align:middle line:84%
So now, you've got
three knobs here

00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:48.100 align:middle line:84%
on the front of
your helmet, right?

00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:50.870 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I guess so.

00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:54.130 align:middle line:84%
So what you would
do is take one hand,

00:47:54.130 --> 00:47:58.690 align:middle line:84%
we'll say your right hand,
and stroke this stick plate.

00:47:58.690 --> 00:48:02.177 align:middle line:84%
And as you do that, you twist
one of the knobs on your helmet

00:48:02.177 --> 00:48:03.010 align:middle line:90%
with the other hand.

00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:04.426 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Oh, with
the other hand.

00:48:04.426 --> 00:48:07.215 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: And as you slowly
turn it from zero to 10 and you

00:48:07.215 --> 00:48:07.350 align:middle line:90%
stroke--

00:48:07.350 --> 00:48:08.370 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Am I
going the right way?

00:48:08.370 --> 00:48:09.570 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: Yep, you're
going the right way.

00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:12.310 align:middle line:84%
There will come a point when
it will suddenly fill stickier.

00:48:12.310 --> 00:48:13.610 align:middle line:90%
It's almost like it changes.

00:48:13.610 --> 00:48:14.520 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah, like right now.

00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:14.810 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: Boom!

00:48:14.810 --> 00:48:15.690 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's like glue.

00:48:15.690 --> 00:48:17.773 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: Then leave that
knob right where it is.

00:48:17.773 --> 00:48:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And you do this the same
thing with the second knob.

00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:21.654 align:middle line:84%
And whenever you
get a stick, you'll

00:48:21.654 --> 00:48:23.570 align:middle line:84%
know that the knob is
in the correct position?

00:48:23.570 --> 00:48:24.490 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: That one
happened sooner.

00:48:24.490 --> 00:48:24.940 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: Yep.

00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:25.530 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Why?

00:48:25.530 --> 00:48:28.480 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: Well, you -- you're
finding a frequency, or a rate,

00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:29.320 align:middle line:90%
as they call it.

00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:33.880 align:middle line:84%
So a three digit number is what
we're going to come up with.

00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:34.909 align:middle line:90%
So once you have it--

00:48:34.909 --> 00:48:35.450 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:48:35.450 --> 00:48:42.320 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: OK, so now, it looks
like your rate is about 6, 4,

00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:43.910 align:middle line:90%
and 5.

00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:44.410 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:48:44.410 --> 00:48:44.790 align:middle line:90%
645.

00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:46.040 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What does that mean?

00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:48.550 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: So that means,
this location, this castle,

00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:51.930 align:middle line:84%
is represented by a
particular rate, 645.

00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:54.847 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Now I know how Johnny
Carson felt when he was doing

00:48:54.847 --> 00:48:55.870 align:middle line:90%
stuff like this.

00:48:55.870 --> 00:49:00.380 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: And so now, you want
to write that particular rate

00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:03.650 align:middle line:84%
down, because you can use that
as a reference for what you

00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:04.900 align:middle line:90%
want to do to that location.

00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:06.030 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:08.279 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: So the second
thing you would do is say OK,

00:49:08.279 --> 00:49:10.320 align:middle line:84%
what do I want to have
happen at that location?

00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:12.060 align:middle line:90%
Do I want rocks to be thrown?

00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:13.229 align:middle line:90%
Do I want to see a ghost?

00:49:13.229 --> 00:49:14.270 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I project that?

00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:15.811 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: Yes, you
would think that.

00:49:15.811 --> 00:49:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And as you do that, you
also would write something,

00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:21.160 align:middle line:84%
or place something here
that would indicate that.

00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:23.790 align:middle line:84%
You could get a little model
of Casper the Friendly Ghost,

00:49:23.790 --> 00:49:25.386 align:middle line:84%
if you wanted to,
and stick it there.

00:49:25.386 --> 00:49:26.760 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you, to
be serious, you

00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:28.920 align:middle line:84%
could take one of these
pebbles that I have,

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:30.650 align:middle line:84%
that was thrown at
the castle, and you

00:49:30.650 --> 00:49:32.060 align:middle line:90%
could put that on there.

00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:33.150 align:middle line:84%
Something that would
represent the activity.

00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:35.690 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do you have to put
whatever you're thinking about

00:49:35.690 --> 00:49:36.456 align:middle line:90%
on this?

00:49:36.456 --> 00:49:37.330 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: Yes, yeah.

00:49:37.330 --> 00:49:39.350 align:middle line:84%
You need to put it
on the input plate.

00:49:39.350 --> 00:49:40.580 align:middle line:90%
And once you do that--

00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:42.045 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So if I was
thinking of Pam Anderson,

00:49:42.045 --> 00:49:43.390 align:middle line:84%
we'd put a little Pam
Anderson picture there?

00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:44.723 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: That's exactly right.

00:49:44.723 --> 00:49:47.219 align:middle line:84%
And we could manifest Pam
Anderson, if we're very lucky.

00:49:47.219 --> 00:49:49.260 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, but what
if something went wrong?

00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:51.575 align:middle line:90%
What would she look like then?

00:49:51.575 --> 00:49:52.200 align:middle line:90%
Phyllis Diller.

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:54.650 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: Yeah, it
would be hard to tell.

00:49:54.650 --> 00:49:57.040 align:middle line:84%
If you stroke the plate
and you go through

00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:59.460 align:middle line:84%
and you adjust each
one of these knobs,

00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:02.670 align:middle line:84%
then you come up with
a particular rate

00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:06.580 align:middle line:84%
for Hunyad Castle
being haunted, right?

00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:09.697 align:middle line:84%
So you'd end up with a rate
that would be 13 digits long.

00:50:09.697 --> 00:50:11.780 align:middle line:84%
You would have one, two,
three on your head there,

00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:13.020 align:middle line:90%
and you would have 10 here.

00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:14.670 align:middle line:84%
Are you doing this
at the castle?

00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: No, you would do
this anywhere else you want.

00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:18.930 align:middle line:84%
You can do at your house before
you even go to Transylvania.

00:50:18.930 --> 00:50:19.610 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:50:19.610 --> 00:50:23.360 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: And so, once you have
a rate which is, in this case,

00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:27.690 align:middle line:84%
a 13 digit number that
represents your intention being

00:50:27.690 --> 00:50:31.060 align:middle line:84%
focused on the haunting
activity there,

00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:33.860 align:middle line:84%
you can leave the
machine just like it is,

00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:35.410 align:middle line:84%
and it will enhance
the activity.

00:50:35.410 --> 00:50:37.810 align:middle line:84%
Or-- and this is the
amazing thing-- now

00:50:37.810 --> 00:50:41.860 align:middle line:84%
that you have a rate, if you
don't want paranormal activity

00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:45.390 align:middle line:84%
to happen, you simply turn
each one of these knobs

00:50:45.390 --> 00:50:47.600 align:middle line:90%
to the inverse position.

00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:50.500 align:middle line:84%
So for example, each
one of these knobs

00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:52.060 align:middle line:90%
goes from zero to 10.

00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:55.710 align:middle line:84%
Well if one knob has a six
which represents the place being

00:50:55.710 --> 00:51:00.120 align:middle line:84%
haunted, you'd say 10 minus
6, and you would turn it to 4.

00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And if one knob has a three,
you'd say what's 10 minus 3,

00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:04.750 align:middle line:90%
and you would turn to 7.

00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And then, you could
actually adjust these knobs

00:51:07.390 --> 00:51:11.700 align:middle line:84%
to the rate for the
place not being haunted,

00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:13.530 align:middle line:84%
and you would be
projecting that intention.

00:51:13.530 --> 00:51:16.197 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You could turn a
place into a haunted place with

00:51:16.197 --> 00:51:17.030 align:middle line:90%
something like this?

00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:18.154 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: That's the idea.

00:51:18.154 --> 00:51:19.890 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: The
entities will show up,

00:51:19.890 --> 00:51:22.352 align:middle line:84%
because they feel like
you're sending them a signal?

00:51:22.352 --> 00:51:24.560 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: Either that, or
you are literally creating

00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:25.740 align:middle line:90%
a thought form.

00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:29.107 align:middle line:84%
That you are taking that energy
that exists within your body

00:51:29.107 --> 00:51:30.190 align:middle line:90%
and you are projecting it.

00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:32.162 align:middle line:90%
And this is just the head band.

00:51:32.162 --> 00:51:33.870 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is that like
a version of this?

00:51:33.870 --> 00:51:35.280 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: Yeah,
except this one,

00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:37.040 align:middle line:84%
because this one doesn't
have dials on it.

00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:37.815 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Why don't
you wear that one?

00:51:37.815 --> 00:51:38.398 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: OK.

00:51:38.398 --> 00:51:40.994 align:middle line:84%
We'll both look
crazy, here we go.

00:51:40.994 --> 00:51:42.220 align:middle line:90%
What do you think, guys?

00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:43.150 align:middle line:90%
Are we studs?

00:51:43.150 --> 00:51:45.300 align:middle line:84%
Ladies, is it
getting hot in here?

00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:46.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.980 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Josh, are you
thinking of a steak tonight?

00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:50.010 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: I am.

00:51:50.010 --> 00:51:51.140 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Huh?

00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:52.306 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: How did you know?

00:51:52.306 --> 00:51:53.692 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You
projected it to me.

00:51:53.692 --> 00:51:56.150 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: It's like
the Matrix in here.

00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:57.462 align:middle line:90%
So this--

00:51:57.462 --> 00:51:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: By the way, I would
change that other thought you

00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:01.840 align:middle line:90%
had.

00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:02.840 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: That's right.

00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:06.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, we are on TV, now, so
we can't illustrate that.

00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:10.580 align:middle line:84%
But this is a great
way to experiment

00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:12.180 align:middle line:90%
with projecting your intention.

00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And I swear, if
it didn't work, I

00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:15.310 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't be showing it to you.

00:52:15.310 --> 00:52:18.460 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What if people
used this for evil purposes?

00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:21.130 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: It can be used
for any purpose you want.

00:52:21.130 --> 00:52:23.940 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you know I've talked on
your program about the Wishing

00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:24.749 align:middle line:90%
Machine, right?

00:52:24.749 --> 00:52:26.040 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yes, I remember that.

00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: This is a version
of the Wishing Machine.

00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:32.400 align:middle line:84%
So that means that, even
though this one was designed

00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:35.150 align:middle line:84%
specifically for
paranormal activity, which

00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:38.350 align:middle line:84%
is why we call this version
the spectralizer, because it's

00:52:38.350 --> 00:52:43.610 align:middle line:84%
a spectral materializer,
still, a very basic type

00:52:43.610 --> 00:52:47.370 align:middle line:84%
of box like this can be used to
magnify any intention that you

00:52:47.370 --> 00:52:49.785 align:middle line:84%
have, be it positive
or negative.

00:52:49.785 --> 00:52:52.102 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Let me feel that.

00:52:52.102 --> 00:52:53.310 align:middle line:90%
>> WARREN: It's just plastic.

00:52:53.310 --> 00:52:58.400 align:middle line:84%
Now you can see, these are
truly handmade in a workshop.

00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is not the kind of
thing you'd run to Walmart

00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:02.210 align:middle line:90%
and buy.

00:53:02.210 --> 00:53:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's important
for the technician who

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:09.830 align:middle line:84%
makes these things to
make each one in a very

00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:13.590 align:middle line:84%
unique customized way,
especially for the purpose

00:53:13.590 --> 00:53:16.080 align:middle line:84%
that you think you
will use it for.

00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:17.270 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's ingenious.

00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:19.853 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: Well, the very fact
that it works in the paranormal

00:53:19.853 --> 00:53:22.020 align:middle line:84%
field, it tells us something
about that mind/body

00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:23.460 align:middle line:90%
environment relationship.

00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:25.950 align:middle line:84%
If I took this same
device, and I gave it

00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:28.710 align:middle line:84%
to a person who
lived 500 years ago,

00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:30.600 align:middle line:84%
it might not work
for that person,

00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:33.540 align:middle line:84%
because that person--
this would be so foreign.

00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:37.440 align:middle line:84%
But we grew up in a day and
age when we liked things

00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:40.070 align:middle line:84%
with knobs and
switches and wires.

00:53:40.070 --> 00:53:43.150 align:middle line:84%
We associate that with it
actually working and making

00:53:43.150 --> 00:53:44.340 align:middle line:90%
something happen.

00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:48.640 align:middle line:84%
So this may be just an advanced
type of device that actually

00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:52.960 align:middle line:84%
takes the potential that
we have to manifest things,

00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:59.280 align:middle line:84%
and gives us the facility
to literally manifest it

00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:01.040 align:middle line:84%
and tune it for a
particular purpose.

00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:01.480 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's fantastic.

00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:03.210 align:middle line:90%
How do people get a hold of you?

00:54:03.210 --> 00:54:04.210 align:middle line:90%
How do they monitor you?

00:54:04.210 --> 00:54:05.293 align:middle line:90%
What's your website, Josh?

00:54:05.293 --> 00:54:08.252 align:middle line:84%
>> WARREN: My website
is joshuapwarren.com.

00:54:08.252 --> 00:54:10.300 align:middle line:84%
I always tell everybody,
there's no period

00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:13.020 align:middle line:84%
after the P. So go
to joshuapwarren.com,

00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:17.370 align:middle line:84%
you can see some great pictures,
video footage, and some

00:54:17.370 --> 00:54:19.370 align:middle line:84%
of the wild experiments
that we continue

00:54:19.370 --> 00:54:21.387 align:middle line:90%
to do to break new ground.
