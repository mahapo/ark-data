they are all key components
to the organs in our bodies.

They govern everything
to our physical health

00:04:46.686 --> 00:04:50.323 align:middle line:84%

to this big space

00:04:50.323 --> 00:04:52.392 align:middle line:84%
around you called
the auric field.

00:04:52.392 --> 00:04:54.828 align:middle line:84%
So, there is layers
to that auric field

me is the reason that we end

I worked on people who have
fibromyalgia, arthritis,

00:06:09.235 --> 00:06:14.174 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of issues, and when I
go back in due processing work

00:06:14.174 --> 00:06:18.645 align:middle line:84%
and deeper work with them on
that emotional body level,

00:06:18.645 --> 00:06:22.682 align:middle line:84%
always, there is a component
that's literally stored

00:06:22.682 --> 00:06:25.785 align:middle line:84%
in the body that's
causing this illness.

00:06:25.785 --> 00:06:28.855 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies are like,
you know, big closets

00:06:28.855 --> 00:06:30.990 align:middle line:84%
and we experience
something emotionally

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.726 align:middle line:84%

I'm not going to do with that.

00:06:53.613 --> 00:06:56.449 align:middle line:84%

00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:01.521 align:middle line:84%
>> SG: I'm a big
fan of meditation.

00:07:01.521 --> 00:07:07.293 align:middle line:84%
I feel that meditation is the
key for all of us to get back

00:07:07.293 --> 00:07:10.730 align:middle line:84%
to who we are, our
original consciousness.

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.132 align:middle line:84%
Meditation slows
down our breathing

00:07:13.132 --> 00:07:15.101 align:middle line:90%
and helps us to center.

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:18.004 align:middle line:84%
And if someone isn't able
to meditate like a lot

00:07:18.004 --> 00:07:20.340 align:middle line:84%
of people call me and say, "I
just don't know how to meditate

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:22.475 align:middle line:84%
and it's hard, and
it's frustrating

00:07:22.475 --> 00:07:26.946 align:middle line:84%
and I get really distracted," we
just do a little bit at a time

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:30.617 align:middle line:84%
and start with some easy
exercises that get us more

00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:32.485 align:middle line:90%
into a meditative state.

00:07:32.485 --> 00:07:33.953 align:middle line:90%
Breathing is huge.

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:36.356 align:middle line:84%
Most people who are under
stress aren't, you know,

00:07:36.356 --> 00:07:38.825 align:middle line:84%
they're breathing it's
like really shallow

00:07:38.825 --> 00:07:41.995 align:middle line:84%
and they're not taking
deeper breaths and just--

00:07:41.995 --> 00:07:42.829 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Calming down.

00:07:42.829 --> 00:07:44.464 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Calming down, yeah.

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:46.866 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: I mean, I remember
when I use to play baseball

00:07:46.866 --> 00:07:49.302 align:middle line:84%
in that little league, you know,
right before I get the bat,

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:51.137 align:middle line:84%
I was, you know,
nervous and stuff.

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:57.377 align:middle line:84%
But when you get to the plate
whether it's in life or baseball

00:07:57.377 --> 00:08:03.316 align:middle line:84%
and you take that long slow whoo
[phonetic] you do feel better.

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:04.083 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: You do.

00:08:04.083 --> 00:08:06.052 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: How does that one?

00:08:06.052 --> 00:08:07.820 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Well, it's the same.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.155 align:middle line:84%
I mean when you start
to meditate,

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:12.926 align:middle line:84%
you take in that deep breath
way deep in your belly

00:08:12.926 --> 00:08:15.595 align:middle line:84%
and you're exhaling it out,
you know, for those of you

00:08:15.595 --> 00:08:18.364 align:middle line:84%
who are fans of taking
yoga class, it's the same.

00:08:18.364 --> 00:08:19.465 align:middle line:90%
It's a yogic breath.

00:08:19.465 --> 00:08:22.235 align:middle line:84%
It's really going
deep into the belly,

00:08:22.235 --> 00:08:24.804 align:middle line:90%
expanding ribs and exhaling.

00:08:24.804 --> 00:08:27.941 align:middle line:84%
You know, I dance professional
for ten years and I know,

00:08:27.941 --> 00:08:30.843 align:middle line:84%
when I was back stage and
totally nervous, you know,

00:08:30.843 --> 00:08:31.878 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting ready to go on.

00:08:31.878 --> 00:08:33.079 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: The butterflies, right?

00:08:33.079 --> 00:08:35.214 align:middle line:84%
>> SG: Yeah, butterflies
and that's all it took was

00:08:35.214 --> 00:08:38.551 align:middle line:84%
that deep, you know,
breath and getting in touch

00:08:38.551 --> 00:08:42.188 align:middle line:84%
with usually something that
was a little bit like you know,

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:45.058 align:middle line:84%
like you just wanted
to go for it.

00:08:45.058 --> 00:08:46.359 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you felt
that in baseball.

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:48.962 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: I do that now before
every speaking engagement

00:08:48.962 --> 00:08:49.796 align:middle line:90%
that I'm on.

00:08:49.796 --> 00:08:51.431 align:middle line:90%
You know, when I'm back stage,

00:08:51.431 --> 00:08:55.134 align:middle line:84%
I'll just take one long deep
breath and how would I go.

00:08:55.134 --> 00:08:55.835 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Right.

00:08:55.835 --> 00:08:56.402 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: And it's perfect.

00:08:56.402 --> 00:08:56.970 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Right.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:57.770 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: It works.

00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:59.472 align:middle line:90%
And that works really well.

00:08:59.472 --> 00:09:03.142 align:middle line:84%
Talk to me about psychic
vampires because I want to talk

00:09:03.142 --> 00:09:04.677 align:middle line:90%
about negative energy.

00:09:04.677 --> 00:09:06.045 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Right.

00:09:06.045 --> 00:09:07.981 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: This people, some of
them know what they're doing,

00:09:07.981 --> 00:09:08.915 align:middle line:90%
others don't.

00:09:08.915 --> 00:09:10.283 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:09:10.283 --> 00:09:11.784 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Well, my experience

00:09:11.784 --> 00:09:13.987 align:middle line:84%
of psychic vampiring
[phonetic] is people

00:09:13.987 --> 00:09:22.562 align:middle line:84%
who are using the ability
to maybe look into something

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:27.734 align:middle line:84%
or kind of connect with the
person and I call it sourcing,

00:09:27.734 --> 00:09:29.168 align:middle line:90%
sourcing their energy.

00:09:29.168 --> 00:09:33.306 align:middle line:84%
I went to see a woman once
who did a huge presentation

00:09:33.306 --> 00:09:37.744 align:middle line:84%
and the gal who was with me
was you know, like crumbling

00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:38.911 align:middle line:90%
as we were sitting there.

00:09:38.911 --> 00:09:42.415 align:middle line:84%
She was getting a
migraine, headache and we--

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:44.350 align:middle line:84%
my husband was down,
and sitting lower,

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:47.320 align:middle line:84%
we couldn't all sit together
and he was like practically

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.390 align:middle line:84%
in a coma in his sit, you
know, asleep and everybody

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:53.026 align:middle line:84%
in the audience was
sort of like fading.

00:09:53.026 --> 00:09:56.362 align:middle line:90%
And I tuned in and I saw cords.

00:09:56.362 --> 00:10:00.566 align:middle line:84%
She had cords going from her
to everybody in the audience

00:10:00.566 --> 00:10:03.302 align:middle line:84%
to their heads and she
was literally sourcing the

00:10:03.302 --> 00:10:05.071 align:middle line:90%
information out.

00:10:05.071 --> 00:10:07.040 align:middle line:84%
This is you know, when you
find someone who's psychic

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.742 align:middle line:84%
and they're going, well little
Johnny had a blue jacket on

00:10:09.742 --> 00:10:11.144 align:middle line:90%
and blue, you know, blue shoes

00:10:11.144 --> 00:10:14.280 align:middle line:84%
and they're being
really detailed about it.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.450 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, that person
is sourcing that information

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:18.951 align:middle line:90%
from the other person.

00:10:18.951 --> 00:10:20.787 align:middle line:84%
I don't personally
work that way.

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:22.021 align:middle line:90%
I don't agree with that.

00:10:22.021 --> 00:10:24.490 align:middle line:90%
My information comes from divine

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:28.094 align:middle line:84%
and if it's not coming then
divine doesn't want the person

00:10:28.094 --> 00:10:29.128 align:middle line:90%
to know.

00:10:29.128 --> 00:10:31.998 align:middle line:90%
It-- This way of sourcing

00:10:31.998 --> 00:10:37.070 align:middle line:84%
or vampiring energy can be very
hurtful to people and I know

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:40.173 align:middle line:84%
that this person that was with
me and my husband and myself.

00:10:40.173 --> 00:10:41.941 align:middle line:84%
We all suffered really
bad headaches

00:10:41.941 --> 00:10:43.476 align:middle line:90%
when we left this event.

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:44.777 align:middle line:90%
And many people we ran

00:10:44.777 --> 00:10:48.448 align:middle line:84%
into afterwards also had
headaches the next day and--

00:10:48.448 --> 00:10:51.351 align:middle line:84%
it's now that, you know, some
people mean to do these things

00:10:51.351 --> 00:10:53.286 align:middle line:90%
and they're vicious about it

00:10:53.286 --> 00:10:54.787 align:middle line:84%
and some people mean
to do these things--

00:10:54.787 --> 00:10:55.855 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: It's just them.

00:10:55.855 --> 00:10:57.356 align:middle line:84%
>> SG: -- because they
don't know better.

00:10:57.356 --> 00:10:59.425 align:middle line:84%
They don't-- they
have not trained.

00:10:59.425 --> 00:11:02.795 align:middle line:84%
They haven't work with someone
who understands, you know,

00:11:02.795 --> 00:11:05.765 align:middle line:84%
what this work really
means and what it's about.

00:11:05.765 --> 00:11:11.637 align:middle line:84%
So, I'm very cautious about,
you know, who I talk to.

00:11:11.637 --> 00:11:15.007 align:middle line:84%
I believe everyone should be
cautious about who you talk to

00:11:15.007 --> 00:11:18.611 align:middle line:84%
and whom you're asking to
do healing work or whatever.

00:11:18.611 --> 00:11:21.447 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a lot of people
out there who are new at it.

00:11:21.447 --> 00:11:22.982 align:middle line:90%
They're excited about it

00:11:22.982 --> 00:11:25.351 align:middle line:84%
but they don't know
what they're doing yet.

00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:29.255 align:middle line:84%
And so, people need to have
maybe a little more awareness

00:11:29.255 --> 00:11:30.356 align:middle line:90%
and training.

00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:31.991 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: I'm going to tell
you, the funny story

00:11:31.991 --> 00:11:34.394 align:middle line:84%
of a guy named Andy [assumed
spelling] at St. Louis

00:11:34.394 --> 00:11:38.598 align:middle line:84%
who would go to the
Ritz-Carlton lobby bar and sit

00:11:38.598 --> 00:11:40.800 align:middle line:90%
at the corner of the bar.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.070 align:middle line:84%
I would notice every
time he was there,

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:47.039 align:middle line:84%
that everybody else
sat at the other end.

00:11:47.039 --> 00:11:49.442 align:middle line:90%
They left spaces next to him.

00:11:49.442 --> 00:11:51.511 align:middle line:90%
Nobody sat next to him.

00:11:51.511 --> 00:11:54.547 align:middle line:84%
And then, as the day or
the night progressed,

00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:57.350 align:middle line:84%
people would completely
leave that area,

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:59.552 align:middle line:84%
living poor little Andy
there in the corner

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:02.421 align:middle line:90%
by himself, time and time again.

00:12:02.421 --> 00:12:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And I watched this guy and then,
I got close to him physically

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.897 align:middle line:84%
and I could feel this
negativity coming from him.

00:12:10.897 --> 00:12:15.268 align:middle line:84%
Wasn't a bad person at all,
but when you would talk to him,

00:12:15.268 --> 00:12:17.270 align:middle line:90%
everything was negative.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:19.972 align:middle line:84%
My life's not going well,
this is not going well,

00:12:19.972 --> 00:12:23.609 align:middle line:84%
my wife's getting a divorce,
my children don't like me.

00:12:23.609 --> 00:12:24.610 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Right.

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:25.678 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And after
five minutes of that,

00:12:25.678 --> 00:12:26.946 align:middle line:90%
you wanted to run out the room.

00:12:26.946 --> 00:12:30.716 align:middle line:84%
Well, this guy was
emptying the lounge.

00:12:30.716 --> 00:12:33.686 align:middle line:84%
He'd be perfect in
Vegas as a cooler.

00:12:33.686 --> 00:12:36.022 align:middle line:84%
You know, walking around
people who are winning.

00:12:36.022 --> 00:12:38.424 align:middle line:84%
I mean he would just
suck the energy right

00:12:38.424 --> 00:12:39.559 align:middle line:90%
out of the atmosphere.

00:12:39.559 --> 00:12:41.727 align:middle line:90%
It was horrible.

00:12:41.727 --> 00:12:43.629 align:middle line:84%
And I sat down with
him one day and I said,

00:12:43.629 --> 00:12:45.131 align:middle line:84%
"Andy I think you've
got a problem."

00:12:45.131 --> 00:12:46.499 align:middle line:90%
And he said, "What?

00:12:46.499 --> 00:12:49.869 align:middle line:84%
What?" I said, "Do you ever
wonder why nobody sits down next

00:12:49.869 --> 00:12:52.839 align:middle line:84%
to you when you're at a
bar or any place you go?"

00:12:52.839 --> 00:12:55.708 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Well, I
thought about that a lot,

00:12:55.708 --> 00:12:57.510 align:middle line:90%
but I don't know why."

00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:59.679 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Everything out
of your mouth is energy.

00:12:59.679 --> 00:13:02.548 align:middle line:84%
I could feel negativity
coming off your body.

00:13:02.548 --> 00:13:05.318 align:middle line:84%
It's-- It's coming
out of your pores.

00:13:05.318 --> 00:13:07.453 align:middle line:90%
You need to change some things."

00:13:07.453 --> 00:13:08.721 align:middle line:90%
And he said, "How do you that?"

00:13:08.721 --> 00:13:10.556 align:middle line:90%
I said, "I don't know.

00:13:10.556 --> 00:13:11.924 align:middle line:90%
But go and find out.

00:13:11.924 --> 00:13:15.294 align:middle line:84%
You know, talk to somebody
who understands this."

00:13:15.294 --> 00:13:16.629 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Right.

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:18.731 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And he came back a couple
months later and I noticed

00:13:18.731 --> 00:13:22.602 align:middle line:84%
that more people were
migrating to his end of the bar.

00:13:22.602 --> 00:13:25.371 align:middle line:84%
And I went up and talked
to him and he had changed

00:13:25.371 --> 00:13:27.773 align:middle line:84%
about 70 percent
of his negativity.

00:13:27.773 --> 00:13:29.108 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Wow, that's great.

00:13:29.108 --> 00:13:30.776 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And, you know, he'd
fixed himself, he worked some--

00:13:30.776 --> 00:13:31.978 align:middle line:90%
he worked it out with his wife.

00:13:31.978 --> 00:13:34.847 align:middle line:84%
He was taking his
kids out more often.

00:13:34.847 --> 00:13:38.985 align:middle line:84%
He was doing what he had to do
to get rid of that negativity.

00:13:38.985 --> 00:13:39.819 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: That's great.

00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:40.987 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: And people sensed that.

00:13:40.987 --> 00:13:42.121 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: That's great.

00:13:42.121 --> 00:13:43.656 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: It's amazing how
the body picks on that.

00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:45.458 align:middle line:84%
>> SG: Well that's--
that's the energy field.

00:13:45.458 --> 00:13:47.126 align:middle line:90%
That's what I was talking about.

00:13:47.126 --> 00:13:49.562 align:middle line:84%
Our energy is emitting
everything

00:13:49.562 --> 00:13:51.731 align:middle line:90%
in our auric field around us.

00:13:51.731 --> 00:13:56.802 align:middle line:84%
And what we hope for, what I
teach when I work with people is

00:13:56.802 --> 00:13:59.205 align:middle line:84%
to ground the energy
from the chakras.

00:13:59.205 --> 00:14:02.341 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are, you know,
walking around with their energy

00:14:02.341 --> 00:14:05.244 align:middle line:84%
from their chakras just
blasting the world.

00:14:05.244 --> 00:14:07.013 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how many
people have walked

00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:10.549 align:middle line:84%
in to a big corporate meeting
and, you know, like somebody

00:14:10.549 --> 00:14:13.452 align:middle line:84%
in the meeting is not happy and
you feel it in your stomach,

00:14:13.452 --> 00:14:14.220 align:middle line:90%
right, when you walk in--

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.021 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Or you could tell.

00:14:15.021 --> 00:14:16.255 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: -- yeah you can tell.

00:14:16.255 --> 00:14:18.624 align:middle line:84%
You just go, "Oh something's
bad in this meeting."

00:14:18.624 --> 00:14:20.826 align:middle line:84%
You know, you feel it in
your stomach and, you know,

00:14:20.826 --> 00:14:24.630 align:middle line:84%
people are just inappropriately
kind of blasting their energy

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:27.500 align:middle line:84%
through out, you know, their
society, their communities

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:30.536 align:middle line:84%
and they're not taking
responsibility

00:14:30.536 --> 00:14:32.104 align:middle line:90%
for what they're doing.

00:14:32.104 --> 00:14:33.372 align:middle line:90%
It's very powerful.

00:14:33.372 --> 00:14:36.275 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's super
powerful with their energy

00:14:36.275 --> 00:14:37.977 align:middle line:90%
and that's what he was doing.

00:14:37.977 --> 00:14:41.480 align:middle line:84%
He was just emitting all
these energy and negativity

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.783 align:middle line:90%
so then his vibration is lower.

00:14:43.783 --> 00:14:45.618 align:middle line:84%
It lowers the vibration
in the room.

00:14:45.618 --> 00:14:47.586 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: His health
probably was affected.

00:14:47.586 --> 00:14:50.423 align:middle line:84%
>> SG: His health-- how many
people have called me and said,

00:14:50.423 --> 00:14:53.793 align:middle line:84%
"You know, I've got his cancer
and I've got this problem and,

00:14:53.793 --> 00:14:57.196 align:middle line:84%
you know, my life is bad, and
this is horrible," and on and on

00:14:57.196 --> 00:14:59.398 align:middle line:84%
and on and on and then it's
like, why do I have cancer

00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:02.935 align:middle line:84%
and it's like, OK let's go
over what you just told me.

00:15:02.935 --> 00:15:03.502 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:15:03.502 --> 00:15:04.270 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: So yeah.

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:05.237 align:middle line:90%
It makes a big difference.

00:15:05.237 --> 00:15:06.639 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: You have to change it.

00:15:06.639 --> 00:15:10.943 align:middle line:84%
Let's take some quick calls from
Sonja who's got something here.

00:15:10.943 --> 00:15:11.744 align:middle line:90%
I said calls.

00:15:11.744 --> 00:15:13.112 align:middle line:90%
It's my radio show.

00:15:13.112 --> 00:15:14.447 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:15:14.447 --> 00:15:15.848 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:15:15.848 --> 00:15:18.384 align:middle line:84%
>> Sonja, when you're doing
your healing for somebody,

00:15:18.384 --> 00:15:22.488 align:middle line:84%
do you actually go into
their higher self or whatever

00:15:22.488 --> 00:15:24.657 align:middle line:84%
to see what their
life path is to see

00:15:24.657 --> 00:15:26.892 align:middle line:84%
if maybe they shouldn't
be healed?

00:15:26.892 --> 00:15:28.194 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Absolutely.

00:15:28.194 --> 00:15:32.732 align:middle line:84%
I always ask the person's
higher self before I start.

00:15:32.732 --> 00:15:34.433 align:middle line:90%
Can I do this work?

00:15:34.433 --> 00:15:38.004 align:middle line:84%
And I never do my work without
asking to be in alignment

00:15:38.004 --> 00:15:39.905 align:middle line:84%
with the will of
God and the God as--

00:15:39.905 --> 00:15:41.540 align:middle line:84%
with the highest
good of everyone

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.242 align:middle line:84%
and the highest good
of the universe.

00:15:43.242 --> 00:15:48.147 align:middle line:84%
And then, if I'm shown that this
person needs to be, you know,

00:15:48.147 --> 00:15:50.616 align:middle line:84%
healed in terms of
an actual healing

00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:52.485 align:middle line:84%
or maybe there's
something karmic [phonetic]

00:15:52.485 --> 00:15:53.786 align:middle line:90%
that needs to be clear.

00:15:53.786 --> 00:15:57.656 align:middle line:84%
They've got a past life that
is really what's the cause

00:15:57.656 --> 00:15:59.358 align:middle line:90%
of the problem?

00:15:59.358 --> 00:16:02.528 align:middle line:84%
I'll go in and do that
kind of karmic clearing.

00:16:02.528 --> 00:16:06.332 align:middle line:84%
But absolutely, I
always ask and check in.

00:16:06.332 --> 00:16:06.899 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:16:06.899 --> 00:16:07.533 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:16:07.533 --> 00:16:08.234 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Thank you.

00:16:08.234 --> 00:16:09.802 align:middle line:90%
>> Would you still take,

00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:12.671 align:middle line:84%
'cause I think traditional
medicine is good.

00:16:12.671 --> 00:16:16.976 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of doctor's
care and I would not--

00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:19.779 align:middle line:84%
not do whatever they
recommended.

00:16:19.779 --> 00:16:20.846 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Right.

00:16:20.846 --> 00:16:21.781 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: But I would
still do alternative,

00:16:21.781 --> 00:16:23.115 align:middle line:90%
I would do faith healing,

00:16:23.115 --> 00:16:27.319 align:middle line:84%
and I would do whatever else
it takes to supplement that.

00:16:27.319 --> 00:16:28.654 align:middle line:90%
Would you do the same thing?

00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:30.523 align:middle line:84%
I mean, God forbid, if you
were sick, would you still go

00:16:30.523 --> 00:16:32.892 align:middle line:84%
to a traditional doctor
and say, "Help me?"

00:16:32.892 --> 00:16:33.426 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Absolutely.

00:16:33.426 --> 00:16:34.427 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:16:34.427 --> 00:16:36.128 align:middle line:84%
>> SG: Absolutely,
I love my doctor.

00:16:36.128 --> 00:16:37.463 align:middle line:90%
I love her.

00:16:37.463 --> 00:16:40.299 align:middle line:84%
And I love my acupuncturist
and I love my natural path.

00:16:40.299 --> 00:16:45.137 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that we all
work in concert together.

00:16:45.137 --> 00:16:49.608 align:middle line:84%
We are all important
components of healing.

00:16:49.608 --> 00:16:51.343 align:middle line:90%
I'm addressing the energy body.

00:16:51.343 --> 00:16:55.181 align:middle line:84%
I'm addressing what's going
on deep in the emotional body

00:16:55.181 --> 00:16:58.784 align:middle line:84%
and what got stuck inside
the person as to why it needs

00:16:58.784 --> 00:17:03.622 align:middle line:84%
to be healed so that that part
can be literally taken out

00:17:03.622 --> 00:17:05.356 align:middle line:90%
and new energy comes in.

00:17:05.356 --> 00:17:07.192 align:middle line:84%
'Cause when we have
like, you know,

00:17:07.192 --> 00:17:09.628 align:middle line:90%
betrayal stuck into our body.

00:17:09.628 --> 00:17:12.498 align:middle line:84%
Let's say we got betrayal
under the right rib cage,

00:17:12.498 --> 00:17:17.103 align:middle line:84%
and we literally get that out in
a session and it's no longer--

00:17:17.103 --> 00:17:19.839 align:middle line:84%
it's like, you know,
then the body gets filled

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:21.841 align:middle line:90%
up with a higher vibration.

00:17:21.841 --> 00:17:24.442 align:middle line:84%
And if you're a satellite,
you just shifted

00:17:24.442 --> 00:17:26.745 align:middle line:90%
to now you're watching TNT.

00:17:26.745 --> 00:17:28.681 align:middle line:84%
You're no longer watching
the Discovery Channel,

00:17:28.681 --> 00:17:32.818 align:middle line:84%
you just switched because you're
no longer a vibrational match

00:17:32.818 --> 00:17:34.553 align:middle line:90%
for that betrayal.

00:17:34.553 --> 00:17:37.389 align:middle line:84%
So, it's all of it
works in concert.

00:17:37.389 --> 00:17:38.023 align:middle line:90%
And believe me--

00:17:38.023 --> 00:17:39.391 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Absolutely.

00:17:39.391 --> 00:17:41.861 align:middle line:84%
>> SG: I'm the first one to
go see my doctor if I need to.

00:17:41.861 --> 00:17:45.598 align:middle line:84%
But I'm also the first
one to try and go

00:17:45.598 --> 00:17:48.968 align:middle line:84%
through anything natural
in a natural way of healing

00:17:48.968 --> 00:17:50.369 align:middle line:90%
because I believe in that.

00:17:50.369 --> 00:17:53.172 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Well, you know, I've
look at our bodies like a car.

00:17:53.172 --> 00:17:56.675 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, do you fix
the car after it breaks down

00:17:56.675 --> 00:17:59.912 align:middle line:84%
or do you try to maintain
it so it doesn't break down.

00:17:59.912 --> 00:18:02.314 align:middle line:84%
And I would more rather
do that, you know.

00:18:02.314 --> 00:18:03.115 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Right.

00:18:03.115 --> 00:18:04.116 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Take care of yourself

00:18:04.116 --> 00:18:06.452 align:middle line:84%
so you will minimize
future problems.

00:18:06.452 --> 00:18:07.753 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Right.

00:18:07.753 --> 00:18:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's a great
analogy because I also feel

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:13.692 align:middle line:84%
that this is the
car we're given.

00:18:13.692 --> 00:18:16.028 align:middle line:84%
You know, when we're
souls and we're coming

00:18:16.028 --> 00:18:18.964 align:middle line:84%
through to earth,
this is your vehicle.

00:18:18.964 --> 00:18:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't take
care of it then--

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.434 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Nobody else will.

00:18:22.434 --> 00:18:23.836 align:middle line:84%
>> SG: -- you know,
nobody else will.

00:18:23.836 --> 00:18:27.806 align:middle line:84%
And that goes for
the earth, you know.

00:18:27.806 --> 00:18:30.676 align:middle line:84%
We're given this
beautiful planet to live on,

00:18:30.676 --> 00:18:33.712 align:middle line:84%
and if we don't take
care of her,

00:18:33.712 --> 00:18:37.850 align:middle line:84%
she who's so generously gives
to us day in and day out,

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:40.753 align:middle line:84%
then we aren't going
to have a place to be.

00:18:40.753 --> 00:18:41.987 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:18:41.987 --> 00:18:43.489 align:middle line:84%
Well we use the latest
technology on Beyond Belief

00:18:43.489 --> 00:18:47.960 align:middle line:84%
so let's go to our Beyond Belief
camp for a question for Sonja.

00:18:49.161 --> 00:18:50.462 align:middle line:84%
>> Joy: Hey Sonja, I'm
Joy [assumed spelling]

00:18:50.462 --> 00:18:51.330 align:middle line:90%
from Colorado.

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:52.665 align:middle line:90%
And I was wondering

00:18:52.665 --> 00:18:54.533 align:middle line:84%
if a person's destructive
patterns can change even though

00:18:54.533 --> 00:18:58.971 align:middle line:84%
they've been doing
them for a long time.

00:18:58.971 --> 00:19:00.539 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Destructive habits.

00:19:00.539 --> 00:19:04.109 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Absolutely.

00:19:04.109 --> 00:19:08.380 align:middle line:84%
Again, when we set up with
all of these things that go

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:12.618 align:middle line:84%
on in our lives, I believe
we form and develop most

00:19:12.618 --> 00:19:16.355 align:middle line:84%
of our patterns from the time
we're in the womb until we're

00:19:16.355 --> 00:19:17.823 align:middle line:90%
about three years old.

00:19:17.823 --> 00:19:20.492 align:middle line:84%
We're imprinting
everything, our parents, our--

00:19:20.492 --> 00:19:23.796 align:middle line:84%
the environment and we
have this big bag of karma

00:19:23.796 --> 00:19:26.999 align:middle line:84%
that we just brought with
us from previous lives.

00:19:26.999 --> 00:19:29.301 align:middle line:84%
So, we've got all these
stuff that we're dealing with

00:19:29.301 --> 00:19:32.371 align:middle line:84%
and we're basically
setting up the template

00:19:32.371 --> 00:19:35.808 align:middle line:84%
for how we're going
to be as adults.

00:19:35.808 --> 00:19:37.776 align:middle line:90%
And as adults what do we do?

00:19:37.776 --> 00:19:41.046 align:middle line:84%
You know, we've got this
grand theater called life,

00:19:41.046 --> 00:19:43.315 align:middle line:90%
and we get to set up the stage.

00:19:43.315 --> 00:19:47.553 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm going to play myself as
the child, and then I'm going

00:19:47.553 --> 00:19:50.122 align:middle line:84%
to play my mother and then
I'm going to play my father

00:19:50.122 --> 00:19:52.691 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to act out all
of these emotional woundings

00:19:52.691 --> 00:19:56.528 align:middle line:84%
that I have from childhood
so that I can heal.

00:19:56.528 --> 00:19:59.899 align:middle line:84%
So, we keep doing this
setting up incredible,

00:19:59.899 --> 00:20:01.166 align:middle line:90%
incredible productions.

00:20:01.166 --> 00:20:03.636 align:middle line:84%
You know, Shakespeare
would be proud.

00:20:03.636 --> 00:20:09.174 align:middle line:84%
But we have to really find a
way to find those patterns,

00:20:09.174 --> 00:20:11.777 align:middle line:84%
to understand what
the patterns are,

00:20:11.777 --> 00:20:16.315 align:middle line:84%
why wouldn't we feel betrayed by
someone, we go into depression.

00:20:16.315 --> 00:20:19.351 align:middle line:84%
And from that depression,
we go into some kind

00:20:19.351 --> 00:20:23.188 align:middle line:84%
of habitual habit
like we eat too much.

00:20:23.188 --> 00:20:26.492 align:middle line:84%
And then from that pattern,
we go into some kind

00:20:26.492 --> 00:20:29.161 align:middle line:84%
of deeper depression
where we feel suicidal.

00:20:29.161 --> 00:20:30.963 align:middle line:84%
You know, everybody's
patterns are different.

00:20:30.963 --> 00:20:35.934 align:middle line:84%
I'm giving that as an example to
what you are literally plugging

00:20:35.934 --> 00:20:37.970 align:middle line:90%
into when you connect with one

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:40.372 align:middle line:84%
of those core emotional
woundings.

00:20:40.372 --> 00:20:42.775 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Well, you know,
we're all human beings.

00:20:42.775 --> 00:20:46.912 align:middle line:84%
We all suffer from ups and
downs in life, tragedies,

00:20:46.912 --> 00:20:50.082 align:middle line:84%
all of us will go through
things, family, episodes.

00:20:50.082 --> 00:20:53.285 align:middle line:90%
I'm going through one right now.

00:20:53.285 --> 00:20:56.488 align:middle line:84%
But you have to be able to
pull yourself out of that and--

00:20:56.488 --> 00:20:57.723 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Absolutely.

00:20:57.723 --> 00:21:00.993 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: -- you know, as
frustrating and as maybe sad

00:21:00.993 --> 00:21:05.898 align:middle line:84%
or devastating that it might
be, you have to be able to stay

00:21:05.898 --> 00:21:08.233 align:middle line:90%
above that or just pulls you in.

00:21:08.233 --> 00:21:09.501 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Right.

00:21:09.501 --> 00:21:11.837 align:middle line:84%
Right. And that's keeping
our vibration really high.

00:21:11.837 --> 00:21:15.974 align:middle line:84%
That's where meditation and
yoga and exercise and listening

00:21:15.974 --> 00:21:17.209 align:middle line:90%
to your favorite music

00:21:17.209 --> 00:21:20.045 align:middle line:84%
and watching your
favorite movie and--

00:21:20.045 --> 00:21:21.714 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Listening to your
favorite radio show.

00:21:21.714 --> 00:21:22.848 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Exactly!

00:21:22.848 --> 00:21:23.816 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Or watching your
favorite comedy show.

00:21:23.816 --> 00:21:24.917 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Exactly.

00:21:24.917 --> 00:21:26.652 align:middle line:84%
And that's what keeps
your vibration high.

00:21:26.652 --> 00:21:32.024 align:middle line:84%
So, when your vibration is
high, you're not likely to go

00:21:32.024 --> 00:21:36.061 align:middle line:84%
into that, you know, that stuff
that's brewing with your family

00:21:36.061 --> 00:21:39.431 align:middle line:84%
or with, you know, a loved one,
someone that's having problems.

00:21:39.431 --> 00:21:45.704 align:middle line:84%
We have to really avoid--
when we let our energy drop,

00:21:45.704 --> 00:21:51.744 align:middle line:84%
we are really going into a
space where it becomes difficult

00:21:51.744 --> 00:21:55.414 align:middle line:84%
for us to be helpful
to others, right?

00:21:55.414 --> 00:21:58.751 align:middle line:84%
We have to keep our energy high
and I don't mean getting high

00:21:58.751 --> 00:22:00.085 align:middle line:84%
like we're all, you
know, crazy--

00:22:00.085 --> 00:22:00.986 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:22:00.986 --> 00:22:01.820 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: -- happy all the time.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:03.555 align:middle line:90%
I just mean a higher vibration.

00:22:03.555 --> 00:22:05.557 align:middle line:84%
And we get that through
meditation.

00:22:05.557 --> 00:22:07.593 align:middle line:90%
We get that through exercise.

00:22:07.593 --> 00:22:10.662 align:middle line:84%
We get that through
watching Coast to Coast.

00:22:10.662 --> 00:22:16.001 align:middle line:84%
So, so it's really something
that we can all apply ourselves

00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:20.372 align:middle line:84%
to doing more but I think
beyond that is stepping back

00:22:20.372 --> 00:22:22.708 align:middle line:84%
and observing what
is the duality.

00:22:22.708 --> 00:22:25.544 align:middle line:84%
See, this is where I think
we get into the problem is

00:22:25.544 --> 00:22:28.180 align:middle line:84%
that things are good
or they're bad.

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:29.515 align:middle line:90%
They're right or they're wrong.

00:22:29.515 --> 00:22:31.750 align:middle line:84%
They're hot, they're
cold, the duality,

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:37.089 align:middle line:84%
and when we put our energy into
the good or we put our energy

00:22:37.089 --> 00:22:40.726 align:middle line:84%
into the bad, or
literally engaging ourselves

00:22:40.726 --> 00:22:42.194 align:middle line:90%
in the duality.

00:22:42.194 --> 00:22:45.164 align:middle line:84%
When we engage ourselves
in the duality in that way,

00:22:45.164 --> 00:22:47.299 align:middle line:90%
we're creating more karma.

00:22:47.299 --> 00:22:49.635 align:middle line:84%
Last time I checked, we don't
want to be creating more karma.

00:22:49.635 --> 00:22:50.702 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:22:50.702 --> 00:22:51.870 align:middle line:84%
>> SG: We want to be
resolving our karma.

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:55.140 align:middle line:84%
So, so, we have to
learn to step back.

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:57.109 align:middle line:84%
Again, this is through
meditation

00:22:57.109 --> 00:22:58.911 align:middle line:90%
and observed the duality.

00:22:58.911 --> 00:23:01.647 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Let's take one more
final question for Sonja.

00:23:01.647 --> 00:23:03.682 align:middle line:90%
Who's got one for us?

00:23:03.682 --> 00:23:06.018 align:middle line:90%
Anybody? Yes, ma'am.

00:23:06.018 --> 00:23:06.919 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Sonja.

00:23:06.919 --> 00:23:08.120 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Hi.

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.689 align:middle line:84%
>> What is your daily
regiment in order to keep

00:23:10.689 --> 00:23:14.726 align:middle line:84%
that energy high and
stay in a good place?

00:23:14.726 --> 00:23:17.696 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Yeah, give us
your prescription.

00:23:17.696 --> 00:23:22.367 align:middle line:84%
>> SG: Well, a daily regiment
would be to really connect

00:23:22.367 --> 00:23:24.736 align:middle line:84%
with the inner child
first thing,

00:23:24.736 --> 00:23:26.839 align:middle line:84%
when you're up in the
morning, I don't care

00:23:26.839 --> 00:23:29.441 align:middle line:84%
if you're brushing you're
teeth or you're taking the dog

00:23:29.441 --> 00:23:33.245 align:middle line:84%
for a walk, see that
little child that's you,

00:23:33.245 --> 00:23:36.148 align:middle line:84%
maybe she's a baby,
he's a toddler,

00:23:36.148 --> 00:23:38.984 align:middle line:90%
10-years old, and just connect.

00:23:38.984 --> 00:23:42.821 align:middle line:84%
Love that child, feel the
love from that child to you,

00:23:42.821 --> 00:23:46.225 align:middle line:84%
and I'm telling you that
will set so many things

00:23:46.225 --> 00:23:48.393 align:middle line:90%
on a really good path.

00:23:48.393 --> 00:23:52.131 align:middle line:84%
Because you're acknowledging
that part of you that really

00:23:52.131 --> 00:23:54.666 align:middle line:84%
for most of us doesn't
get acknowledged.

00:23:54.666 --> 00:23:58.203 align:middle line:84%
Nobody handed us a book
and said, "Oh, you're 18.

00:23:58.203 --> 00:24:00.439 align:middle line:84%
You need to parent
yourself now."

00:24:00.439 --> 00:24:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's a huge part of us
being adults is being able

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:07.913 align:middle line:90%
to parent that child within us

00:24:07.913 --> 00:24:10.315 align:middle line:84%
because we all have
an inner child.

00:24:10.315 --> 00:24:13.452 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: How important is that
inner self then within us

00:24:13.452 --> 00:24:16.889 align:middle line:84%
to be able to heal
us, keep us healthy?

00:24:16.889 --> 00:24:20.325 align:middle line:84%
>> SG: I think-- I think it is
the key to all of us healing.

00:24:20.325 --> 00:24:21.527 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:24:21.527 --> 00:24:24.263 align:middle line:84%
I mean I'm like crazy
cakes about inner child

00:24:24.263 --> 00:24:28.834 align:middle line:84%
or because I feel like it's the
one component that helps us get

00:24:28.834 --> 00:24:32.104 align:middle line:84%
to the parts of us
that we've suppressed.

00:24:32.104 --> 00:24:33.372 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the bodies,
the closet,

00:24:33.372 --> 00:24:36.341 align:middle line:84%
and we store all these
emotional things in the body?

00:24:36.341 --> 00:24:39.878 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of that has to do with
the emotional woundings we have

00:24:39.878 --> 00:24:43.148 align:middle line:84%
from our childhood
and from past lives.

00:24:43.148 --> 00:24:48.720 align:middle line:84%
So, we've got this whole,
you know, deep well of stuff.

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:52.758 align:middle line:84%
And if we're giving some kind
of acknowledgement and approval

00:24:52.758 --> 00:24:56.161 align:middle line:84%
to that inner child, we're not
necessarily going to go outside

00:24:56.161 --> 00:24:59.298 align:middle line:84%
of ourselves to our
parents or our coworkers

00:24:59.298 --> 00:25:01.934 align:middle line:84%
or our boss looking
for approval.

00:25:01.934 --> 00:25:05.270 align:middle line:84%
We've already given
ourselves at approval.

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:08.473 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: So, give me an
example, somebody calls you,

00:25:08.473 --> 00:25:11.109 align:middle line:84%
why did they call you,
and then what do you do.

00:25:11.109 --> 00:25:14.746 align:middle line:84%
>> SG: Oh, well, I get
called for a lot of reasons.

00:25:14.746 --> 00:25:16.548 align:middle line:90%
People who have illness.

00:25:16.548 --> 00:25:19.985 align:middle line:84%
People who are struggling
with their relationship.

00:25:19.985 --> 00:25:25.557 align:middle line:84%
I've get-- I get calls from
people who are maybe dealing

00:25:25.557 --> 00:25:27.326 align:middle line:90%
with something in their family.

00:25:27.326 --> 00:25:30.562 align:middle line:84%
They know that something
happened when they were young.

00:25:30.562 --> 00:25:33.332 align:middle line:84%
I have people who have
been abducted that call me.

00:25:33.332 --> 00:25:35.968 align:middle line:84%
Lots of UFO and alien
experiences.

00:25:35.968 --> 00:25:36.668 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: OK.

00:25:36.668 --> 00:25:37.369 align:middle line:90%
You're like a counselor.

00:25:37.369 --> 00:25:38.570 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Big time.

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:39.972 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:25:39.972 --> 00:25:42.874 align:middle line:84%
>> SG: And, you know, and then
I'm usually clearing something

00:25:42.874 --> 00:25:48.580 align:middle line:84%
karmically for them or grandma
just died a week ago, you know,

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:52.184 align:middle line:84%
there's grandma and I'm talking
to her and helping them resolve

00:25:52.184 --> 00:25:54.419 align:middle line:84%
or have some clearing because
they weren't able to be

00:25:54.419 --> 00:25:56.455 align:middle line:90%
with grandma when she passed.

00:25:56.455 --> 00:25:57.956 align:middle line:90%
So, there're lots of reasons.

00:25:57.956 --> 00:26:01.727 align:middle line:84%
Not to mention, you know, CEOs
of large businesses who come

00:26:01.727 --> 00:26:05.063 align:middle line:84%
and want to know about
their business practice.

00:26:05.063 --> 00:26:05.597 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Really?

00:26:05.597 --> 00:26:06.698 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Yeah.

00:26:06.698 --> 00:26:07.232 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Their products
and stuff like that?

00:26:07.232 --> 00:26:07.766 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Yeah.

00:26:07.766 --> 00:26:09.101 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, part--

00:26:09.101 --> 00:26:10.469 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Should we come out with
this and things like that?

00:26:10.469 --> 00:26:11.269 align:middle line:84%
>> SG: Partnering and yeah,
marketing, all kinds of stuff.

00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:12.404 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Interesting.

00:26:12.404 --> 00:26:14.006 align:middle line:84%
Of course you were
born with this.

00:26:14.006 --> 00:26:14.940 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Yeah.

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:17.009 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: But how did
you develop it?

00:26:17.009 --> 00:26:22.414 align:middle line:84%
>> SG: Well, I was-- I was
really out there as a child,

00:26:22.414 --> 00:26:24.082 align:middle line:90%
I mean my earliest memory too,

00:26:24.082 --> 00:26:28.120 align:middle line:84%
I remember seeing the spirit
realm and my poor mom.

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:30.155 align:middle line:84%
She didn't know what
to do with me.

00:26:30.155 --> 00:26:33.291 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I grew up back
in the day when we played

00:26:33.291 --> 00:26:35.093 align:middle line:84%
in the woods and, you
know, you weren't scared

00:26:35.093 --> 00:26:36.828 align:middle line:90%
of people in the neighborhood.

00:26:36.828 --> 00:26:38.730 align:middle line:90%
Everybody knew everybody and so,

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:41.633 align:middle line:84%
I grew up around the [inaudible]
realm and really connecting

00:26:41.633 --> 00:26:45.937 align:middle line:84%
with trees and nature and
I, you know, I-- I didn't--

00:26:45.937 --> 00:26:48.073 align:middle line:84%
mom didn't know what to
do with me, so she put me

00:26:48.073 --> 00:26:51.576 align:middle line:84%
in ballet class, and I ended
up training in classical ballet

00:26:51.576 --> 00:26:53.745 align:middle line:84%
and went on to dance
professionally.

00:26:53.745 --> 00:26:57.416 align:middle line:84%
And as I was pursuing
my career, I, you know,

00:26:57.416 --> 00:26:58.784 align:middle line:84%
I was still seeing
things shouldn't--

00:26:58.784 --> 00:26:59.584 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Sure.

00:26:59.584 --> 00:27:00.719 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: -- really out there.

00:27:00.719 --> 00:27:04.156 align:middle line:84%
And so, I found my first
teacher and I really--

00:27:04.156 --> 00:27:07.592 align:middle line:84%
thank God for her because she
helped me understand what was

00:27:07.592 --> 00:27:09.728 align:middle line:84%
going on for me and
she helped me

00:27:09.728 --> 00:27:14.833 align:middle line:84%
to develop what was already
there but give me a platform

00:27:14.833 --> 00:27:18.070 align:middle line:84%
of integrity and
clarity to work from.

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:19.037 align:middle line:90%
And it was--

00:27:19.037 --> 00:27:21.273 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Was it trial
and error Sonja?

00:27:21.273 --> 00:27:22.674 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: I think everything is.

00:27:22.674 --> 00:27:26.745 align:middle line:84%
You know, you-- you know, I
always compare my healing work

00:27:26.745 --> 00:27:29.681 align:middle line:84%
to my ballet training and
that is that, you know,

00:27:29.681 --> 00:27:33.585 align:middle line:84%
as a ballet dancer, you know
you will always be in class.

00:27:33.585 --> 00:27:36.421 align:middle line:84%
You know, you know that you have
to take class to stay in shape.

00:27:36.421 --> 00:27:39.891 align:middle line:84%
You have to take class to
keep your technique good.

00:27:39.891 --> 00:27:43.195 align:middle line:84%
And there has never been a
day in my life as a healer

00:27:43.195 --> 00:27:47.899 align:middle line:84%
and as a-- as a visionary that I
have not worked with my teacher

00:27:47.899 --> 00:27:51.503 align:middle line:84%
and had some guidance and,
you know, my own processing

00:27:51.503 --> 00:27:54.840 align:middle line:84%
and I feel that this
kind of work

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:57.209 align:middle line:84%
and especially the
type of work that I do.

00:27:57.209 --> 00:27:59.711 align:middle line:90%
I'm just a firm believer

00:27:59.711 --> 00:28:03.248 align:middle line:84%
in people studying
and having teachers.

00:28:03.248 --> 00:28:05.617 align:middle line:84%
Because when we look at
a violinist, you know,

00:28:05.617 --> 00:28:07.219 align:middle line:84%
you don't pick up a
violin and say, "Gee,

00:28:07.219 --> 00:28:08.587 align:middle line:90%
I want to play the violin."

00:28:08.587 --> 00:28:10.088 align:middle line:90%
You know, it doesn't work.

00:28:10.088 --> 00:28:11.656 align:middle line:90%
Guaranteed it won't work.

00:28:11.656 --> 00:28:12.958 align:middle line:90%
You have to train.

00:28:12.958 --> 00:28:16.928 align:middle line:84%
You have to train with the
teacher and study and I feel

00:28:16.928 --> 00:28:20.532 align:middle line:84%
that that process helps
us to develop and grow

00:28:20.532 --> 00:28:23.835 align:middle line:84%
and over the course
of, you know, 30 years,

00:28:23.835 --> 00:28:25.937 align:middle line:84%
I've had three different
teachers all

00:28:25.937 --> 00:28:30.142 align:middle line:84%
of which have contributed
tremendously to my--

00:28:30.142 --> 00:28:32.244 align:middle line:90%
my work, to what I do.

00:28:32.244 --> 00:28:33.745 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And I'm sure
you've had good days

00:28:33.745 --> 00:28:35.614 align:middle line:90%
and bad days yourself, right?

00:28:35.614 --> 00:28:36.748 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Sure.

00:28:36.748 --> 00:28:38.450 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: How do you pull
yourself out of that?

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:39.451 align:middle line:90%
Meditation?

00:28:39.451 --> 00:28:39.985 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: I do.

00:28:39.985 --> 00:28:41.052 align:middle line:90%
I meditate.

00:28:41.052 --> 00:28:42.120 align:middle line:90%
I clear a lot.

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:43.522 align:middle line:90%
I do clearing.

00:28:43.522 --> 00:28:45.257 align:middle line:90%
I use cedar when I clear.

00:28:45.257 --> 00:28:46.024 align:middle line:90%
Can I show that?

00:28:46.024 --> 00:28:47.092 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah, what is that?

00:28:47.092 --> 00:28:48.460 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: This is cedar and--

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:49.461 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: From a cedar tree?

00:28:49.461 --> 00:28:50.495 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: This is from a cedar tree

00:28:50.495 --> 00:28:53.365 align:middle line:84%
but this is a cedar
tree in Arizona.

00:28:53.365 --> 00:28:54.032 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: OK.

00:28:54.032 --> 00:28:54.966 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

00:28:54.966 --> 00:28:56.334 align:middle line:84%
>> SG: Even though
I'm in Oregon.

00:28:56.334 --> 00:28:59.037 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to light it and I
promise I won't set you on fire.

00:28:59.037 --> 00:29:01.139 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:29:01.139 --> 00:29:02.340 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Watch the
alarm go on, right?

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:02.941 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: I know.

00:29:02.941 --> 00:29:04.209 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:29:04.209 --> 00:29:09.247 align:middle line:84%
OK. We got a little
bit of smoke going,

00:29:09.247 --> 00:29:12.150 align:middle line:84%
and then I just take
this smoke over my head.

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:13.852 align:middle line:90%
I take it under my feet.

00:29:13.852 --> 00:29:16.054 align:middle line:90%
I run it up and down and--

00:29:16.054 --> 00:29:17.122 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: What does that do?

00:29:17.122 --> 00:29:19.057 align:middle line:84%
>> SG: It's called
smudging and I want it--

00:29:19.057 --> 00:29:23.195 align:middle line:84%
I really want to share with you
that cedar is what clears us.

00:29:23.195 --> 00:29:26.164 align:middle line:90%
Cedar clears the space.

00:29:26.164 --> 00:29:28.700 align:middle line:90%
Sages use to blessings.

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:31.870 align:middle line:84%
So, a lot of people get
kind of misunderstood

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:36.808 align:middle line:84%
that sages use to-- to clear
us but sage is actually

00:29:36.808 --> 00:29:38.276 align:middle line:84%
like if you're having
a bad day and you want

00:29:38.276 --> 00:29:41.713 align:middle line:84%
to clear some negative vibes
around you, and you burn sage,

00:29:41.713 --> 00:29:43.715 align:middle line:90%
you're basically blessing it.

00:29:43.715 --> 00:29:44.850 align:middle line:90%
Oh, good. Negative vibes.

00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:45.550 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: You burn the whole--

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:46.651 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Stay with me.

00:29:46.651 --> 00:29:47.719 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: You generally
burn the whole thing?

00:29:47.719 --> 00:29:49.054 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: No.

00:29:49.054 --> 00:29:51.389 align:middle line:84%
No. You just light it up a
little bit, let it smoke and,

00:29:51.389 --> 00:29:53.425 align:middle line:84%
you know, let the smoke
come up, blow it out

00:29:53.425 --> 00:29:56.795 align:middle line:84%
and don't set off your fire
alarms and you can, you know,

00:29:56.795 --> 00:29:58.363 align:middle line:90%
you can clear your whole house.

00:29:58.363 --> 00:30:03.401 align:middle line:84%
I burn cedar everyday, but of
course I would because my job,

00:30:03.401 --> 00:30:06.538 align:middle line:84%
you know, I'm with people
and working all day long.

00:30:06.538 --> 00:30:08.773 align:middle line:84%
I think it's important
though that we take care

00:30:08.773 --> 00:30:09.941 align:middle line:90%
of our energy in this way.

00:30:09.941 --> 00:30:11.576 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Now, how's
doing it though,

00:30:11.576 --> 00:30:13.612 align:middle line:90%
is it the cedar or is it you?

00:30:13.612 --> 00:30:16.882 align:middle line:84%
>> SG: Well, the cedar
has a tremendous spirit.

00:30:16.882 --> 00:30:20.318 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I-- I connect
with the cedar spirit

00:30:20.318 --> 00:30:22.220 align:middle line:90%
when I'm using that plant.

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:26.157 align:middle line:84%
I always ask the tree before
I break cedar off to dry.

00:30:26.157 --> 00:30:28.526 align:middle line:90%
I leave an offering.

00:30:28.526 --> 00:30:30.762 align:middle line:84%
I think the cedar
is very powerful.

00:30:30.762 --> 00:30:31.863 align:middle line:90%
It's a part of the earth.

00:30:31.863 --> 00:30:33.365 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Just my luck to
use a Venus' flytrap

00:30:33.365 --> 00:30:35.200 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.234 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: No.

00:30:36.234 --> 00:30:38.637 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Some people
actually use a sage

00:30:38.637 --> 00:30:40.772 align:middle line:84%
to clean themselves
of bad spirits.

00:30:40.772 --> 00:30:41.439 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Yeah, and--

00:30:41.439 --> 00:30:41.940 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Same thing--

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:42.707 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: No.

00:30:42.707 --> 00:30:43.742 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: -- same principle.

00:30:43.742 --> 00:30:44.943 align:middle line:84%
>> SG: Yes but sage
is used to bless.

00:30:44.943 --> 00:30:48.546 align:middle line:84%
Sage is used in all
native tribes.

00:30:48.546 --> 00:30:50.215 align:middle line:90%
They use sage to blessings.

00:30:50.215 --> 00:30:53.251 align:middle line:84%
You get a pipe, it's
used to bless the pipe.

00:30:53.251 --> 00:30:56.488 align:middle line:84%
And it's after the pipe's
been cleared with smoke.

00:30:56.488 --> 00:30:58.523 align:middle line:90%
It's only for blessing things.

00:30:58.523 --> 00:31:00.225 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: People talk
a lot about karma.

00:31:00.225 --> 00:31:03.361 align:middle line:84%
And they say, "What goes
around comes around."

00:31:03.361 --> 00:31:05.130 align:middle line:90%
Do you believe that?

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:09.768 align:middle line:84%
>> SG: Well I believe in karma
big time but I also believe

00:31:09.768 --> 00:31:16.074 align:middle line:84%
that karma is something that we
create or we incur more karma

00:31:16.074 --> 00:31:20.312 align:middle line:84%
because we're letting our
energy go into the duality

00:31:20.312 --> 00:31:22.547 align:middle line:90%
or engaging our energy.

00:31:22.547 --> 00:31:25.317 align:middle line:84%
Oh that's so good, and you
can just feel how good it is.

00:31:25.317 --> 00:31:29.087 align:middle line:84%
Oh that's so bad, and then
we feel how bad it is.

00:31:29.087 --> 00:31:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And our energy is
going into it and work.

00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:33.558 align:middle line:90%
And we become a part of it.

00:31:33.558 --> 00:31:36.361 align:middle line:84%
We become a part of
the collective karma.

00:31:36.361 --> 00:31:39.998 align:middle line:84%
That's why we see things cycle
and recycle around the earth

00:31:39.998 --> 00:31:43.401 align:middle line:84%
with wars and-- and, oh boy
we've been down that road.

00:31:43.401 --> 00:31:44.869 align:middle line:90%
We fought that battle before.

00:31:44.869 --> 00:31:46.905 align:middle line:90%
Look, we're fighting it again.

00:31:46.905 --> 00:31:51.776 align:middle line:84%
And it's all a karmic thread
that we keep participating in.

00:31:51.776 --> 00:31:53.979 align:middle line:84%
So yes, what goes
around comes around.

00:31:53.979 --> 00:31:56.748 align:middle line:84%
But we have to take
responsibility

00:31:56.748 --> 00:31:58.450 align:middle line:84%
for what we're doing
with our energy

00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:00.785 align:middle line:90%
so we don't incur more karma.

00:32:00.785 --> 00:32:03.355 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: I thought karma was a
good thing though, generally.

00:32:03.355 --> 00:32:04.456 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: I don't--

00:32:04.456 --> 00:32:05.824 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: So, why don't
we want to incur more?

00:32:05.824 --> 00:32:07.459 align:middle line:84%
>> SG: I don't see
karma as a good thing.

00:32:07.459 --> 00:32:11.830 align:middle line:84%
I see karma as the
unresolved emotional woundings

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:14.666 align:middle line:84%
and components that
we didn't complete.

00:32:14.666 --> 00:32:17.135 align:middle line:84%
So, in the past life,
if you were beheaded --

00:32:17.135 --> 00:32:18.336 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: That's great.

00:32:18.336 --> 00:32:19.404 align:middle line:84%
>> SG: -- imagine many
people have been beheaded.

00:32:19.404 --> 00:32:22.407 align:middle line:84%
We come from a very
violent culture.

00:32:22.407 --> 00:32:23.441 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Sure.

00:32:23.441 --> 00:32:24.509 align:middle line:84%
>> SG: If you look
at history, I mean,

00:32:24.509 --> 00:32:26.678 align:middle line:84%
we've all been to
war, believe me.

00:32:26.678 --> 00:32:29.080 align:middle line:84%
And if you're-- if you got
your head on the chopping block

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.783 align:middle line:84%
and you're being accused of,
you know, being a heretic

00:32:31.783 --> 00:32:34.285 align:middle line:84%
and you know that you
didn't do anything wrong.

00:32:34.285 --> 00:32:35.787 align:middle line:90%
What's going through your mind?

00:32:35.787 --> 00:32:38.790 align:middle line:90%
The anxiety, fear, betrayal--

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:41.159 align:middle line:84%
how come no one's
saving me right now?

00:32:41.159 --> 00:32:42.460 align:middle line:84%
You know, you got a
lot of things going

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:45.797 align:middle line:84%
through your mind right
before your head is cut off.

00:32:45.797 --> 00:32:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And if that's the case, those
are the karmic pieces that go

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.936 align:middle line:90%
with you into the next lifetime.

00:32:51.936 --> 00:32:54.706 align:middle line:84%
So, the next lifetime
maybe you come back,

00:32:54.706 --> 00:32:57.075 align:middle line:90%
you're not male, you're female.

00:32:57.075 --> 00:32:58.710 align:middle line:84%
You're living in a
different culture

00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:02.047 align:middle line:84%
but you have chronic neck
pain, and no one can figure

00:33:02.047 --> 00:33:03.748 align:middle line:90%
out what's wrong with your neck.

00:33:03.748 --> 00:33:06.484 align:middle line:84%
I had a woman who called me,
she had chronic neck pain.

00:33:06.484 --> 00:33:07.685 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what
had happened.

00:33:07.685 --> 00:33:08.453 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: She was beheaded?

00:33:08.453 --> 00:33:09.754 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: She was beheaded.

00:33:09.754 --> 00:33:11.356 align:middle line:90%
She was hung in another life.

00:33:11.356 --> 00:33:14.826 align:middle line:84%
She obviously did not
agree with being beheaded.

00:33:14.826 --> 00:33:18.930 align:middle line:84%
So, she manifested being
hung in the next life.

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:22.000 align:middle line:84%
When I cleared all of this
karmically, this is someone

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.303 align:middle line:84%
who had CT-Scans and MRIs and
the doctors could not find--

00:33:25.303 --> 00:33:26.538 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Nothing there.

00:33:26.538 --> 00:33:27.605 align:middle line:84%
>> SG: -- they couldn't find
what was wrong with her.

00:33:27.605 --> 00:33:30.141 align:middle line:90%
I cleared her and all, gone.

00:33:30.141 --> 00:33:31.042 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Now, how'd
you cleared her?

00:33:31.042 --> 00:33:31.943 align:middle line:90%
What'd you do?

00:33:31.943 --> 00:33:33.611 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Well I cleared--

00:33:33.611 --> 00:33:38.249 align:middle line:84%
I cleared the karma between
her and those lifetimes.

00:33:38.249 --> 00:33:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And when I go in and clear
people, it's a whole process

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:46.958 align:middle line:84%
that I do but it's
definitely going in

00:33:46.958 --> 00:33:50.061 align:middle line:84%
and removing components
from the body.

00:33:50.061 --> 00:33:54.766 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Is it mystical,
what you do?

00:33:54.766 --> 00:33:55.467 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Yeah.

00:33:55.467 --> 00:33:56.401 align:middle line:90%
I think it's mystical.

00:33:56.401 --> 00:33:57.902 align:middle line:84%
I think it's working
with energy.

00:33:57.902 --> 00:33:59.504 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Are you tapping
into something?

00:33:59.504 --> 00:34:02.373 align:middle line:90%
Or is it you?

00:34:02.373 --> 00:34:03.141 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Oh George.

00:34:03.141 --> 00:34:03.842 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Somehow.

00:34:03.842 --> 00:34:04.976 align:middle line:90%
Some people would say,

00:34:04.976 --> 00:34:07.011 align:middle line:84%
you've got the ability
to do this, you know.

00:34:07.011 --> 00:34:11.249 align:middle line:84%
>> SG: Well, I mean I'm just
a humbled human being, I--

00:34:11.249 --> 00:34:14.085 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Or are you
like an antenna?

00:34:14.085 --> 00:34:15.487 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: I'm vessel.

00:34:15.487 --> 00:34:18.990 align:middle line:84%
I believe that God comes through
the roof and the goddess comes

00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:22.092 align:middle line:84%
through our feet and
it meets in our heart.

00:34:22.092 --> 00:34:24.762 align:middle line:90%
And that's the alchemy happens.

00:34:24.762 --> 00:34:27.866 align:middle line:84%
That's where the magic
happens is in our hearts.

00:34:27.866 --> 00:34:31.503 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
our greatest mission--

00:34:31.503 --> 00:34:34.005 align:middle line:84%
the mission statement
for humanity is to love

00:34:34.005 --> 00:34:36.708 align:middle line:84%
at the deepest level
of our beings.

00:34:36.708 --> 00:34:40.411 align:middle line:84%
So, as much as you love
your family and your spouses

00:34:40.411 --> 00:34:43.447 align:middle line:84%
and your loved ones, we
should be loving everybody

00:34:43.447 --> 00:34:46.284 align:middle line:90%
around the world that much.

00:34:46.284 --> 00:34:48.786 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Well you went through
a lot of experiences yourself

00:34:48.786 --> 00:34:51.055 align:middle line:84%
to reach the point
where you are at now.

00:34:51.055 --> 00:34:52.790 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:56.059 align:middle line:84%
>> SG: When we're
connecting with the earth,

00:34:56.059 --> 00:34:59.430 align:middle line:84%
and we're drawing that
energy up through our bodies

00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:02.901 align:middle line:84%
and we're grounding our
energy down into the earth

00:35:02.901 --> 00:35:06.171 align:middle line:84%
and we're receiving energy
from above, from the divine

00:35:06.171 --> 00:35:08.907 align:middle line:90%
through the tops of our heads.

00:35:08.907 --> 00:35:14.112 align:middle line:84%
We are igniting all
of it at our hearts.

00:35:14.112 --> 00:35:15.446 align:middle line:90%
And this is the magic.

00:35:15.446 --> 00:35:19.784 align:middle line:84%
This is the intense creativity
we all feel in our lives.

00:35:19.784 --> 00:35:23.521 align:middle line:84%
Whether we're baking a cake or
we're painting a masterpiece

00:35:23.521 --> 00:35:26.591 align:middle line:84%
or we're building a
[inaudible] in the backyard.

00:35:26.591 --> 00:35:29.127 align:middle line:90%
It all happens in the heart.

00:35:29.127 --> 00:35:32.263 align:middle line:84%
And our purpose for
being here is to love

00:35:32.263 --> 00:35:35.400 align:middle line:84%
at the deepest level
of our beings.

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:39.070 align:middle line:84%
So, what a greater place for
all of this incredible alchemy

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:41.372 align:middle line:90%
to happen then in your heart.

00:35:41.372 --> 00:35:43.875 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Interesting
metamorphosis there for you too.

00:35:43.875 --> 00:35:45.710 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Yeah, yeah very much.

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:50.315 align:middle line:84%
I had a client who--
whose father had passed

00:35:50.315 --> 00:35:54.118 align:middle line:84%
and it was just a week I think
from his passing and he came

00:35:54.118 --> 00:35:56.788 align:middle line:84%
through on the reading
and he said, "Honey,

00:35:56.788 --> 00:35:59.991 align:middle line:84%
I just want to tell you
what it's like over here."

00:35:59.991 --> 00:36:05.029 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "You know, we
believe that there's a review

00:36:05.029 --> 00:36:07.966 align:middle line:84%
on what we've done in our
lives that we're being kind

00:36:07.966 --> 00:36:10.168 align:middle line:90%
of reviewed on the other side."

00:36:10.168 --> 00:36:13.104 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "The review
isn't what we've done,

00:36:13.104 --> 00:36:16.374 align:middle line:84%
the review is how
much we've loved."

00:36:16.374 --> 00:36:19.611 align:middle line:84%
And he said that--
I'm going to cry.

00:36:19.611 --> 00:36:21.112 align:middle line:90%
He said that-- that--

00:36:21.112 --> 00:36:21.813 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Oh go ahead.

00:36:21.813 --> 00:36:22.347 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: -- he loved.

00:36:22.347 --> 00:36:22.847 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Cry.

00:36:22.847 --> 00:36:24.115 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: OK.

00:36:24.115 --> 00:36:26.884 align:middle line:84%
He said he loved his daughter
and his family so much

00:36:26.884 --> 00:36:29.420 align:middle line:84%
but that what he learned
on the other side was

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:31.623 align:middle line:84%
that he should have
loved everyone

00:36:31.623 --> 00:36:34.559 align:middle line:90%
that much around the world.

00:36:34.559 --> 00:36:35.560 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And it's a
big difference.

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.228 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Oh that just--

00:36:37.228 --> 00:36:39.397 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: You know, people
have talked about episodes

00:36:39.397 --> 00:36:44.502 align:middle line:84%
where a family member will
get killed by someone.

00:36:44.502 --> 00:36:47.305 align:middle line:84%
Whether a drunk driver
or a murderer.

00:36:47.305 --> 00:36:48.673 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Yeah.

00:36:48.673 --> 00:36:52.577 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And some people say,
"You just need to forgive them."

00:36:52.577 --> 00:36:53.278 align:middle line:90%
The killer.

00:36:53.278 --> 00:36:55.280 align:middle line:90%
The murderer.

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:58.082 align:middle line:84%
I'm not at that point, you
know, maybe it's my nine years

00:36:58.082 --> 00:36:59.784 align:middle line:84%
in the navy, I don't
know what it is.

00:36:59.784 --> 00:37:05.623 align:middle line:84%
But I could not justifiably
just forgive someone like that.

00:37:05.623 --> 00:37:07.158 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Right.

00:37:07.158 --> 00:37:09.961 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: A justifiable
accident perhaps,

00:37:09.961 --> 00:37:14.332 align:middle line:84%
but a murder, I couldn't
do that.

00:37:14.332 --> 00:37:17.969 align:middle line:84%
Now, am I lacking
something because of that?

00:37:17.969 --> 00:37:19.370 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: No, you're not.

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:21.205 align:middle line:90%
I think that's-- that's a--

00:37:21.205 --> 00:37:23.308 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: I mean how many of
you could forgive someone

00:37:23.308 --> 00:37:25.343 align:middle line:84%
who kills one of
your loved ones?

00:37:25.343 --> 00:37:26.210 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: That would be very hard.

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:26.778 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: You could.

00:37:26.778 --> 00:37:27.845 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Yeah.

00:37:27.845 --> 00:37:28.646 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. It's--

00:37:28.646 --> 00:37:29.881 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:37:29.881 --> 00:37:31.649 align:middle line:84%
Most of the people-- almost
all of them could not.

00:37:31.649 --> 00:37:32.917 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Right.

00:37:32.917 --> 00:37:36.921 align:middle line:84%
And it's something that,
again, if you were calling me

00:37:36.921 --> 00:37:40.725 align:middle line:84%
and telling me, "Sonja,
someone murdered my loved one."

00:37:40.725 --> 00:37:43.061 align:middle line:84%
I would, first of
all, want to look

00:37:43.061 --> 00:37:48.132 align:middle line:84%
at karmically what have
taken place between you

00:37:48.132 --> 00:37:50.768 align:middle line:90%
and those people in past lives

00:37:50.768 --> 00:37:54.172 align:middle line:84%
that has brought this
reoccurring into this life.

00:37:54.172 --> 00:37:59.510 align:middle line:84%
Because I believe that we're
just repeating and mixing

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:02.380 align:middle line:84%
up the karmic pieces
that we already have

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:05.283 align:middle line:84%
and we're trying to
heal those things.

00:38:05.283 --> 00:38:07.352 align:middle line:84%
Now, the fact that
it's happened again,

00:38:07.352 --> 00:38:09.954 align:middle line:84%
doesn't give you
any piece of mind.

00:38:09.954 --> 00:38:12.490 align:middle line:84%
But I always tell people
you couldn't forgive

00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:16.327 align:middle line:84%
but you can also hold
someone accountable.

00:38:16.327 --> 00:38:20.331 align:middle line:84%
And that accountability
part is the part

00:38:20.331 --> 00:38:22.433 align:middle line:90%
that I hear you talking about.

00:38:22.433 --> 00:38:24.102 align:middle line:90%
I hold these people accountable.

00:38:24.102 --> 00:38:25.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to forgive them

00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:27.972 align:middle line:84%
because I don't want
karma with this person.

00:38:27.972 --> 00:38:30.241 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to keep
coming back lifetime

00:38:30.241 --> 00:38:32.510 align:middle line:84%
after lifetime and
working this out.

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:36.881 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to simply hold them
accountable for what they did.

00:38:36.881 --> 00:38:39.217 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: I got to tell you my
Tommy [assumed spelling] story

00:38:39.217 --> 00:38:40.551 align:middle line:90%
in Vegas.

00:38:40.551 --> 00:38:43.020 align:middle line:84%
Tom [assumed spelling] and
I are playing Blackjack

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:45.223 align:middle line:90%
and we're sitting at a table

00:38:45.223 --> 00:38:47.792 align:middle line:84%
where a guy is sitting
between us.

00:38:47.792 --> 00:38:51.162 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very
strange Blackjack game.

00:38:51.162 --> 00:38:54.031 align:middle line:84%
Where if you put a little
dollar in the circle, and that--

00:38:54.031 --> 00:38:57.702 align:middle line:84%
if you get a Blackjack,
you get to spin the wheel

00:38:57.702 --> 00:38:59.337 align:middle line:90%
and you get whatever it says.

00:38:59.337 --> 00:39:00.705 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Right.

00:39:00.705 --> 00:39:03.374 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: It was from a dollar to
a thousand, up on the wheel.

00:39:03.374 --> 00:39:05.176 align:middle line:84%
So, we're playing and
I get a Blackjack.

00:39:05.176 --> 00:39:07.512 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, I had a
dollar in the circle

00:39:07.512 --> 00:39:09.914 align:middle line:90%
so that qualified as first spin.

00:39:09.914 --> 00:39:11.783 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Tom,
let's concentrate

00:39:11.783 --> 00:39:13.818 align:middle line:90%
on the thousand dollars.

00:39:13.818 --> 00:39:16.721 align:middle line:84%
I think we can move
the wheel, like that."

00:39:16.721 --> 00:39:18.923 align:middle line:90%
And he said, "Yeah, I'm game."

00:39:18.923 --> 00:39:22.593 align:middle line:84%
And the guy in the middle
goes, "It ain't going to work."

00:39:22.593 --> 00:39:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And we're looking at him and
he got this negative energy

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:29.033 align:middle line:84%
and he's loosing at
the table anyway.

00:39:29.033 --> 00:39:31.302 align:middle line:90%
And that's a different story.

00:39:31.302 --> 00:39:34.305 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, by looking
at Tom saying, "Look,

00:39:34.305 --> 00:39:35.306 align:middle line:90%
we'll do it without him.

00:39:35.306 --> 00:39:36.474 align:middle line:90%
So, let's do it."

00:39:36.474 --> 00:39:38.776 align:middle line:84%
And he kept saying,
"It's not going to work."

00:39:38.776 --> 00:39:42.547 align:middle line:84%
The guy spins the wheel and Tom
and I are thinking thousand,

00:39:42.547 --> 00:39:45.083 align:middle line:84%
thousand, and the thing's
clicking, you know.

00:39:45.083 --> 00:39:46.017 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Right.

00:39:46.017 --> 00:39:47.351 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: It's got a
zillion numbers

00:39:47.351 --> 00:39:50.922 align:middle line:84%
and it's clicking getting
close to the thousand.

00:39:50.922 --> 00:39:53.324 align:middle line:84%
And as it's ready
to hit the thousand,

00:39:53.324 --> 00:39:56.127 align:middle line:90%
the guy goes, "It won't work."

00:39:56.127 --> 00:39:59.096 align:middle line:90%
It stops right before that.

00:39:59.096 --> 00:40:00.865 align:middle line:90%
We won a dollar.

00:40:00.865 --> 00:40:04.202 align:middle line:84%
One more click would
have been a thousand.

00:40:04.202 --> 00:40:05.603 align:middle line:90%
I think it's his fault.

00:40:05.603 --> 00:40:06.704 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:40:06.704 --> 00:40:07.538 align:middle line:90%
He did it.

00:40:07.538 --> 00:40:08.206 align:middle line:90%
Don't you?

00:40:08.206 --> 00:40:09.006 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: There you go.

00:40:09.006 --> 00:40:09.607 align:middle line:90%
And I hold him accountable.

00:40:09.607 --> 00:40:11.242 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:40:11.242 --> 00:40:14.712 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: How do people get
there energy out of life?

00:40:14.712 --> 00:40:16.013 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:40:16.013 --> 00:40:18.983 align:middle line:84%
>> SG: So, the trick
is, is to step back

00:40:18.983 --> 00:40:21.352 align:middle line:90%
and observe the duality.

00:40:21.352 --> 00:40:24.121 align:middle line:84%
To realize that there are really
good things in the universe

00:40:24.121 --> 00:40:25.656 align:middle line:90%
and there's really bad.

00:40:25.656 --> 00:40:28.659 align:middle line:84%
And they both exist
and there is nothing

00:40:28.659 --> 00:40:34.132 align:middle line:84%
that we really truly have on
it other than the awareness

00:40:34.132 --> 00:40:36.033 align:middle line:90%
and the ability to observe.

00:40:36.033 --> 00:40:38.970 align:middle line:84%
To observe that this
is what's going on.

00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:41.405 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not going to
participate in it.

00:40:41.405 --> 00:40:42.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to stay centered.

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:47.311 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to stay in a
grounded place, and I'm going

00:40:47.311 --> 00:40:50.815 align:middle line:84%
to maintain a very high
vibration in my body,

00:40:50.815 --> 00:40:54.318 align:middle line:84%
in my being, and my
whole auric field.

00:40:54.318 --> 00:40:56.988 align:middle line:84%
So, by creating a
high vibration,

00:40:56.988 --> 00:41:01.259 align:middle line:84%
I'm manifesting a high
vibration from the universe.

00:41:01.259 --> 00:41:02.527 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: You know,
I think it works.

00:41:02.527 --> 00:41:08.232 align:middle line:84%
I think if people
concentrate, if they meditate,

00:41:08.232 --> 00:41:11.035 align:middle line:84%
it's principles I've practices
and believed all my life.

00:41:11.035 --> 00:41:12.170 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: It's true.

00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:13.971 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: You tap into a
force that's out there.

00:41:13.971 --> 00:41:18.509 align:middle line:84%
They call it Tesla, one who's
trying to create free energy

00:41:18.509 --> 00:41:20.678 align:middle line:84%
for this planet,
tapped into that.

00:41:20.678 --> 00:41:21.379 align:middle line:90%

00:41:30.154 --> 00:41:36.827 align:middle line:84%
that we have the ability to
ground-- to ground our energy,

00:41:36.827 --> 00:41:40.698 align:middle line:84%
to connect with the earth
and allow that energy to come

00:41:40.698 --> 00:41:43.134 align:middle line:84%
up through our body,
through legs, you know,

00:41:43.134 --> 00:41:45.203 align:middle line:90%
the old saying, get grounded.

00:41:45.203 --> 00:41:49.273 align:middle line:84%
And to allow the energy from the
divine to come through our heads

00:41:49.273 --> 00:41:52.043 align:middle line:84%
and down and all of
it meets in our heart.

00:41:52.043 --> 00:41:56.247 align:middle line:84%
But so many people will
practice a form of meditation

00:41:56.247 --> 00:41:57.648 align:middle line:84%
where they want to
leave their body,

00:41:57.648 --> 00:41:59.283 align:middle line:90%
"Woohoo, we're out of here.

00:41:59.283 --> 00:42:01.018 align:middle line:90%
Let's go. Yeah, that was cool."

00:42:01.018 --> 00:42:03.921 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, that's what
we're doing at night too, right?

00:42:03.921 --> 00:42:05.423 align:middle line:90%
When we dream where some

00:42:05.423 --> 00:42:07.792 align:middle line:84%
of us are actually leaving
our bodies and, you know,

00:42:07.792 --> 00:42:10.294 align:middle line:84%
flying around, checking
on, you know, what--

00:42:10.294 --> 00:42:13.297 align:middle line:84%
what somebody else is doing on
the other side of the planet.

00:42:13.297 --> 00:42:14.432 align:middle line:90%
And it's all great.

00:42:14.432 --> 00:42:17.535 align:middle line:90%
It's fun. But honestly,

00:42:17.535 --> 00:42:20.705 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we are
the high spiritual beings

00:42:20.705 --> 00:42:22.406 align:middle line:90%
that we're seeking.

00:42:22.406 --> 00:42:24.842 align:middle line:90%
You're already it.

00:42:24.842 --> 00:42:27.912 align:middle line:84%
And so, knowing that you're
already it, we have a job

00:42:27.912 --> 00:42:31.349 align:middle line:84%
to do while we're here
and that's the planet.

00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:34.585 align:middle line:84%
We're here to-- we're the
caretakers of this earth.

00:42:34.585 --> 00:42:36.187 align:middle line:90%
That's why we're here.

00:42:36.187 --> 00:42:37.888 align:middle line:90%
We're here to feel our feelings.

00:42:37.888 --> 00:42:39.323 align:middle line:90%
That's our homework.

00:42:39.323 --> 00:42:41.692 align:middle line:90%
Feel them, process them.

00:42:41.692 --> 00:42:43.094 align:middle line:90%
Let them go.

00:42:43.094 --> 00:42:46.430 align:middle line:84%
It's when we feel them and we
don't process them and we hold

00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:48.499 align:middle line:84%
on to them that we
end up, you know,

00:42:48.499 --> 00:42:50.801 align:middle line:84%
like in a bad mood
for three days.

00:42:50.801 --> 00:42:53.371 align:middle line:84%
So, we have to feel our
feelings, process them,

00:42:53.371 --> 00:42:56.374 align:middle line:84%
let them go, and get
back to what our job is.

00:42:56.374 --> 00:43:01.012 align:middle line:84%
Our job honestly is to
take care of the planet.

00:43:01.012 --> 00:43:02.013 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Oh, that's good advice.

00:43:02.013 --> 00:43:02.980 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Yeah.

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:03.581 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Are you always
this bubbly?

00:43:03.581 --> 00:43:04.081 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: I am.

00:43:04.081 --> 00:43:04.782 align:middle line:90%
I am.

00:43:04.782 --> 00:43:06.317 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: You really are?

00:43:06.317 --> 00:43:08.219 align:middle line:84%
Let's take some more
questions for Sonja.

00:43:08.219 --> 00:43:10.254 align:middle line:90%
Who's got a few?

00:43:10.254 --> 00:43:11.622 align:middle line:90%
Yes, ma'am.

00:43:11.622 --> 00:43:14.225 align:middle line:84%
>> So, you said you do must
leave your phone over the work--

00:43:14.225 --> 00:43:17.328 align:middle line:84%
or your work over the phone,
how does that work for people

00:43:17.328 --> 00:43:21.365 align:middle line:84%
that like to see you or
be with you in person?

00:43:21.365 --> 00:43:21.932 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Well.

00:43:21.932 --> 00:43:22.566 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Skype.

00:43:22.566 --> 00:43:23.901 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Exactly.

00:43:23.901 --> 00:43:26.303 align:middle line:84%
There's Skype but I don't
have a camera on my computer,

00:43:26.303 --> 00:43:30.007 align:middle line:84%
so I do Skype but I don't have a
camera, so you have to just look

00:43:30.007 --> 00:43:32.143 align:middle line:90%
at my picture in front anyways.

00:43:32.143 --> 00:43:34.378 align:middle line:84%
I've had people who call
me that do have a camera

00:43:34.378 --> 00:43:38.616 align:middle line:84%
and then I can see them, but
I suggest for people who want

00:43:38.616 --> 00:43:41.952 align:middle line:84%
to see me in person to take
one of my workshops or come

00:43:41.952 --> 00:43:45.489 align:middle line:84%
to my meditation retreats,
because that's when, you know,

00:43:45.489 --> 00:43:47.825 align:middle line:84%
it's-- it's a lot when
of one-on-one time

00:43:47.825 --> 00:43:51.195 align:middle line:84%
and it's more intense
for that time.

00:43:51.195 --> 00:43:52.463 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. Thank you.

00:43:52.463 --> 00:43:54.732 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Is it necessary
or how important is it

00:43:54.732 --> 00:43:56.534 align:middle line:90%
for people to see you?

00:43:56.534 --> 00:43:57.368 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: It's not.

00:43:57.368 --> 00:43:59.503 align:middle line:90%
I mean some people are visual--

00:43:59.503 --> 00:44:03.507 align:middle line:84%
their primary way of taking
the world and is visual,

00:44:03.507 --> 00:44:05.309 align:middle line:90%
so they need to see me.

00:44:05.309 --> 00:44:08.446 align:middle line:84%
But some people are
terminal which is great.

00:44:08.446 --> 00:44:10.981 align:middle line:84%
The phone is perfect
for terminal people.

00:44:10.981 --> 00:44:13.584 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, kinesthetic
people, people who just have

00:44:13.584 --> 00:44:17.254 align:middle line:84%
to feel everything, yeah, they
get the phone work and people

00:44:17.254 --> 00:44:20.958 align:middle line:84%
who are mental processors that,
you know, the phone works,

00:44:20.958 --> 00:44:23.294 align:middle line:84%
a lot of times, the
mental visual people want

00:44:23.294 --> 00:44:25.529 align:middle line:90%
to see me in person.

00:44:25.529 --> 00:44:26.931 align:middle line:90%
It's all good.

00:44:26.931 --> 00:44:30.101 align:middle line:84%
I mean I'm the same whether I'm
in front of you in person or I'm

00:44:30.101 --> 00:44:33.170 align:middle line:84%
on a phone, you know,
a gazillion miles away.

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:34.305 align:middle line:90%
It's all the same.

00:44:34.305 --> 00:44:35.606 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Sonja, what's been one

00:44:35.606 --> 00:44:38.042 align:middle line:84%
of the most bizarre phone
calls you've had for people?

00:44:38.042 --> 00:44:41.212 align:middle line:84%
I mean what-- what
has been so strange?

00:44:41.212 --> 00:44:44.849 align:middle line:84%
>> SG: My most bizarre
phone calls and I want

00:44:44.849 --> 00:44:46.517 align:middle line:84%
to professes [phonetic]
this with--

00:44:46.517 --> 00:44:49.386 align:middle line:84%
I clear people of
negative energy.

00:44:49.386 --> 00:44:54.825 align:middle line:84%
So, I have the ability to see
all levels of the astral plane.

00:44:54.825 --> 00:44:58.229 align:middle line:84%
I see the lowest,
darkest entities

00:44:58.229 --> 00:45:00.331 align:middle line:90%
up to the highest angels.

00:45:00.331 --> 00:45:02.299 align:middle line:90%
I also see alien beings.

00:45:02.299 --> 00:45:07.738 align:middle line:84%
I see a lot of alien beings
because I believe and I see them

00:45:07.738 --> 00:45:09.073 align:middle line:90%
without physical form.

00:45:09.073 --> 00:45:10.608 align:middle line:90%
They're an energy form

00:45:10.608 --> 00:45:12.576 align:middle line:84%
but they're different
than an entity.

00:45:12.576 --> 00:45:15.546 align:middle line:84%
An entity is much
more translucent

00:45:15.546 --> 00:45:17.448 align:middle line:84%
when I see them whereas
an alien being--

00:45:17.448 --> 00:45:18.783 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Right.

00:45:18.783 --> 00:45:19.984 align:middle line:84%
>> SG: -- has more density,
and they're harder to clear.

00:45:19.984 --> 00:45:23.053 align:middle line:84%
But I do clear them
out of people's bodies.

00:45:23.053 --> 00:45:26.056 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by that is
sometimes, when we're checked

00:45:26.056 --> 00:45:29.560 align:middle line:84%
out and we're not present in
our body, there're other things

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:33.197 align:middle line:84%
that really-- they do want
to be in a human form.

00:45:33.197 --> 00:45:37.101 align:middle line:84%
They want to experience life
on earth just like, you know,

00:45:37.101 --> 00:45:39.436 align:middle line:90%
we do as souls and bodies.

00:45:39.436 --> 00:45:44.675 align:middle line:84%
I believe that our soul is
our regional state of being.

00:45:44.675 --> 00:45:47.912 align:middle line:84%
Our natural state of
being is in spirit form.

00:45:47.912 --> 00:45:51.782 align:middle line:84%
This is just a car, you
know, we got a car this time,

00:45:51.782 --> 00:45:53.050 align:middle line:90%
and we have to take care of it.

00:45:53.050 --> 00:45:54.885 align:middle line:90%
And most importantly, we have

00:45:54.885 --> 00:45:57.922 align:middle line:84%
to stay conscious while
we're driving the car.

00:45:57.922 --> 00:46:01.659 align:middle line:84%
And we have to make sure that
the child, the inner child is

00:46:01.659 --> 00:46:04.628 align:middle line:84%
in a car seat in the
back with the seatbelt on

00:46:04.628 --> 00:46:07.298 align:middle line:84%
and the adult is
driving the car.

00:46:07.298 --> 00:46:11.202 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, if your five-year old
is driving your car, you know,

00:46:11.202 --> 00:46:13.170 align:middle line:90%
there can be problems, right?

00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:14.438 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Let's go to one

00:46:14.438 --> 00:46:18.442 align:middle line:84%
of our Beyond Belief camp
questions for Sonja Grace.

00:46:18.442 --> 00:46:19.643 align:middle line:90%
>> Vanessa: Hi, Sonja.

00:46:19.643 --> 00:46:21.412 align:middle line:84%
It's Vanessa [assumed
spelling] from Washington,

00:46:21.412 --> 00:46:23.514 align:middle line:84%
DC and I was wondering if
you think that our loved ones

00:46:23.514 --> 00:46:26.584 align:middle line:84%
who have crossed over
hear our prayers.

00:46:26.584 --> 00:46:27.618 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Thank you, Vanessa.

00:46:27.618 --> 00:46:30.087 align:middle line:84%
I do feel that they
hear our prayers.

00:46:30.087 --> 00:46:34.592 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I think that our loved
ones are with us and around us--

00:46:34.592 --> 00:46:36.393 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: All the time.

00:46:36.393 --> 00:46:37.394 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: -- all the time.

00:46:37.394 --> 00:46:38.829 align:middle line:84%
I hear from people
on the other side

00:46:38.829 --> 00:46:42.867 align:middle line:84%
that they become the guardian
angels to our children

00:46:42.867 --> 00:46:44.535 align:middle line:90%
and our grandchildren.

00:46:44.535 --> 00:46:49.373 align:middle line:84%
They are looking after all of
us and mostly what I've seen is

00:46:49.373 --> 00:46:52.042 align:middle line:90%
about three generations out.

00:46:52.042 --> 00:46:53.511 align:middle line:90%
There's about three generations

00:46:53.511 --> 00:46:56.146 align:middle line:84%
that I'll see within
my own family.

00:46:56.146 --> 00:46:58.115 align:middle line:84%
I see my dad who's
on the other side.

00:46:58.115 --> 00:46:59.783 align:middle line:90%
I see my grandparents.

00:46:59.783 --> 00:47:01.752 align:middle line:84%
I no longer see my
great grandparents.

00:47:01.752 --> 00:47:03.621 align:middle line:90%
They've incarnated again.

00:47:03.621 --> 00:47:05.890 align:middle line:84%
But it all depends
on the family pod.

00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:10.394 align:middle line:84%
It depends on what we're doing
consciously or unconsciously

00:47:10.394 --> 00:47:12.162 align:middle line:90%
within our family unit.

00:47:12.162 --> 00:47:15.733 align:middle line:84%
And no, you're not
stuck with your family

00:47:15.733 --> 00:47:17.501 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of eternity.

00:47:17.501 --> 00:47:18.869 align:middle line:90%
I get that question a lot.

00:47:18.869 --> 00:47:21.872 align:middle line:90%
But we have to work on things.

00:47:21.872 --> 00:47:25.376 align:middle line:84%
So, we have to clear some
of those emotional woundings

00:47:25.376 --> 00:47:28.779 align:middle line:84%
to move into a different
family pod.

00:47:28.779 --> 00:47:31.048 align:middle line:84%
My motto is, "Do
it for the pod."

00:47:31.048 --> 00:47:32.383 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:47:32.383 --> 00:47:34.351 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: All right, let's take
another question for Sonja.

00:47:34.351 --> 00:47:37.054 align:middle line:90%
Who's got one for us?

00:47:37.054 --> 00:47:39.056 align:middle line:90%
Yes, way in the corner.

00:47:39.056 --> 00:47:41.759 align:middle line:84%
>> I heard you talking on one
of your videos the other day

00:47:41.759 --> 00:47:46.263 align:middle line:84%
about different alien beings
and how there are some of them

00:47:46.263 --> 00:47:47.965 align:middle line:90%
that are benevolent than others

00:47:47.965 --> 00:47:51.068 align:middle line:84%
and I thought I just ask a
little bit more about that.

00:47:51.068 --> 00:47:52.169 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: OK.

00:47:52.169 --> 00:47:53.237 align:middle line:84%
Good. You got me back
on the alien track.

00:47:53.237 --> 00:47:54.004 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:47:54.004 --> 00:47:54.638 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Some are friendly.

00:47:54.638 --> 00:47:55.306 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Thank you.

00:47:55.306 --> 00:47:56.073 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Some are not.

00:47:56.073 --> 00:47:56.640 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Some are friendly.

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:57.975 align:middle line:90%
Some are not.

00:47:57.975 --> 00:48:02.212 align:middle line:84%
And what I see is as I was
talking before, alien beings are

00:48:02.212 --> 00:48:06.417 align:middle line:84%
at such-- many of them are
at such a high vibration

00:48:06.417 --> 00:48:10.421 align:middle line:84%
that they're able to take
that spirit form and or move

00:48:10.421 --> 00:48:12.856 align:middle line:90%
into a more solid form.

00:48:12.856 --> 00:48:15.225 align:middle line:84%
Some of there are only in
spirit form and they want

00:48:15.225 --> 00:48:17.494 align:middle line:90%
to step into human form.

00:48:17.494 --> 00:48:19.997 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them want to
come through right now

00:48:19.997 --> 00:48:23.667 align:middle line:84%
to manage what's being
mismanaged here on earth.

00:48:23.667 --> 00:48:27.871 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of them have been here
for a long time and they want

00:48:27.871 --> 00:48:31.742 align:middle line:84%
to manage what they think
they are in charge of.

00:48:31.742 --> 00:48:37.081 align:middle line:84%
And others are coming in because
we're really at a critical point

00:48:37.081 --> 00:48:41.452 align:middle line:84%
on earth's history as a species,
we're at a critical point.

00:48:41.452 --> 00:48:47.324 align:middle line:84%
So, that's where-- I think
that being respectful

00:48:47.324 --> 00:48:50.694 align:middle line:84%
and seeing the alien
species that are here

00:48:50.694 --> 00:48:53.530 align:middle line:90%
for very much like we are.

00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:56.834 align:middle line:84%
There's an agenda just like
the human race has an agenda.

00:48:56.834 --> 00:49:00.004 align:middle line:84%
They have a different
vibration that they're in.

00:49:00.004 --> 00:49:04.074 align:middle line:84%
I see them at a much higher
vibration which is why

00:49:04.074 --> 00:49:05.275 align:middle line:90%
to some people when they're--

00:49:05.275 --> 00:49:09.747 align:middle line:84%
they have experiences of
abduction that they feel

00:49:09.747 --> 00:49:13.917 align:middle line:84%
that they're cold or removed
from what's happening.

00:49:13.917 --> 00:49:19.757 align:middle line:84%
I mean, seriously, human race
doesn't understand the different

00:49:19.757 --> 00:49:23.427 align:middle line:84%
levels of consciousness
that exist.

00:49:23.427 --> 00:49:26.296 align:middle line:84%
I had a scientist say to
me once, "If the front

00:49:26.296 --> 00:49:29.033 align:middle line:90%
of your brain were your car,

00:49:29.033 --> 00:49:32.269 align:middle line:84%
the back of your brain
is the milky way."

00:49:32.269 --> 00:49:33.871 align:middle line:90%
>> That's intriguing, it is?

00:49:33.871 --> 00:49:35.572 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: ST: Yeah.

00:49:35.572 --> 00:49:36.507 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:49:36.507 --> 00:49:37.141 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Thank you.

00:49:37.141 --> 00:49:37.975 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Thank you.

00:49:37.975 --> 00:49:39.009 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Or in some cases, much.

00:49:39.009 --> 00:49:39.710 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Mush.

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:43.213 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: You never know.

00:49:43.213 --> 00:49:48.452 align:middle line:84%
Throughout all of this, have
you ever gotten to a patient

00:49:48.452 --> 00:49:56.727 align:middle line:84%
or someone who you just could
not reach that they built

00:49:56.727 --> 00:50:00.631 align:middle line:84%
up such a barrier that not
even you could get through?

00:50:00.631 --> 00:50:01.765 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: I did.

00:50:01.765 --> 00:50:05.903 align:middle line:84%
I had a woman once who
called me-- that was--

00:50:05.903 --> 00:50:09.273 align:middle line:84%
she was dealing with
kidney problems.

00:50:09.273 --> 00:50:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And she was trying to
avoid going on dialysis.

00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:14.745 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: I don't blame her.

00:50:14.745 --> 00:50:16.580 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: And she-- but you know,

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:18.916 align:middle line:84%
the list before me
was quite impressive.

00:50:18.916 --> 00:50:22.252 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this woman had seen
every healer including John

00:50:22.252 --> 00:50:28.125 align:middle line:84%
of God and I, of course was
the last one she called.

00:50:28.125 --> 00:50:30.160 align:middle line:90%
No pressure.

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:34.665 align:middle line:84%
And I-- I worked with her and
I felt, we made some progress.

00:50:34.665 --> 00:50:37.734 align:middle line:84%
Her kidney numbers
did come down a bit.

00:50:37.734 --> 00:50:45.242 align:middle line:84%
But the bigger component of this
case is she had emotional issues

00:50:45.242 --> 00:50:47.611 align:middle line:90%
that she was not dealing with.

00:50:47.611 --> 00:50:52.483 align:middle line:84%
She was not willing to go in and
do that deeper processing work.

00:50:52.483 --> 00:50:55.853 align:middle line:84%
And I'm telling you,
processing work is not easy.

00:50:55.853 --> 00:50:59.723 align:middle line:90%
It takes a lot of courage.

00:50:59.723 --> 00:51:03.460 align:middle line:84%
It takes a lot of devotion
to your own healing

00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:06.196 align:middle line:84%
and your own path to
do that kind of work.

00:51:06.196 --> 00:51:10.534 align:middle line:84%
But when you do it, the feeling,
the good feeling and the high

00:51:10.534 --> 00:51:14.338 align:middle line:84%
that you have after
doing that is so bigger

00:51:14.338 --> 00:51:16.039 align:middle line:84%
than anything you
ever started with--

00:51:16.039 --> 00:51:16.840 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Just overwhelming.

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:17.774 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: -- in terms of pain.

00:51:17.774 --> 00:51:19.143 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:51:19.143 --> 00:51:23.247 align:middle line:84%
So, I wanted to get her to
that place but she was blocked

00:51:23.247 --> 00:51:27.484 align:middle line:84%
and people do have a lot
of resistance and blocks.

00:51:27.484 --> 00:51:31.722 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of resistance
that goes on and, you know,

00:51:31.722 --> 00:51:34.658 align:middle line:84%
we all experience resistance
through out our day, you know.

00:51:34.658 --> 00:51:36.827 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to go
in there, it smells.

00:51:36.827 --> 00:51:40.364 align:middle line:84%
Or I-- I don't want to go over
there it's, you know it's dark.

00:51:40.364 --> 00:51:42.432 align:middle line:84%
Or, you know, we all have
kind of our resistance.

00:51:42.432 --> 00:51:44.501 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember the
movie the Yes Man?

00:51:44.501 --> 00:51:45.135 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yup, yes.

00:51:45.135 --> 00:51:45.869 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Yes.

00:51:45.869 --> 00:51:46.403 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yes.

00:51:46.403 --> 00:51:47.070 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Yes.

00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:48.338 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:51:48.338 --> 00:51:50.774 align:middle line:84%
I mean when you feel your
resistance once in while,

00:51:50.774 --> 00:51:54.311 align:middle line:84%
just say, "I can walk into
that space or you know?

00:51:54.311 --> 00:51:57.147 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: I wish my producer Tom
was a yes man, but he's not,

00:51:57.147 --> 00:51:58.215 align:middle line:90%
adds me on everything.

00:51:58.215 --> 00:52:00.217 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: I'll work on him.

00:52:00.217 --> 00:52:01.185 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:52:01.185 --> 00:52:02.286 align:middle line:84%
I've got by the way
in my office one

00:52:02.286 --> 00:52:05.522 align:middle line:84%
of this little man toys
it's just the head.

00:52:05.522 --> 00:52:06.690 align:middle line:90%
But it's the yes man head.

00:52:06.690 --> 00:52:07.191 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Oh.

00:52:07.191 --> 00:52:08.592 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:52:08.592 --> 00:52:10.894 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: So, you put it down and
whatever you say to it, it goes,

00:52:10.894 --> 00:52:12.329 align:middle line:90%
"Yes, I agree with that."

00:52:12.329 --> 00:52:14.298 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:52:14.298 --> 00:52:15.199 align:middle line:90%
.11

00:52:15.199 --> 00:52:16.366 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Oh, that's great.

00:52:16.366 --> 00:52:21.138 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Where's this
planet headed as a whole?

00:52:21.138 --> 00:52:23.140 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:24.274 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Well.

00:52:24.274 --> 00:52:25.742 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: We're shifting,
something's happening.

00:52:25.742 --> 00:52:26.910 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: We shifted a lot.

00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:29.079 align:middle line:84%
We moved into the
fifth dimension.

00:52:29.079 --> 00:52:31.982 align:middle line:84%
That was the whole big
mind calendar thing.

00:52:31.982 --> 00:52:34.484 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is we
were in the fourth dimension

00:52:34.484 --> 00:52:40.490 align:middle line:84%
and the fourth dimension is kind
of like the last hundreds of,

00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:42.859 align:middle line:84%
you know, not hundreds of
centuries but many centuries.

00:52:42.859 --> 00:52:45.262 align:middle line:90%
We were in the fourth dimension.

00:52:45.262 --> 00:52:46.897 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're in
the fifth dimension

00:52:46.897 --> 00:52:50.801 align:middle line:84%
and people are really
experiencing a tough time.

00:52:50.801 --> 00:52:54.204 align:middle line:84%
A great example is someone
who sells real estate.

00:52:54.204 --> 00:52:56.206 align:middle line:84%
You know on the fourth
dimension,

00:52:56.206 --> 00:52:57.641 align:middle line:90%
no problem, bing, bang, boom.

00:52:57.641 --> 00:53:00.244 align:middle line:84%
They were selling houses,
everything was going great.

00:53:00.244 --> 00:53:02.212 align:middle line:84%
Well then we had the whole
financial thing happen.

00:53:02.212 --> 00:53:03.380 align:middle line:90%
People had a hard time.

00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:04.915 align:middle line:90%
People lost their homes.

00:53:04.915 --> 00:53:06.617 align:middle line:84%
They literature [phonetic]
themselves

00:53:06.617 --> 00:53:08.485 align:middle line:90%
where no longer selling houses.

00:53:08.485 --> 00:53:10.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're in the
fifth dimension,

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:13.156 align:middle line:84%
real estates a little bit
more on people or, you know,

00:53:13.156 --> 00:53:15.626 align:middle line:84%
having a little more
movement with selling.

00:53:15.626 --> 00:53:20.664 align:middle line:84%
Real estate is happening,
but if the realtor themselves

00:53:20.664 --> 00:53:22.566 align:middle line:90%
and this goes for any industry.

00:53:22.566 --> 00:53:26.470 align:middle line:84%
If they're not aligning
themselves to their purpose

00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:30.407 align:middle line:84%
and to doing what they're
doing form a higher place,

00:53:30.407 --> 00:53:34.411 align:middle line:84%
meaning that we are
truly walking our path.

00:53:34.411 --> 00:53:39.182 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is we do in our
lives from that spiritual place,

00:53:39.182 --> 00:53:41.485 align:middle line:84%
it's like it all falls
off the back of the wagon.

00:53:41.485 --> 00:53:44.187 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Well talking about time,
space, and other dimensions.

00:53:44.187 --> 00:53:45.956 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the other
issues you answered

00:53:45.956 --> 00:53:47.758 align:middle line:90%
in your documentary.

00:53:47.758 --> 00:53:53.030 align:middle line:84%
>> SG: We're all noticing
time and space shifting.

00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:57.134 align:middle line:84%
We're noticing that things
aren't kind of lining up the way

00:53:57.134 --> 00:53:59.136 align:middle line:90%
that they have in the past.

00:53:59.136 --> 00:54:00.971 align:middle line:84%
We know we have an
appointment at 10 o'clock

00:54:00.971 --> 00:54:03.640 align:middle line:84%
but maybe 10 o'clock
rolls around

00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:07.577 align:middle line:84%
and we're not quite sure
how it got there so fast.

00:54:07.577 --> 00:54:09.579 align:middle line:84%
We're not sure why
every time we look

00:54:09.579 --> 00:54:15.085 align:middle line:84%
at the clock, it
says 2:22 or 4:44.

00:54:15.085 --> 00:54:19.222 align:middle line:84%
We're not sure how we're
floating from the time we get

00:54:19.222 --> 00:54:21.792 align:middle line:90%
up until the afternoon

00:54:21.792 --> 00:54:25.829 align:middle line:84%
and we don't quite remember how
we got there but we got there.

00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:30.133 align:middle line:84%
And so, we're riding and
morphing into places in way

00:54:30.133 --> 00:54:32.369 align:middle line:90%
that we've never done before.

00:54:32.369 --> 00:54:33.937 align:middle line:90%
And it's very different.

00:54:33.937 --> 00:54:36.306 align:middle line:84%
Some people are really
surrendering to it and saying,

00:54:36.306 --> 00:54:39.609 align:middle line:84%
"OK, whatever, this is a way
to flow to the next spot."

00:54:39.609 --> 00:54:42.679 align:middle line:84%
And other people are
actually resisting it

00:54:42.679 --> 00:54:47.517 align:middle line:84%
and feeling very nervous about
how they're going to get there

00:54:47.517 --> 00:54:50.120 align:middle line:90%
and how come I ran out of time.

00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:52.723 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Well you're talking about
getting to one place to another

00:54:52.723 --> 00:54:53.890 align:middle line:90%
and forgetting things.

00:54:53.890 --> 00:54:54.658 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Yes.

00:54:54.658 --> 00:54:55.192 align:middle line:90%

00:54:55.192 --> 00:54:56.293 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Yes.

00:54:56.293 --> 00:54:57.527 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Where you go
from point A to point B

00:54:57.527 --> 00:54:59.996 align:middle line:84%
and you have no recollection
of in between.

00:54:59.996 --> 00:55:00.797 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: That's right.

00:55:00.797 --> 00:55:01.665 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: How does that happen?

00:55:01.665 --> 00:55:02.799 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Well let me tell you--

00:55:02.799 --> 00:55:04.234 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Well we all
have done that, I know.

00:55:04.234 --> 00:55:06.636 align:middle line:84%
>> SG: Absolutely, and if
you're in the Island of Oahu

00:55:06.636 --> 00:55:08.105 align:middle line:84%
and you're going
to the Polytunnel,

00:55:08.105 --> 00:55:09.873 align:middle line:90%
that'll happen every time.

00:55:09.873 --> 00:55:12.409 align:middle line:84%
Because the Polytunnel
on Oahu is--

00:55:12.409 --> 00:55:14.144 align:middle line:90%
it's its own time warp but--

00:55:14.144 --> 00:55:15.112 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: You're zoned out.

00:55:15.112 --> 00:55:15.812 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Yeah.

00:55:15.812 --> 00:55:17.280 align:middle line:90%
That happens everywhere.

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:19.383 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you guys have
all experienced that,

00:55:19.383 --> 00:55:22.619 align:middle line:84%
just that time space
change and you looked

00:55:22.619 --> 00:55:24.654 align:middle line:84%
at your clock it was 10
o'clock and then you turn

00:55:24.654 --> 00:55:26.156 align:middle line:90%
around and it's 11:30 and--

00:55:26.156 --> 00:55:27.224 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Yeah.

00:55:27.224 --> 00:55:28.258 align:middle line:84%
>> SG: -- and you
weren't doing anything.

00:55:28.258 --> 00:55:30.861 align:middle line:90%
And it just happened that fast.

00:55:30.861 --> 00:55:32.863 align:middle line:84%
This is part of that
fifth dimension.

00:55:32.863 --> 00:55:35.766 align:middle line:84%
We're all more telepathic
with each other.

00:55:35.766 --> 00:55:39.569 align:middle line:84%
We're all experiencing
a higher vibration.

00:55:39.569 --> 00:55:43.373 align:middle line:84%
We're all getting bombarded
from solar flares and, you know,

00:55:43.373 --> 00:55:46.476 align:middle line:84%
space weather and all kinds
of stuff is affecting us

00:55:46.476 --> 00:55:48.278 align:middle line:90%
and affecting the shift.

00:55:48.278 --> 00:55:51.748 align:middle line:84%
So in this fifth
dimension, if we choose

00:55:51.748 --> 00:55:55.085 align:middle line:84%
to do our jobs whatever
your industry is,

00:55:55.085 --> 00:55:59.055 align:middle line:84%
from that spiritual place
that everybody's feeling.

00:55:59.055 --> 00:56:02.726 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's feeling it, it
just depends on what kind

00:56:02.726 --> 00:56:06.196 align:middle line:84%
of awareness and
awakeness a person has.

00:56:06.196 --> 00:56:08.165 align:middle line:84%
Then you're taking
that awareness

00:56:08.165 --> 00:56:11.401 align:middle line:84%
into whatever you're doing
with your daily lives.

00:56:11.401 --> 00:56:14.438 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Well let's see how you
raise people's vibrations here.

00:56:14.438 --> 00:56:15.472 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: OK.

00:56:15.472 --> 00:56:16.206 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Let's do your
little experiment.

00:56:16.206 --> 00:56:16.706 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: OK.

00:56:16.706 --> 00:56:17.707 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:56:17.707 --> 00:56:20.243 align:middle line:84%
So, can everybody
stand up with me?

00:56:21.611 --> 00:56:26.183 align:middle line:84%
OK, make sure you have a nice
stance so you're not falling

00:56:26.183 --> 00:56:27.651 align:middle line:90%
over when you close your eyes.

00:56:27.651 --> 00:56:30.587 align:middle line:84%
I want you to just
imagine yourself you're.

00:56:30.587 --> 00:56:33.457 align:middle line:84%
You can even use your
arms holding yourself

00:56:33.457 --> 00:56:35.425 align:middle line:90%
as a new born baby.

00:56:35.425 --> 00:56:38.895 align:middle line:84%
See yourself as a
newborn baby in your arms.

00:56:38.895 --> 00:56:42.833 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to feel your
heart opening up and filling

00:56:42.833 --> 00:56:45.101 align:middle line:90%
that baby up with love and see

00:56:45.101 --> 00:56:48.371 align:middle line:84%
that baby filling
you up with love.

00:56:48.371 --> 00:56:55.712 align:middle line:84%
And then I want you to visualize
yourself looking at this picture

00:56:55.712 --> 00:57:00.150 align:middle line:84%
of you loving the baby
and love that picture

00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:03.753 align:middle line:84%
of you loving the baby
and the baby loving you.

00:57:03.753 --> 00:57:07.791 align:middle line:84%
And then take it
out one more time.

00:57:07.791 --> 00:57:11.328 align:middle line:84%
See yourself now the second
time, standing further out,

00:57:11.328 --> 00:57:15.465 align:middle line:84%
loving you standing there,
loving you loving the picture

00:57:15.465 --> 00:57:17.567 align:middle line:90%
of you loving the baby.

00:57:17.567 --> 00:57:21.104 align:middle line:84%
This is expanding
your auric field.

00:57:21.104 --> 00:57:23.540 align:middle line:90%
And when you open your eyes now,

00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:27.911 align:middle line:84%
what you've done is you have
literally taken your aura

00:57:27.911 --> 00:57:30.680 align:middle line:90%
and you've made it a lot bigger.

00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:34.251 align:middle line:84%
And what that does
is it protects you.

00:57:34.251 --> 00:57:36.620 align:middle line:84%
It protects you, it
keeps your energy high,

00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:42.192 align:middle line:84%
and it also allows you to
operate from a higher vibration

00:57:42.192 --> 00:57:43.760 align:middle line:90%
so that all of the, kind

00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:46.296 align:middle line:84%
of lower negative,
oh my god the new.

00:57:46.296 --> 00:57:49.866 align:middle line:84%
You know, all that stuff
kind of just goes kind

00:57:49.866 --> 00:57:50.967 align:middle line:90%
of grounded around you.

00:57:50.967 --> 00:57:53.703 align:middle line:90%
You can sit down, thank you.

00:57:53.703 --> 00:57:55.205 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And can you
do this everyday?

00:57:55.205 --> 00:57:56.673 align:middle line:90%
>> SG: Everyday.

00:57:56.673 --> 00:58:00.010 align:middle line:90%
Everyday please, everyday.

00:58:00.010 --> 00:58:03.146 align:middle line:84%
That-- just loving that baby,
that inner child and having

00:58:03.146 --> 00:58:05.882 align:middle line:84%
that baby love you
is so important

00:58:05.882 --> 00:58:10.086 align:middle line:84%
because you're acknowledging
a part of you that needs

00:58:10.086 --> 00:58:12.355 align:middle line:90%
to be loved and nurtured.

00:58:12.355 --> 00:58:14.891 align:middle line:84%
The more we do that, the
less we're looking outside

00:58:14.891 --> 00:58:17.928 align:middle line:90%
of ourselves for anything.

00:58:17.928 --> 00:58:20.730 align:middle line:84%
We're not looking to other
people to fill up the glass.

00:58:20.730 --> 00:58:22.732 align:middle line:84%
We're not looking
to other people

00:58:22.732 --> 00:58:25.702 align:middle line:84%
to make us feel valued
or, you know, that we're--

00:58:25.702 --> 00:58:28.238 align:middle line:84%
that we're right
or that we're OK.

00:58:28.238 --> 00:58:30.373 align:middle line:84%
We're filling that
up from the inside.

00:58:30.373 --> 00:58:33.944 align:middle line:84%
And when we do that, then
we can just be present.

00:58:33.944 --> 00:58:37.847 align:middle line:84%
And be able to, you know,
take care of her, the earth.

00:58:37.847 --> 00:58:39.249 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Well you helped
a lot of people.

00:58:39.249 --> 00:58:40.150 align:middle line:90%
What motivates you?

00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:41.918 align:middle line:90%
What drives you?

00:58:41.918 --> 00:58:45.755 align:middle line:84%
>> SG: Oh, you're going
to make me cry again.

00:58:45.755 --> 00:58:49.459 align:middle line:84%
I really turn my life over
to God, to the goddess.

00:58:49.459 --> 00:58:53.863 align:middle line:84%
I, you know, I just got
to a place with my work

00:58:53.863 --> 00:58:56.833 align:middle line:84%
where I felt that's
all I could do.

00:58:56.833 --> 00:58:58.101 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:58:58.101 --> 00:59:01.271 align:middle line:84%
I just-- I want to help people
because I love humanity.

00:59:01.271 --> 00:59:03.139 align:middle line:90%
I love this planet.

00:59:03.139 --> 00:59:04.407 align:middle line:90%
I love animals.

00:59:04.407 --> 00:59:06.376 align:middle line:90%
I love everything that's here.

00:59:06.376 --> 00:59:10.914 align:middle line:84%
And so, my feeling
is if this is my gift

00:59:10.914 --> 00:59:14.584 align:middle line:84%
and this is what I can do, then
that's what I need to be doing.

00:59:14.584 --> 00:59:17.821 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: What has in your career

00:59:17.821 --> 00:59:21.625 align:middle line:84%
than for you probably
the most sobering event

00:59:21.625 --> 00:59:23.159 align:middle line:90%
that you've handled?

00:59:23.159 --> 00:59:27.130 align:middle line:90%
A client where you really knew

00:59:27.130 --> 00:59:30.800 align:middle line:84%
that you were touching
somebody's life.

00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:35.071 align:middle line:84%
>> SG: Well, there was
a woman in Puerto Rico

00:59:35.071 --> 00:59:36.906 align:middle line:90%
who I didn't speak to ever.

00:59:36.906 --> 00:59:39.909 align:middle line:84%
She-- her son was
living on the East Coast.

00:59:39.909 --> 00:59:42.779 align:middle line:84%
And he sent me an email with
her photograph and said,

00:59:42.779 --> 00:59:45.782 align:middle line:84%
"My mother doesn't speak
English, can you do a healing

00:59:45.782 --> 00:59:47.117 align:middle line:90%
and a clearing on her."

00:59:47.117 --> 00:59:48.952 align:middle line:90%
And he listed her ailments.

00:59:48.952 --> 00:59:50.887 align:middle line:90%
She had no appetite.

00:59:50.887 --> 00:59:54.024 align:middle line:84%
She had a lot of
pain in her back.

00:59:54.024 --> 00:59:57.193 align:middle line:84%
She had multiple surgeries
on her feet and her spine.

00:59:57.193 --> 00:59:59.195 align:middle line:90%
There was lots of scar tissue.

00:59:59.195 --> 01:00:00.597 align:middle line:90%
She had insomnia.

01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:02.298 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Oh gosh, everything.

01:00:02.298 --> 01:00:03.400 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:04.634 align:middle line:84%
>> SG: All kind-- all
kinds of everything.

01:00:04.634 --> 01:00:06.002 align:middle line:84%
So, I went in, and, you
know, I never talked to her,

01:00:06.002 --> 01:00:08.505 align:middle line:84%
I just had her picture up and
I went in and worked on her.

01:00:08.505 --> 01:00:10.407 align:middle line:90%
And before I worked on her,

01:00:10.407 --> 01:00:13.143 align:middle line:84%
I have this essential
oil that I wear.

01:00:13.143 --> 01:00:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And I put it on and I
was laughing in my office

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:19.916 align:middle line:84%
in Portland Oregon going,
"God she's probably going

01:00:19.916 --> 01:00:22.485 align:middle line:84%
to smell this all the
way to Puerto Rico."

01:00:22.485 --> 01:00:25.655 align:middle line:84%
And I-- so I did the work,
and then I emailed him

01:00:25.655 --> 01:00:27.924 align:middle line:84%
and said this is what I
did, this is what I found.

01:00:27.924 --> 01:00:30.660 align:middle line:84%
There was lots of scar
tissue, I took all that out.

01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:34.664 align:middle line:84%
You know, I cleared-- it took
me 20 minutes to clear all

01:00:34.664 --> 01:00:38.768 align:middle line:84%
of the real dark like entity
energy stuff off of here,

01:00:38.768 --> 01:00:41.104 align:middle line:84%
and of course living in
Puerto Rico, that's a culture

01:00:41.104 --> 01:00:43.873 align:middle line:84%
that practices a lot of
witching and that kind of thing.

01:00:43.873 --> 01:00:45.675 align:middle line:84%
So of course, it
made sense to me.

01:00:45.675 --> 01:00:46.976 align:middle line:90%
I was seeing that.

01:00:46.976 --> 01:00:49.012 align:middle line:84%
Different cultures
practice different things.

01:00:49.012 --> 01:00:51.381 align:middle line:84%
And so, I got all that
cleared off of her,

01:00:51.381 --> 01:00:52.916 align:middle line:90%
wrote him, told him what I did.

01:00:52.916 --> 01:00:55.251 align:middle line:84%
The next day, he wrote
me back, he said,

01:00:55.251 --> 01:00:57.454 align:middle line:90%
"This is what my mother said."

01:00:57.454 --> 01:01:00.490 align:middle line:84%
She said, "I saw this
woman come into the room.

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:03.026 align:middle line:84%
And I smell this
beautiful fragrance."

01:01:03.026 --> 01:01:07.564 align:middle line:84%
I was just crying, and reading
at the computer and he said

01:01:07.564 --> 01:01:11.968 align:middle line:84%
that she got up, she ate
a dinner, a full dinner

01:01:11.968 --> 01:01:15.405 align:middle line:84%
and she did some dishes and she
went back to bed and she woke

01:01:15.405 --> 01:01:18.508 align:middle line:84%
up in the morning,
she had no pain.

01:01:18.508 --> 01:01:19.609 align:middle line:90%

01:01:20.677 --> 01:01:22.812 align:middle line:84%
I was so grateful I
can't tell you how--

01:01:22.812 --> 01:01:24.814 align:middle line:90%
I was just so honored, you know.

01:01:24.814 --> 01:01:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And he keeps writing me
saying, "Mom's still good."

01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:28.852 align:middle line:90%
