>>JIMMY CHURCH:
Welcome, everybody.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jimmy Church.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.380 align:middle line:10%
You might know me from Into
The Vortex right here on Gaia,

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.710 align:middle line:10%
and I'm honored to be sitting in
for George Noory on this episode

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.400 align:middle line:10%
of Beyond Belief.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.240 align:middle line:84%
Joining me is Neil Gaur, the
founder of Portal to Ascension,

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.270 align:middle line:84%
a platform dedicated
to uncovering

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.930 align:middle line:84%
humanity's true origins,
exploring ET contact,

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.900 align:middle line:84%
and shining light on the hidden
knowledge of our ancient past.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.550 align:middle line:90%
Neil, welcome to the show.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NEIL GAUR: Good to be
here with you, Jimmy.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.340 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: I want to jump
back into your ancient past,

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.200 align:middle line:90%
if we can.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.140 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
London and starseeds.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.980 align:middle line:84%
What is a starseed,
and why London?

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GAUR: Well, so first I'll
start with the starseed.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.550 align:middle line:10%
A starseed is someone that has
come in with a divine mission

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.640 align:middle line:10%
or, in some level, maybe even
have dormant memories of being

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.200 align:middle line:10%
connected to the
stars and are here

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.620 align:middle line:10%
for the awakening of humanity.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.170 align:middle line:10%
Basically, they're
incarnated to help

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.800 align:middle line:10%
with the shift in consciousness.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.578 align:middle line:10%
And there's many starseeds
that have incarnated over time.

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:20.120 align:middle line:84%
Some of them aren't
even aware of it.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.330 align:middle line:84%
They're just living their
lives, doing whatever

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.385 align:middle line:84%
they do in this world, maybe
waiting for a moment for them

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:27.760 align:middle line:84%
to wake up to those memories,
and other ones are actively

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.830 align:middle line:84%
doing this work, and I
would say Gaia TV has

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.270 align:middle line:84%
a lot of those people
come on their shows.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: I think
starseed is a loose term.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.380 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't
understand actually

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.130 align:middle line:84%
what it is when
they are using it.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's really good to
have a clear definition of it.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.400 align:middle line:84%
Now for you at such
a young age, did you

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.400 align:middle line:84%
understand what a starseed
was, and did you hang out

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.368 align:middle line:90%
with other starseeds?

00:01:52.368 --> 00:01:54.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GAUR: No, I definitely
didn't know what it was,

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.858 align:middle line:84%
but at a young age, I
always had the feeling

00:01:56.858 --> 00:01:58.400 align:middle line:84%
that something was
off on the planet,

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.390 align:middle line:84%
that there was something
not quite connecting.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.460 align:middle line:84%
I felt that we could
live in a different way.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.670 align:middle line:84%
And many starseeds have
also had those feelings,

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.590 align:middle line:84%
that this isn't really
the way things should be,

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.994 align:middle line:90%
or it could be better.

00:02:08.994 --> 00:02:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that deep,
underlying craving for creating

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.100 align:middle line:84%
a harmonious world, maybe
is that initial spark that

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.450 align:middle line:84%
eventually leads them to
doing this work later in life.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Did you have friends
that you talked to about this?

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.390 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: No, no, not at all.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.807 align:middle line:84%
Not until I was
in high school did

00:02:22.807 --> 00:02:25.100 align:middle line:84%
I start even start thinking
about the universe, quantum

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.725 align:middle line:84%
physics, having those
kind of thoughts.

00:02:26.725 --> 00:02:28.890 align:middle line:84%
As a kid, it was
more about just--

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.630 align:middle line:84%
I just felt foreign
to this world.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.980 align:middle line:90%
I didn't feel like I belonged.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: What about contact
experiences at an early age?

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GAUR: In retrospect, as
a kid, I didn't remember.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.920 align:middle line:84%
But later in life,
as an adult, I

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.410 align:middle line:84%
started having memories
and dreams of what

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.730 align:middle line:90%
was happening to me as a child.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm under
the awareness that I

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.200 align:middle line:84%
have had contact experiences
and been interacting

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.870 align:middle line:84%
with different
beings, but there's

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.620 align:middle line:84%
only specific memories
that have come back

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.787 align:middle line:90%
to me in the last few years.

00:02:52.787 --> 00:02:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Isn't it interesting
how so many of us as adults

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.620 align:middle line:84%
can look back and realize
that we had experiences,

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.700 align:middle line:90%
but they weren't special to us?

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And they get put in
a box, put on a shelf

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.120 align:middle line:84%
and forgotten about because
life gets in the way, right?

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.850 align:middle line:84%
And as an adult, you can look
back and go, wait a minute,

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.940 align:middle line:84%
something was
special about that.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.740 align:middle line:90%
Let's go back and visit it.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:18.850 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you did?

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GAUR: Yeah, I did visit that
on some level with hypnosis

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.650 align:middle line:84%
and I started
regaining memories.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.550 align:middle line:84%
But I realized now that I was
guided by specific beings,

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.050 align:middle line:84%
and the first beings
that came to me

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.660 align:middle line:84%
were the Arcturians,
in order to move me

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.500 align:middle line:90%
towards doing the work I do now.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.050 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting
is I realized

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.150 align:middle line:84%
that my traumas as
a child were really

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.250 align:middle line:84%
the catalyst for waking me
up to my gifts later in life.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.170 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Did you
have missing time?

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.290 align:middle line:84%
Are there sections
of your childhood

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.060 align:middle line:84%
that you can't recall
even to this day?

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GAUR: Actually, I do
not have too many memories

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.970 align:middle line:90%
from my childhood.

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:49.265 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Right.

00:03:49.265 --> 00:03:52.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GAUR: So I would say almost my
whole childhood is missing time.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: I've had
the same experience.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.290 align:middle line:84%
So let's explore that
for a second, if we can.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.190 align:middle line:90%
This is very important.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.790 align:middle line:90%
I had a period of about a year--

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.240 align:middle line:90%
I was nine--

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.340 align:middle line:84%
I do not remember
sleeping in my own bed.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember
getting dressed.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.300 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember any of that.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.940 align:middle line:90%
Similar experiences for you.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GAUR: Yeah, as a child, I
would say that before age 18,

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.892 align:middle line:84%
I don't have too many
distinct memories of my life.

00:04:20.892 --> 00:04:23.600 align:middle line:84%
Later in life, I started hearing
about walk-ins and soul exchange

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.460 align:middle line:84%
walk-ins, and that could
be what happened to me.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.478 align:middle line:84%
But for some reason, there's a
lot of memories from childhood

00:04:29.478 --> 00:04:31.020 align:middle line:84%
that's been completely
blocked to me.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And when I do
meditations and when

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.890 align:middle line:84%
I go to silent
meditation retreats,

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.660 align:middle line:84%
that's when I start
regaining memories.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And I just realized
that I really

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.350 align:middle line:84%
was wondering about what's
out there in the universe.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.280 align:middle line:84%
What is-- even at
an early age, I

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.303 align:middle line:84%
was thinking about death
and extraterrestrials

00:04:46.303 --> 00:04:47.220 align:middle line:90%
and different planets.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.720 align:middle line:84%
So those thoughts
were coming to me.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And so I was being
guided, but there

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.920 align:middle line:84%
weren't any distinct
interactions that I remember.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.100 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Did you feel
different and did people

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.710 align:middle line:90%
look at you as being different?

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GAUR: My family definitely
thought I was different.

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.947 align:middle line:84%
And it took them a while
for them to accept me.

00:05:01.947 --> 00:05:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And when I was starting
to do this work full-time,

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.610 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of--
my parents didn't

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.630 align:middle line:84%
want to tell anybody
else what I was doing.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.020 align:middle line:84%
Not until I actually
made a career out of it

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.012 align:middle line:84%
and started traveling
the world and creating

00:05:12.012 --> 00:05:13.720 align:middle line:84%
these events did they
really shift on it.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.690 align:middle line:84%
So it was not until my 30s that
my family really accepted me.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.190 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Did you find that--

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm analyzing you at
the moment, but did you

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:28.230 align:middle line:84%
find that once you started
to go out and mingle

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.850 align:middle line:84%
and meet other people
in this community,

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:35.100 align:middle line:84%
that your story wasn't that
special, that others were going

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.310 align:middle line:90%
through the exact same thing?

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.110 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: 100%.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, it didn't really
happen until I was 18.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.870 align:middle line:84%
So as a child, there was no one
to connect with on this level.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.520 align:middle line:84%
I came to the US when I was
12 years old from London,

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.520 align:middle line:84%
and then I started writing
poetry around age 16.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And the poetry I was writing,
spoken word, and became hip hop

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.480 align:middle line:84%
later, I was talking
about the universe,

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.980 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial
terrestrial beings.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.280 align:middle line:84%
I was speaking about, in my
poetry, a planet that was--

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.700 align:middle line:90%
where the asteroid belt is.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.350 align:middle line:90%
I hadn't done any research.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.840 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know anybody
in this world.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And when I turned
18, that's when

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:08.780 align:middle line:84%
I started looking online to
find more words for my poetry.

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And as I was searching
for the words,

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.950 align:middle line:84%
I stumbled on different
speakers, like Jordan Maxwell,

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.420 align:middle line:84%
and I realized that a
lot of what I was writing

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.310 align:middle line:84%
were actual stories that
are from ancient texts,

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:20.920 align:middle line:84%
including the
Sumerian scriptures.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:27.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: I was hosting
an event and you got up.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.610 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know it was you.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:29.410 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: Yeah.

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:32.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: And you did
some spoken word poetry.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And I was in the back
and I got sucked in.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.920 align:middle line:90%
It was amazing.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:43.460 align:middle line:84%
And somebody tapped me on my
shoulder and said, that's Neil.

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And I took a second look, and
I remember going up on stage,

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.110 align:middle line:84%
let me just say this, you
transformed into somebody else.

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.910 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: Yeah.

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:53.452 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: You have
an extreme talent,

00:06:53.452 --> 00:06:58.410 align:middle line:84%
but an amazing intelligence
that goes behind this, almost as

00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:59.350 align:middle line:90%
if it was channeled.

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:00.150 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: Yeah.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:01.733 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Am I off
in suggesting that?

00:07:01.733 --> 00:07:02.533 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: No.

00:07:02.533 --> 00:07:04.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: I did not recognize
the person that I've

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:04.870 align:middle line:90%
known for so many years.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.412 align:middle line:84%
>>GAUR: Most of my
poetry comes to me

00:07:06.412 --> 00:07:09.160 align:middle line:84%
within a few seconds
in the entire songs,

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.170 align:middle line:84%
and I remember it
almost immediately.

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why I started
doing poetry and then

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.260 align:middle line:84%
touring around the
world doing spoken word

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.705 align:middle line:84%
was because I could
convey information

00:07:18.705 --> 00:07:21.330 align:middle line:84%
I was learning, whether it was
an extraterrestrials, whether it

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.800 align:middle line:84%
was on Lyra and the
seeding of humanity,

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.270 align:middle line:84%
or on the way quantum physics
works, and even the double slit

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:30.430 align:middle line:84%
experiment, I would embed
all that in my poetry,

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:32.580 align:middle line:84%
and it just became a way
for me to express really

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.950 align:middle line:84%
huge concepts in a way that was
really beautiful and artistic.

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: So multidimensional
and inter-dimensional

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:42.150 align:middle line:84%
and communication, and
entanglement, and physics,

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.790 align:middle line:84%
and science, and all
of these amazing things

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:47.110 align:middle line:84%
that we talk about, you
are actually living it.

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.910 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: Yeah.

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:50.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, I feel the best way to
convey this information is

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:51.070 align:middle line:90%
through art.

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:54.130 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I would say that
the ancients knew that as well.

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:58.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: It was a very
interesting thing for me

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:01.420 align:middle line:84%
to see with you, because
I know you so well.

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly, I'm
introduced to somebody

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:07.030 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't know
and hadn't met before.

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:08.410 align:middle line:90%
It was-- it was amazing.

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:10.110 align:middle line:90%
Now let's go back.

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:14.610 align:middle line:84%
In 2000, you did a transition
that I think a lot of us

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:17.050 align:middle line:84%
go through, and that is
the Epic of Gilgamesh.

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:17.850 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: Yes.

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:20.017 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: And when you read
that for the first time,

00:08:20.017 --> 00:08:22.020 align:middle line:90%
it's a paradigm shift for us.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:23.040 align:middle line:90%
Was it for you too?

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.010 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: 100%.

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:26.610 align:middle line:84%
Because I actually-- the
reason why I started all this

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:29.790 align:middle line:84%
and on the search was I saw
a connection between Yeshua,

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:31.330 align:middle line:90%
Christ, and Krishna.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:32.380 align:middle line:90%
That's how it started.

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And I was told, because I went
to Catholic school for one

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:38.169 align:middle line:84%
year in England and deep
dive into the Bible,

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:41.640 align:middle line:84%
I was told that Krishna,
polytheism and monotheism,

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.450 align:middle line:84%
both evolved separately
from each other.

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:44.470 align:middle line:90%
There was no connection.

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:47.280 align:middle line:84%
But I was seeing similar stories
in polytheistic religions

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.340 align:middle line:90%
and monotheism.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:51.137 align:middle line:84%
So I said to myself, well,
if there's these connections

00:08:51.137 --> 00:08:52.970 align:middle line:84%
that we're being told
that they aren't, what

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:55.342 align:middle line:90%
is the root of all religion?

00:08:55.342 --> 00:08:57.840 align:middle line:84%
So as I started looking for
the root of all religion,

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.660 align:middle line:84%
I would be at the
local café when

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:01.490 align:middle line:84%
I was 18 years old
with the Bhagavad

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:04.340 align:middle line:84%
Gita, the Quran, different
types of texts highlighting

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:05.400 align:middle line:90%
similarities.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And then as I started going
further and further back,

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.050 align:middle line:84%
I found the Sumerian
tablets of creation.

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And now we have
texts that actually

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.300 align:middle line:84%
is source text for many
religions in the world,

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.607 align:middle line:84%
and the Epic of Gilgamesh
was the next thing I found.

00:09:17.607 --> 00:09:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
it was mind-blowing

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:23.630 align:middle line:84%
is who does Gilgamesh meet
as he's traveling the world?

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:25.640 align:middle line:90%
A guy called Napishtim, a.k.a.

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:26.450 align:middle line:90%
Noah.

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:29.010 align:middle line:84%
So it's the Noah story,
but the original one,

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:30.770 align:middle line:84%
but the original
Noah story, Noah

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:32.910 align:middle line:84%
was supposed to be the
only family left on Earth.

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:34.910 align:middle line:84%
There's another hominid,
another human type

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:37.200 align:middle line:84%
of being hybrid that
interacted with him.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.550 align:middle line:90%
So that was one component.

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And the other one
was the flood story.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.920 align:middle line:84%
That really opened me up
to realizing that there's

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.150 align:middle line:84%
a flood story around
the entire world,

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.390 align:middle line:84%
not just the Gilgamesh
story, and maybe it's

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:50.100 align:middle line:84%
a collective memory of a
trauma that happened on Earth,

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.250 align:middle line:84%
rather than just a
myth or just a story.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:56.080 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Do you think that
because so many cultures have

00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:00.680 align:middle line:84%
similar elements in their origin
stories and creation myths,

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:04.540 align:middle line:84%
that they shared
these stories, or were

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:07.963 align:middle line:84%
these independent events that
were separated by cultures?

00:10:07.963 --> 00:10:09.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GAUR: I think
it's a bit of both

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.250 align:middle line:84%
actually, because the
civilizations and religions

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:14.602 align:middle line:84%
and cultures that coalesced
thousands of years

00:10:14.602 --> 00:10:16.810 align:middle line:84%
after the flood and they
have passed down information

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:17.930 align:middle line:90%
from other tribes.

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:20.650 align:middle line:84%
But if you go around
the entire planet from--

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:22.465 align:middle line:84%
literally go over
the planet, you

00:10:22.465 --> 00:10:24.680 align:middle line:84%
have hundreds and
hundreds of flood stories.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And I don't feel
like every single one

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:29.542 align:middle line:84%
of those civilizations
interacted with each other.

00:10:29.542 --> 00:10:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And I was just
researching the other day,

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:34.840 align:middle line:84%
even the Zoroastrians, they
say that every 12,000 years

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.230 align:middle line:90%
there's a renewal and a reset.

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And the last one was 12,000
years ago, a great flood.

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:42.190 align:middle line:84%
So you just hear this
story over and over.

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:46.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: We have something
like Gobekli Tepe, which is not

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:49.080 align:middle line:90%
connected to any of this.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.710 align:middle line:90%
We've got the Bible.

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:55.630 align:middle line:84%
You've got what happened with
the melting of the glaciers

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:59.650 align:middle line:84%
and the events that happened in
North America, where allegedly

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:01.940 align:middle line:84%
there were no cultures
here to note that.

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:04.120 align:middle line:90%
But the flood did happen.

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:08.920 align:middle line:84%
And we start looking at
this 10500 BC number that

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.380 align:middle line:84%
correlates with
everything else, including

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:12.890 align:middle line:90%
the dating of the Great Sphinx.

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:13.690 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: Yeah.

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:17.260 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: This pops up over and
over again and dates correctly,

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:21.050 align:middle line:84%
not only with Gilgamesh, but
with Plato's Atlantis, right?

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:22.010 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: Yeah, exactly.

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And then you have even
scientific evidence from Robert

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:28.300 align:middle line:84%
Schoch, for example, that shows
that the erosion of the Sphinx

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:31.270 align:middle line:84%
goes back to the same amount
of years as all these other

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:33.110 align:middle line:84%
cultures saying
12,000 years ago.

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:34.042 align:middle line:90%
But it's not even--

00:11:34.042 --> 00:11:35.750 align:middle line:84%
it's not even a
conspiracy at this point.

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:38.250 align:middle line:84%
It's conventionally accepted
that there was a cataclysm that

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:40.420 align:middle line:84%
happened 12,000 to
13,000 years ago.

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:42.670 align:middle line:84%
Through archeological digs,
they can even see that

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:44.240 align:middle line:84%
there's a specific
type of sediment,

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.080 align:middle line:84%
that there was some type of
catastrophe that lasted for over

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.200 align:middle line:90%
1,000 years.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.103 align:middle line:84%
So now that we've proven
it scientifically,

00:11:51.103 --> 00:11:52.770 align:middle line:84%
and if we look back
at the ancient texts

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:54.250 align:middle line:84%
and we're seeing
the same dating,

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:55.917 align:middle line:84%
there is enough
information there for us

00:11:55.917 --> 00:11:57.870 align:middle line:84%
to research this even
further and maybe think

00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:00.210 align:middle line:84%
that they were talking about
a collective memory rather

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:01.810 align:middle line:90%
than just a fantastical story.

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:03.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: You live
in Peru right now.

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:05.440 align:middle line:84%
You have the same
physical evidence,

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.230 align:middle line:84%
trace evidence all
over that country

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:08.670 align:middle line:90%
going to the same dating--

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:09.470 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: Exactly.

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:14.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: --of burnt glass
creation all over the country.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.480 align:middle line:84%
And that is dated to
that same time period.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:20.130 align:middle line:84%
I want to go back, if
I can, to 2003, staying

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:26.130 align:middle line:84%
on this possible Anunnaki,
Gilgamesh, Maldek-Mars

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:30.090 align:middle line:84%
war connection that a lot
of us are starting to take

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:31.900 align:middle line:90%
a little more serious today.

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:33.953 align:middle line:84%
But this came to you
in dreams, didn't it?

00:12:33.953 --> 00:12:34.870 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: Yeah, exactly.

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:38.247 align:middle line:84%
I was having-- I had a few
different repeated dreams that

00:12:38.247 --> 00:12:40.080 align:middle line:84%
just kept coming back
to me, but one of them

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.710 align:middle line:90%
was of my time on Maldek.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:44.580 align:middle line:84%
And this dream was even before
I started researching that there

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.250 align:middle line:84%
was an asteroid belt.
I knew from high school

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:49.900 align:middle line:84%
that there was one, but I never
even put the dots together

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:51.150 align:middle line:90%
that there was a planet there.

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:54.150 align:middle line:84%
And I would have a dream that
I would be in a stasis chamber.

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:56.220 align:middle line:84%
Every time I would go
to sleep in this life,

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.580 align:middle line:84%
I would wake up in a stasis
chamber that would then

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:00.870 align:middle line:84%
lift from my face,
smoke would come out,

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:03.060 align:middle line:84%
I would see wires
coming out of my hands,

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:04.860 align:middle line:84%
and then I would
go grab a weapon--

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:06.463 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: What is
the stasis chamber?

00:13:06.463 --> 00:13:07.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GAUR: A stasis
chamber basically

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:11.270 align:middle line:84%
is like a cryotherapy
chamber, where

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:15.230 align:middle line:84%
you may be frozen or have a
type of gas that slows down

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:17.240 align:middle line:84%
all your vital
organs to the point

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:20.540 align:middle line:84%
that you're able to not age
and go into a deep sleep

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:22.950 align:middle line:84%
as you're going and traversing
far distances in space.

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:23.750 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Gotcha.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:26.550 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you awoke
from this chamber.

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:28.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GAUR: So I woke
from this chamber.

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:29.570 align:middle line:90%
I go and there's--

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:32.580 align:middle line:84%
I see chambers as far as the
eyes can see on this ship.

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:34.832 align:middle line:84%
We're all going and we're
picking up these weapons,

00:13:34.832 --> 00:13:36.540 align:middle line:84%
and we get teleported
down to the planet.

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:37.980 align:middle line:90%
And I'm engaging in a war.

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And this happened
repeatedly over and over.

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:40.867 align:middle line:90%
And at some points--

00:13:40.867 --> 00:13:42.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Who were you fighting?

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.777 align:middle line:84%
>>GAUR: There was--
we both looked human.

00:13:44.777 --> 00:13:46.110 align:middle line:90%
It was a different civilization.

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:48.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure who they were, but
they looked pretty much similar

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.360 align:middle line:90%
to me.

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.380 align:middle line:84%
But what came to me
later, through meditation

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:54.290 align:middle line:84%
and different downloads,
was that I was actually

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:56.600 align:middle line:84%
incarnated on both sides,
because the way our soul

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.160 align:middle line:84%
works is we can incarnate
into multiple bodies,

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.110 align:middle line:84%
sometimes within
the same reality.

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:03.590 align:middle line:84%
So in some of my dreams,
I would actually shift

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:06.608 align:middle line:84%
from being this warrior
to being the person

00:14:06.608 --> 00:14:08.150 align:middle line:84%
that I was actually
fighting against.

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:10.040 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Wait, your soul split.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:13.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GAUR: So the soul can
actually incarnate, not only

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:15.960 align:middle line:84%
into different parallel
realities at the same time,

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.020 align:middle line:84%
but you could have a
soul split on Earth

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:19.670 align:middle line:84%
right now where
somebody on Earth

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:23.000 align:middle line:84%
has a fragment of your soul
incarnated on this planet

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.520 align:middle line:84%
that you can actually
go and interact with.

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Is this a past life?

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:33.510 align:middle line:84%
Do you consider this part of
you and part of your reality,

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:38.150 align:middle line:84%
or was this something
that is a dream

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:40.250 align:middle line:84%
and is something
else altogether?

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:41.250 align:middle line:90%
How do you look at this?

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:43.167 align:middle line:84%
>>GAUR: I look at it as
a past life, for sure.

00:14:43.167 --> 00:14:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And at the time
when it happened,

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:46.443 align:middle line:84%
I really didn't know
what to make out of it,

00:14:46.443 --> 00:14:47.910 align:middle line:84%
but that was over
15 years ago now.

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And since then, I've
had many regressions

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:52.010 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of other dots
have been connected

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:53.990 align:middle line:84%
on what has happened
throughout the Galaxy

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:55.740 align:middle line:84%
and what my role was
on different planets.

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:57.180 align:middle line:84%
So I feel like it
was a past life.

00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:58.640 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: How long ago was this?

00:14:58.640 --> 00:14:59.932 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: This one, I don't know.

00:14:59.932 --> 00:15:01.057 align:middle line:90%
It didn't get dates for it.

00:15:01.057 --> 00:15:02.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: You didn't
get dates for it,

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:03.960 align:middle line:90%
but there was technology there.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:04.760 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: Yeah.

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:08.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Was there anything
referencing another time period?

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:09.660 align:middle line:90%
Were there pyramids?

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:10.880 align:middle line:90%
Were there roads?

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:11.940 align:middle line:90%
Was there something else?

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:13.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GAUR: This was towards
the end of the war

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:15.470 align:middle line:84%
when I was going there, the
dreams and the memories I

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:17.510 align:middle line:84%
was having, and the whole
planet was desolated

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:19.670 align:middle line:84%
from nuclear
explosions and bombs

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:22.580 align:middle line:90%
and warring for quite some time.

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:23.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: And this was Mars.

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:24.980 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: This was Maldek.

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:25.610 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: So Maldek.

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:28.152 align:middle line:84%
>>GAUR: This is the asteroid
belt, the current asteroid belt.

00:15:28.152 --> 00:15:29.750 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: So this is Maldek.

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:33.480 align:middle line:90%
After that, where to though?

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:36.810 align:middle line:84%
What, did the technology and
the civilization go to Mars?

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:38.880 align:middle line:90%
Did it go to Earth, to the moon?

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:39.680 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: Yeah.

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:43.670 align:middle line:84%
So in the memories
that I had, I only

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:45.808 align:middle line:84%
was seeing myself in the
war, fighting the war,

00:15:45.808 --> 00:15:47.350 align:middle line:84%
and it was the same
time as that war.

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:48.975 align:middle line:84%
Something happened
in particular there.

00:15:48.975 --> 00:15:50.470 align:middle line:90%
I even know what I was wearing.

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:51.630 align:middle line:84%
There was actually
a pill that they

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:53.213 align:middle line:84%
would give every
single one of us that

00:15:53.213 --> 00:15:55.170 align:middle line:84%
was kind of a mind
control MKUltra pill

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:57.580 align:middle line:84%
as well that we're taking so
I have all those memories.

00:15:57.580 --> 00:15:59.655 align:middle line:84%
What happened after
the war, I don't know.

00:15:59.655 --> 00:16:02.100 align:middle line:84%
But from my memories
and my information

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:03.660 align:middle line:84%
afterwards, my
research afterwards,

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:07.560 align:middle line:84%
is that there was actually a
tribe of people from Maldek

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:08.890 align:middle line:90%
that then migrated to Earth.

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:12.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: If this was Maldek
and this is asteroid belt,

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:16.330 align:middle line:84%
we could be dealing with
hundreds of millions of years,

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:17.130 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:18.096 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: Exactly.

00:16:18.096 --> 00:16:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Now, what about
other downloads from people

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:25.470 align:middle line:90%
that you have talked to?

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:30.160 align:middle line:84%
Has there been a connecting of
the dots with your experience?

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.248 align:middle line:84%
You keep your
experience to yourself,

00:16:32.248 --> 00:16:34.290 align:middle line:84%
but when you're talking
to somebody else and then

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:37.680 align:middle line:84%
you hear something that
is similar to yours,

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.115 align:middle line:84%
to help confirm and
validate your experience.

00:16:40.115 --> 00:16:42.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GAUR: Yes, I've had a lot
of those type of experiences.

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And what I've come
to realize now

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:45.913 align:middle line:84%
is that there is a
lot that has happened

00:16:45.913 --> 00:16:48.330 align:middle line:84%
in the Galaxy, many different
stories that are overlapping

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:50.890 align:middle line:84%
and some that seem seemingly
independent from each other.

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Plus the way that time works
on Earth, some of us that

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:54.750 align:middle line:84%
are incarnated on
Earth, we actually

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:56.750 align:middle line:84%
have different timelines
and different histories

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:57.670 align:middle line:90%
than other people.

00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:00.550 align:middle line:84%
So in my timeline, I might
have had a Maldek story,

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:03.840 align:middle line:84%
but in your timeline, that
may never have even happened.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.369 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: When you
have a regression,

00:17:06.369 --> 00:17:11.319 align:middle line:84%
what's the goal with that, to
go back to that period or find

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:12.119 align:middle line:90%
out--

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:14.859 align:middle line:84%
or is it trauma that
you're trying to fix,

00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:18.190 align:middle line:84%
or is it a past
life here on Earth?

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:19.815 align:middle line:84%
What's the intention
of the regression?

00:17:19.815 --> 00:17:20.615 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: Yeah.

00:17:20.615 --> 00:17:22.210 align:middle line:84%
So the intention
of the regression,

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:25.368 align:middle line:84%
there is a component to it to
heal from different traumas.

00:17:25.368 --> 00:17:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And then when you start looking
at the traumas here on Earth,

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:30.610 align:middle line:84%
it does sometimes go off
planet to before you incarnate

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:31.450 align:middle line:90%
and what occurred.

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:33.660 align:middle line:84%
So the first time I
did it, I had no--

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:35.313 align:middle line:90%
I just wanted to experience it.

00:17:35.313 --> 00:17:37.480 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing that I
really was trying to go to.

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And then in that
regression, I randomly

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:41.670 align:middle line:84%
showed up on Orion,
in Orion's belt,

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:43.530 align:middle line:90%
in the central star Alnilam.

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And then my second regression,
I go into the Inner Earth.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm not even
attempting to go there.

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:51.253 align:middle line:84%
So my third regression, that's
when I became more intentional.

00:17:51.253 --> 00:17:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And the third
regression, we spent

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:53.817 align:middle line:90%
five hours exploring Orion.

00:17:53.817 --> 00:17:55.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: What was
your intention that

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.008 align:middle line:90%
was set for that regression?

00:17:57.008 --> 00:17:58.050 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: For the last one?

00:17:58.050 --> 00:17:58.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Yeah.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:17:59.760 align:middle line:84%
>>GAUR: The third
one, the intention

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.450 align:middle line:84%
was to look and see
what the connection was

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:04.880 align:middle line:84%
to the reptilians,
Orion, the Nebula

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:08.690 align:middle line:84%
in Orion, M42 Nebula, and
the incarnational process

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:11.690 align:middle line:90%
from the Orion beings to Earth.

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:15.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: When I regressed, I
regressed with no intention.

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:17.340 align:middle line:90%
It was very interesting.

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And regression, I think,
is very important.

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:25.490 align:middle line:84%
I didn't take it as
serious as I do now.

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
I say that is I

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:33.590 align:middle line:84%
remembered things
that I didn't even

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:35.170 align:middle line:90%
know that I knew anything about.

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:35.970 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: Yeah.

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:38.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: It was very
interesting to me.

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And to back up and
then realize who

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:44.140 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed over
the years and people that

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:46.600 align:middle line:84%
have had these
experiences, I wanted

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:49.870 align:middle line:84%
to go back and reflect on
what they were trying to say.

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:52.390 align:middle line:84%
It's a very difficult thing
to describe to somebody

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:54.790 align:middle line:84%
that's never had a
regression experience.

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:57.250 align:middle line:84%
Setting intention is
important, but would you

00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:59.030 align:middle line:90%
go into it open to as well?

00:18:59.030 --> 00:18:59.830 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: 100%.

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:00.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Without an intention.

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:02.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GAUR: So the first
two I had no intention.

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And actually, to be clear,
the third one, I just

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:05.648 align:middle line:90%
wanted to explore Orion.

00:19:05.648 --> 00:19:07.940 align:middle line:84%
So everything that I had told
you is what came from it.

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:11.150 align:middle line:84%
So because on the second one,
I ended up in Orion in the end.

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:14.180 align:middle line:84%
So the third one, I was
like, maybe I'll go to Orion.

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:16.220 align:middle line:84%
But if it doesn't take
me there, then so be it.

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:18.710 align:middle line:84%
But I actually did go and
experience Orion in that one.

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:21.580 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Do you feel that
through these experiences,

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:24.290 align:middle line:84%
and not only that, but what
you have learned in research,

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:29.500 align:middle line:84%
of course, throughout life, that
consciousness and entanglement

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.580 align:middle line:84%
is connecting everything
in the universe.

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:35.110 align:middle line:84%
So when you talk about
Orion, it may be distant,

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:38.170 align:middle line:84%
but we're connected directly
through consciousness right

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:41.230 align:middle line:84%
here on this planet
and the communication

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:42.770 align:middle line:90%
happens in real time.

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:44.030 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: Yeah, that's true.

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And I would say that if
you look on the planet

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.390 align:middle line:84%
and you look at ancient
sites, you don't really

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:51.955 align:middle line:84%
see sites that are aligned
to Arcturus, to the Pleiades.

00:19:51.955 --> 00:19:53.330 align:middle line:84%
There might be
some around there.

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:55.882 align:middle line:84%
But if there's one site or
there's one constellation

00:19:55.882 --> 00:19:57.340 align:middle line:84%
that you see most
of the alignments

00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:59.730 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of deities
connected to, it's Orion,

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:00.980 align:middle line:90%
and there's a reason for that.

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:03.790 align:middle line:84%
So for Orion, time has
progressed and a lot of things

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:05.540 align:middle line:84%
have happened since
the Orion wars.

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:08.140 align:middle line:84%
But for a lot of people, because
of entanglement in the way

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:11.500 align:middle line:84%
that time works, we literally
just incarnated there yesterday

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.320 align:middle line:84%
or our past
incarnation was there.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.820 align:middle line:84%
So even though Orion might have
gone millions of Earth years

00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:17.800 align:middle line:84%
into the future,
many of us actually

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.860 align:middle line:90%
just came from that experience.

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:23.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Let's stay
right there for a second.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:29.270 align:middle line:84%
Are we describing the linear
distance on a Yuga cycle?

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:31.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GAUR: So not when
it comes to Orion,

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:32.870 align:middle line:84%
because the Yuga
cycles in particular,

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:35.540 align:middle line:84%
even though there's this
solar systematic Yuga cycles,

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:37.670 align:middle line:84%
there's galactic ones,
there's universal ones.

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:38.960 align:middle line:90%
The cycles just keep going on.

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.530 align:middle line:84%
So the Yuga cycles that
I specifically talk about

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:43.090 align:middle line:90%
is Earth cycle.

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:47.060 align:middle line:84%
So the Orion one is a
separate construct entirely.

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:49.210 align:middle line:84%
However, the beings
that came from Orion

00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:51.520 align:middle line:84%
did have an effect on
our Yuga cycles on Earth.

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.570 align:middle line:84%
Before they came,
the Yuga cycles,

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:56.360 align:middle line:84%
they weren't such a
fluctuation of polarity.

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.630 align:middle line:84%
But when they came and
their influence actually

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:00.860 align:middle line:84%
helped us get to the
densities that we are at now,

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:04.880 align:middle line:84%
now we have such a wide
diversity of experiences,

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:08.110 align:middle line:84%
from the highest of highs
to the lowest of lows.

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:09.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: We've
got a graphic here

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:12.430 align:middle line:84%
that will help explain
the Yuga cycles,

00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:15.130 align:middle line:90%
and we've got it right here.

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:16.040 align:middle line:90%
Walk me through this.

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:16.840 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: Yeah.

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:19.700 align:middle line:84%
There's four ages
within the Yuga cycles.

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:22.460 align:middle line:84%
Many ancient civilizations
have spoke about it,

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:24.970 align:middle line:84%
but in India seems to be the
only place that we actually

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:25.850 align:middle line:90%
have dates.

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And the four cycles are split
into the Kali Yuga, which

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:33.010 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people know about, the
dark ages, which many people say

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:34.610 align:middle line:90%
we're in or that we were in.

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:37.970 align:middle line:84%
We have the Dwapara Yuga,
which is the Bronze Age.

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:41.070 align:middle line:84%
We have the Treta Yuga,
which is the Silver Age.

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And then we have the Satya
Yuga, the Golden age.

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:45.682 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people think that we're
going straight to the Golden

00:21:45.682 --> 00:21:47.520 align:middle line:84%
Age, but based on these
types of calendars,

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:50.790 align:middle line:84%
we're moving from the
Kali to the Dwapara.

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Every single one of
these ages has a theme.

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:56.600 align:middle line:84%
So not only does
each age is doubled

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.030 align:middle line:84%
the size of the other
age, so Kali Yuga--

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:01.230 align:middle line:84%
Dwapara Yuga is twice
the size of Kali Yuga.

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:04.950 align:middle line:84%
Treta is twice the size of
the Yuga before it, and so on.

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:09.240 align:middle line:84%
But in each age, the age limit
of humanity also doubles.

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:13.350 align:middle line:84%
So in Kali Yuga, we
have 120-year age limit.

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:15.140 align:middle line:90%
That's how much we live until.

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:17.480 align:middle line:84%
If we didn't have pollution,
chemicals, different things

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:21.030 align:middle line:84%
and we had a good environment,
we would all live to around 120.

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And then you go to the Dwapara
Yuga, age doubles to 240.

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:27.890 align:middle line:84%
So each of these ages
also have a theme.

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:31.370 align:middle line:84%
The Kali Yuga's theme
is hierarchy, authority,

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:32.460 align:middle line:90%
and delusion.

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:35.000 align:middle line:84%
So meaning that when you
get into that density,

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.350 align:middle line:84%
you have not only amnesia,
you don't forget--

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:39.420 align:middle line:84%
you forget your
connection to the cosmos,

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:42.510 align:middle line:84%
you forget your connection to
extraterrestrials, the divine.

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:44.430 align:middle line:84%
But it's also the
age of delusion,

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:47.450 align:middle line:84%
which goes without saying
how right is wrong and wrong

00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:50.630 align:middle line:84%
is right in many ways, and
it's also the age of authority

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:53.420 align:middle line:84%
and hierarchy, when you give
up your power to authorities

00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:55.920 align:middle line:84%
and hierarchies and you
forget your own sovereignty.

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And case in point on
that one, we just,

00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:01.350 align:middle line:84%
a few hundred years ago,
if not even before that,

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:03.780 align:middle line:84%
little earlier than that or
a little later than that,

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:08.690 align:middle line:84%
we have giving up your power
to a sovereign because now

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:10.280 align:middle line:90%
we're regaining our sovereignty.

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And in the next age, the Dwapara
Yuga, that's the age of energy.

00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:17.820 align:middle line:84%
So as we're shifting
from the Kali Yuga,

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:20.160 align:middle line:84%
we're shifting from
this hierarchy delusion

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.452 align:middle line:84%
and we're going through a
200-year transitionary phase,

00:23:22.452 --> 00:23:23.910 align:middle line:84%
and that's what
we're in right now,

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:25.410 align:middle line:90%
the 200-year transition phase.

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:26.310 align:middle line:90%
We're ascending.

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:29.660 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at that calendar,
you can see that this 13,000

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:31.890 align:middle line:84%
years of one cycle that
we've been descending.

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:33.590 align:middle line:84%
So we went through
that descension cycle

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:35.160 align:middle line:90%
and now we're on the other time.

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.420 align:middle line:84%
So we've gone through the
other part of the Kali Yuga

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:39.590 align:middle line:84%
and we're ascending into
the Dwapara Yuga now.

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:43.540 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: It seems tangible.

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:47.660 align:middle line:84%
I think we all know that
there is something going on.

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:50.020 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to have a
belief in consciousness

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:55.250 align:middle line:84%
or our community to not see
what is going on right now,

00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:59.740 align:middle line:84%
not only with the world,
but with ET contact.

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:02.740 align:middle line:84%
Is ET contact and
the conversations

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:06.370 align:middle line:84%
that we're having right now with
the media, programs like this,

00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:08.330 align:middle line:90%
is this part of the ascension?

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:09.130 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: 100%.

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:11.710 align:middle line:10%
So what happens at the
end of all these ages

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:14.980 align:middle line:10%
is the old systems that
are no longer serving

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:16.280 align:middle line:10%
humanity start crumbling.

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:17.900 align:middle line:10%
And that's what we're seeing
in the world right now.

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:20.500 align:middle line:84%
That's why we see so much chaos,
because all the things that

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.720 align:middle line:84%
aren't serving us, that
aren't at the vibration

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.240 align:middle line:84%
for the new dimension, the
new paradigm we're going into

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.293 align:middle line:90%
are basically crumbling.

00:24:26.293 --> 00:24:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why that
there's this awakening

00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:30.430 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness, people
are not only becoming

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:32.290 align:middle line:84%
awakened to consciousness,
but they're also

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:35.290 align:middle line:84%
becoming awakened to the
corruption of the institutions

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:37.450 align:middle line:84%
and the governments
that claim to control us

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:38.910 align:middle line:90%
and to rule over us.

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:40.182 align:middle line:90%
So it's all a part of that.

00:24:40.182 --> 00:24:41.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: That's interesting.

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:44.800 align:middle line:84%
ET must have been, and
still is, observing us

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.280 align:middle line:90%
for millions of years.

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:47.080 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: Yeah.

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: A lot of ET.

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:51.280 align:middle line:84%
It's not one specific
species or race.

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:52.820 align:middle line:90%
It could be an infinite number.

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:57.530 align:middle line:84%
But they also see what's going
on this planet too as well.

00:24:57.530 --> 00:24:58.330 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: Yeah.

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:01.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Are they aware
of our ascension cycle?

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And is this part
of the ET contact,

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:07.213 align:middle line:90%
and it's because they are aware?

00:25:07.213 --> 00:25:08.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GAUR: Yeah,
they're aware of it.

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:11.213 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of them actually help
contribute towards creating it

00:25:11.213 --> 00:25:12.540 align:middle line:90%
in the first place.

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And they also know that when
we're in specific Yuga cycles,

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:18.430 align:middle line:84%
we have a veil of
amnesia where we forget

00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:20.650 align:middle line:84%
a lot of things about who
we are and our connection

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:21.710 align:middle line:90%
to the cosmos.

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:25.060 align:middle line:84%
And they also know that
we've been under quarantine.

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:26.500 align:middle line:84%
When we're in the
Kali Yuga, we're

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:28.150 align:middle line:84%
in something called
quarantine, which

00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:30.400 align:middle line:84%
means that the level of
consciousness of humanity

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.438 align:middle line:84%
is at such a low
level that they don't

00:25:32.438 --> 00:25:34.230 align:middle line:84%
want to interact with
us because of the way

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:35.232 align:middle line:90%
we might respond to it.

00:25:35.232 --> 00:25:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And now we're going
through a phase

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:37.898 align:middle line:90%
where we're moving out of it.

00:25:37.898 --> 00:25:40.920 align:middle line:84%
So part of us having all these
sightings, people openly talking

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:43.300 align:middle line:84%
about it, congressional
members speaking about it,

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:45.820 align:middle line:84%
is getting humanity
ready for the next age,

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:47.880 align:middle line:84%
for the next Yuga cycle,
when eventually we'll

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.072 align:middle line:90%
have open contact.

00:25:49.072 --> 00:25:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: When do you
think that's going to be?

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:53.050 align:middle line:84%
That's the million-dollar
question, isn't it?

00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:57.170 align:middle line:84%
But we can all feel that
something is imminent.

00:25:57.170 --> 00:25:58.170 align:middle line:90%
When do you think it is?

00:25:58.170 --> 00:26:00.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GAUR: So I was never into
dates for the most part,

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:03.180 align:middle line:84%
because so many people
have prophesied dates

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:05.315 align:middle line:90%
since 2012 and afterwards.

00:26:05.315 --> 00:26:08.220 align:middle line:84%
But I do feel that we're at the
cusp of something great right

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:10.622 align:middle line:84%
now, especially because
things that were ridiculed

00:26:10.622 --> 00:26:13.080 align:middle line:84%
are now being openly talked
about on a level that has never

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.080 align:middle line:90%
been done before.

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:15.890 align:middle line:84%
So we're getting very,
very close to it.

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:18.390 align:middle line:84%
And I would say, don't throw
the baby out with the bathwater

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:19.890 align:middle line:84%
because many people
have been jaded

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:21.430 align:middle line:90%
and disillusioned by government.

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:23.220 align:middle line:84%
So when they see all
these individuals

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:25.030 align:middle line:84%
within government
speaking about it,

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:28.110 align:middle line:84%
a lot of times they just say,
oh, it's just another psyop.

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:30.520 align:middle line:84%
But what's really happening
is the drip disclosure.

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And maybe on some level,
this drip disclosure

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:34.940 align:middle line:84%
is benefiting humanity
because the first thing that

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:37.010 align:middle line:84%
needs to happen is
everyone on Earth needs

00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:39.310 align:middle line:84%
to know we're not
alone in the universe.

00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:42.230 align:middle line:84%
When that happens, that has
a shift in our consciousness

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:44.460 align:middle line:84%
that then opens us
up to the next level.

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:46.590 align:middle line:84%
So I would say within
the next few years,

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:48.260 align:middle line:84%
we're going to get to a
place where everyone on Earth

00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:50.370 align:middle line:84%
is going to know we're
not alone in the universe,

00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:53.900 align:middle line:84%
maybe before 2030,
maybe 2027, and then

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:55.550 align:middle line:84%
we'll see what
happens after that.

00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:58.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: A couple
of years ago, I

00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:05.330 align:middle line:84%
heard for the first time from
the White House press office UFO

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:07.110 align:middle line:90%
at a live press briefing.

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And I stepped back and said,
well, that's the first time

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:12.270 align:middle line:90%
that that's ever happened.

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:15.830 align:middle line:84%
And second, if there's ever
been a question of us living

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:18.320 align:middle line:90%
in a simulation, this is it.

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:21.450 align:middle line:84%
It didn't seem real,
but that is a shift.

00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:27.620 align:middle line:84%
That is a conscious simulation
vibrational matrix happening

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:29.910 align:middle line:84%
and presented out to the
rest of the world, isn't it?

00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:31.640 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: Yeah, exactly.

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:35.120 align:middle line:84%
So on a simulation
level, yes, in what

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:36.690 align:middle line:84%
you just spoke
about, yes, for sure.

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And now also we're seeing that
these craft are doing things

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:41.440 align:middle line:84%
that we do not
know how can happen

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.440 align:middle line:84%
because of the laws of
physics are being broken.

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.770 align:middle line:84%
So that's where
the simulation is.

00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:48.120 align:middle line:84%
We have a set of laws and
it's the laws of physics.

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:50.120 align:middle line:84%
But now we're seeing on
the quantum world, which

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:52.430 align:middle line:84%
is subatomic world,
everything below an atom,

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:54.600 align:middle line:84%
are operating by a
different set of laws.

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:57.140 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting thing
is the subatomic world

00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:59.460 align:middle line:84%
are the building blocks
for the atomic world.

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:01.820 align:middle line:84%
So how can the building
blocks for the atomic world

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:04.620 align:middle line:84%
be paradoxical to
what is creating?

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:07.700 align:middle line:84%
So we are able to
perceive and see

00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:11.610 align:middle line:84%
that the universe and the code
of reality doesn't make sense.

00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:14.390 align:middle line:84%
But in a lot of ways,
governments and scientists

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:15.990 align:middle line:84%
really don't know
what to make of it.

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
happening with UFOs.

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.950 align:middle line:84%
They're breaking
the sound barrier.

00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:21.890 align:middle line:84%
They're going at speeds
that we can't even

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:23.660 align:middle line:84%
do with our conventional
craft, or even

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:25.680 align:middle line:90%
go against the laws of physics.

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:28.655 align:middle line:84%
So we're stepping into not only
a new world with disclosure,

00:28:28.655 --> 00:28:30.530 align:middle line:84%
but also stepping into
a new world of science

00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:33.170 align:middle line:84%
and really understanding what
the fabric of the universe is.

00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:34.753 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Wouldn't
that suggest to you

00:28:34.753 --> 00:28:37.930 align:middle line:84%
that the quantum
world is conscious?

00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:40.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GAUR: I would say that
everything is consciousness.

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:41.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Right.

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:43.100 align:middle line:84%
It seems sentient
and making decisions.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:43.900 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: Yeah.

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: When that goes
against what science

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:50.470 align:middle line:84%
says, that you need mass
and a brain and chemistry

00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:53.325 align:middle line:84%
to create consciousness when we
have something else happening

00:28:53.325 --> 00:28:54.200 align:middle line:90%
right in front of us.

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GAUR: Well, a
great example of that

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:56.510 align:middle line:90%
is the double slit experiment.

00:28:56.510 --> 00:29:01.510 align:middle line:84%
Just by the simple observation
of the electron going

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:03.310 align:middle line:84%
through the double
slit, it collapses

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:05.680 align:middle line:84%
into an actual
timeline and becomes

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:07.340 align:middle line:90%
an actual tangible probability.

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:08.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: You change its state.

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:09.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GAUR: But when you're
not looking at it,

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:11.780 align:middle line:84%
it just acts as infinite
possibilities as a wave.

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:14.350 align:middle line:84%
So thereby, whatever is
happening on the quantum level

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:16.335 align:middle line:90%
is aware of us perceiving it.

00:29:16.335 --> 00:29:17.710 align:middle line:10%
>>CHURCH: Isn't
that more science

00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:19.960 align:middle line:10%
fiction than this
community has ever

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:22.480 align:middle line:10%
been science fiction,
but yet that science

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:25.900 align:middle line:10%
and they want us to accept that,
that you can change something

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:27.160 align:middle line:10%
state by observing it?

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:27.960 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: Yeah.

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:29.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And that whole component,
the double slit experiment,

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:35.500 align:middle line:84%
entanglement, so many different
concepts in quantum physics,

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:38.610 align:middle line:84%
I feel that we don't take enough
time to philosophically actually

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:41.730 align:middle line:84%
look at what that really
means for who and what we are.

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:47.880 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: When you observe
something in the sky,

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:52.320 align:middle line:84%
let's stay right here for a
second, the comments, there

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:56.220 align:middle line:84%
has been a change in those
observations over the years,

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:59.370 align:middle line:84%
where we have gone from flying
saucers, and we still do,

00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:00.930 align:middle line:90%
metallic craft, metallic disks.

00:30:00.930 --> 00:30:03.490 align:middle line:90%
That has never gone away.

00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:07.110 align:middle line:84%
But now the
inter-dimensional aspect

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:10.050 align:middle line:84%
is now here, where
we're seeing stuff

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:12.670 align:middle line:90%
appear and disappear at will.

00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:14.740 align:middle line:84%
What do you think is
actually going on?

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:16.510 align:middle line:84%
Is it appearing
and disappearing?

00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:19.960 align:middle line:84%
Is it leaving and going
into another dimension?

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.980 align:middle line:84%
Is it just traveling that
way, going from point to point

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:25.590 align:middle line:84%
and we observe it
as disappearing?

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:26.770 align:middle line:90%
What is happening?

00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:28.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GAUR: I feel that there's
a lot of different things

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:30.190 align:middle line:84%
happening because there's
many different types of craft,

00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:31.600 align:middle line:90%
different beings visiting us.

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:34.840 align:middle line:84%
Definitely inter-dimensional
travel, wormholes for sure,

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:36.600 align:middle line:84%
also existing at
a light spectrum

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:38.800 align:middle line:84%
that's not perceivable
to the human senses.

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.040 align:middle line:84%
But if you really
say-- a lot of people

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:43.420 align:middle line:84%
say that there's a lot of
UFOs around the planet,

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:45.555 align:middle line:84%
there's many of them
surrounding us right now.

00:30:45.555 --> 00:30:47.680 align:middle line:84%
But then when we look out
there, we don't see them.

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And the answer to that
is it's a frequency game.

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:52.690 align:middle line:84%
We exist in a certain
bandwidth of frequency.

00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:54.270 align:middle line:84%
Many of these
beings, even if they

00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:56.430 align:middle line:84%
don't exist at that other
frequency range that

00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:58.557 align:middle line:84%
is out of the range
that we can perceive,

00:30:58.557 --> 00:31:00.390 align:middle line:84%
they have the technology
to be able to shift

00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:01.890 align:middle line:84%
into those vibrations
that we can't

00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:04.410 align:middle line:84%
perceive with our eyes
or our ears or anything.

00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:08.170 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Is shifting into
that vibration for us,

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:10.130 align:middle line:84%
is that an accident
or intentional?

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:12.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GAUR: When they are shifting,
or are you talking about us?

00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:13.170 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Both.

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:15.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GAUR: So what's
happening is as there's

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.040 align:middle line:84%
a shift on the planet occurring,
shift in consciousness,

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:19.750 align:middle line:84%
not only is it happening
metaphysically,

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:22.620 align:middle line:84%
but also the position of our
solar system in our Galaxy

00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:24.970 align:middle line:84%
is actually affecting the
vibration of the planet,

00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:27.000 align:middle line:84%
is that we are now
slowly becoming

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.640 align:middle line:84%
those beings that
are at the vibration

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:30.120 align:middle line:90%
that we'll be able to perceive.

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:31.162 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: That's correct.

00:31:31.162 --> 00:31:32.580 align:middle line:90%
So we are the aliens to them.

00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:35.633 align:middle line:84%
We may be the ghosts
in their dimension.

00:31:35.633 --> 00:31:37.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GAUR: We could
be their shadows.

00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:37.560 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: That's right.

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:37.940 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: Yeah.

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:38.640 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: That's right.

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:39.720 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that interesting?

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:40.887 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: That is interesting.

00:31:40.887 --> 00:31:44.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: I think about that
all the time, where it just

00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:46.190 align:middle line:90%
may be an accident.

00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:49.460 align:middle line:84%
In another dimension,
some little ET being

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:52.560 align:middle line:84%
runs into his mom and
says, I just saw an alien.

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: Yeah.

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:55.622 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: And he observes
you and I sitting here

00:31:55.622 --> 00:31:56.830 align:middle line:90%
talking in this conversation.

00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:57.830 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: That's so funny.

00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:59.960 align:middle line:84%
I have a friend
that actually had

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:02.460 align:middle line:84%
dreams of her being channeled
on a different planet,

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:05.480 align:middle line:84%
channeling her consciousness
here on another planet.

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:11.450 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Now with CERN, with
different experiments here,

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:14.600 align:middle line:84%
we have Trinity,
all of the nuclear--

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.490 align:middle line:84%
Oppenheimer, all of
the nuclear things

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:18.150 align:middle line:84%
that we have done
on this planet,

00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:21.590 align:middle line:84%
is it possible that we
could be opening up portals

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:23.370 align:middle line:90%
and dimensions unintentionally?

00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:24.920 align:middle line:84%
>>GAUR: Yeah, so there's
a lot of things with CERN

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:26.340 align:middle line:84%
that we probably
don't know about.

00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:28.048 align:middle line:84%
But even the things
that we do know about

00:32:28.048 --> 00:32:30.015 align:middle line:84%
are actually smoking
guns for this.

00:32:30.015 --> 00:32:33.560 align:middle line:84%
For example, in CERN, they have
the large hydrogen collider.

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:35.890 align:middle line:84%
They're sending photons
around, and the photons

00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:36.980 align:middle line:90%
bang into each other.

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:38.745 align:middle line:90%
They smash into each other.

00:32:38.745 --> 00:32:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And then the God particle,
or Graviton, comes out of it.

00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:45.370 align:middle line:84%
So one of the studies that
happened just a few years ago

00:32:45.370 --> 00:32:47.530 align:middle line:84%
is that the Graviton
would release

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:52.125 align:middle line:84%
from the impact of those two
particles and it would vanish.

00:32:52.125 --> 00:32:54.905 align:middle line:84%
It just released and all of a
sudden it's completely gone.

00:32:54.905 --> 00:32:56.780 align:middle line:84%
So they started wondering
what was happening,

00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:59.930 align:middle line:84%
and they were theorizing, oh,
what we believe has happened

00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:04.250 align:middle line:84%
is this Graviton vanishes into
a fifth dimensional space,

00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:06.230 align:middle line:84%
into an area of space
we can't perceive.

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:08.150 align:middle line:84%
So if you take a moment
to think about it,

00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:10.377 align:middle line:84%
to me, that's almost
like with that collision,

00:33:10.377 --> 00:33:11.960 align:middle line:84%
they're creating a
fifth dimensional--

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:13.360 align:middle line:84%
they're creating
a portal that is

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:16.790 align:middle line:84%
allowing subatomic particles to
vibrate into another reality.

00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:19.240 align:middle line:84%
And that is just the beginning,
because right now we're

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:21.700 align:middle line:84%
doing these things on
the subatomic level.

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:25.300 align:middle line:84%
But when we figure out how
to take the subatomic science

00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:27.190 align:middle line:84%
and bring it into
the Newtonian science

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:29.140 align:middle line:84%
and use it on a
bigger level, that's

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:32.587 align:middle line:84%
when we start getting
space travel spacecraft.

00:33:32.587 --> 00:33:33.670 align:middle line:90%
And I got to add to that--

00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:35.120 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Micro into the macro.

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:35.920 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: Exactly.

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:41.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: But if that's the
case, ET 50 years, 100 years,

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:44.180 align:middle line:84%
1,000 years, a million
years in front of us,

00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:45.890 align:middle line:84%
figured this out
a long time ago.

00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:46.690 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: Yeah.

00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:49.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Which would
demonstrate the way

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:52.750 align:middle line:84%
that they are doing it
is really easy for them.

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:57.770 align:middle line:84%
Is easy as us starting a car and
driving to work in the morning.

00:33:57.770 --> 00:34:00.980 align:middle line:84%
That's them traveling,
not only interstellar,

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:02.000 align:middle line:90%
but to this planet.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.190 align:middle line:84%
That's the only-- that's
the only way to look at it.

00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:04.990 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: Yeah.

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:06.700 align:middle line:84%
So the interesting
thing is that we

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:08.800 align:middle line:84%
are doing this now and
these laboratories that

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.790 align:middle line:84%
are conventional
mainstream science.

00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:13.159 align:middle line:84%
But as that there's
other types of programs,

00:34:13.159 --> 00:34:15.500 align:middle line:84%
there's reverse engineered
UFOs and crashes.

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:18.909 align:middle line:84%
So it seems like there is
some type of institutions

00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:21.639 align:middle line:84%
in the world that have already
mastered this technology.

00:34:21.639 --> 00:34:23.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: We are using
James Webb to look

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:27.520 align:middle line:84%
at the atmospheres of
exoplanets right now,

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:30.540 align:middle line:84%
and we're looking
for technosignatures.

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:36.190 align:middle line:84%
A technosignature for us,
1945, first nuclear blast.

00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:41.230 align:middle line:84%
If ET is looking at this planet
like we are looking at them,

00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:43.710 align:middle line:84%
they would have seen
that nuclear blast.

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:45.610 align:middle line:90%
What would that tell them?

00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:48.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GAUR: So when it comes to
seeing the nuclear blast,

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:50.469 align:middle line:84%
that's not how it really
works, in my opinion.

00:34:50.469 --> 00:34:52.440 align:middle line:84%
What's occurring with
the nuclear blast

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:54.219 align:middle line:84%
is that we're actually
splitting the atom.

00:34:54.219 --> 00:34:56.350 align:middle line:90%
So it's actually the opposite.

00:34:56.350 --> 00:34:58.350 align:middle line:84%
They're perceiving
it through the fabric

00:34:58.350 --> 00:35:01.600 align:middle line:84%
of space time being corrupted
or destroyed on some level.

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:02.800 align:middle line:90%
Just imagine it like this.

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:05.320 align:middle line:84%
Say that the universe
is one big hard drive,

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:07.750 align:middle line:84%
and say in that hard
drive in a little area,

00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:09.430 align:middle line:84%
there's one software
and a little spark,

00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:11.400 align:middle line:84%
a little flame goes
off in that software.

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And say, that's
the nuclear bomb.

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:15.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, that flame now affects
all the other softwares

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:17.470 align:middle line:84%
and the corruption
of the hard drive.

00:35:17.470 --> 00:35:19.380 align:middle line:84%
So since this is,
in some way, kind

00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:23.320 align:middle line:84%
of a holographic simulated
reality, when we split the atom,

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:25.500 align:middle line:84%
the energy goes
through the wormhole,

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:28.050 align:middle line:84%
through the singularity
into other realities,

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:31.350 align:middle line:84%
and the simulation is
stacked upon other realities.

00:35:31.350 --> 00:35:34.490 align:middle line:84%
So what's occurring is we're
actually not only affecting

00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:37.388 align:middle line:84%
ourselves, but we have no idea
what is actually happening

00:35:37.388 --> 00:35:38.930 align:middle line:84%
to this energy and
how it's affecting

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:40.290 align:middle line:90%
other dimensions around us.

00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:43.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: So ET
would have, no matter

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:45.260 align:middle line:84%
who they are or what
part of the universe,

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:50.160 align:middle line:84%
would have gone through the same
stages of evolution as we are,

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:53.540 align:middle line:90%
and they are observing that.

00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:56.277 align:middle line:84%
So they know exactly where
we are in our timeline.

00:35:56.277 --> 00:35:57.860 align:middle line:84%
>>GAUR: Well, that's
why as soon as we

00:35:57.860 --> 00:35:59.642 align:middle line:84%
had the first
nuclear explosion, we

00:35:59.642 --> 00:36:01.100 align:middle line:84%
started seeing all
the foo fighters

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:02.310 align:middle line:90%
and all the sightings happen.

00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:06.180 align:middle line:84%
Even Roswell happened in an area
where there was nuclear tests.

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And in 1945, there
was another UFO crash

00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:12.290 align:middle line:84%
in San Antonio, New
Mexico that no one really

00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:15.300 align:middle line:84%
talks about that also happened
right after nuclear test.

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Now, ET would
have to be here in order

00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:22.130 align:middle line:90%
to observe that nuclear test.

00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:25.590 align:middle line:84%
If they are 20 light years
away in observing us,

00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:28.140 align:middle line:84%
like with the James
Webb Space Telescope,

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:32.850 align:middle line:84%
then they're looking
at Earth previously.

00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:35.060 align:middle line:84%
They're not looking
at it in real time.

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:37.012 align:middle line:84%
So they would have to
be here to observe that.

00:36:37.012 --> 00:36:38.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GAUR: It all depends
on what type of ET race,

00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:41.210 align:middle line:84%
because there are some ET
races that can perceive

00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:43.580 align:middle line:90%
all creation simultaneously.

00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:45.180 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Very interesting.

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:50.390 align:middle line:84%
If we do an accidental
experiment at CERN

00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:54.350 align:middle line:84%
and we are colliding particles
and we create something

00:36:54.350 --> 00:36:57.660 align:middle line:84%
that we can't control,
whether it's a black hole,

00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:59.820 align:middle line:84%
it's a portal, it's
another dimension,

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:03.660 align:middle line:84%
and something shifts
on our timeline here,

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:06.560 align:middle line:84%
how would that be
observed off-planet?

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:09.080 align:middle line:84%
I think that is
a very real thing

00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:12.150 align:middle line:84%
to look at when we have things
like the Mandela effect,

00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:14.120 align:middle line:84%
where memories are
corrupted here,

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:16.430 align:middle line:84%
things don't seem
quite right, where

00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:19.460 align:middle line:84%
either somebody from our future
coming back and adjusting

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:23.500 align:middle line:84%
things, or maybe we fit
into another timeline

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:26.650 align:middle line:84%
and we didn't even
realize that had happened.

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:29.145 align:middle line:84%
How would that be
observed off-planet.

00:37:29.145 --> 00:37:30.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GAUR: When we do
something like that,

00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:32.530 align:middle line:84%
where we shift something on
the planet, when it comes

00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:34.460 align:middle line:84%
to the ETs and the
connection to Earth,

00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:36.790 align:middle line:84%
the main prime
directive for the ETs

00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:38.890 align:middle line:84%
is to make sure we
don't destroy ourselves.

00:37:38.890 --> 00:37:41.440 align:middle line:84%
If we go ahead and shift
into other parallel realities

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:43.793 align:middle line:84%
and moved on different
pathways, that might be OK.

00:37:43.793 --> 00:37:46.210 align:middle line:84%
But they want to make sure
that we don't destroy ourselves

00:37:46.210 --> 00:37:49.510 align:middle line:84%
and the human experiment and
the human evolution continues.

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: So if we go to another
planet and we encounter life,

00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:59.200 align:middle line:84%
it could be primitive, do
we leave that DNA alone?

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:01.473 align:middle line:84%
>>GAUR: Well, when it
comes to Earth humans,

00:38:01.473 --> 00:38:03.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure because we haven't
technically done that yet,

00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:06.020 align:middle line:84%
or maybe we have on some
black budget programs.

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:08.590 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to the
original template of humanity

00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:11.180 align:middle line:84%
coming out of Lyra, the
first human template,

00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:13.100 align:middle line:84%
the humans were the
master geneticists.

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:15.290 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what we
did all over the Galaxy.

00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:17.720 align:middle line:84%
And not only did we
hybridize ourselves,

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:20.820 align:middle line:84%
but we also hybridized ourselves
with the native population

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:22.750 align:middle line:84%
of the beings that
we're interacting with,

00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:24.382 align:middle line:84%
including the
reptilian beings that

00:38:24.382 --> 00:38:26.340 align:middle line:84%
were the most predominant
species in the Galaxy

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:27.140 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:31.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: So are we
contradicting ourselves?

00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:34.470 align:middle line:90%
Is it a paradox?

00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:37.410 align:middle line:84%
In that we don't want
to interfere necessarily

00:38:37.410 --> 00:38:40.890 align:middle line:84%
with the prime directive,
with another species,

00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:44.310 align:middle line:84%
but some are OK
with other species

00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:49.390 align:middle line:84%
coming here and modifying us
in creation and altering DNA.

00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:51.610 align:middle line:84%
It seems like we
want it both ways.

00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:55.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GAUR: Yeah, well, DNA
is the largest commodity

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:56.080 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:59.110 align:middle line:84%
Genetics and hybridization
ever since source fragmented.

00:38:59.110 --> 00:38:59.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Yep.

00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:02.035 align:middle line:84%
>>GAUR: The only way we've
had all of this creation

00:39:02.035 --> 00:39:04.350 align:middle line:84%
is because free will
was given to creation

00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:06.970 align:middle line:84%
in order to basically
hybridize and create beings.

00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:09.278 align:middle line:84%
So on some level, that's
continuing to happen now.

00:39:09.278 --> 00:39:11.820 align:middle line:84%
But the whole thing is, do you
look at it as a negative thing

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:13.300 align:middle line:90%
or is it a positive thing?

00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And now there are some malicious
hybridization programs,

00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:18.910 align:middle line:84%
but the DNA hybridization
of humanity,

00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:20.670 align:middle line:84%
we are a product
of hybridization

00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:22.480 align:middle line:90%
so many times over.

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:24.942 align:middle line:84%
There's many different et
races within our own DNA.

00:39:24.942 --> 00:39:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And I would even say that
the different ethnic groups

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:29.880 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, we have
such variety because

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:32.260 align:middle line:84%
of the influence of different
extraterrestrial races.

00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Is at
this point, is there

00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:37.870 align:middle line:84%
a way to get back
to our original DNA?

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:39.183 align:middle line:90%
Is it still in there?

00:39:39.183 --> 00:39:40.475 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: Ooh, that's a good one.

00:39:40.475 --> 00:39:46.510 align:middle line:84%
I feel that the way time works
is our ancestors created us,

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:48.970 align:middle line:84%
but they're actually
also our descendants.

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:50.940 align:middle line:84%
Because as they created
us, they created us

00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:52.600 align:middle line:90%
from a place of timelessness.

00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And then they started creating
realities until we finally

00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:56.350 align:middle line:90%
got to linearity.

00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:57.730 align:middle line:90%
And now in our linear--

00:39:57.730 --> 00:39:59.650 align:middle line:84%
in the linear time
that we are in,

00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:02.480 align:middle line:84%
we start evolving back
into timelessness.

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And when we get to that
reality of timelessness,

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:05.550 align:middle line:84%
we end up becoming
the beings that

00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:07.060 align:middle line:90%
created us in the first place.

00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: What are we
going to evolve into?

00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:17.130 align:middle line:84%
1,000 years from now, Neil, do
we have these meat sacks or do

00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:20.033 align:middle line:90%
we evolve into pure energy?

00:40:20.033 --> 00:40:22.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GAUR: In the 1,000 years
from now, I would say no,

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:24.360 align:middle line:84%
that we'd still be
in a human body,

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:27.060 align:middle line:84%
but we won't be in the same
type of body as we are now.

00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:29.007 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we won't need the
same type of things.

00:40:29.007 --> 00:40:30.590 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we won't eat
the same way, maybe

00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:31.980 align:middle line:90%
we won't interact the same way.

00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:34.940 align:middle line:84%
But the experiment
on Earth is how

00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:36.410 align:middle line:84%
we can be
multidimensional beings

00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:38.340 align:middle line:84%
and still have a
physical experience.

00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:40.820 align:middle line:84%
Earth isn't just a place to
evolve and ascend and become

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:41.310 align:middle line:90%
light.

00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:43.140 align:middle line:84%
We're attempting to
create something new here.

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:44.932 align:middle line:84%
And part of what we're
attempting to create

00:40:44.932 --> 00:40:49.190 align:middle line:84%
is, firstly, let's wipe our
memories clean, go to this Earth

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:51.510 align:middle line:84%
and try to see if we
remember who we really are.

00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:52.770 align:middle line:90%
It's an experiment.

00:40:52.770 --> 00:40:54.650 align:middle line:84%
Can we remember when
we don't remember?

00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:54.960 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Right.

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:56.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GAUR: And then when
we do remember, can we

00:40:56.930 --> 00:41:00.530 align:middle line:84%
tap into the innate gifts in our
body, multidimensional gifts,

00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:02.870 align:middle line:84%
so that we can still
live in physicality

00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:04.770 align:middle line:84%
but tap into the
highest dimensions?

00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:08.820 align:middle line:84%
So I feel we're creating that
kind of Utopian world on Earth.

00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:11.150 align:middle line:84%
And 1,000 years from now, I
would hope that we would be

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:12.230 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:19.270 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: The craft lands, being
steps off, and it's Neil Gaur.

00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:20.120 align:middle line:90%
It's your twin.

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:20.920 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: Yeah.

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:23.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: And you
come down and we--

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:25.842 align:middle line:90%
what's going on here?

00:41:25.842 --> 00:41:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And do you say, the version
of you, well, you are us.

00:41:33.310 --> 00:41:36.760 align:middle line:90%
We helped create you.

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.780 align:middle line:90%
Can this planet handle that?

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:41.290 align:middle line:84%
We are on the verge
of finding out

00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:45.470 align:middle line:90%
this very fundamental question.

00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:47.607 align:middle line:84%
Can the Earth handle
something like that?

00:41:47.607 --> 00:41:49.940 align:middle line:10%
>>GAUR: They will be able to
handle something like that.

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:53.008 align:middle line:10%
Maybe in this moment no,
but as soon as everybody

00:41:53.008 --> 00:41:54.800 align:middle line:10%
knows that we're not
alone in the universe,

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:56.300 align:middle line:10%
then the questions
start coming out.

00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And then partly,
the next thing will

00:41:58.060 --> 00:41:59.865 align:middle line:90%
be our true history on Earth.

00:41:59.865 --> 00:42:01.160 align:middle line:90%
What is the true history?

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:03.310 align:middle line:84%
We have this arrogance thinking
that we're the most advanced

00:42:03.310 --> 00:42:04.220 align:middle line:90%
that we've ever been.

00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:05.980 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot of
evidence to suggest

00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:08.530 align:middle line:84%
that there were more advanced
civilizations, some of them

00:42:08.530 --> 00:42:10.230 align:middle line:90%
completely lost to time.

00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:13.160 align:middle line:84%
We're just talking about
13,000 years ago in Atlantis,

00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:15.680 align:middle line:90%
that's just one cycle.

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:18.770 align:middle line:84%
What about five cycles before
that, or even further than that?

00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:21.470 align:middle line:84%
How many different renditions
have we had of that in humanity?

00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:24.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a lot of evidence
to suggest the actual truth

00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:27.020 align:middle line:84%
that we have had greater
civilizations on Earth.

00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:30.320 align:middle line:84%
So after everybody knows we're
not alone in the universe,

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.990 align:middle line:84%
the next step will be to inform
people about true history.

00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And I feel it will be an
exponential thing at that point,

00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:37.930 align:middle line:84%
when the institutions,
our educational system

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:41.020 align:middle line:84%
starts teaching us the truth
about who we really are.

00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:43.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: An amazing
conversation.

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:44.620 align:middle line:84%
Neil, I want to thank you
for being on the show, but--

00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:45.200 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: Thank you, brother.

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:46.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: I'm very
excited about learning

00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:50.480 align:middle line:84%
how to channel poetry from
you in the very near future.

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:51.280 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: Yeah.

00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:52.697 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Thank
you so much, Neil.

00:42:52.697 --> 00:42:54.864 align:middle line:84%
Where can everybody get
information about your work?

00:42:54.864 --> 00:42:55.664 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: Sure.

00:42:55.664 --> 00:42:57.692 align:middle line:10%
You can find me at
portaltoascension.org.

00:42:57.692 --> 00:43:00.050 align:middle line:10%
And I have a YouTube channel
too, Portal to Ascension.

00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:01.640 align:middle line:10%
And everything's
there on my website.

00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:03.133 align:middle line:90%
We do around 70 events a year.

00:43:03.133 --> 00:43:04.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Thank
you so much, Neil.

00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:05.633 align:middle line:90%
>>GAUR: Thank you brother.

00:43:05.633 --> 00:43:09.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: I'm Jimmy Church,
sitting in for George Noory.
