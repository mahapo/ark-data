00:00:05.604 --> 00:00:08.080 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And I
think many people today don't

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.810 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.658 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.658 --> 00:00:13.240 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>It felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.550 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.249 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:27.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:28.052 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:28.052 --> 00:00:29.760 align:middle line:10%
And of course, you're
noticing that we're

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.160 align:middle line:10%
in a different environment.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.460 align:middle line:10%
We're in the Los Angeles
studios of Gaiam Television,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.210 align:middle line:10%
not back in the Denver area.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.460 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.500 align:middle line:84%
My guest tonight is
LA Marzulli, and he

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.100 align:middle line:84%
comes to us from all
over the universe

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.400 align:middle line:84%
to talk about his
"Watchers" series

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.210 align:middle line:84%
and "On the Trail
of the Nephilim."

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.210 align:middle line:90%
LA, welcome.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LA MARZULLI:
Thank you, George.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.025 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:00:50.025 --> 00:00:50.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Good to
have you with us.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: It's
nice to be here.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're on "Coast
to Coast" so often.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.135 align:middle line:84%
On the phone, we really don't
have a chance to interact.

00:00:56.135 --> 00:00:57.385 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: This is wonderful.

00:00:57.385 --> 00:00:58.340 align:middle line:90%
This is fantastic.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But it was fun
seeing you last year

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.959 align:middle line:84%
at the UFO Congress where
we gave you and Richard Shaw

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:06.622 align:middle line:84%
an award for your
work on the Nephilim

00:01:06.622 --> 00:01:06.930 align:middle line:90%
and the "Watchers" series.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.221 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: That was fantastic.

00:01:08.221 --> 00:01:10.390 align:middle line:84%
We won People's Choice and
the Best Film that year.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.114 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Yeah.

00:01:11.114 --> 00:01:11.405 align:middle line:90%
That was great.

00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:11.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:12.960 align:middle line:90%
What drives you by the way?

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.560 align:middle line:90%
What pushes you into this field?

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.470 align:middle line:84%
Which, of course,
we'll get into.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.820 align:middle line:90%
It's very strange.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: It is.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.500 align:middle line:10%
Basically what's
motivating me is the idea

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.850 align:middle line:10%
that supernatural events
happened thousands of years

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:26.620 align:middle line:10%
ago.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.340 align:middle line:10%
And we read about
these, of course,

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.570 align:middle line:10%
in the Judeo Christian Bible.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.920 align:middle line:10%
And are they real?

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.194 align:middle line:10%
Is it fantasy?

00:01:33.194 --> 00:01:34.860 align:middle line:84%
The people that were
writing this stuff,

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.026 align:middle line:90%
were they just making it up?

00:01:36.026 --> 00:01:37.755 align:middle line:84%
Were they high on
mushrooms or something?

00:01:37.755 --> 00:01:38.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Or is there
evidence that actually

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.497 align:middle line:90%
proves the biblical narrative?

00:01:42.497 --> 00:01:43.830 align:middle line:90%
And that's why I'm on the trail.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:44.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, good for you.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Yeah.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's
talk, first of all,

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.020 align:middle line:84%
about "On the Trail
of the Nephilim."

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.077 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Sure.

00:01:50.077 --> 00:01:52.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we'll get
into your "Watchers" series

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.760 align:middle line:84%
in our other
portion of the show.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.122 align:middle line:90%
But who are the Nephilim?

00:01:57.122 --> 00:01:58.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: That's a
hot button question.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
of controversy.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.000 align:middle line:84%
But I hold the view
that the Nephilim

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.320 align:middle line:84%
are the progeny of the
fallen angelic hosts

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.850 align:middle line:90%
and the women of earth.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.434 align:middle line:84%
And this was never
supposed to happen.

00:02:10.434 --> 00:02:11.391 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The offspring.

00:02:11.391 --> 00:02:12.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: The offspring.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.240 align:middle line:84%
And what we get is
this hybrid being--

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.960 align:middle line:84%
because it is a hybrid
being-- known as the Nephilim.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.760 align:middle line:90%
They were incredibly powerful.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.690 align:middle line:90%
They were robust.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.370 align:middle line:90%
They were very large.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.930 align:middle line:84%
There were genetic
characteristics which we really

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.560 align:middle line:90%
don't know anything about.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.050 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly enough,
the events of that time,

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.560 align:middle line:84%
which happened
thousands of years ago,

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.100 align:middle line:84%
tell us that the Nephilim were
on the earth in those days

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.010 align:middle line:84%
and also afterward when the
sons of God or the fallen angels

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.410 align:middle line:84%
saw the women of earth,
had sex with them.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And the offspring
is the Nephilim.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And this is what's so
interesting because when

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.620 align:middle line:84%
Joshua and Caleb go into what's
known as the Promised Land,

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.550 align:middle line:84%
or the Levant, about 3,500
years ago, guess who's there?

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.480 align:middle line:84%
All these different
Nephilim tribes.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And these tribes
have different names.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.580 align:middle line:84%
The Longnecks, the Zamzummins,
the Rephaims, the Nephilim,

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.250 align:middle line:90%
the Emins.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And each one of
these names denotes

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.850 align:middle line:84%
a different genetic
characteristic of these tribes.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:12.820 align:middle line:90%
Some had six fingers.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:13.705 align:middle line:90%
Some are very large.

00:03:13.705 --> 00:03:14.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Giant types?

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Giant types,
like Goliath, for instance,

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.090 align:middle line:90%
probably 12 feet tall.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.550 align:middle line:10%
The Jewish historian Josephus
from the first century

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.405 align:middle line:10%
writes about the Nephilim.

00:03:24.405 --> 00:03:27.260 align:middle line:10%
He talks about that the
bones of the Nephilim

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.970 align:middle line:10%
were openly on display
in the first century.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.300 align:middle line:84%
So we know that
this stuff existed.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And my whole hypothesis
is, wow, Joshua and Caleb

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.980 align:middle line:84%
are coming in with
the Israeli army,

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.930 align:middle line:84%
essentially, wiping
these guys out

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.540 align:middle line:90%
because they're hybrid beings.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.140 align:middle line:90%
And there's a diaspora.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.060 align:middle line:90%
Some flee northward.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.150 align:middle line:84%
Some build papyrus
boats and go out

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.650 align:middle line:84%
the Mediterranean, which we
know Thor Heyerdahl proved that

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.000 align:middle line:84%
with Kon-Tiki and Ra--
two amazing books.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.400 align:middle line:90%
And they settle in the Americas.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.150 align:middle line:84%
If the hypothesis is true,
then are there vestiges?

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.110 align:middle line:90%
Are there remains?

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.650 align:middle line:90%
Are there artifacts?

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we think
that there are artifacts.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.505 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I thought they were
wiped out, LA, in the flood.

00:04:11.505 --> 00:04:14.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Well, that's
another controversial point.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.110 align:middle line:84%
Some people believe that all
the Nephilim were wiped out.

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:18.510 align:middle line:90%
But the text is very clear.

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.310 align:middle line:84%
When the text is written, it's
written actually thousands

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.640 align:middle line:90%
of years after the flood.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.010 align:middle line:84%
Moses is getting all this on
Mount Sinai, which is thousands

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.410 align:middle line:90%
of years after the flood.

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.160 align:middle line:84%
So why wouldn't he
have just written

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.585 align:middle line:84%
or been dictated to, let's
say, the Nephilim were

00:04:31.585 --> 00:04:32.710 align:middle line:90%
on the earth in those days.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:33.507 align:middle line:90%
Period.

00:04:33.507 --> 00:04:35.840 align:middle line:84%
Because we're talking about
something thousands of years

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:36.020 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.269 align:middle line:90%
But that's not what he writes.

00:04:37.269 --> 00:04:40.430 align:middle line:84%
He writes, the Nephilim were
on the earth in those days

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.170 align:middle line:90%
and also afterward.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And so what my conjecture
is, is also afterward

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.570 align:middle line:90%
means exactly what it says.

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.130 align:middle line:90%
And also afterwards.

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And of course, this ties--
which is fascinating to me--

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.590 align:middle line:84%
this ties into the
whole modern day UFO

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.010 align:middle line:90%
phenomenon in my opinion.

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.055 align:middle line:90%
There is a link.

00:04:55.055 --> 00:04:55.971 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Explain that.

00:04:55.971 --> 00:04:56.824 align:middle line:90%
Explain that link.

00:04:56.824 --> 00:04:58.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Well, the
link is incredible

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.020 align:middle line:84%
because what we're
told, 2,000 years ago,

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.370 align:middle line:84%
Yeshua-- Jesus-- warns us
in this prophetic utterance.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.340 align:middle line:84%
He says something
which is incredibly

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.680 align:middle line:90%
strange and enigmatic.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.804 align:middle line:84%
He says, it'll be like the
days of Noah when I return.

00:05:12.804 --> 00:05:13.470 align:middle line:90%
It's like, what?

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:14.969 align:middle line:84%
And remember, when
he's saying this,

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:17.340 align:middle line:84%
there is no church
that we have today.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.570 align:middle line:90%
There's no televangelist.

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:19.070 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.040 align:middle line:84%
It's just this one god-man
running around doing

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.900 align:middle line:90%
all this amazing stuff.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.390 align:middle line:90%
But there's no PR campaign.

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:27.290 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And he makes this
absurd statement.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.700 align:middle line:84%
When I return, it'll be
like the days of Noah.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.520 align:middle line:90%
So that's a huge clue.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.510 align:middle line:84%
It points us back to what
differentiates the days of Noah

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.250 align:middle line:84%
from any other
time on the planet?

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.090 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.580 align:middle line:84%
When we read the
days of Noah, it's

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.240 align:middle line:84%
not talking about human
beings inter-marrying.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.850 align:middle line:84%
It's talking about fallen
angels marrying the women,

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.110 align:middle line:90%
creating this hybrid--

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or breeding with them.

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.571 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Breeding with them,
creating the hybrid Nephilim.

00:05:53.571 --> 00:05:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And when you fast
forward to modernity,

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.760 align:middle line:84%
this is exactly what we see with
the abduction phenomena where

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.900 align:middle line:84%
sperm is taken, eggs are
taken, and a hybrid being

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.560 align:middle line:90%
is being formed.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.500 align:middle line:90%
There's a connection.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.857 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where are the bones,
LA, of these supposed giants?

00:06:10.857 --> 00:06:12.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Well, we
hear this over and over

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:13.860 align:middle line:90%
and over again, George.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.200 align:middle line:84%
We hear that-- and this
happens, let's say--

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want
to see the bones.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.906 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: I do, too.

00:06:17.906 --> 00:06:21.460 align:middle line:90%
Well, is this a Nephilim?

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.520 align:middle line:90%
To my left, your right.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.019 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It could
be an alien grave.

00:06:24.019 --> 00:06:26.060 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Yeah.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's interesting that
people talk about the bones.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.180 align:middle line:10%
And we have in the historical
record from all over the United

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.090 align:middle line:10%
States where, at the latter
part of the 19th century

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.190 align:middle line:10%
into the 20th century, people
were digging into these mounds.

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:41.850 align:middle line:84%
People were looking
at these mounds,

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.661 align:middle line:90%
let's say, in Ohio Valley.

00:06:43.661 --> 00:06:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And they were going, what
the heck is in these mounds?

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And they would go in and
do these very primitive

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.950 align:middle line:90%
archaeological digs.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, they
would find 9, 10, 12 footers.

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.970 align:middle line:10%
Some of them dressed
in copper armor.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.210 align:middle line:10%
Some of them with six
fingers, elongated skulls.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.860 align:middle line:84%
We've actually got pictures of
skeletons that were actually

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.170 align:middle line:90%
found out on Catalina.

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The skull would have
to be about that big, right?

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:05.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Really, really big.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.841 align:middle line:90%
And they talk about this.

00:07:06.841 --> 00:07:08.820 align:middle line:90%
Men of letters write about it.

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:13.370 align:middle line:84%
Doctors, lawyers talk
about seeing femur bones

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:14.670 align:middle line:90%
over 30 inches in length.

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:15.930 align:middle line:90%
That's a big guy.

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:19.470 align:middle line:84%
And in case after
case, what happens

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.540 align:middle line:84%
is the Smithsonian
Institute shows up.

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:23.790 align:middle line:90%
We'll take the bones from you.

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:24.320 align:middle line:90%
And they do.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:24.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they take them.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:25.567 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: And they take them.

00:07:25.567 --> 00:07:26.939 align:middle line:90%
And they're never seen again.

00:07:26.939 --> 00:07:28.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why do they hide them?

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:29.530 align:middle line:90%
What's the big controversy?

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:31.988 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Because it goes
against the Darwinian paradigm,

00:07:31.988 --> 00:07:33.880 align:middle line:84%
which is sacrosanct
in both academia

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.377 align:middle line:90%
and the scientific community.

00:07:35.377 --> 00:07:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And pretty much everybody
at the Smithsonian

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:39.030 align:middle line:90%
are ardent Darwinists.

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:40.470 align:middle line:90%
There is no supernatural.

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:42.620 align:middle line:90%
Everything just happened here.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:46.450 align:middle line:84%
And yet, that's the paradigm
that they guard and do

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:49.670 align:middle line:84%
so religiously to
guard that paradigm.

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And anything, any artifact-- and
this sounds like a conspiracy,

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.730 align:middle line:84%
but just a modicum of
research shows that we're not

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:56.870 align:middle line:90%
being told the truth.

00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:00.019 align:middle line:84%
For instance, on Catalina
Island, I was out there, and--

00:08:00.019 --> 00:08:01.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Off the
coast of California.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Right
outside of Los Angeles.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.490 align:middle line:84%
There was a primitive
archaeologist

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:07.970 align:middle line:90%
by the name of Ralph Glidden.

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:11.150 align:middle line:84%
1919-- he's employed
by the Heye museum.

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.940 align:middle line:84%
The Heye was later gobbled
up by the Smithsonian.

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.362 align:middle line:84%
So he's employed by
the Heye, go out,

00:08:16.362 --> 00:08:17.820 align:middle line:84%
and see what you
can see out there.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.000 align:middle line:90%
So he's doing these digs.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.175 align:middle line:90%
And I've read his journals.

00:08:20.175 --> 00:08:22.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've held
them in my hand.

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And they're very
like-- one line.

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:29.020 align:middle line:84%
Saw-- uncovered 20 Native
Americans with wampum and beads

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:30.210 align:middle line:90%
and arrowheads.

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And every now and
then, he discovers

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.414 align:middle line:90%
something which is enigmatic.

00:08:34.414 --> 00:08:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And I've got photographic
proof of that.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.669 align:middle line:84%
And it's in "On the Trail
of the Nephilim: Volume 2."

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:43.929 align:middle line:84%
The photograph that we saw came
from 1919 off Catalina Island.

00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:47.750 align:middle line:84%
It shows Ralph Glidden standing
in a recently excavated grave.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And in front of him is a
very large skeleton in situ.

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:55.800 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it's been
uncovered exactly the same way

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.250 align:middle line:90%
it was placed in repose.

00:08:58.250 --> 00:08:58.940 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:08:59.830 align:middle line:90%
It's uncovered.

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:02.340 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at this, and
I'm just going, oh my gosh.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:03.340 align:middle line:90%
And the curator's there.

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's like 9 o'clock
at night or whatever.

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:06.330 align:middle line:90%
There's nobody in the museum.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:07.790 align:middle line:84%
It's just the two
of us in this room.

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:09.831 align:middle line:84%
He looks at it, and he
goes, wow, that's amazing.

00:09:09.831 --> 00:09:11.905 align:middle line:84%
So we took the
photograph and we had

00:09:11.905 --> 00:09:15.062 align:middle line:84%
it analyzed by four different
people, three of them

00:09:15.062 --> 00:09:16.020 align:middle line:90%
completed the analysis.

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:19.260 align:middle line:84%
All three of them put that
skeleton based on Ralph

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.200 align:middle line:90%
Glidden's height of 5'8".

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.940 align:middle line:84%
That skeleton came
in at over nine feet.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.370 align:middle line:84%
In the book, we rounded it
down to eight and 1/2 feet

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:29.160 align:middle line:84%
so we were not being
accused of just

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.550 align:middle line:90%
being sensationalist, right.

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:31.614 align:middle line:90%
But there it is.

00:09:31.614 --> 00:09:32.280 align:middle line:90%
The smoking gun.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If somebody
tried to falsify that,

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:40.050 align:middle line:84%
could they have made those
kinds of bones in that era?

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:40.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Sure.

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're being--
the naysayers are going,

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:45.530 align:middle line:84%
well, Ralph Glidden
was doing this.

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:48.030 align:middle line:84%
If Ralph Glidden went
through all-- I mean,

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:49.620 align:middle line:84%
it's a straw man
argument, and it sort

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.290 align:middle line:90%
of collapses of its own weight.

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:53.790 align:middle line:84%
Because if Glidden was
really trying to do that--

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:55.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's an expensive hoax.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:56.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: --then why didn't
he do something with it?

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:57.830 align:middle line:90%
He never did anything with it.

00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:58.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:59.180 align:middle line:84%
What do you get out of it
if you're gonna do that?

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:00.721 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: He got
nothing out of it.

00:10:00.721 --> 00:10:04.150 align:middle line:84%
That photograph has
just been in some trunk

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:06.280 align:middle line:90%
for the last 50, 60 years.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:09.684 align:middle line:84%
And no one discovered that
until-- because people go in

00:10:09.684 --> 00:10:11.850 align:middle line:84%
and they look at this stuff,
and they're not looking

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:13.610 align:middle line:90%
for the same ones that I look.

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:14.770 align:middle line:90%
And I'm looking for giants.

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:16.395 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking for
evidence of the giants.

00:10:16.395 --> 00:10:17.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking for six fingers.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.780 align:middle line:90%
And we found another skeleton.

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:21.980 align:middle line:84%
Lo and behold, this
one also turned out

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.680 align:middle line:84%
to be about nine feet
with the sixth digit.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And this ties back into the
Native American oral tradition

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:31.310 align:middle line:84%
of red-haired
cannibalistic giants that

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:32.660 align:middle line:90%
were in the Americas.

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And we've got some
photographic proof.

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:38.260 align:middle line:84%
We believe we will find
the evidence at some point.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:42.589 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they traveled
from the Middle East and Egypt,

00:10:42.589 --> 00:10:43.130 align:middle line:90%
in that area.

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:44.546 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: That's
our hypothesis.

00:10:44.546 --> 00:10:45.700 align:middle line:90%
That's what we believe.

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:47.090 align:middle line:90%
And here's why.

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:49.630 align:middle line:84%
When you go to Ohio and
the Great Circle Mound,

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:51.650 align:middle line:90%
this was a huge complex.

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:53.236 align:middle line:84%
And there was also
an octagon which

00:10:53.236 --> 00:10:55.110 align:middle line:84%
you could put-- the base
of the Great Pyramid

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:58.200 align:middle line:84%
would fit inside
the octagon, which

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.260 align:middle line:90%
is just a huge-- and edifice.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.130 align:middle line:84%
And it begs the question, who
were the people that did it?

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And why get up on a Monday
morning and do this?

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And we're looking at
building techniques.

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.156 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at
astronomical alignments.

00:11:11.156 --> 00:11:12.030 align:middle line:90%
Who taught them this?

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:14.050 align:middle line:84%
Native Americans didn't
deal with this stuff.

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:17.940 align:middle line:84%
We've also found human sacrifice
was done at these sites.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And that always ties
back to the Middle East.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.860 align:middle line:84%
So this is why it's
so fascinating,

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:26.040 align:middle line:84%
because the history that we've
been told is a lot of hooey.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So these
bones, you believe,

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:32.580 align:middle line:84%
are closeted somewhere
at the Smithsonian.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.870 align:middle line:90%
You're guessing.

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:37.052 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: I would love
to be able to get in there.

00:11:37.052 --> 00:11:39.260 align:middle line:84%
It would be fascinating to
see what they really have.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:40.968 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many do
you think they have?

00:11:40.968 --> 00:11:42.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Well, you
know, I was at one

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:46.620 align:middle line:90%
of the museums in Chicago.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And you see artifacts
that they will display.

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:53.565 align:middle line:84%
And it's very telling-- and
it's in-- it's "On the Trail 1,"

00:11:53.565 --> 00:11:55.460 align:middle line:90%
a huge spear point.

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And underneath that, they don't
tell you where it was found.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.990 align:middle line:84%
They just say, this is more than
likely it's a Hopewell point.

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:04.852 align:middle line:84%
So Hopewell is where
this ancient civilization

00:12:04.852 --> 00:12:06.810 align:middle line:84%
that-- really no one
knows where they came from

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:09.210 align:middle line:84%
or what they even
called themselves.

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And so this spearhead's
about this large.

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And underneath, it says, this
is a ceremonial spearhead.

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:16.280 align:middle line:90%
Well, how do you know that?

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:17.620 align:middle line:90%
They don't know that.

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:18.670 align:middle line:90%
They're guessing.

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And my whole point
in the book is,

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.170 align:middle line:90%
what if it's not ceremonial?

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:24.940 align:middle line:90%
What if it's utilitarian?

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:27.310 align:middle line:84%
Now we're looking at a
really big guy throwing

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:29.380 align:middle line:90%
a very heavy spearhead.

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:31.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how many
might there have been?

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:33.536 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Well, we think
there were a lot of them.

00:12:33.536 --> 00:12:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And "On the Trail 2," we
discovered a lance almost three

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.980 align:middle line:90%
feet long made out of bronze.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:41.960 align:middle line:90%
And it was hammered.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.650 align:middle line:84%
And when we saw this artifact--
the owner of the artifact

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:47.170 align:middle line:84%
brought it in and
wanted us to examine it.

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And I'm there with
Chief Joseph Riverwind,

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.870 align:middle line:84%
who's a Native American War
Chief-- the Taino tribe.

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:55.560 align:middle line:84%
And we're all going, man, this
would be a really hard sword

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.040 align:middle line:90%
to wield, right?

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.770 align:middle line:90%
And Chief Joseph goes, no.

00:12:58.770 --> 00:12:59.270 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:00.200 align:middle line:90%
And he's all excited.

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.770 align:middle line:84%
We're going, what do you
mean no, it's not a sword?

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:03.070 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, it's not a sword.

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:03.970 align:middle line:90%
It's a lance.

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:05.220 align:middle line:90%
And we go, a lance?

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:06.430 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, yes.

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:08.620 align:middle line:84%
Our oral tradition
and the oral tradition

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.890 align:middle line:84%
of many Native
American tribes talk

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:13.810 align:middle line:84%
about these red-haired
giants which

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:16.690 align:middle line:84%
would come in with
these huge lances

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:19.336 align:middle line:84%
and skewer three of
our braves together.

00:13:19.336 --> 00:13:20.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At one time.

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:20.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: At one time.

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:21.350 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:21.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:23.461 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: When we
all stood side by side,

00:13:23.461 --> 00:13:25.670 align:middle line:84%
that lance would pass easily
through the three of us.

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:26.627 align:middle line:90%
So we've had it tested.

00:13:26.627 --> 00:13:27.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And then some.

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:28.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: And then some.

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:31.460 align:middle line:90%
We've had that artifact tested.

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:34.110 align:middle line:10%
The copper is incredibly pure.

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:37.770 align:middle line:10%
And this is weird because
we met with the scientist.

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And this person was very eager
and excited about the artifact.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.750 align:middle line:84%
So two months
later, we came back.

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I met
her for the first time.

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And they had a PR person
with the scientist monitoring

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:53.610 align:middle line:90%
everything that she said.

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:55.310 align:middle line:90%
She had been coached.

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
the information

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:00.780 align:middle line:84%
that we thought we were
going to get-- everything

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:02.640 align:middle line:90%
was played down.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.250 align:middle line:84%
And the PR person
interrupted several times.

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:07.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was like, what's
going on here type of thing.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
happened to them, LA?

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:11.210 align:middle line:84%
If they escaped
the flood of Noah

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:15.200 align:middle line:84%
and they were able to
travel to the Americas,

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.250 align:middle line:90%
what happened to them?

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:17.710 align:middle line:90%
Where did they all go?

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:19.110 align:middle line:90%
Did they just all die off?

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:20.794 align:middle line:90%
Didn't they continue breeding?

00:14:20.794 --> 00:14:21.710 align:middle line:90%
What happened to them?

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: This is
what's really interesting.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And were the women 10
feet tall, too, the offspring?

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.430 align:middle line:90%
Or were they just all men?

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:31.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: This is where
it gets problematic.

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:34.850 align:middle line:84%
A geneticist who has
examined some material

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:38.060 align:middle line:84%
that the late Lloyd Pye
took out from Paracas

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:41.430 align:middle line:84%
stated that the mitochondrial
DNA didn't match anything

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:42.120 align:middle line:90%
in the genome.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.220 align:middle line:84%
Not Neanderthals,
not Homo sapien,

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:45.810 align:middle line:90%
not Denisovan-- nothing.

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:47.650 align:middle line:90%
He's all excited about this.

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:50.810 align:middle line:84%
He also stated that,
perhaps because of this,

00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:52.550 align:middle line:90%
they were not viable.

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:55.380 align:middle line:84%
In other words, maybe
they couldn't reproduce.

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing, what we
see with the Paracas people

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:01.830 align:middle line:84%
down in Paracas Peru, which
is right on the coast.

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:03.640 align:middle line:84%
They show up right
in the timeline

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.480 align:middle line:90%
around 3,500 years ago.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:06.520 align:middle line:90%
What a coincidence.

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:09.682 align:middle line:84%
That's when the conquest
of the Levant is happening.

00:15:09.682 --> 00:15:11.890 align:middle line:84%
And the Nephilim tribes,
according to our hypotheses,

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:13.290 align:middle line:90%
are fleeing the area.

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And they're there for
about 1,500 years,

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:18.210 align:middle line:84%
and then all of a sudden
they just disappear.

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And no one knows
where they went.

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:21.610 align:middle line:84%
Were they killed
off by the Inca?

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:24.440 align:middle line:90%
Were they not viable?

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:28.660 align:middle line:84%
The skull behind you, that
was an 18-month baby, which

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:29.990 align:middle line:90%
we were able to unwrap.

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:34.690 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting is,
in 1842, two archaeologists

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:35.640 align:middle line:90%
were down in Peru.

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:38.045 align:middle line:84%
And this battle
was raging between,

00:15:38.045 --> 00:15:39.920 align:middle line:84%
oh, all these skulls
are cradle head-boarded,

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.140 align:middle line:84%
where they bind the skulls
and they create the shape.

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.098 align:middle line:84%
These guys are going,
well, maybe some of them.

00:15:44.098 --> 00:15:45.440 align:middle line:90%
But why are they doing this?

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And they found a pregnant
woman who had been mummified.

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:50.597 align:middle line:84%
And she was about
seven months pregnant.

00:15:50.597 --> 00:15:52.013 align:middle line:84%
So they're really
curious to see--

00:15:52.013 --> 00:15:53.117 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was she a giant?

00:15:53.117 --> 00:15:54.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: She was not a giant.

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:57.250 align:middle line:84%
But when they opened her
up to view the baby--

00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:59.270 align:middle line:84%
and there's actually
a lithograph of it--

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:00.960 align:middle line:90%
the skull was elongated.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.811 align:middle line:84%
And you can't elongate the
skull of a child in its mother's

00:16:04.811 --> 00:16:05.310 align:middle line:90%
womb.

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:06.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Until afterward.

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:08.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: It's
not going to fly.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.730 align:middle line:90%
So something's going on here.

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And it bolsters my hypothesis
that there's an outside agency

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:17.820 align:middle line:90%
manipulating the genome.

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that goes back
to the biblical narrative,

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:21.590 align:middle line:90%
which was your first question.

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:22.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we're
doing what we're doing.

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:23.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.590 align:middle line:84%
If they could not reproduce
and then they slowly died off

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:35.670 align:middle line:84%
in time, why didn't the-- gosh,
you know, we say fallen angels,

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:39.620 align:middle line:84%
are we talking biblical,
or are we talking ET's?

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:40.610 align:middle line:90%
That's another thing.

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:41.985 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: That's
another thing.

00:16:41.985 --> 00:16:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's so funny
because Chase Kloetske

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:45.580 align:middle line:84%
and I have sat down
and talked about this.

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And she was the one
who alerted me to this.

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:50.390 align:middle line:90%
And she made the switch.

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:52.920 align:middle line:84%
And she basically said,
oh, I got to the point

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:55.070 align:middle line:84%
where I just substituted--
instead of ET,

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:56.859 align:middle line:84%
I began to substitute
fallen angel.

00:16:56.859 --> 00:16:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
the phenomena parallel.

00:16:58.650 --> 00:16:59.325 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's one in the same.

00:16:59.325 --> 00:17:00.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: It's
one in the same.

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:00.661 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yup.

00:17:00.661 --> 00:17:02.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: In a classic
sense, the fallen angels

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:06.210 align:middle line:84%
are certainly extraterrestrial
because this is not their home.

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:07.695 align:middle line:90%
So that--

00:17:07.695 --> 00:17:09.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've always
suspected that.

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:09.960 align:middle line:90%
Always.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:10.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Well, that's
what we're looking at,

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:11.393 align:middle line:90%
in my opinion.

00:17:11.393 --> 00:17:12.940 align:middle line:84%
That's what I think
we're looking at.

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:13.898 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's dramatic.

00:17:13.898 --> 00:17:17.420 align:middle line:84%
So "On the Trail of the
Nephilim," how close are you?

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:20.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: I think we're
going to get DNA samples out

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:21.630 align:middle line:90%
of Peru legally.

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:22.921 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're trying to do.

00:17:22.921 --> 00:17:24.720 align:middle line:84%
We're working with a
team of archaeologists

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:25.720 align:middle line:90%
and anthropologists.

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.849 align:middle line:84%
Of course, Brien
Foerster is key to that.

00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And we hope to get them
out sometime this year.

We've got two labs which will
be doing the testing on them.

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:36.100 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a blind study,
but we've got two labs.

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:37.487 align:middle line:90%
And we'll be able to see.

00:17:37.487 --> 00:17:39.820 align:middle line:84%
Once we get the results, we
will hold a press conference

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:42.104 align:middle line:84%
and invite the powers that
be to look at our findings.

00:17:42.104 --> 00:17:44.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you'll announce
it on "Coast to Coast."

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:44.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Absolutely.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And "Beyond
Belief," of course.

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:46.268 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Absolutely.

00:17:46.268 --> 00:17:47.390 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:50.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the Peruvian
government say about all this?

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:52.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: They
hold the party line.

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:57.360 align:middle line:84%
They believe that the
Paracas people migrated,

00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.290 align:middle line:90%
but they're not sure from where.

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:01.970 align:middle line:84%
The party line is that they
came down from the highlands,

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:05.670 align:middle line:84%
but they don't, because
their tapestries are

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:06.690 align:middle line:90%
completely unique.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:08.340 align:middle line:84%
Their pottery is
completely unique.

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:11.620 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing that--
it doesn't hold water.

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's why one of the
archaeologists that we've

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:16.930 align:middle line:84%
been talking to,
who's Peruvian, is

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:22.510 align:middle line:84%
really intrigued by where the
Paracas people originated from.

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's why he joined
the team, our effort,

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:26.090 align:middle line:90%
to try to find out.

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And really we've looked at--
for this little guy here,

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:32.460 align:middle line:90%
he had red hair.

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And we've analyzed that hair
with raman spectroscopy.

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:40.750 align:middle line:84%
Steven Colburn, Dr.
Roger Leir, we did that.

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:43.659 align:middle line:84%
And we compared it
to a whitish hair

00:18:43.659 --> 00:18:45.950 align:middle line:84%
that came from someone who
had been abducted and forced

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:47.410 align:middle line:90%
to have sex with a hybrid being.

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:50.120 align:middle line:84%
Now that's wacky to
talk about that stuff.

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:53.820 align:middle line:84%
But what they found
was-- and Steven did--

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:55.560 align:middle line:84%
and it's all in
"On the Trail 2."

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:56.920 align:middle line:90%
He did four hairs.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.130 align:middle line:90%
He tested four hairs.

00:18:58.130 --> 00:18:59.480 align:middle line:90%
The first one was a human hair.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.394 align:middle line:84%
The second one was
a dyed human hair.

00:19:01.394 --> 00:19:02.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Third was
Bigfoot, right?

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:05.432 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Well, the third was
the red hair from this skull

00:19:05.432 --> 00:19:05.490 align:middle line:90%
here--

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:06.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to talk to
you about that in a second.

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:07.155 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: OK.

00:19:07.155 --> 00:19:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And the fourth hair
was the blond hair

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.980 align:middle line:84%
from a so-called
alien hybrid being.

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And the human hair goes
like this on the graph.

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.890 align:middle line:90%
It just kind of goes like that.

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:18.320 align:middle line:84%
The dyed human hair
comes in on the graph

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.817 align:middle line:84%
and the slope just
goes straight up.

00:19:20.817 --> 00:19:22.400 align:middle line:84%
But this is where
it gets interesting.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.400 align:middle line:84%
The red hair from Paracas
and the white hair

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:29.740 align:middle line:84%
from the hybrid, their slopes
track like this-- every little

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:32.060 align:middle line:90%
jot and tittle all the way up.

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And when we saw that, we
were just beside ourselves

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:38.350 align:middle line:84%
because it seems to
show a relationship

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:41.900 align:middle line:84%
between genetic manipulation
that happened thousands

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:44.770 align:middle line:84%
of years ago in Paracas
to what's happening today

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:47.260 align:middle line:84%

abduction phenomenon.

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:48.700 align:middle line:90%

would be doing this.

00:20:26.694 --> 00:20:28.360 align:middle line:84%
The only reason they
would be doing that

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.280 align:middle line:90%
would be for a royal personage.

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:33.940 align:middle line:84%
The finer the fabric,
the higher the rank,

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:38.100 align:middle line:84%
just like the finer the

little skull, which

00:21:43.336 --> 00:21:45.210 align:middle line:84%
we call the baby skull--
because it is-- it's

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:47.760 align:middle line:90%
about an 18-month-old child.

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.940 align:middle line:84%
It was originally in
Senor Juan's museum.

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And it came from a place
known as Chongos Necropolis.

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And Chongos is one of the
bleakest places I've ever been.

00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:58.190 align:middle line:90%
It looks like the Sahara Desert.

00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:02.930 align:middle line:84%
It's just nothing but dunes and
sand as far as the eye can see.

And yet, right next
to it is a green belt

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.450 align:middle line:84%
because there's an underground
river that flows there.

And as you walk
through Chongos, it's

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:14.234 align:middle line:84%
been raided for the

00:22:14.234 --> 00:22:15.900 align:middle line:84%

conquistadors came in.

we went to the place

where three skulls were
taken from a grave.

at the brain capacity,

00:22:54.195 --> 00:22:57.327 align:middle line:84%
it had about 30%

00:22:57.327 --> 00:22:58.910 align:middle line:84%

sagittal suture here.

It's missing a sagittal suture.

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:08.060 align:middle line:84%

one parietal plate.

A normal human skull should
have a sagittal suture there.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And we see this on
many of the skulls.

00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:15.290 align:middle line:84%
But the baby skull was
found in this grave.

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And what we did is we
asked Senor Juan, who's

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:20.830 align:middle line:84%
the curator of the museum,
can we unwrap the skull?

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:21.940 align:middle line:90%
And Senor Juan said yes.

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:24.220 align:middle line:84%
So the second time
we came down there,

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:25.346 align:middle line:90%
we came down with a crew.

00:23:25.346 --> 00:23:26.720 align:middle line:84%
We had an
archaeologist with us--

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.850 align:middle line:84%
Joe Taylor from the
Mount Blanco Museum.

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:30.794 align:middle line:90%
We did the unwrapping.

00:23:30.794 --> 00:23:32.210 align:middle line:84%
Richard Shaw was
there, of course.

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:33.760 align:middle line:84%
We're filming
everything on tape.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.440 align:middle line:84%
What we found was
just astounding.

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And it took Joe about
four or five hours

00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:40.390 align:middle line:90%
to unwrap it very carefully.

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:43.710 align:middle line:84%
The textiles that were
shown-- and we carbon

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:44.740 align:middle line:90%
dated it, by the way.

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:46.022 align:middle line:90%
It's about 2,000 years old.

00:23:46.022 --> 00:23:47.480 align:middle line:84%
So it's the end of
the Paracas era.

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.220 align:middle line:90%
It suddenly dies out.

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And the textiles, the colors
are still vibrant, even

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:53.510 align:middle line:90%
after 2,000 years.

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, we get
a glimpse of the hair color.

00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:58.000 align:middle line:90%
And it's not black.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.670 align:middle line:90%
And it's not coarse.

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:01.320 align:middle line:90%
It's strawberry blond.

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And when we took that
skull out into the light,

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:05.570 align:middle line:90%
we just went, oh my gosh.

00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:07.230 align:middle line:90%
Unbelievable.

00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:07.965 align:middle line:90%
That's a first.

00:24:07.965 --> 00:24:08.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is.

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:09.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: It
really is a first.

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:13.412 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why would
it be blond or red?

00:24:13.412 --> 00:24:15.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Well, this goes
back into our hypothesis.

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:17.440 align:middle line:90%
This is what's so fascinating.

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.830 align:middle line:84%
So far, the hypothesis is
that the Nephilim tribes

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:23.570 align:middle line:84%
fled the Levant, fled
the Promised Land,

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:25.770 align:middle line:84%
and migrated to different
parts of the world--

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:27.960 align:middle line:90%
seems to be holding its own.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And if that baby skull
had coarse black hair,

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:35.300 align:middle line:84%
then that was, well, OK
so that-- but what we see

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:38.735 align:middle line:84%
is the baby skull has strawberry
blond hair, which originates

00:24:38.735 --> 00:24:39.610 align:middle line:90%
from the Middle East.

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:42.620 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting is once
we get the DNA samples,

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:45.850 align:middle line:84%
we'll be able to see what
haplogroup it comes from.

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And we'll be able
to pretty much rest

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:50.100 align:middle line:90%
the case one way or the other.

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:54.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, these people did not
originate across the Bering

00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:57.780 align:middle line:84%
Strait 10,000 years ago at
the end of the last ice age.

00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:59.110 align:middle line:90%
They came from the Middle East.

00:24:59.110 --> 00:24:59.971 align:middle line:90%
Whoa.

00:24:59.971 --> 00:25:01.220 align:middle line:90%
This is what we're up against.

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:03.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: LA, if we
assume for a moment

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:06.940 align:middle line:84%
that the fallen angels
were extraterrestrials

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:10.820 align:middle line:84%
and that they mated with
the daughters of man,

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:14.340 align:middle line:84%
and the Nephilim offspring
came about from them,

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:18.290 align:middle line:84%
do we have any idea
what star system they

00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:19.710 align:middle line:90%
might have come from?

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:21.420 align:middle line:90%
Are there any clues?

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:22.900 align:middle line:90%
Is there anything there?

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:27.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Well, we get a lot
of the idea from Orion's Belt,

00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:31.190 align:middle line:84%
the Pleiades, UFO contact
from the Pleiades,

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:35.010 align:middle line:84%
Billy Meier, Sirius,
that whole thing

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:37.350 align:middle line:90%
with the tribe and all that.

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:39.660 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:41.180 align:middle line:84%
There seems to be
gateways and there

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:43.200 align:middle line:84%
seems to be portals
in the universe

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.080 align:middle line:90%
where entities come and go.

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.314 align:middle line:90%
What bothers me--

00:25:46.314 --> 00:25:48.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, they've learned
how to bend space and time.

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:49.563 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: I agree.

00:25:49.563 --> 00:25:50.150 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's my
old-- put two dots

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:55.740 align:middle line:84%
on two ends of a piece of
paper and fold them together.

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:56.827 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: I agree.

00:25:56.827 --> 00:25:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And they're able to
do that with ease.

00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:00.709 align:middle line:84%
But as Dr. David Jacobs
says, it's future physics.

00:26:00.709 --> 00:26:02.000 align:middle line:90%
We don't know how they operate.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:02.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're not there yet.

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:04.959 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Again, Jacques
Vallee-- and I always

00:26:04.959 --> 00:26:06.125 align:middle line:90%
hail back to Jacques Vallee.

00:26:06.125 --> 00:26:09.060 align:middle line:84%
He's one of the founding
fathers of ufology.

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And he states that
these entities seem more

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:14.425 align:middle line:84%
like interdimensional entities
than they do extraterrestrial.

00:26:14.425 --> 00:26:16.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he thinks
they're more demonic, right?

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:18.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Well, that's
the paradigm I embrace.

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:23.924 align:middle line:84%
I think that what we're looking
at so far-- and everybody

00:26:23.924 --> 00:26:25.840 align:middle line:84%
I've ever interviewed
and every book I've ever

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.460 align:middle line:84%
read on the subject,
there doesn't

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:29.270 align:middle line:84%
seem to be a lot of
good guys out there.

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:31.705 align:middle line:84%
And people say, well, the
Grays are the bad guys

00:26:31.705 --> 00:26:33.230 align:middle line:84%
and Tall Whites
are the good guys.

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:36.104 align:middle line:84%
Well, OK, but why not give
us the cure to cancer?

00:26:36.104 --> 00:26:37.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But there
aren't any good ones.

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:38.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: It
doesn't seem like it.

00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:41.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It tells you if
this universe is the same--

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:43.540 align:middle line:84%
and I believe it is--
that primordial soup

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:46.850 align:middle line:90%
in this universe is the same.

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:48.020 align:middle line:90%
Planets are the same.

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:49.450 align:middle line:90%
The sun is the same.

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:50.840 align:middle line:90%
Stars are the same.

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:52.030 align:middle line:90%
It's all the same.

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:54.940 align:middle line:84%
I think the psyche
of the human mind

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:58.850 align:middle line:84%
is the same as the
psyche of an ET.

00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:00.920 align:middle line:90%
And I don't think they change.

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:03.200 align:middle line:84%
I think they're
a warring people.

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.130 align:middle line:90%
They're greedy people.

00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:07.710 align:middle line:90%
They're all kinds of things.

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:09.396 align:middle line:90%
I think it's the same.

00:27:09.396 --> 00:27:11.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: I would go as far
as to say that they're evil

00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:12.810 align:middle line:84%
because when you take
a five-year-old--

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:13.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: More so than we are.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:14.668 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Yeah.

00:27:14.668 --> 00:27:15.310 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:15.930 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:18.790 align:middle line:84%
When you take a five-year-old
from his or her bed

00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:21.980 align:middle line:84%
and they're awake and they're
completely terrorized by what's

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:23.525 align:middle line:90%
going on, that's evil.

00:27:23.525 --> 00:27:24.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's evil.

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:25.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: That's evil.

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:26.100 align:middle line:90%
And that's what goes on.

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:27.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or you don't
bring them back.

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:29.188 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: Or you
don't bring them back.

00:27:29.188 --> 00:27:31.240 align:middle line:90%
David Paulides.

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:34.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Take a few minutes here
and talk about the late Roger

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:36.080 align:middle line:90%
Leir and some of his work.

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:38.050 align:middle line:90%
You were working with him.

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:38.970 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:41.940 align:middle line:10%
>>MARZULLI: Dr. Rogar Leir was
instrumental in our "Watchers"

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:42.740 align:middle line:10%
series.

00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:44.920 align:middle line:10%
He was featured in "Watchers 1."

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:48.190 align:middle line:10%
And of course, "Watchers 8" was
the last time we filmed him.

00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And Roger and I had
many conversations

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:57.160 align:middle line:84%
about the ancient scriptures,
religion, Judaism,

00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:57.840 align:middle line:90%
Christianity.

00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:00.410 align:middle line:84%
We would go around and
around about all this stuff.

00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And what did it for
Roger-- the last time

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:06.820 align:middle line:84%
I ever spoke to him
was at Seal Lab.

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:10.620 align:middle line:84%
This was two days after we
had taken an implant out.

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And here's the backstory
to that implant.

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:13.790 align:middle line:90%
And this was all on film.

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:16.590 align:middle line:84%
It's all in "Watchers
7" and "Watchers 8."

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:19.547 align:middle line:84%
We had a man, whom
we call Bill, who

00:28:19.547 --> 00:28:21.380 align:middle line:84%
said he had an implant
below his right knee.

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:22.060 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:23.920 align:middle line:84%
The first thing
Dr. Roger Leir did

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:25.599 align:middle line:90%
was, well, let's get an x-ray.

00:28:25.599 --> 00:28:27.140 align:middle line:84%
Sure enough, there's
something there.

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:29.140 align:middle line:84%
Then the next thing was,
let's get a CAT scan.

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:30.490 align:middle line:84%
Sure enough, the
CAT scan comes back,

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:31.370 align:middle line:84%
there's an implant
in the guy's knee.

00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:31.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
something there.

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:32.500 align:middle line:90%
A little tiny thing.

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.416 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: A little
tiny thing about the size

00:28:34.416 --> 00:28:35.590 align:middle line:90%
of a lead pencil.

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:38.580 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Leir takes a Gauss
meter-- it measures

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:40.630 align:middle line:84%
magnetic field-- puts
it next to the implant;

00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:44.400 align:middle line:84%
it's registering 8.0 to 8.5
milligauss on the Gauss meter.

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.190 align:middle line:84%
Richard's camera is
only showing 10 points.

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:49.300 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what's going on here?

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:50.640 align:middle line:90%
It's bizarre.

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:54.330 align:middle line:90%
So the technology, what is this?

00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:56.290 align:middle line:84%
It's giving off a radio
frequency which we

00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:59.590 align:middle line:90%
think is about 330 gigahertz.

00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:00.950 align:middle line:90%
A stud finder picks it up.

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:03.242 align:middle line:84%
So now we take him to the
surgeon's office-- ultrasound

00:29:03.242 --> 00:29:05.408 align:middle line:84%
machine-- takes the wand
for the ultrasound, squirts

00:29:05.408 --> 00:29:07.900 align:middle line:84%
a little gel where the
implant's supposedly.

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:09.250 align:middle line:90%
Oh, there it is right there.

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:10.624 align:middle line:90%
OK, we'll see you in two weeks.

00:29:10.624 --> 00:29:11.540 align:middle line:90%
So we know it's there.

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:13.380 align:middle line:84%
We've got all the
scientific evidence

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:15.090 align:middle line:90%
that there's a metallic implant.

00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:19.060 align:middle line:84%
The day the surgery comes,
three film crews are there.

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:20.820 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Leir is assisting.

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:22.990 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Matriciano is
the head surgeon.

00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:23.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm there.

00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:25.696 align:middle line:84%
Steven Colbern is there,
the chief of science.

00:29:25.696 --> 00:29:28.320 align:middle line:10%
We got 15 people in the
waiting room, HD monitor.

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.100 align:middle line:10%
It's a whole production for us.

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:32.090 align:middle line:10%
And the patient's
lying on the bed.

00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:34.790 align:middle line:10%
And Matriciano takes the
x-ray, puts it over his leg,

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:36.110 align:middle line:10%
puts a little dot there.

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:38.900 align:middle line:10%
And for the next
hour and 20 minutes,

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:41.210 align:middle line:10%
goes over a little three
inch by eight inch strip

00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:42.560 align:middle line:10%
of flesh on this guy's leg.

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:43.640 align:middle line:90%
It's not there.

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:45.040 align:middle line:90%
He can't find anything.

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:45.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unbelievable.

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:46.605 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: It's not there.

00:29:46.605 --> 00:29:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And Matriciano turns
to Leir and goes,

00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:49.880 align:middle line:84%
maybe we should
get another x-ray.

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:51.220 align:middle line:90%
And Roger goes, oh, it's there.

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:51.970 align:middle line:90%
I know it's there.

00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:53.822 align:middle line:84%
You know, typical
doctor Leir thing.

00:29:53.822 --> 00:29:55.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They never found it?

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:56.140 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: God rest his soul.

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:57.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: LA, thanks for
being on the program.

00:29:57.670 --> 00:29:58.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: OK.

00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.710 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, George.

00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:59.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I appreciate it.

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:00.200 align:middle line:84%
But they never
found it, did they?

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:00.625 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: No, we did.

00:30:00.625 --> 00:30:01.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, you did?

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:03.281 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: That's the
kicker of the story.

00:30:03.281 --> 00:30:04.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where was it?

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:05.930 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: I prayed.

00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:07.620 align:middle line:90%
I prayed a short, simple prayer.

00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:10.110 align:middle line:84%
I said, Father, if there are
forces cloaking this device,

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:12.080 align:middle line:84%
I pray that you would
break it and do it soon.

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:14.200 align:middle line:84%
Less than two minutes
later, the image

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:17.110 align:middle line:84%
shows up like this
on the-- it just

00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:19.132 align:middle line:84%
appears on the ultrasound
out of nowhere.

00:30:19.132 --> 00:30:20.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was
moving in his body.

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:22.865 align:middle line:84%
>>MARZULLI: That's what
changed Dr. Leir's paradigm--

00:30:22.865 --> 00:30:23.912 align:middle line:90%
when he saw that.

00:30:23.912 --> 00:30:25.370 align:middle line:84%
He looked at me
and said, LA, I now

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:27.540 align:middle line:84%
believe that there's a
supernatural component

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:28.660 align:middle line:90%
to the UFO phenomena.

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:30.152 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
tell [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:30.152 --> 00:30:30.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not bad.

00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:31.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Yeah.

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:31.200 align:middle line:90%
Pretty cool.

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: LA, thanks
for being here.

00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:32.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MARZULLI: Thank you, George.

00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:33.380 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's an
incredible thing.

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:37.500 align:middle line:90%
"On the Trail of the Nephilim."

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:40.340 align:middle line:10%
On our next "Beyond Belief"
program with LA Marzulli,

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:42.937 align:middle line:10%
we talk about his
"Watchers" series.

00:30:42.937 --> 00:30:44.020 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to miss it.
