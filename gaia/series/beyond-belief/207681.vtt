>>ANDREW HOLECEK: The
practices that you

00:00:11.395 --> 00:00:13.680 align:middle line:84%
do in the dream state can
be seven to nine times more

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.540 align:middle line:84%
efficacious or
transformative than what

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.920 align:middle line:90%
you do in the waking state.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.120 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE NOORY: That's huge.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.558 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLECEK: By going so deeply
into the center of yourself,

00:00:20.558 --> 00:00:21.600 align:middle line:90%
well, guess what happens?

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.090 align:middle line:84%
Like a Mobius strip, you find
yourself coming back out.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.710 align:middle line:84%
We're hacking into previously
unconscious domains of mind

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.167 align:middle line:84%
as a way to accelerate
evolution and development.

00:00:31.167 --> 00:00:33.000 align:middle line:84%
But here's where it
gets really interesting.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.230 align:middle line:84%
Once you become lucid, there
are about nine practices

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.280 align:middle line:90%
that one can do.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.350 align:middle line:84%
They're kind of a
pedagogy of the future.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.080 align:middle line:84%
They represent a provocative
kind of night school.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dreaming is like
dying, sort of, isn't it?

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLECEK: It truly is.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Same proficiency you develop
in the nighttime dream

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.420 align:middle line:84%
then extends into the
dream at the end of time.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.750 align:middle line:84%
The good thing about all
this is that you can actually

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.858 align:middle line:90%
train yourself.

00:00:55.858 --> 00:00:57.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How would you do that?

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.317 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLECEK: We actually start
to realize, oh my gosh.

00:00:59.317 --> 00:01:02.580 align:middle line:84%
The aperture of my
awareness is so constricted,

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.410 align:middle line:84%
you're leaving out
2/3 of reality.

Well, welcome to
"Beyond Belief,"

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.660 align:middle line:10%
another amazing program for you.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.010 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Andrew Holecek is with us.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.930 align:middle line:10%
He's an author, humanitarian
who teaches internationally

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.400 align:middle line:10%
on meditation, lucid
dreaming, and conscious dying.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.448 align:middle line:90%
Andrew, welcome to the program.

00:01:28.448 --> 00:01:30.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLECEK: George,
thank you for having me.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.115 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is conscious
dying, by the way?

00:01:32.115 --> 00:01:33.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLECEK: [LAUGHS] Yeah.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.020 align:middle line:84%
It's in my languaging
using the nocturnal arena

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.580 align:middle line:90%
as a lucid dreaming.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.770 align:middle line:84%
You could also talk
about it as lucid dying.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.040 align:middle line:10%
It's actually a way
to maintain awareness

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.350 align:middle line:10%
as one goes through this
transitional process.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.470 align:middle line:10%
And there's a way to
actually rehearse it, George.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.330 align:middle line:84%
When you do nocturnal
practices, there's

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.460 align:middle line:84%
a way to kind of grease
the skids for lucid dying.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.243 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in this kind of work?

00:01:56.243 --> 00:01:58.410 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLECEK: I have always
had a very deep fascination

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.520 align:middle line:90%
with mind, consciousness.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.320 align:middle line:90%
Like, what is mind?

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.370 align:middle line:90%
What is consciousness?

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And decades ago, I
started meditating.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.080 align:middle line:84%
I started originally in the
transcendental meditation

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.880 align:middle line:90%
movement.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.030 align:middle line:10%
I had a very kind of profound
opening during that period.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.020 align:middle line:10%
And then began a somewhat
rigorous systematic search

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.640 align:middle line:10%
through the world's
wisdom traditions.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.800 align:middle line:84%
Came across the
Buddhist tradition,

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.930 align:middle line:84%
and was deeply attracted to how
connected Buddhism-- really,

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.388 align:middle line:84%
the word Buddha comes from a
root meaning the awakened one.

00:02:27.388 --> 00:02:28.472 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The awakened one.

00:02:28.472 --> 00:02:29.370 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLECEK: Exactly.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.047 align:middle line:84%
How it relates to both
sleeping, dreaming, and dying.

00:02:32.047 --> 00:02:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And there's a very
intimate connection

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.670 align:middle line:90%
between all these aspects.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And in the wisdom
traditions, you

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.890 align:middle line:84%
can actually work with
dimensions of mind

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.508 align:middle line:84%
that allow you to prepare for
things like conscious dying.

00:02:43.508 --> 00:02:45.300 align:middle line:84%
They're also obviously
intimately connected

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.217 align:middle line:90%
to conscious sleeping.

00:02:46.217 --> 00:02:48.570 align:middle line:90%
That's what lucid dreaming is.

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dreaming is like dying.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.998 align:middle line:90%
Sort of, isn't it?

00:02:50.998 --> 00:02:52.290 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLECEK: It truly is, George.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, in
the Tibetan arena,

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.470 align:middle line:84%
which probably has the world's
richest literature on this,

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.720 align:middle line:84%
they actually talk about
three types of dream.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.850 align:middle line:90%
One is the nighttime dream.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.118 align:middle line:84%
Then the dream-- what they call
the dream at the end of time,

00:03:06.118 --> 00:03:07.410 align:middle line:90%
which is what we know as death.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLECEK: And then the most
important dream is this.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.150 align:middle line:90%
They talk about--

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The reality.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.382 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLECEK: --this,
the reality dream.

00:03:14.382 --> 00:03:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And that is, in fact, what the
Buddha woke up to, the nature

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.190 align:middle line:84%
of reality, waking up from a
particular kind of nightmare,

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.400 align:middle line:84%
which we can talk about, and
actually, somewhat ironically,

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.500 align:middle line:90%
into a dreamlike reality.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.845 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Andrew, what are
nocturnal meditations?

00:03:27.845 --> 00:03:29.220 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLECEK: Nocturnal
meditations.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.420 align:middle line:84%
This is a term that
I engage to describe

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.690 align:middle line:84%
five progressive
practices that one

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.730 align:middle line:84%
can engage in every single
night as they sleep.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And so the first one is
called liminal dreaming,

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.300 align:middle line:84%
used to be called hypnagogic,
hypnopompic dreaming.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.820 align:middle line:84%
But liminality itself is
a really compelling term.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.155 align:middle line:90%
It means threshold.

00:03:50.155 --> 00:03:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And so it's that dream like--
that kind of state, George,

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:53.850 align:middle line:90%
where you're not quite asleep.

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.230 align:middle line:90%
You're not quite awake.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.680 align:middle line:84%
You're kind of
floating between--

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In between.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:58.457 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLECEK: In between state.

00:03:58.457 --> 00:04:00.900 align:middle line:84%
That's literally what
bardo means in Tibetan.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And so liminal dreaming
greases the skids

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.680 align:middle line:84%
for what's called
lucid dreaming.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.538 align:middle line:84%
That's probably the most famous
of the nocturnal meditations,

00:04:07.538 --> 00:04:09.330 align:middle line:84%
the one that's been
scientifically studied,

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.170 align:middle line:90%
proven since the '70s.

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.440 align:middle line:84%
This is when you
attain full awareness.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.940 align:middle line:90%
Lucidity, consciousness.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.839 align:middle line:84%
You're dreaming and you
know you're dreaming.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:19.000 align:middle line:90%
It's like the movie "Inception."

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.480 align:middle line:84%
The next step is what's
called dream yoga, which

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.940 align:middle line:84%
this is where, instead of
one of the characteristics

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.300 align:middle line:84%
of lucid dreaming, it's more
psychological in nature.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.455 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Spiritual?

00:04:29.455 --> 00:04:30.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLECEK: Well, not quite.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.410 align:middle line:84%
So lucid dreaming per
se is more psychological

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.190 align:middle line:90%
and about self-fulfillment.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.510 align:middle line:84%
Dream yoga is more spiritual
and about self-transcendence.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we have
on the Gaia program

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.580 align:middle line:84%
of "Mystery Teachings,"
physicist Theresa Bullard

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.638 align:middle line:84%
talks about the benefits of
dreaming in a spiritual way.

00:04:49.638 --> 00:04:50.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLECEK: Exactly right.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's watch this.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.320 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLECEK: Fantastic.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.480 align:middle line:84%
>>THERESA BULLARD: Do
you remember your dreams?

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.460 align:middle line:10%
Have you ever
experienced a dream that

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.220 align:middle line:10%
felt like it really happened?

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.010 align:middle line:10%
Or have you ever become
lucid during a dream,

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.920 align:middle line:10%
aware of the fact that
you were dreaming?

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.240 align:middle line:10%
We spend nearly one third
of our life sleeping.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.820 align:middle line:10%
What's happening
during this time?

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.040 align:middle line:10%
Of course, our body
is resting, but what's

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.210 align:middle line:10%
happening with our spirits,
our consciousness and mind?

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.860 align:middle line:10%
Could it be that dreams are
another version of reality?

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.790 align:middle line:10%
Ever since I was really young,
I've had super vivid dreams.

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.010 align:middle line:10%
Being aware of my
dreams and sharing them

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.400 align:middle line:10%
with my parents and friends has
always been a part of my life.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.970 align:middle line:10%
Because of this, my dream time
has been a very enriching part

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:38.750 align:middle line:10%
of my life.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.020 align:middle line:10%
Both my parents
were active students

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.120 align:middle line:10%
of the Edgar Cayce readings.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.540 align:middle line:10%
And in addition, my dad studied
parapsychology and the work

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.470 align:middle line:10%
of Carl Jung while in college.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.060 align:middle line:10%
And my mom's a college professor
of inter and intrapersonal

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.560 align:middle line:10%
communications.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.140 align:middle line:10%
Plus, she was really involved
with the Monroe Institute

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.440 align:middle line:10%
that explores consciousness
and journeys out of body.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.660 align:middle line:10%
So we developed a
family tradition

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.600 align:middle line:10%
of sharing dreams and
interpreting them, especially

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.120 align:middle line:10%
when they felt significant.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.340 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, I'd
like to share with you

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.510 align:middle line:10%
some of what I've learned about
our life in the dream time.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:17.470 align:middle line:10%
Dreams can be such a
useful guide in our life.

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:21.130 align:middle line:10%
They can help us solve problems,
receive insights and higher

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.940 align:middle line:10%
teachings from higher planes,
learn about ourselves, and so

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.330 align:middle line:10%
much more.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.720 align:middle line:10%
So I'd like to share some
useful methods with you

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.320 align:middle line:10%
for becoming more in tune
with your dream time.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.140 align:middle line:10%
When we talk about
dreams, the first question

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:39.010 align:middle line:10%
that often comes up is,
does everybody dream?

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:42.070 align:middle line:10%
Some people swear
that they don't dream,

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:46.510 align:middle line:10%
but science shows dreaming
is a part of our sleep cycle.

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:50.620 align:middle line:10%
Even if we aren't aware of
it or remember our dreams

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.920 align:middle line:10%
when we wake up, we all dream.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.800 align:middle line:10%
Everyone goes through
a couple of REM cycles

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.830 align:middle line:10%
at night, which is marked
by rapid eye movement

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:01.420 align:middle line:10%
during our sleep.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.190 align:middle line:10%
And during this
time, the brain is

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:06.880 align:middle line:10%
firing off with similar
patterns to when we're conscious

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:07.960 align:middle line:10%
and awake.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.840 align:middle line:10%
Only in this case,
we're dreaming.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.390 align:middle line:10%
But for the most
part, our brain can't

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:18.370 align:middle line:10%
tell the difference between
dreaming and wakefulness.

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.310 align:middle line:90%
So everybody dreams.

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:25.350 align:middle line:84%
Whether we remember it or not
is another matter altogether.

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:27.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So where do these
nocturnal meditations

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.440 align:middle line:90%
fit in here, Andrew?

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.523 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLECEK: Oh my goodness.

00:07:29.523 --> 00:07:31.080 align:middle line:90%
Well, there's a host of them.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.360 align:middle line:84%
Once you become lucid,
once you actually

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:39.660 align:middle line:84%
wake up to the dream arena,
there are about nine practices

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:43.017 align:middle line:84%
that one can do, each one
progressively more refined,

00:07:43.017 --> 00:07:44.100 align:middle line:90%
more subtle, more nuanced.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.017 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a lot.

00:07:45.017 --> 00:07:46.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLECEK: That's a lot.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are
exceedingly profound.

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:52.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the eighth and
ninth stages of dream yoga

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.420 align:middle line:84%
allow one to actually
descend into what's

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.300 align:middle line:84%
called lucid sleep, which
is the fourth practice

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:58.940 align:middle line:90%
of the nocturnal curricula.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.690 align:middle line:84%
Believe it or not,
George-- and scientists

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:02.310 align:middle line:84%
are actively
working on this now.

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:04.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm advising some
research scientists

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:05.790 align:middle line:90%
trying to prove this.

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:07.230 align:middle line:84%
This has not been
scientifically proven yet.

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:08.580 align:middle line:84%
It's been in the
wisdom traditions

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:09.600 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.408 align:middle line:84%
Scientists are now
trying to actually--

00:08:11.408 --> 00:08:13.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's taken them
so long to prove this?

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:15.408 align:middle line:10%
>>HOLECEK: It's very
difficult to send a signal

00:08:15.408 --> 00:08:16.890 align:middle line:10%
from deep dreamless sleep.

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:19.500 align:middle line:84%
In the dream state, even
though your body is temporarily

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.110 align:middle line:84%
paralyzed-- it's
called sleep atonia--

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:23.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sleep paralysis.

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:23.580 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLECEK: --you can
still send a signal

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:27.300 align:middle line:90%
by moving your eyelids.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.830 align:middle line:84%
I should say moving
your eyes, which

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:30.900 align:middle line:90%
can register with devices.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.610 align:middle line:84%
You can also hold
your breathing,

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:36.419 align:middle line:84%
so diaphragmatic
messages can be sent.

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:39.419 align:middle line:84%
But in the deep dreamless
state, it's very difficult

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:40.510 align:middle line:90%
to send a signal.

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:43.590 align:middle line:84%
So what you have to do
is a two-fold approach.

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:45.400 align:middle line:84%
You have to bookend
the experience.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:49.050 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you send a
signal to the people in the lab

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:51.370 align:middle line:90%
before you drop into that space.

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:53.820 align:middle line:84%
They monitor it with
their instrumentation.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:57.030 align:middle line:84%
You experience basically
formless dimensions of mind.

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:59.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're still
monitoring you, right?

00:08:59.010 --> 00:08:59.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLECEK: They're
still monitoring you.

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And when you pop
out of that space,

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:02.890 align:middle line:90%
then you send another signal.

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:05.110 align:middle line:84%
You can do that with
your eyes as well.

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And then you come
out as an oneironaut.

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:09.570 align:middle line:84%
That's a wonderful
term for those

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:11.040 align:middle line:90%
who explore the dream arena.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.310 align:middle line:84%
Like astronauts explore
outer space, oneironauts--

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:16.920 align:middle line:84%
oneirology is the
study of dreams--

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.080 align:middle line:84%
oneironauts study the
inner space of the mind.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And so then the
oneironaut comes out,

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:23.850 align:middle line:84%
gives their first-person
phenomenological report.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:25.530 align:middle line:90%
This is what I experienced.

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:28.920 align:middle line:84%
And then we try to collect
enough data to make it happen.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.460 align:middle line:84%
I should say, to make the
verification using questions

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:32.260 align:middle line:90%
like--

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:33.843 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you ever
see the day where

00:09:33.843 --> 00:09:37.200 align:middle line:84%
computer checks
will be on the skull

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:42.000 align:middle line:84%
and you'll literally be able
to see your dream, my dream,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.952 align:middle line:84%
on a screen kind of
like a television?

00:09:44.952 --> 00:09:46.410 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLECEK: Well,
they're starting--

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:49.170 align:middle line:84%
there's some very
interesting people at MIT.

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:50.550 align:middle line:90%
We're heading in that direction.

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:52.080 align:middle line:84%
Because as you
know, George, there

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:56.160 align:middle line:84%
are neurological correlates
to particular experiences.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.050 align:middle line:90%
It's called neurophenomonology.

00:09:58.050 --> 00:09:59.970 align:middle line:84%
So you have a
particular experience,

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:01.860 align:middle line:90%
and there's a neural signature.

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And so now the
scientists can actually

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:06.420 align:middle line:84%
read these neural
signatures and gain

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:08.850 align:middle line:84%
a very powerful
suggestion, intimation,

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.040 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what you're
actually dreaming.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:15.000 align:middle line:84%
So the reason I get really so
excited about this material,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.150 align:middle line:84%
somewhat in reference to
this video we just saw,

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:21.240 align:middle line:84%
is that in my view,
these practices really--

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.700 align:middle line:84%
they're kind of a
pedagogy of the future.

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.800 align:middle line:84%
They represent a kind
of very provocative kind

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.590 align:middle line:84%
of night school where-- think
about what you could do.

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:30.780 align:middle line:84%
According to the great
Tantric traditions,

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:33.480 align:middle line:84%
George, the
practices that you do

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.340 align:middle line:84%
in the dream state--
and this is important,

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:37.800 align:middle line:84%
because why should
I bother with this?

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:38.710 align:middle line:90%
My life is so full.

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:39.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm so busy.

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:42.120 align:middle line:84%
Why should I do
this type of stuff?

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:45.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, according to the Tantric
traditions and even some very

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.850 align:middle line:84%
interesting neuroscience,
the practices

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:50.910 align:middle line:84%
that you do in the dream state
can be seven to nine times more

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:52.800 align:middle line:84%
efficacious or
transformative than what

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:53.965 align:middle line:90%
you do in the waking state.

00:10:53.965 --> 00:10:54.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLECEK: And it's like
what she was saying.

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.830 align:middle line:84%
The brain cannot tell the
difference between something

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:01.780 align:middle line:84%
that's experienced,
visualized, or dreamt.

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:02.580 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:03.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's real to the brain.

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:05.347 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLECEK: It's
real to the brain.

00:11:05.347 --> 00:11:07.230 align:middle line:84%
And then so where this
gets super interesting

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:10.080 align:middle line:84%
is using the principles
of neuroplasticity.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.960 align:middle line:84%
This is a very hot topic
in neuroscience these days,

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:16.780 align:middle line:84%
that what you do with your
mind changes your brain.

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And so literally, they've
done studies where

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.590 align:middle line:90%
if you're working--

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:20.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm a musician.

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.370 align:middle line:84%
If I'm playing the
piano in a dream,

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:25.500 align:middle line:84%
my right hemisphere
will be activated,

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:27.307 align:middle line:84%
and they can detect
that exactly as

00:11:27.307 --> 00:11:29.640 align:middle line:84%
if I was playing at the
keyboard in so-called real life.

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.932 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will they know what
you're doing in the dream?

00:11:31.932 --> 00:11:34.170 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLECEK: Well,
again, the granularity

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:35.180 align:middle line:90%
isn't there 100% yet.

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:36.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's not there.

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:37.890 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLECEK: It's not quite there
yet, but they're heading there.

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:39.690 align:middle line:84%
But if you're doing,
for instance--

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:42.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will they know
if you're in distress?

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:43.657 align:middle line:90%
Let's say a nightmare.

00:11:43.657 --> 00:11:46.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLECEK: Well, there are other
registrations for nightmares.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.780 align:middle line:84%
The amygdala gets activated,
respiration gets heightened.

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:53.500 align:middle line:84%
There are other factors that
can bring about registration

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.850 align:middle line:90%
of stress states.

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:58.450 align:middle line:84%
So that one is not that
terribly difficult to pick up

00:11:58.450 --> 00:11:59.560 align:middle line:90%
neuroscientifically.

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.300 align:middle line:84%
But the really
important point here

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:05.170 align:middle line:84%
is that what you do
in the dreaming state

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:07.560 align:middle line:84%
can be actually more
transformative than what

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.310 align:middle line:84%
you do in the waking
state, because you're

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:12.310 align:middle line:84%
working with foundational
dimensions of mind.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:15.040 align:middle line:84%
You're working with kind
of substrate dimensions

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.020 align:middle line:90%
that really--

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:18.910 align:middle line:84%
I use the analogy
of tectonic plates.

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:20.380 align:middle line:90%
It's like what you do--

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:22.480 align:middle line:84%
the mind shifts in
a tectonic plate

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:28.030 align:middle line:84%
down there can have vast surface
repercussions and implications.

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And so this is why I like
to preach a little bit

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:34.330 align:middle line:84%
about this stuff, because it has
so much pedagogical potential.

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:36.700 align:middle line:84%
In fact, a neuroscientist,
a very famous one,

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:39.730 align:middle line:84%
Matthew Walker, wrote
the wonderful book

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:41.390 align:middle line:90%
called "Why We Sleep."

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:42.640 align:middle line:90%
It's very interesting, George.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.400 align:middle line:84%
In this book, he only devotes
three pages to lucid dreaming.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.400 align:middle line:84%
The fact that he devotes
anything is remarkable.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.050 align:middle line:84%
But in this book, he
says the following.

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:54.550 align:middle line:84%
He says, it is entirely
possible that lucid dreamers

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:58.360 align:middle line:84%
represent the next iteration
in homo sapiens evolution.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.760 align:middle line:90%
That's a big statement.

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.093 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLECEK: It's a big statement.

00:13:02.093 --> 00:13:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And this is from a
hard-hitting neuroscientist.

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:08.992 align:middle line:84%
And so I can attest in my own
experience when I've had dreams

00:13:08.992 --> 00:13:11.200 align:middle line:84%
like she was alluding to--
they're called hyper lucid

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.670 align:middle line:90%
dreams--

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:15.790 align:middle line:84%
dreams that are actually
more real than this,

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:17.920 align:middle line:84%
you wake up from
one of those dreams,

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:20.860 align:middle line:84%
and this appears to
be the foggy dream.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And the reason these
dreams are so compelling

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:25.630 align:middle line:84%
is it's not too dissimilar
to what happens when you

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:27.370 align:middle line:90%
have a near-death experience.

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:29.290 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to have
a near-death experience

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:31.730 align:middle line:84%
over and over for it
to change your life.

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:32.530 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:33.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just one time.

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:33.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLECEK: One time.

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:34.870 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:36.340 align:middle line:90%
Because it's so foundational.

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:39.190 align:middle line:84%
Because you're dealing with
something so true, so deep,

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:44.020 align:middle line:84%
so irrevocable that one
experience like that

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.920 align:middle line:84%
can change the course
of your entire life.

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And so you can also have
these hyper lucid dreams

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.910 align:middle line:90%
that are very similar to that.

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:52.900 align:middle line:84%
And the literature is replete
with these accounts, especially

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:56.080 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual traditions, where
people wake up in the morning.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.970 align:middle line:84%
They are really
different from the way

00:13:57.970 --> 00:13:59.710 align:middle line:84%
they were when
they went to sleep,

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:02.300 align:middle line:84%
because they're working with
such foundational dimensions

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.100 align:middle line:90%
of the mind.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:04.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On "Gaia
News," they have

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:08.770 align:middle line:84%
discussed some scientific
research on dreaming.

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:10.020 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLECEK: Oh, fantastic.

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:10.820 align:middle line:90%
[SOFT MUSIC]

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:12.403 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: The lucid
dream is a state

00:14:12.403 --> 00:14:14.630 align:middle line:10%
of being aware that you're
dreaming and possibly

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:17.330 align:middle line:10%
having some control
over what happens in it.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.580 align:middle line:10%
It is estimated that
some 50% of people

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:22.520 align:middle line:10%
have had one,
especially in childhood.

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:25.970 align:middle line:10%
Scientists have been studying
this phenomenon for decades,

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:28.610 align:middle line:10%
but haven't been able to
adequately explain it,

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:31.760 align:middle line:10%
because a person's recounting
of dreams upon waking

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.770 align:middle line:10%
is often unreliable.

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:36.350 align:middle line:84%
But recently, scientists
have made a breakthrough

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:38.480 align:middle line:84%
by showing that people
can both comprehend

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.960 align:middle line:84%
questions and provide answers
to them all while they're

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.400 align:middle line:90%
dreaming.

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.290 align:middle line:84%
A team of international
researchers

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:48.110 align:middle line:84%
studied 36 people with
the goal of finding a way

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:50.960 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with them
while they were dreaming.

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.020 align:middle line:90%
The results were groundbreaking.

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.930 align:middle line:10%
Charlie Morley is a dream
researcher who teaches people

00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:58.190 align:middle line:10%
how to lucid dream.

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:01.352 align:middle line:10%
He had this to say about
the importance of the study.

00:15:01.352 --> 00:15:02.810 align:middle line:10%
>>CHARLIE MORLEY:
Up to this point,

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:05.060 align:middle line:10%
there's been no way to
directly communicate

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:07.640 align:middle line:10%
to the lucid dreamer while
they're in the lucid dream.

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.590 align:middle line:84%
You can give them
instructions before.

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:11.090 align:middle line:84%
You can speak to
them afterwards.

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:13.610 align:middle line:84%
But while they're in that
internal virtual reality

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:17.330 align:middle line:84%
simulation of their own mind,
there's a blackout in comms.

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:19.070 align:middle line:84%
The brilliant thing
about this new study

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:21.020 align:middle line:84%
is that blackout
was broken through.

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:23.450 align:middle line:10%
They could actually communicate
to the lucid dreamer

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:26.870 align:middle line:10%
while they were inside
the lucid dream.

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:28.735 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: How exactly
did they do this?

00:15:28.735 --> 00:15:30.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: What
they discovered is

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:32.450 align:middle line:84%
once you're in a
lucid dream, you

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:36.510 align:middle line:84%
can actually direct your
physical eyes at will.

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:39.710 align:middle line:84%
So using a form of
literal Morse code,

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:41.670 align:middle line:84%
flicking the eyes
left, right, up,

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:44.030 align:middle line:84%
down to indicate
certain responses,

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:46.160 align:middle line:84%
they were able to
communicate with the dreamer

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.780 align:middle line:90%
while they were still asleep.

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.250 align:middle line:90%
How did they enter the dream?

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:51.090 align:middle line:90%
Three main different ways.

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:54.110 align:middle line:84%
One person said it came through
a car radio in the dream.

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:55.760 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, the radio
station changed

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:57.718 align:middle line:84%
and they could hear the
voice of the scientist.

00:15:57.718 --> 00:15:59.810 align:middle line:84%
Another person said it
was like the voice of God.

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:01.400 align:middle line:90%
It just came down from the sky.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And another person said it
was like a narrator in a film.

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:07.250 align:middle line:84%
They would then reply,
yes, I can hear you,

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:09.350 align:middle line:84%
by doing two eye
flicks to the left,

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:13.325 align:middle line:84%
or whatever code they had
pre-decided to indicate yes.

00:16:13.325 --> 00:16:15.770 align:middle line:84%
Full-on communication
back and forth

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:18.080 align:middle line:84%
while the person is
still in the dream.

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think
science is really

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:20.960 align:middle line:90%
going to get us these answers.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:21.410 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLECEK: I do too.

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:21.960 align:middle line:90%
It's so fun.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:22.970 align:middle line:90%
These are all my friends.

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:23.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Your buddies.

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:24.780 align:middle line:90%
That's what I thought.

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:26.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLECEK: It's really
delightful to see them,

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:27.050 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:28.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
liminal beings?

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:30.320 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLECEK: Liminal beings?

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:32.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:35.390 align:middle line:84%
Again, liminality, it's
a very compelling--

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:37.580 align:middle line:84%
not only a state of
consciousness, but a very

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:38.630 align:middle line:90%
compelling phenomena.

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:43.010 align:middle line:84%
So liminal beings
are those who just

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:45.170 align:middle line:90%
don't fit the standard mold.

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:46.250 align:middle line:90%
LGBTQ.

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:47.360 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the people--

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:50.150 align:middle line:84%
artists, creator
types, people that you

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:51.920 align:middle line:84%
can't pigeonhole
or shrink wrap into

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.840 align:middle line:90%
the traditional categories.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.480 align:middle line:10%
So not only do you have
liminal beings, liminal dreams,

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.370 align:middle line:10%
you also have
liminal experiences.

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:02.390 align:middle line:84%
Like for instance, when you fly
home tonight, when you first

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:04.369 align:middle line:90%
arrive, you're not quite there.

00:17:04.369 --> 00:17:05.369 align:middle line:90%
You're not quite here.

00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:08.210 align:middle line:84%
You're in this kind
of transitional space.

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:13.460 align:middle line:84%
Liminal places like
hallways, workplaces

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:15.829 align:middle line:90%
after hours, empty theaters.

00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:18.680 align:middle line:84%
Places that have a
sense of transition

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.300 align:middle line:90%
are also liminal places.

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:24.770 align:middle line:84%
So liminality is, I think, a
very compelling way to expand

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:28.610 align:middle line:84%
and open our minds to horizons
beyond the usual conventional

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:29.450 align:middle line:90%
shrink wrapping.

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:30.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it healthy?

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:31.310 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLECEK: Is it healthy?

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:31.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:33.688 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLECEK: Oh, I think
so, because what it does

00:17:33.688 --> 00:17:37.100 align:middle line:84%
is it helps dislodge our
exclusive identification

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:39.590 align:middle line:84%
with things, people,
places, and the like.

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:44.250 align:middle line:84%
It creates a more fluid, open,
kind of malleable relationship

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:45.050 align:middle line:90%
to phenomena.

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, this
effect is deeply connected

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:50.420 align:middle line:84%
to dream yoga and ties
into this wonderful maxim

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:52.220 align:middle line:84%
that I love so much,
which is blessed

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:55.970 align:middle line:84%
are the flexible, for they are
never bent out of shape, right?

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:59.150 align:middle line:84%
So liminality really works
with the type of flexibility

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:00.830 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:03.470 align:middle line:84%
You're playing in the
froth of perception,

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:07.490 align:middle line:84%
as it's sometimes said, or
the plasma of mind, right?

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:09.410 align:middle line:84%
A kind of dimension
of experience

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:11.660 align:middle line:90%
that's not quite fully formed.

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:13.730 align:middle line:84%
It's starting to
what's called de-reify,

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:16.670 align:middle line:84%
a dimension of experience
that's not so solid.

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And the minute we have
that space, George,

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:21.200 align:middle line:84%
we're more tolerant and
understanding of others.

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.090 align:middle line:90%
We're less concretized.

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:24.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're not as uptight.

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:25.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLECEK: We're not as uptight.

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:26.020 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:27.540 align:middle line:90%
We're more playful.

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:31.010 align:middle line:84%
I think a common kind of
affective or emotional kind

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:35.840 align:middle line:84%
of component of this is a more
delightful, playful, childlike

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:38.300 align:middle line:84%
wonder in terms of
relating to the world.

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:41.120 align:middle line:84%
Because you realize on one
level that this thing really

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.440 align:middle line:90%
is very much like a dream.

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And that is, in fact,
what not just the Buddha,

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:46.940 align:middle line:84%
but really the
nandu wisdom masters

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:49.610 align:middle line:84%
have all proclaimed, that
when you actually wake up

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:51.980 align:middle line:84%
to the nature of
reality, you wake up

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:56.540 align:middle line:84%
to something that appears very
dreamlike, fluid, malleable.

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.060 align:middle line:84%
In Buddhist jargon,
it's called emptiness.

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:01.610 align:middle line:84%
The world is empty of
all our projections,

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:04.100 align:middle line:84%
our imputations,
our hopes and fears.

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we're much more
responsive instead of reactive.

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:11.880 align:middle line:84%
If we hold our
views too solidly,

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:16.150 align:middle line:84%
we get confrontational,
defensive, offensive, reactive.

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:19.950 align:middle line:84%
So these practices that
seem so esoteric actually

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:22.570 align:middle line:84%
have tremendous
exoteric applications.

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:24.528 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are some
people unable to remember

00:19:24.528 --> 00:19:25.328 align:middle line:90%
their dreams?

00:19:25.328 --> 00:19:27.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLECEK: [LAUGHS] Well,
there's so many reasons.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.060 align:middle line:84%
It's like she was saying, we
have at least five dream cycles

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:31.113 align:middle line:90%
a night.

00:19:31.113 --> 00:19:32.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a lot.

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:33.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLECEK: Yeah, exactly.

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:35.250 align:middle line:90%
First one is maybe 10 minutes.

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:37.283 align:middle line:84%
Then as we go through
the night, you

00:19:37.283 --> 00:19:38.700 align:middle line:84%
enter towards the
end of the night

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:41.460 align:middle line:84%
the fourth or fifth phase,
90-minute cycles, what

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:43.440 align:middle line:90%
I call prime time dream time.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.780 align:middle line:84%
You can be in REM for
90 minutes at a shot,

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:48.300 align:middle line:84%
so you can have
long lucid dreams.

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.440 align:middle line:84%
People don't remember them
for a number of reasons.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:53.640 align:middle line:84%
One is they're not
trained properly.

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.950 align:middle line:84%
One is they don't
want to remember.

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:59.800 align:middle line:84%
Stress tends to reduce
a recall in that sense.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.950 align:middle line:84%
But the good thing
about all this

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:04.500 align:middle line:84%
is that you can
actually train yourself.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.930 align:middle line:84%
These are things that
can be exercised.

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:08.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How would you do that?

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:11.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLECEK: Well, first and
foremost is intentionality.

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:13.513 align:middle line:84%
Intentionality
comes from a root.

00:20:13.513 --> 00:20:14.930 align:middle line:84%
It's a very
interesting etymology.

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:18.562 align:middle line:84%
It comes from a root that
means to stretch towards.

00:20:18.562 --> 00:20:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And so what you want
to do here is a kind

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:21.800 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness hacking.

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:25.160 align:middle line:84%
You want to stretch the
conscious mind into previously

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.570 align:middle line:90%
unconscious domains.

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:29.000 align:middle line:84%
You want to stretch
lucidity, which is just

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.030 align:middle line:84%
a code word for
awareness, into previously

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:35.850 align:middle line:84%
non-lucid or non-aware
states, i.e. sleep and dream.

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And so intentionality
is massive.

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:40.100 align:middle line:84%
I've actually been to
some dream yoga trainings

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:43.550 align:middle line:84%
with dream yoga
meditation masters.

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:45.350 align:middle line:84%
That's the only
instruction they give.

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:46.820 align:middle line:90%
So the power of intentionality.

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:50.720 align:middle line:84%
Tonight, I'm really going
to remember my dreams.

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.610 align:middle line:84%
You can also start
to dream journal.

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:53.540 align:middle line:90%
That's been proven--

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:54.664 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That works.

00:20:54.664 --> 00:20:55.498 align:middle line:90%
That works.

00:20:55.498 --> 00:20:56.540 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLECEK: Totally works.

00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:58.305 align:middle line:84%
You keep a journal
at your bedside.

00:20:58.305 --> 00:20:59.930 align:middle line:84%
You put your money
where your mouth is.

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:02.240 align:middle line:84%
You start to record
snippets of dreams.

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:05.360 align:middle line:84%
If you have even the slightest
recollection of a dream,

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.370 align:middle line:90%
you stay with that recollection.

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And kind of like
picking up the scent,

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:11.630 align:middle line:90%
you go, oh, there's that image.

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:12.530 align:middle line:90%
Close your eyes.

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:14.000 align:middle line:90%
Turn the lens of your mind in.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.530 align:middle line:90%
Turn the mind back in.

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:17.960 align:middle line:10%
And then throughout
the day what you can do

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:22.980 align:middle line:10%
is you can literally just stop,
pause, turn your mind back

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:24.280 align:middle line:10%
in and say, OK.

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.750 align:middle line:10%
What was I just thinking
for the last 30 seconds?

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:30.780 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time we live
our lives non-lucidly,

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:32.940 align:middle line:84%
and that's the really
important thing here.

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:37.170 align:middle line:84%
The whole kind of fruition
especially of dream yoga

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.390 align:middle line:84%
is what's called
bidirectionality.

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:42.515 align:middle line:84%
Lucid dreaming leads
to lucid living.

00:21:42.515 --> 00:21:43.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's
look more at lucid

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:46.590 align:middle line:84%
dreaming with the Gaia
program "Microdose"

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:49.070 align:middle line:84%
and discuss some interesting
facts about that.

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:49.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLECEK: Love it.

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:50.440 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.107 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: This
ability for the dreamer

00:21:52.107 --> 00:21:54.250 align:middle line:10%
to be aware that he
or she is dreaming

00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:56.470 align:middle line:10%
is called lucid dreaming.

00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:58.600 align:middle line:84%
In this state of
awareness, the dreamer

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.150 align:middle line:84%
can learn and receive
guidance from the dream

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:05.470 align:middle line:84%
narrative, environment, and
even the dream characters.

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:07.690 align:middle line:10%
The term lucid
dreaming was coined

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:12.400 align:middle line:10%
by a Dutch psychiatrist named
Frederik van Eeden in 1913.

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.620 align:middle line:10%
However, early references
to this phenomenon

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:16.690 align:middle line:10%
can be found in
ancient Greek writings

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:20.830 align:middle line:10%
as well as in ancient Hindu
and Buddhist practices.

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:24.370 align:middle line:10%
In 1975, parapsychologist
Keith Hearn

00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:27.550 align:middle line:10%
proved that people can be
conscious in their dreams

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:30.790 align:middle line:10%
by having his test subjects
give coded eye signals

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:34.318 align:middle line:10%
while they were dreaming, thus
proving that they were lucid.

00:22:34.318 --> 00:22:36.610 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID JAY BROWN: When people
were in the dream state,

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:41.050 align:middle line:10%
they were able to communicate by
moving their eyes right, left,

00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:43.982 align:middle line:10%
right, left, going
back and forth.

00:22:43.982 --> 00:22:45.940 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: This
was conscious signaling

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:48.260 align:middle line:10%
from the lucid dream state
world to the lab techs?

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:49.060 align:middle line:10%
>>BROWN: Yes.

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:51.940 align:middle line:10%
And that was what demonstrated
that lucid dreaming was

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:52.960 align:middle line:10%
a reality.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.660 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: Before jumping
into how to lucid dream,

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:59.290 align:middle line:10%
are there any actual benefits
to learning this practice?

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:02.200 align:middle line:10%
Well, studies show that
lucid dreaming can literally

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:04.180 align:middle line:10%
rewire your brain.

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:06.400 align:middle line:10%
During normal dreaming,
the part of your brain

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.770 align:middle line:10%
called the visual
cortex is activated

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:10.900 align:middle line:10%
and your prefrontal
cortex, which

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:14.170 align:middle line:10%
is associated with your sense
of self, is deactivated.

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:17.470 align:middle line:10%
But during a lucid dream,
your prefrontal cortex

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:19.510 align:middle line:10%
suddenly gets activated.

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:22.660 align:middle line:10%
>>MORLEY: Once the prefrontal
cortex is activated,

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:25.570 align:middle line:10%
neuroplasticity
becomes activated too.

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:28.090 align:middle line:10%
And this is where it
gets really interesting.

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:30.340 align:middle line:10%
Neuroplasticity, of
course, the phenomena

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:33.160 align:middle line:10%
of the brain to
rewire itself in favor

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:35.560 align:middle line:10%
of a repeated action or habit.

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.750 align:middle line:10%
What you do in the
lucid dream, how

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:39.730 align:middle line:10%
you spend the lucid
dream actually

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:43.220 align:middle line:10%
rewires your brain in
favor of that activity.

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:46.293 align:middle line:10%
This means that you can
learn in your lucid dreams.

00:23:46.293 --> 00:23:47.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Fascinating
work, Andrew.

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:50.168 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLECEK: And I have to say
one thing about the prefrontal

00:23:50.168 --> 00:23:51.640 align:middle line:90%
cortex, George, coming back to--

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And where
is that on the head?

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:54.130 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLECEK: Well, let me explain.

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:55.520 align:middle line:90%
This is really interesting.

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:58.360 align:middle line:84%
So remember that proclamation
from Matthew Walker,

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:00.490 align:middle line:84%
the possibility that
lucid dreamers represent

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:02.080 align:middle line:90%
the next iteration in Homo--

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.410 align:middle line:90%
so check this out.

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:07.360 align:middle line:90%
So the most evolutionary--

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:10.240 align:middle line:84%
most recent evolutionary
advances in neuroanatomy,

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:14.930 align:middle line:84%
in the brain structure, are,
in fact, the frontal cortex.

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:17.620 align:middle line:84%
If you could take your eyes
and roll them straight up,

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:19.300 align:middle line:90%
that's what you would see.

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:22.420 align:middle line:84%
This is why, when
you look at an ape,

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:24.970 align:middle line:84%
their head slopes back,
because they don't

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:26.620 align:middle line:90%
have that part of the brain.

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:27.770 align:middle line:90%
So check this out.

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:32.950 align:middle line:84%
So when you come back online in
a lucid dream, as the video was

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:36.290 align:middle line:84%
just suggesting, the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:39.280 align:middle line:84%
the precuneus, and the
orbitofrontal cortex,

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:41.650 align:middle line:84%
they come back online
in a lucid dream.

00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:44.260 align:middle line:84%
So there's actually
neurological or neuroanatomical

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:46.510 align:middle line:84%
footing to Matthew
Walker's claim

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:50.260 align:middle line:84%
that the most recent
evolutionary advances literally

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:54.550 align:middle line:84%
in the brain structure, what's
called metacognitive capacities

00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:57.550 align:middle line:84%
of the brain, are exactly the
parts that come back online

00:24:57.550 --> 00:24:59.030 align:middle line:84%
when you're having
a lucid dream.

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:01.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does brain damage,
a tumor, affect that?

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:03.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLECEK: Yes, it can.

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:06.010 align:middle line:84%
There's been some very
interesting studies going back

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:08.920 align:middle line:84%
all the way to Phineas
Gage who had a rod shot

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:10.315 align:middle line:90%
through his prefrontal cortex.

00:25:10.315 --> 00:25:11.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god.

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:12.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLECEK: So it does.

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:14.230 align:middle line:90%
There are organic disorders.

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:17.170 align:middle line:84%
There are obviously TBIs,
Traumatic Brain Injuries

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:19.540 align:middle line:84%
and the like that actually
can radically affect that.

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:22.450 align:middle line:84%
But given enough time,
the adaptability,

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:25.120 align:middle line:84%
the malleability of
the brain, as you know,

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:28.480 align:middle line:84%
certain other aspects of the
brain can come in to take over.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:31.750 align:middle line:84%
It's a wonderful miracle of
the evolutionary trajectory

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:32.830 align:middle line:90%
altogether.

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:35.920 align:middle line:84%
But to me, I find this,
as Charlie was saying,

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:40.090 align:middle line:84%
so beautifully-- this to me is
worth putting an exclamation

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:43.420 align:middle line:84%
point on, because many people
are wondering, like, again,

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:44.500 align:middle line:90%
why should I do this?

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:45.460 align:middle line:90%
Why should I bother?

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:47.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, think about what
you could do here.

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:49.480 align:middle line:84%
We enter the dream
state-- my dear

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:52.900 align:middle line:84%
friend Stephen LaBerge from
Stanford proved it in '77.

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:55.210 align:middle line:84%
Keith Hearn did it
in '75 in England.

00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:59.260 align:middle line:84%
We enter the dream state
about 500,000 times.

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:03.580 align:middle line:84%
In an average lifetime, that
amounts to at least six years

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:05.260 align:middle line:90%
in the dream state.

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:07.200 align:middle line:84%
You can get a PhD in
less than six years.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLECEK: So if you
attain lucidity--

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:12.010 align:middle line:84%
and this is why I think what
Matthew was really saying,

00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:14.770 align:middle line:90%
I completely stand behind it--

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:17.210 align:middle line:84%
potentially, these nocturnal
meditations, in fact,

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:19.390 align:middle line:84%
represent the pedagogy
of the future.

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:22.720 align:middle line:84%
Once the induction
methods are refined--

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:25.540 align:middle line:84%
and this is the great
contribution from the West.

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:28.000 align:middle line:84%
The East has marvelous
what are called

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.830 align:middle line:84%
phenomenological techniques,
first-person meditative

00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:31.630 align:middle line:90%
techniques.

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:33.568 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you train
someone to lucid dream?

00:26:33.568 --> 00:26:35.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLECEK: That's exactly
where I was headed with this.

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:36.610 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And that is, in fact,
what makes lucid dreaming,

00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:42.080 align:middle line:84%
and in particular dream
yoga, an actual practice.

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:45.550 align:middle line:84%
So there's a whole battery
of both Eastern and Western

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:49.090 align:middle line:84%
approaches that you can
use to not only increase

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:53.420 align:middle line:84%
your recollection of
dream, but the incidence

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:57.200 align:middle line:84%
of lucidity in the dream state,
incidences of hyper lucidity.

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually, that
even matures into lucidity

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:01.745 align:middle line:90%
in the deep dreamless state.

00:27:01.745 --> 00:27:03.620 align:middle line:84%
And this is where this
material transitions--

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:06.260 align:middle line:84%
I didn't get to the fifth
of the nocturnal practices.

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:08.510 align:middle line:84%
This is a purely
Tibetan contribution.

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:11.180 align:middle line:84%
The fifth one is
called Bardo yoga.

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:14.390 align:middle line:84%
Bardo is a Tibetan word
very similar to liminal that

00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:17.450 align:middle line:84%
basically, if you believe in
this sort of thing, refers

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:20.960 align:middle line:84%
to the gaps between lives,
between incarnations.

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:23.780 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, the
fruition of all these

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:25.820 align:middle line:84%
practices-- and
in fact, somewhat

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:30.800 align:middle line:84%
in the kind of lens of Hegel,
this Hegelian notion of

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:34.670 align:middle line:84%
transcend but include,
each succeeding practice

00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:37.170 align:middle line:84%
transcends but includes
its predecessor,

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:39.770 align:middle line:84%
which means Bardo
yoga transcends what

00:27:39.770 --> 00:27:42.200 align:middle line:84%
includes sleep yoga, dream
yoga, lucid dreaming,

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.560 align:middle line:90%
and liminal dreaming.

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And so the great gift here is
that these practices, according

00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:49.610 align:middle line:84%
especially to the Tibetan
view, can radically

00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:51.230 align:middle line:90%
help you prepare for death.

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And this is even suggested in
Western intellectual thought.

00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:58.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Thanatos, the
Greek god of death,

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:03.990 align:middle line:84%
Hypnos, the Greek god of sleep,
they're not just brothers.

00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:05.370 align:middle line:90%
They're twins.

00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:07.380 align:middle line:84%
So there's a very
intimate connection

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:09.700 align:middle line:84%
between sleeping,
dreaming, and dying.

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And so what the Tibetans do--
and there are others as well.

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:14.670 align:middle line:84%
The Islamic tradition has
a dream yoga tradition.

00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:17.100 align:middle line:84%
I've been in contact
with Islamic scholars.

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:19.320 align:middle line:90%
The Jewish tradition--

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:20.937 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dying is
like lucid dreaming.

00:28:20.937 --> 00:28:23.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLECEK: Dying is very
much like lucid dreaming.

00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:24.960 align:middle line:84%
And so as I mentioned
earlier, not only

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:28.410 align:middle line:84%
do we have this bidirectional
thing where lucid dreaming can

00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:31.980 align:middle line:84%
lead to lucid living, well,
it's actually tridirectional,

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:34.950 align:middle line:84%
which means lucid dreaming
can lead to lucid dying.

00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:37.020 align:middle line:84%
It's what we started
talking about at the outset.

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:40.470 align:middle line:84%
Conscious dreaming can lead to
conscious dying, because you're

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:43.650 align:middle line:84%
working arguably, according
to these wisdom traditions,

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:46.200 align:middle line:84%
with the same
dimensions of mind.

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, if you can
attain lucidity-- in fact,

00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:51.660 align:middle line:84%
in the great Tantric traditions
of what's called the Nyingma

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:52.890 align:middle line:90%
school--

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:55.860 align:middle line:84%
if you contain lucidity--
it's an archetypal number.

00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:58.620 align:middle line:84%
They say seven times, but we're
not to take it too literally.

00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:00.630 align:middle line:84%
It just means with
some constancy.

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:03.090 align:middle line:84%
What they argue is that
the same proficiency

00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:05.640 align:middle line:84%
you develop in the
nighttime dream

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:08.220 align:middle line:84%
then extends into the
dream at the end of time.

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, you can have
a lucid, conscious dying

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:13.140 align:middle line:84%
experience where you
maintain awareness

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:15.533 align:middle line:84%
throughout the entire
death trajectory.

00:29:15.533 --> 00:29:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
the great-- this

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:18.420 align:middle line:84%
is a little bit of
a sidebar topic,

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:20.820 align:middle line:84%
but this is where the great
texts like the Tibetan

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:23.640 align:middle line:84%
Book of the Dead come
from, the great masters who

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:26.310 align:middle line:84%
maintain lucidity who can
actually come back like travel

00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:30.760 align:middle line:84%
guides and basically share what
they experienced in that space.

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:32.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have the same
mind as the Buddha.

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:35.460 align:middle line:84%
We have the same mind
as these great masters.

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:36.930 align:middle line:90%
We just need to train it.

00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:38.190 align:middle line:90%
We just need to cultivate it.

00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's why this is not just
rhetoric or metaphysical mumbo

00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:43.050 align:middle line:90%
jumbo.

00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:44.423 align:middle line:90%
This is a pedagogical approach.

00:29:44.423 --> 00:29:45.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's the real deal.

00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:46.965 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLECEK: This
is the real deal.

00:29:46.965 --> 00:29:48.510 align:middle line:90%
If you engage in the methods--

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:51.300 align:middle line:84%
and the West has some really
interesting contributions

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:52.270 align:middle line:90%
here--

00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:55.570 align:middle line:84%
you can engage in lucidity
every single night,

00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:57.570 align:middle line:84%
transform-- in fact, let
me share one experience

00:29:57.570 --> 00:29:58.370 align:middle line:90%
with you, George.

00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:02.070 align:middle line:84%
I was teaching a program where
I mentioned to this woman--

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:03.930 align:middle line:90%
actually, to this class--

00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:05.970 align:middle line:84%
that it's actually
entirely possible

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:09.660 align:middle line:84%
that you're already having lucid
dreams, but you don't know it.

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Technically for
the deeper divers--

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:13.088 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, now that's
a conflict, isn't it?

00:30:13.088 --> 00:30:15.045 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLECEK: Well, this is a--

00:30:15.045 --> 00:30:17.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because a lucid
dream, you do know it.

00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:18.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLECEK: But the
difference here--

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:20.400 align:middle line:84%
and this is worth
throwing into the mix--

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:21.775 align:middle line:84%
there's a difference
between what

00:30:21.775 --> 00:30:24.480 align:middle line:84%
philosophers call
access consciousness

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:26.430 align:middle line:90%
and phenomenal consciousness.

00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:29.010 align:middle line:84%
What that means is you can
have the experience-- that's

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:31.440 align:middle line:84%
the phenomenal consciousness--
but you may not

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:33.870 align:middle line:84%
be able to access it
actively in memory.

00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:35.980 align:middle line:90%
That is very interesting to me.

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And so when I was telling
this program, this class

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:43.422 align:middle line:84%
about this process, one woman
came up to me afterwards

00:30:43.422 --> 00:30:44.880 align:middle line:84%
and she said, you
know, I think you

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:46.560 align:middle line:84%
might have helped me
understand something

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:47.977 align:middle line:84%
I haven't been
able to understand,

00:30:47.977 --> 00:30:52.140 align:middle line:84%
that over the last six months,
I'm mysteriously getting better

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:54.330 align:middle line:90%
at this particular thing.

00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think now
what's happening is

00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:59.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually doing
this in my dream state,

00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:03.690 align:middle line:84%
and it's transforming my
ability to do it in waking life.

00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:04.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dream yoga.

00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:07.200 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that
and the Gaia program

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:10.890 align:middle line:84%
"Psychedelica" which talks
about the dream world.

we set sail for the other shore.

The dream world comes alive.

How did our ancient
ancestors view this space?

oldest continuous culture

00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:37.800 align:middle line:10%
on the planet, the
originals of what is now

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:40.830 align:middle line:10%
called Australia believe
that all creation was

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:44.760 align:middle line:10%
birthed from what the West
termed as the dreaming.

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:49.710 align:middle line:10%
The creation of the world,
the origins of knowledge.

00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:51.720 align:middle line:84%
The Indigenous
tribes of Australia

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:54.030 align:middle line:84%
would use shamanic
ceremonies and miming

00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:56.520 align:middle line:84%
dances to enter
this space in which

00:31:56.520 --> 00:32:00.420 align:middle line:84%
all ancestors and all
information was attainable.

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:02.580 align:middle line:84%
The Westerners who
attempted to translate

00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:07.000 align:middle line:84%
the meaning of this space
called it dream time.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.170 align:middle line:10%
Even in the Americas,
accessing the dreaming realm

00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:13.560 align:middle line:10%
was a known phenomena
among the Indigenous.

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:28.290 align:middle line:10%
It varies, of course, but
there is a common DNA thread

00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:30.450 align:middle line:10%
of all the Indigenous people.

00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:34.080 align:middle line:10%
Basically, they're all
related, and all of them

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:38.310 align:middle line:10%
had access to what
we call dream time.

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:43.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, dream time is
where the humans

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:46.620 align:middle line:84%
have access to
information that exists

00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:50.070 align:middle line:90%
in interdimensional spheres.

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:54.870 align:middle line:10%
And the way this was utilized
in pre-American times

00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:57.660 align:middle line:10%
and pre-Hispanic times and
before the colonization

00:32:57.660 --> 00:32:59.340 align:middle line:10%
and the Christianization
and all this

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:04.240 align:middle line:10%
where they viewed this
as diabolical or useless

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:06.130 align:middle line:10%
was that they would
find individuals

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:10.090 align:middle line:10%
that had this ability
to remember their dreams

00:33:10.090 --> 00:33:14.980 align:middle line:10%
and to be aware in their dreams,
and they would group them

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:18.160 align:middle line:10%
into dreamer societies.

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:22.840 align:middle line:10%
And they would forge a physical
unity through certain dances,

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:25.930 align:middle line:10%
through certain songs,
through drumming practices.

00:33:25.930 --> 00:33:28.810 align:middle line:10%
And then they would
go into the dream time

00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:32.980 align:middle line:10%
where they could access
visions of the future, visions

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:37.240 align:middle line:10%
of the past, visions
of other places.

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:40.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are some of
the aspects of all of this?

00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:42.290 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLECEK: Oh my goodness.

00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:43.730 align:middle line:90%
So much comes to mind here.

00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:45.770 align:middle line:84%
One thing that
immediately I have to say

00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:50.790 align:middle line:84%
is that these practices,
because they're

00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:52.920 align:middle line:84%
working with unconscious
dimensions of the mind--

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:56.460 align:middle line:84%
and neuroscience these
days argues very cogently

00:33:56.460 --> 00:34:01.560 align:middle line:84%
that at least 95% of
what we do is actually

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:04.830 align:middle line:84%
dictated by unconscious
processes, which

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:07.440 align:middle line:84%
lends tremendous new meaning
to what Christ allegedly

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.489 align:middle line:90%
said on the cross, right?

00:34:08.489 --> 00:34:11.150 align:middle line:84%
Forgive them, father, for
they know not what they do.

00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And so what you're doing when
you're working with this stuff

00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:15.567 align:middle line:84%
is you're bringing these
unconscious processes

00:34:15.567 --> 00:34:17.310 align:middle line:90%
into the light of consciousness.

00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:19.469 align:middle line:84%
And in particular,
what's very powerful

00:34:19.469 --> 00:34:22.260 align:middle line:84%
is you are revealing
a host of blind spots.

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:24.900 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most
insidious of all blind spots

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:28.020 align:middle line:84%
is actually a type
of discrimination

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:29.610 align:middle line:84%
that we all suffer
from in the West,

00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:30.790 align:middle line:90%
and we don't even know it.

00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:34.230 align:middle line:84%
It's like what-- they often
attribute it to Mark Twain,

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:36.550 align:middle line:84%
but Josh Billings
actually said it.

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:39.100 align:middle line:84%
It's not what you don't know
that gets you in trouble.

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:42.000 align:middle line:84%
It's what you do know
that just ain't so.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.489 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the things
you take as axiomatic,

00:34:44.489 --> 00:34:48.183 align:middle line:84%
the things you take as a
given, they're not givens.

00:34:48.183 --> 00:34:49.600 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
myth of the given.

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And so the reason
this is important

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:56.858 align:middle line:84%
is that Charles Laughlin,
a neuroanthropologist,

00:34:56.858 --> 00:34:58.650 align:middle line:84%
has done a very
interesting set of studies.

00:34:58.650 --> 00:35:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And he estimates that outside
of European cultures--

00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:04.770 align:middle line:84%
there are some 4,000
Indigenous cultures worldwide--

00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:08.700 align:middle line:84%
90% of them are what
are called polyphasic.

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:11.190 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they
derive their insights

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:13.590 align:middle line:84%
into mind and reality
from all dimensions

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:15.420 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness like this.

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:18.270 align:middle line:90%
In the West, we are monophasic.

00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:19.620 align:middle line:90%
We're wake-centric.

00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:22.410 align:middle line:84%
We derive our insights
from mind and reality

00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:24.150 align:middle line:90%
from the waking state.

00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, we're
leaving out categorically 2/3

00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:30.400 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And this is exactly what
this video revealed.

00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:34.950 align:middle line:84%
So by engaging in
these practices,

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:36.720 align:middle line:84%
we actually start to
realize, oh my gosh.

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:40.170 align:middle line:84%
The aperture of my
awareness is so constricted,

00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:43.290 align:middle line:84%
the lens of my mind
is so small, it's

00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:45.930 align:middle line:84%
like the only thing that's
valid and is worth discovering

00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:48.810 align:middle line:84%
is what shines itself
in the light of the day,

00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:50.530 align:middle line:90%
the diurnal activities.

00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And what these practices
point out go, you know,

00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:54.270 align:middle line:90%
you're shortchanging yourself.

00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:56.940 align:middle line:84%
You're leaving out
2/3 of reality.

00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:59.850 align:middle line:84%
Look how much you can
experience and learn

00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:01.980 align:middle line:84%
if you maintain lucidity
in the dream state

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:03.360 align:middle line:90%
and in the sleep state.

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And so again, it just
lends more credibility

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:11.040 align:middle line:84%
to how we're sitting on top
of this vast, untapped natural

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:14.160 align:middle line:84%
resource, which is
our unconscious mind.

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:16.650 align:middle line:84%
And these practices
allow us to bring

00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:18.690 align:middle line:84%
all these unconscious
processes into the light

00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:19.590 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:22.170 align:middle line:84%
They reveal a host
of blind spots,

00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:24.960 align:middle line:84%
and therefore allow you to see
things that you've actually

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:26.213 align:middle line:90%
never seen before.

00:36:26.213 --> 00:36:27.630 align:middle line:84%
And so the analogy
I give, George,

00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:30.840 align:middle line:84%
it's like if we were to take
every light in the studio

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:34.260 align:middle line:84%
and just hit it full
on, super bright,

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:36.270 align:middle line:84%
and we're hanging out in
this super bright room

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:38.790 align:middle line:84%
for, I don't know, half an
hour, and then all of the sudden

00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:42.510 align:middle line:84%
there's a total blackout, for
the first couple of minutes,

00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:44.170 align:middle line:90%
you're not going to see a thing.

00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:44.970 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:49.020 align:middle line:84%
Because your pupils are so
constricted, you can't see.

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:53.320 align:middle line:84%
But what happens, you
relax, be patient--

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:54.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it illuminates.

00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:55.820 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLECEK: Everything dilates.

00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:59.190 align:middle line:84%
That dilation is a dilation
of the aperture of awareness

00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:00.280 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:01.380 align:middle line:90%
So as the mind--

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:05.820 align:middle line:84%
as the eye relaxes, you start
to see things that have always

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:08.580 align:middle line:84%
been there, but you
hadn't seen them before,

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:10.650 align:middle line:84%
because your lens, the
aperture of your awareness

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:12.660 align:middle line:90%
was too constricted.

00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:15.090 align:middle line:84%
And so as we learn to
step into the dark,

00:37:15.090 --> 00:37:18.360 align:middle line:84%
into the nocturnal arena, which
is where we go when nature--

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:20.970 align:middle line:84%
when we abide by the
natural curfew of the night.

00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:22.900 align:middle line:84%
That's the other thing
that's happening.

00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:24.600 align:middle line:84%
Especially in the
West, light pollution

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:26.970 align:middle line:90%
is running rampant in this age.

00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:29.820 align:middle line:84%
I think every year, an
annual increase of at least

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:31.810 align:middle line:90%
6% increase in light over--

00:37:31.810 --> 00:37:32.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Each year?

00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:33.960 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLECEK: Over each year.

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:37.290 align:middle line:84%
It's having a massive damaging
effect on the ecosystem,

00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:38.680 align:middle line:90%
on our psyches, and whatnot.

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:41.580 align:middle line:84%
And so as we violate
the natural curfew

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:43.920 align:middle line:84%
of the night, which
invites us in--

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:45.640 align:middle line:84%
when it gets dark,
we get inside.

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:48.060 align:middle line:84%
When we go to bed, we
go inside even further.

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:49.977 align:middle line:84%
We're missing out on
this profound opportunity

00:37:49.977 --> 00:37:50.777 align:middle line:90%
for growth.

00:37:50.777 --> 00:37:53.070 align:middle line:84%
And even Teilhard de Chardin,
the great anthropologist,

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:55.530 align:middle line:84%
once said very,
very compellingly,

00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:58.170 align:middle line:84%
evolution hasn't
stopped, connecting it

00:37:58.170 --> 00:37:59.460 align:middle line:90%
to the earlier statement.

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.800 align:middle line:90%
It's only moved indoors.

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And so the evolutionary
trajectory now

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:04.920 align:middle line:90%
is taking place where?

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.700 align:middle line:90%
At the arena of the mind.

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:09.690 align:middle line:84%
And so these
practices have so much

00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:13.320 align:middle line:84%
applicability in this
modern age to allow

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:17.400 align:middle line:84%
us to add a night shift,
to go to night school,

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:20.660 align:middle line:84%
to bring about this
vast natural resource.

00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:23.640 align:middle line:84%
Tap into it, bring it into
the light of consciousness,

00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:25.620 align:middle line:84%
and fulfill the
Socratic injunction.

00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:28.350 align:middle line:84%
Remember where he
says, know thyself.

00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So Andrew, where
does this all take us,

00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:32.880 align:middle line:90%
this lucid dream state?

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:35.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLECEK: Ah, great
question, George.

00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:37.120 align:middle line:90%
I think what it does--

00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:39.830 align:middle line:90%
here's the way I look at it.

00:38:39.830 --> 00:38:44.260 align:middle line:84%
It's like walking a labyrinth
into the center of yourself,

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:48.590 align:middle line:84%
discovering as you take this
nocturnal journey every night

00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:52.270 align:middle line:84%
dimensions of our identity,
dimensions of our being

00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:54.280 align:middle line:84%
that have previously
been restricted.

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:57.460 align:middle line:84%
So as I mentioned earlier,
it's a kind of consciousness

00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:58.360 align:middle line:90%
hacking, right?

00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:02.470 align:middle line:84%
We're hacking into previously
unconscious domains of mind

00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:05.170 align:middle line:84%
as a way to accelerate
evolution and development.

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:07.210 align:middle line:84%
But here's where it
gets really interesting,

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:08.200 align:middle line:90%
because not only does--

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:09.325 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Here's the kicker.

00:39:09.325 --> 00:39:10.533 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLECEK: Here's the kicker.

00:39:10.533 --> 00:39:12.220 align:middle line:84%
Not only does this
labyrinth take you

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:13.900 align:middle line:84%
into the center of
yourself, but it also

00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:15.640 align:middle line:90%
doubles as a Mobius strip.

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:18.160 align:middle line:84%
So I'm bringing two
metaphors into play.

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:20.628 align:middle line:84%
By going so deeply into
the center of yourself,

00:39:20.628 --> 00:39:21.670 align:middle line:90%
well, guess what happens?

00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:25.180 align:middle line:84%
Like a Mobius strip, you find
yourself coming back out.

00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:29.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is it
that in our dream state

00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:32.270 align:middle line:84%
we can accomplish things we
can't do when we're awake?

00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:34.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLECEK: Oh, it's
because we're actually

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:38.750 align:middle line:84%
tapping into the more fluid,
dreamlike dimension of reality.

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:42.130 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a
great topic, George.

00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:44.660 align:middle line:84%
The fundamental nature,
the fabric of reality,

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:47.080 align:middle line:84%
especially according to
the Tibetan tradition--

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:50.500 align:middle line:84%
the term is emptiness-- it's a
challenging term to understand.

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:54.370 align:middle line:84%
But emptiness really translates
as openness, as malleability,

00:39:54.370 --> 00:39:57.370 align:middle line:84%
as flexibility, as
interdependence.

00:39:57.370 --> 00:40:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And so by exploring these
dimensions, you not only

00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:04.660 align:middle line:84%
open to yourself and tap
into these natural resources,

00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:07.960 align:middle line:84%
but George, you find that
you are deeply, inextricably

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.430 align:middle line:84%
connected to every
other sentient

00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:11.920 align:middle line:84%
being on this planet,
because your story is

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:12.940 align:middle line:90%
different than mine.

00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:15.070 align:middle line:90%
We don't live the same lives.

00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:17.740 align:middle line:84%
But the nature of our
being is the same.

00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:18.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But it works.

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:19.652 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLECEK: It works.

00:40:19.652 --> 00:40:20.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I've tried it a lot.

00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:21.550 align:middle line:90%
It works.

00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:22.350 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLECEK: Exactly.

00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And so by
understanding yourself,

00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:26.920 align:middle line:84%
know thyself, when
you understand

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:28.780 align:middle line:84%
your heart and mind
so profoundly, well,

00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:30.170 align:middle line:90%
guess what happens?

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:31.720 align:middle line:84%
You understand the
hearts and minds

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:33.650 align:middle line:90%
of all beings on this planet.

00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:36.400 align:middle line:10%
And so therefore,
the fruition of this

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:39.940 align:middle line:10%
is tremendous compassion,
kindness, tolerance, empathy,

00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:42.070 align:middle line:10%
openness towards
others, because you

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:45.610 align:middle line:10%
realize in the most
immediate, first-person way

00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:48.970 align:middle line:10%
that we share the
same bed of mind.

00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:52.120 align:middle line:84%
Every night, we drop
into the same bed

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:55.090 align:middle line:84%
of mind, the same
fundamental matrix of mind.

00:40:55.090 --> 00:40:57.730 align:middle line:10%
And it's only when we
come up out of that state

00:40:57.730 --> 00:40:59.800 align:middle line:10%
with a type of
amnesia, non-lucidly,

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:03.040 align:middle line:10%
that we forget the universality
and the commonality

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:05.410 align:middle line:10%
of the human condition,
that fundamentally we

00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:09.740 align:middle line:10%
are, as the Dalai Lama says
so beautifully, fundamentally,

00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:10.540 align:middle line:10%
we're all the same.

00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:12.237 align:middle line:90%
We all want to be happy.

00:41:12.237 --> 00:41:13.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's the bottom line.

00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:15.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLECEK: We all want
to avoid suffering.

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:17.590 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a beautiful
place to come full circle,

00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:19.480 align:middle line:84%
because these
teachings, again, it

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:22.750 align:middle line:84%
can seem so esoteric
and so otherworldly.

00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:25.720 align:middle line:84%
They have tremendous
applicability

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:29.932 align:middle line:84%
to benefiting ourselves,
others, and the planet itself.

00:41:29.932 --> 00:41:32.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Andrew, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:33.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLECEK: George, it's
been such a delight.

00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:34.070 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:34.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Thank you.

00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:35.710 align:middle line:90%
Lucid dreaming.

00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:38.770 align:middle line:10%
When you realize that you
are dreaming in a dream,

00:41:38.770 --> 00:41:41.110 align:middle line:10%
you can do incredible things.

00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:42.160 align:middle line:10%
Try it.

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:43.210 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:41:43.210 --> 00:41:45.670 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
