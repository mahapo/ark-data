00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:07.720 align:middle line:84%
MAN: And I think many
people today don't

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.130 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.414 align:middle line:84%
MAN: People are basically going
to keep on looking to help

00:00:12.414 --> 00:00:13.380 align:middle line:90%
uncover what really happened.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.059 align:middle line:84%
WOMAN: It felt like
something was watching me.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.910 align:middle line:84%
MAN: We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.680 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:27.850 align:middle line:90%


00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.490 align:middle line:10%
You know, on this
program, we deal

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.860 align:middle line:10%
with a lot of different things--
the strange the mysteries.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.615 align:middle line:10%
But today on "Beyond
Belief," we're

00:00:35.615 --> 00:00:38.760 align:middle line:10%
going to talk about the
very strange, the macabre,

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.430 align:middle line:10%
with Paul Koudounaris.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.740 align:middle line:84%
Paul is an author, researcher,
lives in the Los Angeles area,

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.181 align:middle line:84%
and you might have the most
fascinating job I've ever seen.

00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:49.420 align:middle line:84%
How are you, Paul?
-I'm well.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.119 align:middle line:90%
How are you, George?

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:51.960 align:middle line:10%
Good, tell me a little
bit more about you.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, I study the
use of sacred bones.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.680 align:middle line:10%
I study the use of human
remains in religious contexts,

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.730 align:middle line:10%
their magical significance,
their symbolic significance,

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.150 align:middle line:10%
and their historic significance.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.840 align:middle line:10%
How did you get
involved in that?

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.650 align:middle line:90%
I have a PhD in art history.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.640 align:middle line:84%
I got that from UCLA
several years back.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.760 align:middle line:10%
And after I had
finished grad school,

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.540 align:middle line:10%
I was traveling
in Eastern Europe

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.330 align:middle line:10%
and traveling being
kind of a euphemism

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.700 align:middle line:10%
for refusing to get a job.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.600 align:middle line:10%
You know what I mean?

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.400 align:middle line:10%
And I had gone down the wrong
stairway in an old church,

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.970 align:middle line:10%
and I had discovered
this old bone room.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.820 align:middle line:10%
And you know, I am familiar with
ossuaries and charnel houses.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.220 align:middle line:10%
And there are some famous
ones, the Paris catacombs

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.820 align:middle line:10%
maybe being the most famous.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And this one, even
people in the town

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.790 align:middle line:90%
didn't know this was there.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.080 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to
ask them about it.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.130 align:middle line:84%
You know, what's up with
this crypt full of skulls?

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.940 align:middle line:10%
And it was like, what
crypt full of skulls?

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And it was this
marvelous arrangement,

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.090 align:middle line:90%
and so it got me wondering.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.190 align:middle line:10%
How many more places are
there like this, places

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.540 align:middle line:10%
filled with human
bones that have

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.740 align:middle line:10%
some kind of
religious significance

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.040 align:middle line:10%
that people don't know about?

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.310 align:middle line:84%
Aside from all the famous ones,
there are many, many more that

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.190 align:middle line:84%
are not famous, and it
stirred this interest in me

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.775 align:middle line:84%
in studying the use of
religious bones, decoration

00:01:59.775 --> 00:02:03.020 align:middle line:84%
and human bones in religious
contexts, and beyond that,

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.890 align:middle line:84%
then, in relics,
reliquaries, and

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.060 align:middle line:84%
other mysterious and magical
properties of human remains.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, these human
relics, were they

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.840 align:middle line:84%
worshiped by the ancient people
who put them where they are?

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.050 align:middle line:84%
They're not really that ancient
in terms of world history.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.070 align:middle line:84%
It's really more of a
Christian phenomenon.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.910 align:middle line:84%
The Christians were
the par-excellence bone

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.940 align:middle line:84%
venerators, especially,
of course, the Catholics.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.420 align:middle line:84%
The Catholics are the ones
who most popularized relics.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.310 align:middle line:84%
In the ancient world, you know,
if you back to Roman times,

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.820 align:middle line:90%
the Romans understood.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.890 align:middle line:84%
The Greeks and the Romans
both understood the need

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.430 align:middle line:84%
to venerate those who
had died, but they didn't

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.000 align:middle line:90%
fetishize the human body.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.030 align:middle line:90%
They didn't fetishize remains.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.850 align:middle line:84%
Even the Egyptians were
famous for mummifying.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.630 align:middle line:84%
The mummy was not meant to
be displayed to the public,

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.330 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't really
meant to be venerated.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.940 align:middle line:84%
This is something that really
came with Christianity.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.660 align:middle line:84%
The Christians were
the ones who believed

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.200 align:middle line:84%
by taking the remains
of sacred people saints,

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.700 align:middle line:84%
and other blessed creatures,
other blessed people,

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.690 align:middle line:84%
by taking those remains and
venerating them that God might

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:09.770 align:middle line:90%
look upon them with favor.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.680 align:middle line:84%
So it's really the
Christians who popularized

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.050 align:middle line:90%
the use of sacred bones.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.750 align:middle line:90%
Why did they bury these bones?

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, they buried them,
initially, of course,

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.130 align:middle line:90%
because they had died.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.000 align:middle line:84%
The real question is, why did
they start digging them up?

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.800 align:middle line:84%
They started digging
them up initially.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.140 align:middle line:84%
The first Christian charnel
house is actually in Egypt.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.050 align:middle line:90%
It's in Sinai.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.830 align:middle line:84%
It's at Saint Catherine's
Monastery in Sinai, Egypt,

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.600 align:middle line:84%
where they believed
it was the site

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.470 align:middle line:90%
of Moses and the burning bush.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.510 align:middle line:84%
It was the first actual
physical monastery,

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.000 align:middle line:84%
and they had a very
small cemetery.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.330 align:middle line:84%
They only had nine grave
plots in the cemetery.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, this monastery has been
around for over 1,500 years,

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.120 align:middle line:84%
so 9 grave plots just
isn't going to do.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.950 align:middle line:84%
Within a generation,
that cemetery was full.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you have to be
buried on consecrated ground

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.360 align:middle line:84%
if you're a good
Christian, right?

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.340 align:middle line:84%
And so they had to start
digging people up in order

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.850 align:middle line:84%
to place new burials
in the ground

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.090 align:middle line:90%
because it's a walled community.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.960 align:middle line:84%
Real estate is limited,
and they needed to keep

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.490 align:middle line:90%
them on consecrated ground.

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.530 align:middle line:84%
So they initiated the
first charnel house,

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.340 align:middle line:84%
the first ossuary, a bone
room on consecrated ground

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.510 align:middle line:84%
in order to keep the
bones of our brothers

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.970 align:middle line:84%
and our friends and our
fellow good Christians.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, other churches
started to follow suit,

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.950 align:middle line:84%
and eventually people started
looking at those bones

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.720 align:middle line:84%
and seeing in those charnel
houses a kind of liminal space

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.290 align:middle line:84%
where the dead could be
contacted and asked for favors.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, people started
decorating with those bones

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.000 align:middle line:84%
and creating fantastic
momento-mori displays.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, do they just toss
these bones in together?

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.020 align:middle line:84%
Are they all in some
kind of heap and pile,

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.460 align:middle line:84%
or are they
logistically laid out?

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.760 align:middle line:84%
Initially, they would
use the charnel houses

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.530 align:middle line:90%
simply as a storage house.

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.870 align:middle line:84%
But over time, especially during
the Counter-Reformation when

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.090 align:middle line:84%
the Catholic church was
battling the Protestants,

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.440 align:middle line:84%
it became very typical
in Catholic countries

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.890 align:middle line:84%
to really display death, this
kind of intense penitence

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.210 align:middle line:84%
that comes from
venerating death.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.200 align:middle line:84%
It really stimulated
a desire to have

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.720 align:middle line:84%
this kind of macabre visual
culture in the church.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.400 align:middle line:84%
You know, Paul, like the
ancient days, the Egyptian Book

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.510 align:middle line:84%
of the Dead, the Tibetan
Book of the Dead,

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.560 align:middle line:84%
where they truly tried to
teach people before they passed

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.390 align:middle line:84%
on where they were going
and what they were going

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.570 align:middle line:84%
to experience on the
other side, did they

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.670 align:middle line:84%
do that with modern
and older Christianity?

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.460 align:middle line:84%
Did they try to teach these
people what's going to happen

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.830 align:middle line:90%
to them after they passed on?

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course, that's what
a lot of Christianity is about,

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.380 align:middle line:84%
is preparing you
to enter heaven.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.780 align:middle line:84%
In Christian terms,
it was called

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.630 align:middle line:84%
the ars moriendi, or the art of
death, the art of dying well.

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And there were entire
books, very popular

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.940 align:middle line:90%
in the medieval period.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.430 align:middle line:84%
There were entire
books about dying well,

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.010 align:middle line:84%
to teach you to die
properly so that you

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.190 align:middle line:84%
reconcile yourself in
this world so you're

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.020 align:middle line:90%
prepared for the next world.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.181 align:middle line:84%
All right, well you
brought us some pictures--

00:05:56.181 --> 00:05:56.880 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.691 align:middle line:84%
---of some of these
very interesting bones.

00:06:00.691 --> 00:06:02.560 align:middle line:84%
-I did.
-What's the first one for us?

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first one
is Saint Valerius.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.040 align:middle line:84%
Saint Valerius is a decorated
skeleton, a jewelled skeleton

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.170 align:middle line:90%
from Weyarn, Germany.

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.580 align:middle line:90%
Now, he was considered a relic.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.910 align:middle line:84%
He was considered an early
Christian martyr who had been

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.140 align:middle line:90%
taken from the Roman catacombs.

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.040 align:middle line:84%
His entire skeleton was
fully decorated in jewels

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.780 align:middle line:84%
and sent to this church
in Weyarn, Germany

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.300 align:middle line:90%
as an object of veneration.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.660 align:middle line:84%
The fact is that
he wasn't really

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.170 align:middle line:90%
an early Christian martyr.

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:32.260 align:middle line:84%
In the relic trade, there was
always a lot of shenanigans

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.650 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of chicanery.

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:37.060 align:middle line:84%
When they started,
at one point in time,

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.900 align:middle line:84%
they would go down into
the Roman catacombs.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And they actually
had teams of psychics

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.320 align:middle line:84%
that would go down there and
kind of go into a trance.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, well,
that's Saint Valentine.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.514 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well, we
already have one.

00:06:44.514 --> 00:06:46.013 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well, that's
Saint Valentine, too.

00:06:46.013 --> 00:06:46.730 align:middle line:90%
Bring him out.

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, how would you know, huh?

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.330 align:middle line:84%
Exactly, and so a
lot of these people,

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.330 align:middle line:84%
you know, one of the
things in one of my books,

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.110 align:middle line:84%
"Heavenly Bodies," I wrote
about this extensively,

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.300 align:middle line:84%
this kind of relic trade
in the 17th century.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.370 align:middle line:84%
They would look for
circumstantial evidence,

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:02.600 align:middle line:90%
which was often very flimsy.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.290 align:middle line:84%
They would look for the initial
M because M meant martyr.

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:09.170 align:middle line:84%
M was also an abbreviation for
the most popular name in all

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:10.870 align:middle line:90%
of Rome, which was Marcus.

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:13.310 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, by
that logic, are we

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.140 align:middle line:84%
really looking at an
early Christian martyr

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.290 align:middle line:90%
when we look at Valerius?

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:18.630 align:middle line:84%
Or are we looking at the
skeleton of a Roman fishmonger

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:20.170 align:middle line:90%
by the name of Marcus?

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.400 align:middle line:84%
It could be either, and
it's probably the latter.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.370 align:middle line:84%
The real point is, and
the important point

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:27.610 align:middle line:84%
is, he was believed to have
been in a blessed state.

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:29.020 align:middle line:84%
He was believed to
have been a martyr.

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And he was treated
appropriately,

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:32.730 align:middle line:84%
and he was venerated
appropriately.

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:34.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, what have they
done to him, Paul,

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:40.180 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the kind of jewelry
or whatever it is that they

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.330 align:middle line:90%
put all over these bodies?

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:43.330 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:44.370 align:middle line:90%


00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:46.810 align:middle line:84%
The one we're looking at now
is a Saint Valentine, actually.

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's a Saint Valentine in
Bad Schussenried, Germany--

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:53.560 align:middle line:84%
same story, probably
not a real martyr,

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.490 align:middle line:90%
taken from the Roman catacombs.

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:58.080 align:middle line:84%
These were sent
north as raw bone,

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:01.230 align:middle line:84%
and then they were fully
articulated and decorated

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:03.120 align:middle line:90%
by teams of, usually, nuns.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.460 align:middle line:84%
Nuns, to us, that might
sound strange that nuns

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:07.360 align:middle line:90%
are working on these bones.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.080 align:middle line:84%
But nuns were actually
the perfect people

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.370 align:middle line:84%
to work on these bones
because in the convent

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:14.140 align:middle line:84%
their economy was based
often upon textile work

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:14.960 align:middle line:90%
and jewelry work.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.770 align:middle line:84%
So nuns actually had
incredible skills.

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:19.635 align:middle line:84%
And you could tell by just
looking at these things.

00:08:19.635 --> 00:08:23.220 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, and so they
would take these skeletons.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.370 align:middle line:84%
This was a 17th century
thing in particular.

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:27.360 align:middle line:84%
They would take
these full skeletons,

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.020 align:middle line:84%
and they would
cover them in glory,

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.190 align:middle line:84%
right, cover them in jewels,
covering them in glory.

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:33.400 align:middle line:90%
And it was kind of a sign.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.640 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of a sign
to the congregation.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.120 align:middle line:90%
You stay true to this church.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:37.900 align:middle line:90%
You are loyal.

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.049 align:middle line:90%
You are faithful.

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:41.590 align:middle line:90%
God has glory in store for you.

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:44.480 align:middle line:84%
The glory that we see in
visible terms on this skeleton

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.350 align:middle line:84%
is the glory that God will offer
you in the heavenly Jerusalem.

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:49.450 align:middle line:84%
It's glory that God will
offer you in heaven.

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:53.340 align:middle line:84%
Did anybody try to steal some
of this jewelry and things

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.880 align:middle line:84%
like that from these
bodies, these bones?

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.800 align:middle line:84%
Not back in the day,
not back in the day

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.190 align:middle line:84%
because everyone was
terribly, terribly dedicated

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:02.500 align:middle line:90%
to venerating these skeletons.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.220 align:middle line:90%
Later, they did.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:05.630 align:middle line:84%
In the book,
"Heavenly Bodies," I

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:08.420 align:middle line:84%
mentioned I photographed maybe
about 200 of these skeletons.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.810 align:middle line:84%
I would say that was
maybe 1/10 the number

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:13.270 align:middle line:84%
of these full skeletons
that once existed.

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:15.710 align:middle line:84%
In the 19th century early
century in particular,

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:18.350 align:middle line:84%
when monastic properties
and church properties were

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:19.920 align:middle line:84%
secularized, they would
come in, and they'd

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.350 align:middle line:84%
strip off all the jewels and
throw the bones in the trash.

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.750 align:middle line:84%
What's something
like that worth, Paul?

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.910 align:middle line:90%
That's a great question.

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:29.730 align:middle line:84%
Every time I do a talk,
someone asks that question,

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:31.680 align:middle line:84%
which is a marvelous
question which I have never

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.980 align:middle line:84%
come up with a definitive answer
for because I'll tell you why.

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:37.290 align:middle line:84%
Not trying to
dodge the question,

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:41.080 align:middle line:84%
there is the material value
in gold and in jewels.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.840 align:middle line:84%
But what about the
value of labor?

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.580 align:middle line:84%
What about a team
of nuns that might

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:50.740 align:middle line:84%
spend 10 years decorating this
thing with consummate skill?

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:51.800 align:middle line:90%
An unknown variable, there.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:56.890 align:middle line:84%
Exactly, so there's the value
of the materials in scrap.

00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:59.040 align:middle line:84%
But how do you
calculate that labor

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:03.000 align:middle line:84%
of skilled craftspeople working
for years and years on this?

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.600 align:middle line:84%
When you add that
into the equation,

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.040 align:middle line:84%
it's got to be, in our
terms, millions of dollars.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.320 align:middle line:90%
Are you kidding me?

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.130 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's got to be.

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:10.290 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:14.770 align:middle line:84%
See that wig that Saint
Valentine is wearing?

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:16.970 align:middle line:90%
Notice how gold it looks?

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:17.750 align:middle line:90%
It looks gold.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:18.800 align:middle line:90%
Is that what it's made with?

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.570 align:middle line:90%
It's made of gold, yeah.

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:22.520 align:middle line:84%
There was only one
place in all of Europe

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:26.460 align:middle line:84%
where you could get gold wire
of the thinness of human hair,

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.010 align:middle line:90%
and that was in Leone, France.

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:30.390 align:middle line:84%
It was the only place that
could make gold and silver

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:31.530 align:middle line:90%
wire of that thinness.

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:33.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, why would they
go to this expense

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:34.960 align:middle line:90%
to get gold and silver wire?

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:35.880 align:middle line:90%
Well, think about this.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.951 align:middle line:84%
It's been 350 years, and his
hair still has perfect curls,

00:10:38.951 --> 00:10:39.650 align:middle line:90%
doesn't it?

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:42.181 align:middle line:84%
What would happen if I set
a human wig in perfect curls

00:10:42.181 --> 00:10:43.530 align:middle line:84%
today?
-It would be gone, fall apart.

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:44.363 align:middle line:90%
It would be gone, right.

00:10:44.363 --> 00:10:48.330 align:middle line:84%
So this dedication to
perfection, golden hair--

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, and at
today's gold prices,

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:52.190 align:middle line:84%
that hair is worth
a lot of money.

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:55.140 align:middle line:84%
-He's Goldilocks, literally so.
-He truly is.

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:58.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, did that person
live that kind

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:02.920 align:middle line:84%
of a life to deserve
this kind of recognition

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:03.970 align:middle line:90%
in the afterlife?

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:07.970 align:middle line:84%
If he was truly a
martyr, he is blessed,

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:11.010 align:middle line:84%
and he deserves that
from the church.

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:12.690 align:middle line:84%
Again, we're dealing
with a case where

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:14.920 align:middle line:90%
he probably was not a martyr.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:19.690 align:middle line:84%
One of the other factors that
they would use in determining

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:21.430 align:middle line:84%
who was a martyr in
the Roman catacombs,

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:25.220 align:middle line:84%
for instance, was a presence of
a vial full of brown sediment

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:26.920 align:middle line:84%
because brown sediment
was thought to be blood.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.920 align:middle line:84%
And if you were a martyr, you
had spilled your blood, right?

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And so it was
thought, well, they

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:31.256 align:middle line:84%
would collect some of
the blood, and then it

00:11:31.256 --> 00:11:32.200 align:middle line:90%
would dry into sediment.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And if they find
that by the tomb,

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:36.180 align:middle line:84%
absolutely, that's a martyr,
no question about it.

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.210 align:middle line:84%
It turned out later
when these were

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:41.280 align:middle line:84%
chemically analyzed,
centuries later,

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.750 align:middle line:90%
that it wasn't blood at all.

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:44.820 align:middle line:84%
It was perfume because you
know how we now put flowers

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:46.090 align:middle line:90%
on the grave to freshen it?

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:47.860 align:middle line:90%
The Romans used to put perfume.

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:49.860 align:middle line:84%
So that's evidence,
really, that he

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:53.280 align:middle line:84%
was a Roman and probably more of
a pagan than even a Christian.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:57.450 align:middle line:84%
Do collectors want
things like this?

00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:59.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure they'd love to
have things like this.

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:00.720 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to own
things like this.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you
can get them out

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:04.160 align:middle line:84%
of where they're
stored because they are

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.670 align:middle line:90%
elements of cultural patrimony.

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:10.440 align:middle line:84%
Back in the day, private
collectors would get them.

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:14.410 align:middle line:84%
If you were a very wealthy
family, very well connected,

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:18.310 align:middle line:84%
you, yourself, could get
martyrs of skeleton sent to you

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:20.430 align:middle line:84%
from the Roman catacombs.
-They would do that?

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:22.530 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, private collectors
wanted them back in the day

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:25.210 align:middle line:84%
because it was symbolic
of your incredible piety

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:26.140 align:middle line:90%
to own something like this.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And how would they
display them, in the house,

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.490 align:middle line:90%
somewhere in the living room?

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:30.462 align:middle line:90%
What would they do with them?

00:12:30.462 --> 00:12:34.080 align:middle line:84%
If you were a
princely family, you

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.870 align:middle line:84%
would have display halls within
your palace for your treasures.

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:40.327 align:middle line:84%
And so they would place
them somewhere like that.

00:12:40.327 --> 00:12:41.460 align:middle line:84%
Paul, you know,
like, the crystal

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:45.300 align:middle line:84%
skulls where they talk about
the possibility of them

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:47.460 align:middle line:90%
having some mystical powers.

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:51.770 align:middle line:84%
Did these bones possess
any kind of special powers?

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:54.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, they were certainly
thought to at the time.

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.850 align:middle line:84%
One of the signs of
a relic is the fact

00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:58.610 align:middle line:90%
that it creates miracles.

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And so when one of these
would be sent to a church,

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:03.610 align:middle line:84%
the first thing they would
do is open a miracle book.

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:06.980 align:middle line:84%
And they would start compiling
accounts of potential miracles

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:10.000 align:middle line:84%
that these skeletons
may have performed.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And they were all thought
to have performed them.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:15.200 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I brought along a slide
of Saint Maximus, which I think

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.530 align:middle line:90%
is the next image that we have.

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:17.250 align:middle line:90%
Saint Maximus.

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:18.860 align:middle line:84%
Saint Maximus in
Waldsassen, Germany.

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:19.760 align:middle line:90%
Sounds like the gladiator.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.010 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well, Maximus
was a common Roman name.

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:24.180 align:middle line:90%
It just meant the great.

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.230 align:middle line:84%
These were not even-- I should
point out-- these were not

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:27.870 align:middle line:84%
even the real names
of these people

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:30.750 align:middle line:84%
because often they didn't have
identities when they would take

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:32.660 align:middle line:84%
them out of the Roman catacombs
because the catacombs,

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:34.371 align:middle line:84%
this is 1,500 years
after they may

00:13:34.371 --> 00:13:36.270 align:middle line:84%
have been buried if they were
[INAUDIBLE] or a Christian.

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:38.310 align:middle line:84%
Chances are, they had
the wrong bone, right?

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:40.460 align:middle line:84%
But they would
be rebaptize them.

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:42.710 align:middle line:84%
As I said, they had teams
of psychics or relic hunters

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:44.790 align:middle line:84%
who would go down into
the Roman catacombs.

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:47.100 align:middle line:84%
They would decide based on
circumstantial evidence.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:47.990 align:middle line:90%
This is a martyr.

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:49.640 align:middle line:84%
And then they would
actually rebaptize

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:50.890 align:middle line:90%
them in Italian [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And so they would actually
baptize the bones,

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:54.310 align:middle line:90%
and they would give them a name.

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:56.080 align:middle line:84%
So they became
what they became.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.230 align:middle line:84%
Right, they would baptize
the skeleton and say,

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:02.700 align:middle line:84%
we decree that you are Saint
Maximus, meaning not really

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:03.700 align:middle line:90%
giving him a proper name.

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:05.000 align:middle line:84%
They're just calling
him the great one,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.199 align:middle line:84%
and he is the great
one because they

00:14:06.199 --> 00:14:07.800 align:middle line:90%
believe he died for his faith.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.220 align:middle line:90%
But you asked about miracles.

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:12.200 align:middle line:84%
Saint Maximus, himself,
was involved in a very

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.220 align:middle line:90%
curious supernatural incident.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:14.940 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:18.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, he is one of 10
fully-articulated, jeweled

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.200 align:middle line:84%
skeletons that were sent to
Waldsassen Basilica in Germany,

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.880 align:middle line:84%
and he was the
last one to arrive.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.520 align:middle line:84%
The same guy
decorated all of them.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:25.850 align:middle line:84%
His name was
Adalbart Eder, and he

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:28.840 align:middle line:84%
was a skilled
goldsmith who was also

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.910 align:middle line:90%
a lay brother of this order.

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And this was the last one,
and it was a very old man.

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And he was trying to make them
all a little bit different,

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:38.610 align:middle line:90%
and he had already done nine.

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:40.101 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I just
can't figure out

00:14:40.101 --> 00:14:41.100 align:middle line:90%
what to do with Saint Maximus.

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.060 align:middle line:90%
He was running out of ideas.

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:44.695 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, and he told the skeleton.

00:14:44.695 --> 00:14:47.120 align:middle line:84%
He's like, I don't know
what to do with you.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.780 align:middle line:84%
There's no pose I
can find for you.

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:52.840 align:middle line:84%
I can't pose your bones
in a way that will stay.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.210 align:middle line:84%
I just don't know
what to do with you.

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:55.950 align:middle line:84%
And he walked away to dinner,
and when he came back,

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:57.990 align:middle line:90%
Maximus had posed himself.

00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:59.771 align:middle line:84%
And it's the pose that
Maximus is still in today.

00:14:59.771 --> 00:15:00.470 align:middle line:90%
He did it himself.

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:02.500 align:middle line:84%
Maximus showed him the pose
he wanted to be remembered in.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:03.899 align:middle line:84%
-That's magical?
-That is.

00:15:03.899 --> 00:15:05.090 align:middle line:90%
That's considered magical.

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:07.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, that doesn't look
like a martyr to me.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.780 align:middle line:84%
This was the face that
would be expected of a martyr

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:13.710 align:middle line:84%
because the state of
martyrdom is a blessed state.

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And so in the early
church, martyrs

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:20.480 align:middle line:84%
were thought to be given a
direct pass right into heaven.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.660 align:middle line:84%
So he's covered in
glory, heavenly glory.

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:25.580 align:middle line:84%
This is the face that would
be expected of a martyr.

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:29.260 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we do that
today to our bones?

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.900 align:middle line:84%
We live in a much
more secular age,

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:34.590 align:middle line:84%
and also our
relationship with death

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:37.550 align:middle line:84%
has changed radically over
the past couple of centuries

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:40.720 align:middle line:90%
in the Western world.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:43.920 align:middle line:84%
I always think of the
movie, "Psycho," you know,

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:44.710 align:middle line:90%
Norman Bates.

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:47.970 align:middle line:10%
And what made him
absolutely unfit

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:48.990 align:middle line:10%
to be a member of society?

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:53.050 align:middle line:84%
He is absolutely, positively
insane beyond any measure.

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:54.750 align:middle line:84%
It was the fact that he
had mummified his mother

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:55.240 align:middle line:90%
and displayed her.

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:56.580 align:middle line:84%
Yes, he did, and he
kept her up there.

00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:01.250 align:middle line:84%
Right, now back in Sicily,
especially, in Palermo, Sicily,

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:06.240 align:middle line:84%
up until the 19th century, that
was the epitome of a loving son

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.190 align:middle line:84%
is that you would
mummify your parents.

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:09.170 align:middle line:90%
That was the norm?

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:09.930 align:middle line:90%
That was the norm.

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:12.720 align:middle line:84%
In Palermo, Sicily, there
was a catacombs system

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.710 align:middle line:90%
under a monastery in Palermo.

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:18.570 align:middle line:84%
The Palermo catacombs have
over 3,000 mummies on site.

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:21.240 align:middle line:84%
It's the largest collection,
in situ, of mummies

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.380 align:middle line:90%
in the world that I know of.

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:28.240 align:middle line:84%
3,000 on site, except for a
few ecclesiastics, all of them

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.810 align:middle line:90%
were placed there.

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:33.850 align:middle line:84%
They were ordered to be
mummified by their relatives

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:36.070 align:middle line:84%
as a sign of respect
so their relatives

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:37.420 align:middle line:90%
could come and visit them.

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:40.110 align:middle line:84%
So they could literally
re-encounter their relatives.

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:41.020 align:middle line:90%
So they would keep them?

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:41.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.550 align:middle line:84%
Put them maybe in the
living room or wherever, huh?

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:45.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, in Palermo,
you were supposed

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:48.620 align:middle line:84%
to keep them in a church because
it was a powerful display.

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:50.820 align:middle line:84%
But people would come
every November 2, the Day

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:53.120 align:middle line:84%
of the Dead, not just to pay
homage to those people who

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.930 align:middle line:84%
had passed on, but to
rerope them, to give

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:56.370 align:middle line:90%
them a new set of clothes.

00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:59.330 align:middle line:84%
So what we now think of
as absolute insanity,

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:01.340 align:middle line:90%
Norman Bates, was at one time--

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:02.140 align:middle line:90%
Acceptable.

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:03.900 align:middle line:84%
Right, it wasn't
just acceptable.

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.849 align:middle line:84%
It was the epitome
of a loving son.

00:17:05.849 --> 00:17:07.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have
my father mummified,

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:10.650 align:middle line:84%
and I am going to put him on
display for everyone to see.

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:13.109 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to change
his clothes every year

00:17:13.109 --> 00:17:14.859 align:middle line:90%
so people know that I care.

00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:17.220 align:middle line:84%
In some cultures, it
is the norm, actually,

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:20.050 align:middle line:84%
or it has been the norm to
even bring them into the house.

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:24.210 align:middle line:84%
Most of my work for
the two previous books

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:25.250 align:middle line:90%
was done in Europe.

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:28.190 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, I've also
been travelling a lot in Asia

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:30.710 align:middle line:84%
and Africa, documenting
similar things

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:34.140 align:middle line:84%
cross culturally for a future
book that I'll be releasing.

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And when I was in Indonesia
on the island of Sulawesi,

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.120 align:middle line:90%
I was studying burial caves.

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And I know there was a
tradition in Indonesia

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:44.300 align:middle line:90%
of also mummification.

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, those
mummies would be displayed,

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.910 align:middle line:90%
even displayed by the family.

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And so I asked my guide, do you
know of any local families that

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:54.400 align:middle line:84%
might keep a mummy
that I could visit,

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.300 align:middle line:84%
and I could maybe do some
photographs and interview them?

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:57.670 align:middle line:90%
And he said, you know, I do.

00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:01.280 align:middle line:84%
There is this local family
who found the mummy of a girl

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.660 align:middle line:84%
in a cave, and
they felt that she

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:04.310 align:middle line:90%
was lonely and calling to them.

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:06.470 align:middle line:84%
So they took her in
as their own daughter.

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:08.340 align:middle line:84%
So they keep her in the
house, and they dress her.

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.369 align:middle line:84%
And they have her presented.
-Amazing.

00:18:10.369 --> 00:18:11.350 align:middle line:90%


00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:12.350 align:middle line:90%
It gets better.

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:14.190 align:middle line:84%
So I went and
visited the family,

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:18.600 align:middle line:84%
and I talked to them about
their daughter, the mummy.

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And I did some
photos of the girl.

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:22.881 align:middle line:84%
And then when we were
leaving, I said to my guide--

00:18:22.881 --> 00:18:23.580 align:middle line:90%
his was Agus.

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Agus,
tell me something.

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:29.120 align:middle line:84%
Is it considered normal to keep
a mummy in the house like this

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.840 align:middle line:90%
and treat it as a family member?

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And Agus said to
me, he said, well,

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:35.670 align:middle line:84%
Paul, when I was
a boy, my brothers

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:39.200 align:middle line:84%
and I all slept in the same bed
with my grandfather's mummy.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:42.617 align:middle line:84%
And every morning, we
would take him out of bed,

00:18:42.617 --> 00:18:43.650 align:middle line:90%
and we'd dress him for the day.

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And we'd stand in the corner.
-Oh, my gosh.

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.447 align:middle line:84%
And then every evening,
we'd put his pajamas on,

00:18:47.447 --> 00:18:48.480 align:middle line:90%
and we put him back in the bed.

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.410 align:middle line:90%
And we slept with him.

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:51.530 align:middle line:90%
It was one of those moments.

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:52.763 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've been
around the world.

00:18:52.763 --> 00:18:55.060 align:middle line:84%
You would be put in
an institution today.

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:57.310 align:middle line:84%
I've been around the world, and
I had no comeback for that one.

00:18:57.310 --> 00:19:00.490 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you can say, well,
you know, in the Philippines,

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:01.250 align:middle line:90%
they do such and such.

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:02.630 align:middle line:90%
All you can say to that is, wow.

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:04.200 align:middle line:90%
And they thought it was OK.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.070 align:middle line:90%
It is OK.

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:06.920 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
wrong with it other

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:09.740 align:middle line:84%
than it violates our own
cultural conventions,

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:13.070 align:middle line:84%
our modern cultural
conventions, based on this idea

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:15.050 align:middle line:84%
that the dead need
to be ghettoized.

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And the dead need to
be kept away from us

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:20.560 align:middle line:84%
and segregated from the living,
but it's a very new conception.

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.555 align:middle line:84%
Paul, if I reported
on my radio show

00:19:23.555 --> 00:19:29.840 align:middle line:84%
that a guy in Wichita, Kansas
was sleeping with the skeleton

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:34.360 align:middle line:84%
of his dead mother
or his uncle, people

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:37.740 align:middle line:84%
would want this guy locked up
and put away for a long time

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:39.000 align:middle line:90%
in an institution.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.420 align:middle line:84%
In the United States,
they certainly would.

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:44.555 align:middle line:84%
Yet in other areas, you say
that's perfectly acceptable,

00:19:44.555 --> 00:19:46.080 align:middle line:90%
huh?

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:50.770 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the history
of our relationship to death,

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:53.130 align:middle line:84%
historically and
cross culturally,

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:55.850 align:middle line:84%
it has been more
typical to view death

00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:58.161 align:middle line:84%
as a transition,
not as a boundary

00:19:58.161 --> 00:19:59.560 align:middle line:84%
because that's the way
we think of it now.

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:00.500 align:middle line:90%
Death is a boundary.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And we don't cross
over to their side,

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:03.690 align:middle line:84%
and they don't come
over to our side.

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:05.150 align:middle line:90%
The two groups are segregated.

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:08.210 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at history,
from prehistory on, death

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:10.730 align:middle line:84%
has been a transition, and
it's possible to maintain

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:13.940 align:middle line:84%
a dialogue back and forth
across that boundary.

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:16.710 align:middle line:84%
And that allows the dead
a role to play in society.

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And the dead once had
a very important role

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.820 align:middle line:84%
to play in society, not just
as relics, but as helpers.

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And in many cultures,
they still do.

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:26.800 align:middle line:84%
The living always offer
something to the dead.

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.280 align:middle line:84%
In Christian culture, they
offer prayers to the dead

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:30.480 align:middle line:90%
who are in purgatory.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:32.050 align:middle line:84%
In other cultures,
they offer whatever

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:32.930 align:middle line:90%
the equivalent would be.

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And the dead offer
something to the living.

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:37.290 align:middle line:84%
It's just that now in
Western society, as I said,

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:40.520 align:middle line:84%
we've constructed a very
different reality of the way

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:41.550 align:middle line:90%
we should treat the dead.

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:45.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, you seem to be very
artistical at the same time.

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:49.620 align:middle line:84%
You have a very interesting
array of garb on today.

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:52.160 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, I
remember seeing you now

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.870 align:middle line:84%
on the plane leaving
the Los Angeles

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:57.190 align:middle line:90%
area coming here to Denver.

00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:01.000 align:middle line:84%
Do you get a lot of
response from people who

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.500 align:middle line:90%
see you with the feathered hat?

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:04.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, I certainly
got a response

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:08.020 align:middle line:84%
from TSA when I tried to bring
this jeweled skull through.

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:09.420 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about
him in a second.

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:12.400 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you go around dressed
like me, carrying a human skull

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.950 align:middle line:84%
in a bag that's
covered in jewels,

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:16.291 align:middle line:84%
TSA is going to have
some questions for you.

00:21:16.291 --> 00:21:18.540 align:middle line:84%
-And did they?
-Oh, yeah.

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:21.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, they made me go back and
check him in because they said

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:24.020 align:middle line:90%
it could be a potential weapon.

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:25.560 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't that be the
ultimate hijacking?

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:26.890 align:middle line:90%
You know, give me your plane.

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:30.840 align:middle line:84%
Because I guess,
I've got to tell you.

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.045 align:middle line:84%
They're like little knives,
right, little spikes?

00:21:33.045 --> 00:21:34.880 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's intended
to be a crown.

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.490 align:middle line:90%
It's intended to give him glory.

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:37.500 align:middle line:90%
He's not the real thing.

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:40.637 align:middle line:84%
He's a replica that was
lent to me by a magician

00:21:40.637 --> 00:21:42.470 align:middle line:84%
friend of mine, Christopher
Wonder, who lives in Italy,

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:43.680 align:middle line:84%
who uses him in his act.
-So how did they approach you?

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.511 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're going
through security, right?

00:21:45.511 --> 00:21:47.830 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah.
-And you're holding the skull.

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:49.140 align:middle line:90%
Is he in a bag or something?

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:50.350 align:middle line:90%
He is in my carry-on bag, yeah.

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:52.170 align:middle line:84%
OK, he's in a little carry
on, and there you are.

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And do they have you
take your hat off?

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:55.090 align:middle line:90%
What do they do to you?

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:56.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first thing
they did was notice

00:21:56.910 --> 00:21:59.670 align:middle line:84%
that there was a human
skull in a bag, covered

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:02.810 align:middle line:90%
in some kind of spiky crown.

00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:05.090 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they didn't draw guns.

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:07.730 align:middle line:84%
They just said, uh, sir,
we really need to talk you.

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:09.290 align:middle line:90%
Do they say, who are you?

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:10.530 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:12.600 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they had some
other questions.

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:13.400 align:middle line:90%
What did you tell them?

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to Denver
to do a TV show?

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.370 align:middle line:90%
It's just a friend of mine.

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:20.340 align:middle line:84%
No, I told them he's a
prop, and we're using

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:22.370 align:middle line:90%
him on a TV show in Denver.

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:24.110 align:middle line:84%
They asked if I
would please go back

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:27.720 align:middle line:84%
and check him in instead of
carry him onto the plane.

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:29.110 align:middle line:90%
Did you have to do that?

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:31.270 align:middle line:90%
I did, yeah.

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:32.990 align:middle line:90%
That's a pain all by itself.

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:35.400 align:middle line:90%
Well, he had a nice ride, yeah.

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.480 align:middle line:90%
So you checked him in?

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:40.340 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, were you always
artistical this way,

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:45.530 align:middle line:84%
or did you develop that later
on as you did things like this?

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:47.900 align:middle line:84%
I actually started
out in the visual arts.

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:50.030 align:middle line:84%
I used to do art
installations, and I used

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:51.680 align:middle line:90%
to do assemblage sculpture.

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And after that, I got more
into the studious side

00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:57.830 align:middle line:90%
of the art world.

00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And so I went back, and I
got a PhD in art history.

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
started really becoming

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:04.500 align:middle line:90%
interested in macabre culture.

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And so eventually, I started
writing these books, but, yeah,

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:09.640 align:middle line:84%
I've always been interested
in the visual arts.

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:10.506 align:middle line:90%
I've always had that side.

00:23:10.506 --> 00:23:15.042 align:middle line:84%
How widespread, Paul, is
this interest in this field?

00:23:15.042 --> 00:23:17.260 align:middle line:90%
It can't be that big.

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:18.450 align:middle line:90%
It's growing bigger.

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:21.630 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's an interesting
thing about modern culture.

00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:25.630 align:middle line:84%
If you consider teen
literature, you know, think

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:27.320 align:middle line:90%
about what they're reading now.

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:31.060 align:middle line:84%
It might not be highbrow stuff,
but all this stuff like "Harry

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:34.870 align:middle line:84%
Potter" or "Twilight," it's all
based in kind of macabre stuff.

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:37.180 align:middle line:84%
And so it's growing
larger, and I think

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:38.700 align:middle line:90%
it's going to continue to grow.

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:40.857 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that's happened--

00:23:40.857 --> 00:23:42.290 align:middle line:84%
and I think it's a
product of the internet,

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:44.860 align:middle line:84%
George-- is that I think
there were a lot of people,

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:46.980 align:middle line:84%
and it's probably the
same in a lot of stuff

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:49.320 align:middle line:84%
that you work on with
the UFOs and the aliens.

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:51.750 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
people who are sincerely

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:53.790 align:middle line:84%
interested in this
stuff, but they may have

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:55.050 align:middle line:90%
always felt kind of shut off.

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:57.070 align:middle line:84%
Like, well, is this
considered something I

00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:58.720 align:middle line:84%
shouldn't really be
studying, or is this

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:01.110 align:middle line:84%
considered something that's--
-Taboo?

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:03.430 align:middle line:84%
Exactly, taboo
or not acceptable,

00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:05.190 align:middle line:84%
especially when
it comes to death,

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:07.470 align:middle line:84%
to be interested in
death in this way

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:09.330 align:middle line:84%
and interested in
macabre visual culture,

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:11.600 align:middle line:84%
and I think one of the
things the internet has done

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:15.590 align:middle line:84%
is let normal people, you know,
more shopping-mall culture,

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:18.590 align:middle line:84%
realize that, yeah, you can
be a normal member of society

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:19.820 align:middle line:90%
and be interested in this stuff.

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:21.720 align:middle line:84%
There's kind of a
support group for you,

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:24.772 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot more people
out there than you know.

00:24:24.772 --> 00:24:27.310 align:middle line:84%
Just this year, there
was a friend of mine,

00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:30.110 align:middle line:84%
Megan, in Los Angeles,
had put on a kind

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:31.880 align:middle line:84%
of international
symposium called the Death

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.170 align:middle line:90%
Salon, which I was a part of.

00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And several other people
came to Los Angeles

00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:38.010 align:middle line:84%
to just talk about
topics related to death.

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:41.111 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't a bunch of
scythe-wielding freaks

00:24:41.111 --> 00:24:41.810 align:middle line:90%
and hoods.

00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:44.560 align:middle line:84%
It was a lot of
very normal people.

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:46.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, and that's interesting
that you bring that up

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:49.770 align:middle line:84%
because we have gone
through a huge metamorphosis

00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:54.552 align:middle line:90%
now with the way we treat death.

00:24:54.552 --> 00:24:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And there are some
cultures where, you know,

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:57.840 align:middle line:90%
they have the wake.

00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's a party, and
it's a great time.

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.550 align:middle line:84%
There are other cultures
where it's morbid and sad,

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:08.230 align:middle line:84%
and they treat death as
not an extension of life,

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:10.050 align:middle line:90%
but as the end.

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:12.310 align:middle line:84%
Why are these
cultures so different?

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:16.930 align:middle line:84%
To me, it comes to how society
has chosen to view death,

00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:19.040 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a
transition or a boundary.

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.440 align:middle line:84%
Once it's a boundary,
there's this finality to it.

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And even if you believe
in the afterlife,

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:26.140 align:middle line:84%
there's still a finality to it
because we don't access them.

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:28.380 align:middle line:90%
And they do not access us.

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:33.110 align:middle line:84%
But as I said, when death is
considered as a transition

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:36.930 align:middle line:84%
and the dead maintain a
role to play in society,

00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:40.130 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a much healthier
attitude towards death.

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:43.760 align:middle line:84%
The dead still have
this role to play,

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.230 align:middle line:90%
and we're acculturated to it.

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:47.380 align:middle line:84%
There was an interesting
psychological study

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:49.530 align:middle line:84%
which I quoted in my book,
"The Empire of Death,"

00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:51.850 align:middle line:84%
which is kind of a
history of charnel houses.

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:53.510 align:middle line:84%
There was an interesting
psychological study

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:57.350 align:middle line:84%
that I found where they had
determined that people actually

00:25:57.350 --> 00:26:01.270 align:middle line:84%
live healthier, happier lives
when they are confronted

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:04.660 align:middle line:84%
with distinct
emblems of mortality

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:07.710 align:middle line:84%
because it acculturates
them to the idea of death

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:09.860 align:middle line:90%
being part of a natural process.

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:12.250 align:middle line:84%
The way we treat it,
and a lot of people

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:14.800 align:middle line:84%
are now beginning to feel this
way, the way we treat it now

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.430 align:middle line:84%
is really very
unhealthy because it

00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:18.020 align:middle line:90%
is part of a natural process.

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:21.790 align:middle line:84%
I agree, and what I
try to teach people

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:27.340 align:middle line:84%
is that it's a
process of living.

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:28.470 align:middle line:90%
That's just it.

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And some people will grieve
when an 88-year-old person

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.540 align:middle line:90%
passes on.

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:36.360 align:middle line:90%
I see that as a great run.

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:38.410 align:middle line:90%
We're all terminally ill.

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:40.760 align:middle line:84%
We're terminally ill with
a disease called life,

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:42.620 align:middle line:90%
and it inevitably ends in death.

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:47.030 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, do you
want to live your life,

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:49.300 align:middle line:90%
or die your life, really?

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, I think
being acculturated to death

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:53.780 align:middle line:84%
is a way of helping
you live your life,

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:55.840 align:middle line:84%
to realize what you
have that is precious,

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:57.370 align:middle line:90%
and to celebrate that.

00:26:57.370 --> 00:27:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And to enjoy every day, I
think Gandhi basically said,

00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:03.690 align:middle line:84%
enjoy every day
like it's your last.

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:05.500 align:middle line:90%
And live your life that way.

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.140 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
I've become increasingly

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:10.190 align:middle line:84%
interested in lately and
I've begun researching

00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:11.980 align:middle line:84%
are pet cemeteries,
just because it's

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:13.680 align:middle line:84%
a very different
approach to death

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.900 align:middle line:84%
because it's still a
member of the family.

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:19.740 align:middle line:84%
But the normal filters
and conventions

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:23.070 align:middle line:84%
we have for grieving
the living human beings

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:24.900 align:middle line:84%
are removed when it
comes to the pet.

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:28.130 align:middle line:84%
So it's a lot more raw, and
it's a lot more intimate.

00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's also, in some ways,
I think, a lot more honest.

00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:35.030 align:middle line:84%
I've been photographing
a lot of pet cemeteries

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:37.030 align:middle line:84%
and I'm even thinking of
preparing a book on them.

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:37.770 align:middle line:90%
You should.

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:39.379 align:middle line:84%
That would be a great idea.
-I think I should.

00:27:39.379 --> 00:27:40.790 align:middle line:84%
I've even talked to
a publisher about it.

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And the emotion that I find
there, it's often very crude,

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:46.837 align:middle line:90%
but it's very honest.

00:27:46.837 --> 00:27:48.170 align:middle line:10%
And I'll tell you
something that's going

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:49.730 align:middle line:10%
to make me sound like a sap.

00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:52.350 align:middle line:10%
But it's a true story so
I'll share it with you.

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:54.550 align:middle line:84%
I have obviously been
around the world,

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:56.740 align:middle line:84%
documenting death
in many cultures.

00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:58.940 align:middle line:10%
I have visited every
memorial to the dead.

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:01.410 align:middle line:10%
I've visited every charnel
house and every bone room

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:04.370 align:middle line:10%
in all these places with
skeletons on display.

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:05.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm callous.

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:06.770 align:middle line:90%
Nothing gets to me.

00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:08.730 align:middle line:84%
The first time I
went and I visited

00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:11.250 align:middle line:84%
one of these pet cemeteries, the
first time I went and started

00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:13.220 align:middle line:84%
photographing one,
in the middle,

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:15.350 align:middle line:84%
I had been photographing
for about four hours,

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:16.380 align:middle line:90%
and it started to rain.

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:17.910 align:middle line:84%
I was like, oh, damn it.
It's starting to rain.

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at the camera.
There were drops of water.

00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And I looked up in the sky,
blue sky, nothing, not a cloud.

00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:24.280 align:middle line:84%
I was like, where is
this water coming from?

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:26.480 align:middle line:90%
And I realized, I'm crying.

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:27.986 align:middle line:84%
It got to me, and it
got to me so subtly.

00:28:27.986 --> 00:28:28.950 align:middle line:84%
It did.
It's emotional.

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:30.460 align:middle line:84%
Right, it got to
me so-- and I am

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:33.270 align:middle line:84%
so callous because I've visited
every place of human death.

00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:34.190 align:middle line:90%
No emotion.

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:36.420 align:middle line:84%
Right, but what I found
there, because it was

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:39.310 align:middle line:84%
so much more raw and
so much more intimate,

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:40.690 align:middle line:90%
it had gotten to me.

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that was a
place where death is presented

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:47.220 align:middle line:84%
in a very different
context than as I

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:49.200 align:middle line:84%
said because the normal
conventions are off.

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people need
to start thinking that way.

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:52.520 align:middle line:84%
Paul, thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:54.200 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah, of course.
-I really appreciate it.

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:56.770 align:middle line:90%
This is absolutely fascinating.

00:28:56.770 --> 00:28:59.960 align:middle line:10%
This is something that I
have never really experienced

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.690 align:middle line:10%
before, that in
some cultures just

00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:05.070 align:middle line:10%
honoring the dead by
keeping them along with

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:07.300 align:middle line:10%
you is the norm.

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:11.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thank you
for watching "Beyond Belief."
