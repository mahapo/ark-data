00:00:19.852 --> 00:00:21.810 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
back to another edition

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:22.610 align:middle line:10%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.010 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and this
is a very important show.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.840 align:middle line:10%
Of course they all are, but
this one is very important

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.750 align:middle line:10%
as we're going to talk about
emergency planning and crisis

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.920 align:middle line:10%
management, things that will
help you during an emergency.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.520 align:middle line:84%
Our special guest
is Matthew Stein.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.510 align:middle line:84%
>>We are at a key
moment in history,

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.360 align:middle line:84%
and our choices will
determine whether we

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.080 align:middle line:84%
are headed for the
collapse of civilization

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.100 align:middle line:90%
or a global Renaissance.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.940 align:middle line:10%
Matthew Stein, author of
two best selling books,

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.970 align:middle line:10%
"When Disaster Strikes" and
"When Technology Fails,"

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.900 align:middle line:10%
says it's still up to us,
though time is running out.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.200 align:middle line:84%
Matt warns of a
half dozen scenarios

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.519 align:middle line:84%
looming on the horizon,
any one of which

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.390 align:middle line:84%
would result in a civilization
busting catastrophe.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.610 align:middle line:84%
But he hopes his vision for
a more sustainable future

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.450 align:middle line:84%
will inspire us to move
in the right direction

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.160 align:middle line:90%
before it's too late.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.670 align:middle line:90%
Today, on "Beyond Belief."

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I've got one of his
books, "When Technology Fails,"

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.736 align:middle line:84%
and I'm keeping it
after this program.

00:01:26.736 --> 00:01:28.110 align:middle line:10%
You're not getting
it back, Matt.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.010 align:middle line:10%
>>MATTHEW STEIN: OK.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.660 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: --at all.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.420 align:middle line:90%
>>STEIN: It's yours.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
about this and what

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.740 align:middle line:84%
got you involved in
this, because you're

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.900 align:middle line:90%
a designer by trade, right?

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.310 align:middle line:10%
>>STEIN: Well, I'm a mechanical
engineer with a bachelor

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.830 align:middle line:10%
of science from MIT.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.700 align:middle line:10%
And in 1997, at
that point in time

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.140 align:middle line:10%
I'd had a 20 year
practice of meditation.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.410 align:middle line:10%
And in my morning
session of meditation

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.280 align:middle line:10%
I made a generic request for
guidance and inspiration,

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.492 align:middle line:10%
just kind of like, OK, god,
what am I supposed to do?

00:01:53.492 --> 00:01:54.292 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:01:54.292 --> 00:01:57.510 align:middle line:84%
>>STEIN: And I got a bomb
dropped in my lap that morning.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.170 align:middle line:84%
I received a pictorial
storyboard outline

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.380 align:middle line:84%
for a massive project to help
people live more sustainably,

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.169 align:middle line:84%
and also to help
people plan and cope

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:13.510 align:middle line:84%
with major long-term failures in
our central services-- meaning,

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.012 align:middle line:84%
no Costco, no gasoline, no
electricity, no water flowing.

00:02:17.012 --> 00:02:17.970 align:middle line:90%
How do we deal with it?

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.350 align:middle line:90%
How do we cope?

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.170 align:middle line:84%
Now my first thought, when
I received this vision,

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.780 align:middle line:90%
was no way.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:24.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm an engineer.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm not an author.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.500 align:middle line:90%
I don't know all this stuff.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.580 align:middle line:90%
I can't possibly do this.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus calls it the
still, small voice,

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.235 align:middle line:90%
other people, the inner voice.

00:02:34.235 --> 00:02:35.860 align:middle line:84%
The little voice in
my head said, well,

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.070 align:middle line:90%
nobody knows it all.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And it assured me that I
had the skills and talents

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.530 align:middle line:84%
that if I chose to take
this assignment on that I'd

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.160 align:middle line:84%
get the inner and outer help
I needed to finish it off.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, I didn't just
jump right up and said,

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.524 align:middle line:84%
well, God inspired me
and talked to me today.

00:02:50.524 --> 00:02:52.940 align:middle line:84%
It took me about a year to
decide maybe is was a good idea

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.150 align:middle line:84%
and I could do it,
another year to start

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.610 align:middle line:84%
reading 30 or 40 books,
start writing a proposal,

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:59.640 align:middle line:90%
find a publisher.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.800 align:middle line:84%
And then in the last year,
I worked 70 hours a week

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.120 align:middle line:84%
seven days a week
to finish it off.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.670 align:middle line:84%
And what you see there is the
second edition of my book.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.170 align:middle line:84%
You got about three
years in my life

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.880 align:middle line:84%
and all the equity in
my home in that book.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:11.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right here.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.560 align:middle line:90%
>>STEIN: That's right.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: William Forstchen,
one of our past guests

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.410 align:middle line:84%
on the program, has
talked about what

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.470 align:middle line:84%
would happen if we had
an EMP attack-- that's

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.530 align:middle line:84%
an electromagnetic
pulse bomb that blows up

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.020 align:middle line:84%
over the atmosphere--
or a solar flare that

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.710 align:middle line:90%
takes out the power grid.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.430 align:middle line:84%
A lot of that is
right down your alley.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.020 align:middle line:84%
Because if we lose the ability
to have electrical power

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.390 align:middle line:90%
we're up a creek, Matt.

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.120 align:middle line:84%
>>STEIN: Yet the EMP
Commission estimates

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.120 align:middle line:84%
that 90% of the population
of the United States

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.480 align:middle line:84%
would probably perish
in the first year

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.680 align:middle line:84%
after either an extreme solar
event or a nuclear EMP attack.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.190 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: 200+ million people
dead after the first year.

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.170 align:middle line:10%
>>STEIN: You're talking maybe
even 300 million people dead

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.820 align:middle line:10%
after the first year.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.540 align:middle line:84%
There's a good news,
bad news scenario.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.290 align:middle line:84%
The good news is that there
are technological fixes

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.310 align:middle line:90%
to mitigate this.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.550 align:middle line:84%
Not to say that an
EMP or a solar attack

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.910 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't be severe, even with
the best efforts they could do,

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.690 align:middle line:84%
but for a couple
of billion dollars,

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.010 align:middle line:84%
the price of a single
stealth bomber,

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.362 align:middle line:84%
they could fix the grid so it
wouldn't be all-out collapse,

00:04:19.362 --> 00:04:21.320 align:middle line:84%
and they could protect
our nuclear power plants

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.930 align:middle line:84%
from meltdowns in
the event of an EMP.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.570 align:middle line:84%
The bad news is that so far
they're just talking about it.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.230 align:middle line:84%
So, much like the US Army
Corps of Engineers warned

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.090 align:middle line:84%
for 50 years that the
levees around New Orleans

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.720 align:middle line:84%
were not adequate to sustain
a category 3 or stronger storm

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.805 align:middle line:84%
and that they would
fail, the government

00:04:41.805 --> 00:04:44.180 align:middle line:84%
knew there was a problem and
they talked about fixing it,

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.610 align:middle line:84%
but they never fixed it
and the problem happened.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.690 align:middle line:10%
The problem with the grid
is that, similarly, they're

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.640 align:middle line:10%
talking about the problem,
the scientists acknowledge

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.630 align:middle line:10%
the problem, but they're
still just talking

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.490 align:middle line:10%
and they haven't
implemented the fixes.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.260 align:middle line:84%
So it would be a shame if
the stock market collapsed,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.030 align:middle line:84%
the government collapsed, and
90% of the people of the United

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.790 align:middle line:84%
States died because for the
price of a single stealth

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.230 align:middle line:84%
bomber we never got
around to making

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:12.314 align:middle line:90%
the decision of fixing it.

00:05:12.314 --> 00:05:13.146 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:14.900 align:middle line:84%
What are other nations
doing, because they

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.066 align:middle line:90%
would have the same problem?

00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:19.780 align:middle line:84%
>>STEIN: Well, what's
interesting is that,

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.100 align:middle line:84%
is often the case,
the United States

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.440 align:middle line:84%
is at the forefront of
identifying the problem,

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.220 align:middle line:90%
but we're dragging our feet.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.409 align:middle line:84%
So in some places,
in some countries,

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:30.200 align:middle line:84%
they're working in the
EU-- and some places

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.860 align:middle line:84%
in the EU they're
working to fix the grid.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.890 align:middle line:84%
In the Soviet
Union and in China,

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.180 align:middle line:84%
they're working actively
to strengthen the grid

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.660 align:middle line:90%
against EMP and solar storms--

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:39.577 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Smart people.

00:05:39.577 --> 00:05:40.993 align:middle line:84%
>>STEIN: --and
we're not doing it.

00:05:40.993 --> 00:05:42.526 align:middle line:84%
So here our
scientists figured out

00:05:42.526 --> 00:05:44.150 align:middle line:84%
the problem, figured
out the solutions,

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.999 align:middle line:84%
but we're dragging
our feet to fix it.

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:49.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You would think a
presidential candidate would

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.980 align:middle line:84%
use this-- Newt Gingrich
did several years ago,

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.290 align:middle line:90%
but it fell on deaf ears.

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.440 align:middle line:84%
That they would push
things like this

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.310 align:middle line:84%
to get this done, instead of
the rabble rousing and the junk

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:02.224 align:middle line:90%
they talk about.

00:06:02.224 --> 00:06:03.390 align:middle line:90%
>>STEIN: You would think so.

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.870 align:middle line:90%


00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.140 align:middle line:84%
The state of Maine
is the only state

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.770 align:middle line:84%
that's actively doing
something to fix and strengthen

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.780 align:middle line:84%
their grid, and they had some
people who ran on this platform

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.500 align:middle line:84%
and actually got
elected on this.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.420 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately
in the government

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.510 align:middle line:84%
so far, they're just
kind of ignoring it.

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.490 align:middle line:84%
They don't think it's
that big of an issue.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.740 align:middle line:84%
And part of the problem was
when the EMP Commission said

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.780 align:middle line:84%
this is a huge problem,
there's a private corporation

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:34.470 align:middle line:84%
called National Electric
Reliability Corporation.

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:38.470 align:middle line:84%
Sounds like they're the good
guys and in a sense they are.

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:41.320 align:middle line:84%
It's a group of people
from the industry ensuring

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.550 align:middle line:90%
that our grid is healthy.

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And NERC came out after
the EMP Commission came out

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:48.690 align:middle line:90%
with their stuff.

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:52.030 align:middle line:84%
They had a forum and
they'd identified

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.940 align:middle line:84%
that EMP and solar storm were
huge threats to the grid.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And they wrote a report
called "The HILF Report"--

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.320 align:middle line:90%
high impact, low frequency.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.370 align:middle line:84%
They said, these are
event, black swan events,

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.160 align:middle line:90%
that are really serious.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.452 align:middle line:84%
After that report came
out, NERC fired those guys

00:07:05.452 --> 00:07:06.410 align:middle line:90%
that wrote the report--

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:07.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my.

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:08.263 align:middle line:10%
>>STEIN: --had new people.

00:07:08.263 --> 00:07:10.350 align:middle line:10%
They wrote a new report
saying everything's OK--

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:11.891 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yeah, that's
what they want.

00:07:11.891 --> 00:07:13.400 align:middle line:10%
That was their mission.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.360 align:middle line:10%
>>STEIN: --that our
existing safeguards are OK.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.840 align:middle line:84%
But the truth of the
matter is, in 1989

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:23.510 align:middle line:84%
we had a storm that was
one-tenth as strong as the 1921

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:24.650 align:middle line:90%
geomagnetic storm.

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:27.572 align:middle line:84%
That's called the Great
Geomagnetic Storm of 1921.

00:07:27.572 --> 00:07:29.030 align:middle line:10%
And the prior one
before that was--

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:30.405 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Carrington
Event, right?

00:07:30.405 --> 00:07:34.080 align:middle line:10%
>>STEIN: The 1859 Carrington
Event, 50% stronger

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.690 align:middle line:10%
than the 1921 storm.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:39.390 align:middle line:84%
So in the last 160 years,
we've had two giant storms.

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:41.700 align:middle line:84%
A storm that was
one-tenth as strong

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:47.020 align:middle line:84%
as the smaller of those two
caused 15 simultaneous failures

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:50.640 align:middle line:84%
in the province of Quebec,
wiped out a massive transformer

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:51.440 align:middle line:90%
in Quebec.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.550 align:middle line:84%
>>STEIN: It caused power to go
out in the entire province--

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:55.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Millions
were without power.

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.070 align:middle line:84%
>>STEIN: Millions
were without power,

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:58.980 align:middle line:90%
and that's one-tenth as strong.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:01.890 align:middle line:84%
The U.S. Government
funded a study

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:05.540 align:middle line:84%
to look at the effects
of a geomagnetic storm,

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.390 align:middle line:84%
and they based it
on the 1921 one,

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:10.400 align:middle line:84%
which they estimate is
a one in 80 year event.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.180 align:middle line:84%
You know, roughly 70-80 year
event; 75 years, approximately.

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.660 align:middle line:84%
That storm, when they
did the computer models,

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:21.510 align:middle line:84%
they estimated that 350 of
the massive transformers

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:23.380 align:middle line:84%
in the United States
would go down.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, these transformers
are 20 feet tall,

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:30.320 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of tons, tens of
millions of dollars each.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.250 align:middle line:84%
There's a three year
waiting line to get one.

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:34.280 align:middle line:84%
They're custom made
and custom built.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.740 align:middle line:84%
When one of those
transformers went down

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.630 align:middle line:84%
in Quebec, and a
few smaller things,

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:40.460 align:middle line:90%
the whole province went out.

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.450 align:middle line:84%
If 350 go out in this
country, probably a couple

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:47.240 align:middle line:84%
thousand in the world, that's 20
years of manufacturing capacity

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.200 align:middle line:90%
to replace those transformers.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.660 align:middle line:10%
And most of those will be
made in countries that will

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.260 align:middle line:10%
be crippled by the solar storm.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:54.310 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Like China?

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:55.920 align:middle line:10%
>>STEIN: Like China.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.700 align:middle line:10%
Brazil might be OK.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.267 align:middle line:10%
They make them in Brazil now.

00:08:59.267 --> 00:09:00.350 align:middle line:10%
They make them in Germany.

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:00.950 align:middle line:10%
They won't be made.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:02.310 align:middle line:84%
They're not even made
in America anymore.

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:04.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They can't
make them fast enough.

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:08.480 align:middle line:10%
>>STEIN: Well imagine that
20 years, if we built them

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.859 align:middle line:10%
at today's rate, it
would take 20 years

00:09:10.859 --> 00:09:12.400 align:middle line:10%
to replace the ones
that would go out

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.385 align:middle line:10%
in a single solar event
like 1921 or 1859.

00:09:15.385 --> 00:09:16.400 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: A disaster.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.480 align:middle line:10%
>>STEIN: You're talking
game over for America--

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:22.115 align:middle line:10%
no water treatment, no
sewage treatment, no pumping,

00:09:22.115 --> 00:09:22.915 align:middle line:10%
no electricity.

00:09:22.915 --> 00:09:25.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No water,
no gasoline, no ATMs.

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.370 align:middle line:90%
>>STEIN: No ATMs.

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:29.420 align:middle line:90%
No cash.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.130 align:middle line:90%
Try to go to a gas station.

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:37.010 align:middle line:84%
In 1996, there was a major
power outage on the west coast.

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:39.300 align:middle line:90%
It was a super hot day.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:43.264 align:middle line:84%
The power lines in Oregon sagged
and shorted out in some trees.

00:09:43.264 --> 00:09:44.680 align:middle line:84%
There was air
conditioners running

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:48.250 align:middle line:84%
all over the west coast, so
it caused a cascading failure

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:50.150 align:middle line:84%
that wiped out power
of the whole west coast

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:51.372 align:middle line:90%
for much of the day.

00:09:51.372 --> 00:09:53.080 align:middle line:84%
On that day, my brother
and sister-in-law

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.746 align:middle line:84%
were driving through
the Central Valley.

00:09:54.746 --> 00:09:56.270 align:middle line:90%
It was about 115 degrees.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:58.040 align:middle line:90%
You could fry an egg in the sun.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.500 align:middle line:84%
Pulled into a gas
station and they thought,

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.470 align:middle line:90%
like, I can't pump gas.

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:06.394 align:middle line:84%
They went into the store to
buy a cold beer or some drink

00:10:06.394 --> 00:10:07.560 align:middle line:90%
while they're sitting there.

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.450 align:middle line:84%
People were fanning
themselves in the heat,

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:10.930 align:middle line:90%
trying to find some shade.

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:12.010 align:middle line:90%
You couldn't buy a Coke.

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:13.680 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't open up
the cash register.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.450 align:middle line:90%
Nothing was working.

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:19.570 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that if that started day
one, day two, day three, week

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:22.759 align:middle line:84%
two, week three, month two,
month three, month four--

00:10:22.759 --> 00:10:23.800 align:middle line:90%
what are you going to do?

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.310 align:middle line:84%
How are you going
to feed yourself?

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:26.721 align:middle line:84%
How are you going
to drink water?

00:10:26.721 --> 00:10:28.970 align:middle line:84%
People in the major cities,
they could be drinking out

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:29.770 align:middle line:90%
of the duck ponds.

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:32.270 align:middle line:10%
I mean, a city of
10 million people,

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:36.010 align:middle line:10%
where are they going to pee
and poo when nothing's working?

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:37.710 align:middle line:10%
Where are you going
to drink your water?

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:39.790 align:middle line:84%
Imagine sharing water
out of the duck ponds

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:42.820 align:middle line:84%
in Central Park with another
million other people,

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:45.040 align:middle line:84%
or drinking out of
the Hudson River,

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.590 align:middle line:84%
especially when there's
millions of people upstream

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:49.250 align:middle line:84%
and they're
defecating everywhere

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:51.580 align:middle line:84%
because none of the
toilets will flush.

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.730 align:middle line:84%
That's the situation
you're looking at-- really,

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:54.530 align:middle line:90%
really severe.

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:55.446 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It really is.

00:10:55.446 --> 00:10:58.580 align:middle line:10%
It's a disaster beyond
anything people can imagine.

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.530 align:middle line:10%
>>STEIN: Now some people
say, well, don't you

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:02.300 align:middle line:10%
worry about the
asteroid hitting us?

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.710 align:middle line:10%
You know, an asteroid
wiped out the dinosaurs

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:06.060 align:middle line:10%
40 million years ago.

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:08.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't worry about a
40 million year event.

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.500 align:middle line:84%
This is an event
that happens once

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:15.530 align:middle line:84%
every generation and a
half and they happen, say,

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:17.100 align:middle line:90%
75 years apart.

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:20.040 align:middle line:84%
Last one was 90 years
ago, 60 years before that.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:20.840 align:middle line:90%
We're overdue.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:26.070 align:middle line:84%
The last time it happened
was before we had a grid.

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:29.590 align:middle line:84%
Nothing we have now is
based on the experience

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:31.900 align:middle line:84%
of the last storm, because
the last storm happened

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.180 align:middle line:84%
before any of this
technology existed;

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:37.460 align:middle line:84%
at least the technology that's
susceptible and vulnerable,

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:38.450 align:middle line:90%
our Achilles heel.

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:39.917 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:11:39.917 --> 00:11:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And Matt, we've been
talking about all kinds

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:45.270 align:middle line:84%
of natural disasters that could
affect our ability to survive.

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:47.780 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:49.500 align:middle line:90%
>>A state of emergency in Nepal.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:53.270 align:middle line:10%
The death toll rises
to more than 2,500.

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:55.990 align:middle line:10%
>>I'm thinking how many
homes are we going to lose?

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:57.920 align:middle line:10%
How many people are
we going to lose?

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.330 align:middle line:90%
>>Using scientific analysis.

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:02.730 align:middle line:84%
>>The forecast was done
as best as it could,

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:06.840 align:middle line:84%
but it still underestimated
the scale of the storm surge.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:10.810 align:middle line:10%
>>All residents in New Orleans
are ordered to evacuate.

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:12.990 align:middle line:84%
For those without
the means to leave,

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:16.240 align:middle line:90%
the city sets up shelters.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:19.280 align:middle line:84%
Many locals simply hunker
down in their homes

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:23.310 align:middle line:84%
and prepare to
weather the storm.

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:26.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And Matt, that was tame
compared to what could happen.

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:26.990 align:middle line:90%
>>STEIN: Totally.

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:31.290 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at a number of
possible game-changing events

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:33.110 align:middle line:84%
that collapse the
world as we know it,

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:34.960 align:middle line:84%
where you're looking
long-term things

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.480 align:middle line:84%
are down, where you
don't have the cavalry

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.140 align:middle line:90%
to come in to save you.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:43.170 align:middle line:84%
Like in New Orleans, we
had the National Guard.

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:45.330 align:middle line:84%
The rest of the country
was still together.

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:48.100 align:middle line:84%
Now imagine a scenario
where the entire country

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.950 align:middle line:84%
is crippled like
New Orleans was,

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:52.680 align:middle line:90%
and there's no cavalry coming.

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:57.110 align:middle line:10%
The U.S. Government
had a tabletop exercise

00:12:57.110 --> 00:13:01.520 align:middle line:10%
a few years ago, where
they brought in the best

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.350 align:middle line:10%
first responders
from the military

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:05.630 align:middle line:10%
and the private sectors,
and they showed them

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:09.335 align:middle line:10%
the scenarios we discussed of
the electromagnetic events.

00:13:09.335 --> 00:13:13.240 align:middle line:84%
And in that case, they
basically said, wow,

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:17.140 align:middle line:90%
we can't deal with this.

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:19.140 align:middle line:10%
We're going to end up
going home to protect

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:22.260 align:middle line:10%
our families from
the marauding hordes,

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.502 align:middle line:10%
from people who are pillaging
and people who are--

00:13:25.502 --> 00:13:26.460 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's survival.

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:27.280 align:middle line:10%
>>STEIN: --breaking into things.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:28.080 align:middle line:10%
It's survival.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.287 align:middle line:10%
And they realized that
in a situation like that,

00:13:31.287 --> 00:13:33.370 align:middle line:10%
they didn't have the central
services to help out.

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:35.828 align:middle line:84%
They'd just go home and they
would deal with their families

00:13:35.828 --> 00:13:38.760 align:middle line:84%
and protect their
families first.

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:40.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's
frightening to think

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:42.810 align:middle line:90%
it's a realistic possibility.

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And what concerns me
as well, after being

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:48.570 align:middle line:84%
in the Navy for nine years, that
when we're weak and vulnerable,

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:52.660 align:middle line:84%
if something like this
happens and our guard is down,

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:56.520 align:middle line:84%
what's to prevent some rogue
nation or some nation that

00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:01.800 align:middle line:84%
hates us to attack us when
we have a problem like this?

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.150 align:middle line:84%
>>STEIN: I think that when
we have a problem like this,

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:08.110 align:middle line:84%
it will either have been
nature who's attacked us

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:10.860 align:middle line:84%
and they won't care,
or a rogue nation

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:15.620 align:middle line:84%
will have generated the EMP
that caused the problem.

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:18.260 align:middle line:84%
In my mind, my big
fear-- people say, well,

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:19.680 align:middle line:90%
what keeps you awake at night?

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And my big fear is not so much a
place like a country like Iran.

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:28.830 align:middle line:84%
I think that they want a nuclear
bomb as a deterrent to Israel

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:31.450 align:middle line:84%
because they feel
very vulnerable.

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:34.120 align:middle line:84%
I think it's more a
place like Pakistan

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.230 align:middle line:84%
where they've been
infiltrated at the highest

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:40.620 align:middle line:84%
levels with Islamic
fundamentalists,

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:42.950 align:middle line:84%
both in the government
and the military.

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And the concern there is that
they have the third largest

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:47.320 align:middle line:90%
nuclear arsenal in the world.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.740 align:middle line:84%
They have all of the
engineers and scientists there

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:51.870 align:middle line:84%
who are trained
with the technology.

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And the thought that someone,
perhaps a rich oil sheik,

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:02.200 align:middle line:84%
might fund a rogue group
within the Pakistan government,

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.760 align:middle line:84%
that they could get the
technology out and launch

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.390 align:middle line:84%
an EMP attack on
the United States.

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:08.556 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't necessarily
know where it's coming from.

00:15:08.556 --> 00:15:10.692 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't have a
country's label on it.

00:15:10.692 --> 00:15:11.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Could be off a ship.

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:13.890 align:middle line:84%
>>STEIN: And one single event,
and the United States is done.

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:14.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>>STEIN: But on the other
hand, say none of that happens.

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:24.140 align:middle line:90%
Say there is no solar storm.

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:27.730 align:middle line:84%
Say there is no rogue
country that does an EMP

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:30.400 align:middle line:90%
attack in the United States.

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.940 align:middle line:84%
The natural consequences
of the trends in our planet

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:36.680 align:middle line:84%
are collapsing the natural
systems of the planet that

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.610 align:middle line:84%
keep our world
functional and living

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:42.640 align:middle line:84%
for human beings and
mammals on the planet Earth.

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.740 align:middle line:84%
Einstein's been quoted
as saying that it's

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:49.270 align:middle line:84%
insanity to do the same thing
over and over again and expect

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:53.310 align:middle line:84%
a different result. So I wrote
an article a few years ago

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:57.560 align:middle line:84%
called "The perfect Storm-- Six
Trends Converging on Collapse."

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:00.730 align:middle line:10%
And what it is is we've
got six different trends.

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:04.720 align:middle line:10%
They're all headed towards
the bottom on our planet.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.300 align:middle line:10%
Each one could be a
civilization buster all--

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.530 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: All by itself.

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:09.650 align:middle line:10%
>>STEIN: --all by itself.

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:12.040 align:middle line:10%
And yet, all of six of
these are all kind of

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.890 align:middle line:10%
headed deeply downward.

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:15.437 align:middle line:84%
If we don't do
something radically

00:16:15.437 --> 00:16:17.520 align:middle line:84%
different than the way we
do business in our world

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:20.342 align:middle line:84%
right now, at least one
or more of these trends

00:16:20.342 --> 00:16:21.800 align:middle line:84%
is going to hit
the bottom and it's

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.590 align:middle line:90%
going to collapse these systems.

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And the natural
consequences of us

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:28.290 align:middle line:84%
not changing the way we're
doing business in the world

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:31.040 align:middle line:84%
are going to be collapsing our
world, the end of the world

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.780 align:middle line:84%
as we know it, in a
"Mad Max" scenario.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:38.830 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that we can
fix this, but unfortunately,

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:41.130 align:middle line:84%
right now we haven't done
anything significant.

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:45.560 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like that warnings
about the levees in New Orleans

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.620 align:middle line:84%
and not doing
anything to fix it,

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:50.060 align:middle line:84%
only now we're talking about
collapsing the entire world,

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:51.400 align:middle line:90%
the whole planet going down.

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing
massive, record numbers

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:56.850 align:middle line:84%
of extinctions of
plant and animal

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:59.070 align:middle line:84%
species on the planet
because of the changes

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:01.790 align:middle line:84%
that mankind's been doing in
the ecosystems in our planet.

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:06.599 align:middle line:84%
And the extension of this is
that we affect these systems

00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:10.290 align:middle line:84%
so severely that we are
no longer able to support

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:12.190 align:middle line:84%
the massive numbers of
humans on our planet.

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:15.819 align:middle line:84%
And things crash and burn,
and probably most of us

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:16.619 align:middle line:90%
will go away.

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:19.410 align:middle line:84%
So I believe we can
change it, but we so far

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:21.089 align:middle line:84%
have not done
anything significant

00:17:21.089 --> 00:17:22.339 align:middle line:90%
to make those changes happen.

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:25.170 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What are the
six possible collapsible

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:26.450 align:middle line:10%
events that could occur?

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>>STEIN: Well, the six huge
ways we're impacting the planet.

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:33.880 align:middle line:84%
One is we're killing
the world's oceans.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:38.120 align:middle line:84%
Right now, 11 of 15 of the
world's major ocean fisheries

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.790 align:middle line:84%
are either already dead--
like Georges Bank, the richest

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:44.070 align:middle line:84%
fishery in the world,
is basically dead.

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:46.772 align:middle line:84%
They haven't allowed fishing
in it now for 10 or 15 years.

00:17:46.772 --> 00:17:48.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's
not replenishing?

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:50.290 align:middle line:84%
>>STEIN: It's
replenishing slowly.

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:56.450 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is that of every
single major commercial fish

00:17:56.450 --> 00:18:00.930 align:middle line:84%
species in the ocean, every
single one is at least 90%

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:01.750 align:middle line:90%
depleted.

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:05.830 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, if you went
back 50 years in time,

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:09.390 align:middle line:84%
there's one-tenth
or less as many

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:12.980 align:middle line:84%
of those commercial fish species
left in our world's oceans

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:14.830 align:middle line:90%
than there were 50 years ago.

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:15.800 align:middle line:10%
So imagine that.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.610 align:middle line:10%
There was this many
fish 50 years ago,

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:19.050 align:middle line:10%
and now they're down to this.

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:24.090 align:middle line:10%
So what's happening now is
that the world's ocean fishing

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:28.340 align:middle line:10%
fleets are converging on those
places that are still healthy.

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:31.519 align:middle line:10%
And so now instead of
having fishing fleets spread

00:18:31.519 --> 00:18:33.060 align:middle line:10%
all over the world,
now they're going

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:35.226 align:middle line:10%
to those pockets of the
world that are still healthy

00:18:35.226 --> 00:18:36.820 align:middle line:10%
and those are depleting.

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:39.640 align:middle line:10%
Our coral reefs are dying.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:42.960 align:middle line:10%
25% of the world's coral
reefs are already dead.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:49.270 align:middle line:84%
50% are in danger of very
short-term extermination.

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:52.665 align:middle line:84%
We just had a bleaching
event of the most beautiful,

00:18:52.665 --> 00:18:55.040 align:middle line:84%
most amazing coral reefs in
the world-- the Great Barrier

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:56.980 align:middle line:90%
Reef out of Australia.

00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:58.650 align:middle line:90%
And they're bleached.

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:00.200 align:middle line:84%
Most of those
reefs are bleached.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:03.230 align:middle line:84%
It's questionable whether
they will ever come back.

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And if they do come
back short-term,

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:09.420 align:middle line:84%
the trends of the increasing
ocean temperatures

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:11.960 align:middle line:84%
is that long-term it
means they're probably

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.160 align:middle line:90%
going to be dead and gone.

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And huge numbers of the
populations of the world

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:18.870 align:middle line:84%
rely on fish that are born and
spawned and raised in the coral

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:19.670 align:middle line:90%
reefs.

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:21.160 align:middle line:90%
So it's a giant system.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And the reefs are like the
rain forests of the ocean.

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:26.510 align:middle line:10%
They're part of the
carbon oxygen cycle

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:29.630 align:middle line:10%
that keeps the atmosphere
breathable and livable.

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:32.210 align:middle line:10%
And on top of that, we're
acidifying the oceans.

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:34.670 align:middle line:10%
When we burn carbon
into the atmosphere

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:38.260 align:middle line:10%
through our fossil fuels,
burning coal, burning oil,

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.030 align:middle line:10%
deforestation.

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:43.140 align:middle line:10%
Carbon goes in the atmosphere,
the rain combines with it

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:44.620 align:middle line:10%
and makes carbolic acid.

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:46.930 align:middle line:10%
It falls down in the
oceans and into the rivers.

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:50.020 align:middle line:10%
It acidifies the oceans and
the rivers and the lakes.

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And right now the
pH of the ocean

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:55.310 align:middle line:84%
is gradually getting
more and more acidic

00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:58.770 align:middle line:84%
and it's starting to cause
huge failures in shellfish.

00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:03.500 align:middle line:84%
There's places in British
Columbia where giant shellfish

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:06.000 align:middle line:84%
zones where they grow the
shellfish, the scallops

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.950 align:middle line:84%
and the clams, they're
dying because that pH just

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:13.150 align:middle line:84%
changes a tiny little bit
and it disrupts the balance.

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:16.000 align:middle line:84%
They have limestone, they
have calcium structures

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.240 align:middle line:84%
that they rely on, and
the pH dissolves them

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:19.040 align:middle line:90%
and they're dying.

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:20.390 align:middle line:90%
So we're killing the oceans.

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:23.360 align:middle line:84%
The forests-- half of
the world's forests

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:26.710 align:middle line:84%
have disappeared, most of
that in the last 50 years,

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:29.160 align:middle line:84%
and a good part of the
other half of the forests

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.650 align:middle line:90%
are being compromised.

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And the rain forests are being
destroyed at very high rates.

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:37.470 align:middle line:84%
In spite of efforts to stop
it, they're not stopping it.

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:41.630 align:middle line:84%
The next one is a peak
in world oil production.

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:43.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, we've had a
temporary reprieve

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:45.670 align:middle line:90%
because we invented fracking.

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And fracking is very
hard in the environment.

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:50.840 align:middle line:84%
People who live around them
have a lot of cancer rates,

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:54.840 align:middle line:84%
animals die, with wells polluted
from fracking, earthquakes.

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:57.600 align:middle line:84%
But the truth of fracking is
it's a short-term reprieve.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.900 align:middle line:84%
It made the United States
a big producer of oil.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:03.550 align:middle line:90%
We're still importing oil.

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:05.460 align:middle line:84%
We're the number
one consumer of oil.

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:07.020 align:middle line:90%
So we're still importing oil.

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:09.690 align:middle line:84%
Even though we're making more
oil than anyone right now,

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:11.440 align:middle line:90%
we still have to import it.

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.570 align:middle line:10%
But the truth of fracking
is that these wells

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:16.220 align:middle line:10%
have a very short life span-- a
very expensive, very short life

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:17.370 align:middle line:10%
span.

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:20.530 align:middle line:10%
Tar sands-- very hard
on the environment.

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:24.360 align:middle line:10%
In the old days, you could
have a gusher in Texas.

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.650 align:middle line:10%
You could have 100
to one energy return

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:30.100 align:middle line:10%
on energy invested, meaning
that you'd burn a barrel of oil

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:32.850 align:middle line:10%
to get 100 barrels of
oil out of the ground.

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:36.140 align:middle line:10%
When you have a tar sand,
you get about three to one.

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:38.230 align:middle line:84%
You burn a barrel of
oil to get three barrels

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:39.475 align:middle line:90%
of oil out of the ground.

00:21:39.475 --> 00:21:40.725 align:middle line:90%
Terrible return on investment.

00:21:40.725 --> 00:21:41.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not very profitable.

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:43.370 align:middle line:84%
>>STEIN: A lot goes up
into the atmosphere.

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:45.530 align:middle line:10%
So we're looking at
without oil, until we

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:47.290 align:middle line:10%
change our technologies,
we're looking

00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:49.290 align:middle line:10%
at a very disruptive thing.

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:54.510 align:middle line:10%
So what we found was, 2008
when oil went to $140 a barrel,

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:57.240 align:middle line:10%
the economy couldn't stand it
and just totally collapsed.

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And now every time oil gets
a little more expensive,

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:02.150 align:middle line:84%
the economy starts
tanking again.

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And we're looking at where
most of the record number

00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:06.120 align:middle line:84%
of bankruptcies in
the oil business.

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.779 align:middle line:84%
Because fracking to
get that extra oil out

00:22:08.779 --> 00:22:10.320 align:middle line:84%
in the United States
is so expensive,

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.980 align:middle line:84%
with the price of
oil these days,

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:16.240 align:middle line:84%
it costs more to make fracked
oil than you can sell it for.

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.420 align:middle line:84%
So that's another
area of problem.

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:21.490 align:middle line:90%


00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:23.490 align:middle line:90%
The climate change is a big one.

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:25.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's some debate--
not much debate, really.

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:29.830 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the scientific
consensus, about 98%

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:31.600 align:middle line:84%
of the scientific
studies say that, yes,

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.760 align:middle line:84%
climate change is happening,
and yes, it's man-made.

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:41.480 align:middle line:10%
In fact, recently there was
a big brouhaha in the press

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:43.960 align:middle line:10%
because it turned
out that Chevron

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:47.100 align:middle line:10%
knew about climate change and
believed in climate change

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:50.200 align:middle line:10%
back as early as the 1970s
and they suppressed it.

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And not only did they suppress
it, they paid scientists.

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:56.620 align:middle line:84%
Like the tobacco industry
had paid scientists

00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:59.940 align:middle line:84%
to say that smoking was
OK, the oil industry has

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:03.240 align:middle line:84%
paid scientists to come
out and say climate change

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:06.230 align:middle line:84%
isn't happening, the data's not
conclusive, it's not happening.

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:09.810 align:middle line:84%
But the truth of the matter is,
98% of those scientific studies

00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:11.660 align:middle line:90%
say it is happening.

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:15.160 align:middle line:84%
So climate change is
causing lots of problems,

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.670 align:middle line:90%
geopolitically.

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:20.270 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the Arab
Spring and the revolution that

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:25.350 align:middle line:84%
happened in Egypt,
they had long droughts.

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:28.520 align:middle line:84%
People came from the
farms into the cities

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.980 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't
have the water anymore,

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:33.320 align:middle line:84%
and there was famine and
food prices are going up.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.590 align:middle line:84%
If you look at Syria, the
same thing happened in Syria.

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:41.830 align:middle line:84%
Syria had been one of the
more relaxed Middle Eastern

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:43.610 align:middle line:84%
countries, where
women were educated--

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:44.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:46.050 align:middle line:90%
They were very progressive.

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:47.220 align:middle line:84%
>>STEIN: They were
pretty progressive

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:48.790 align:middle line:84%
and they allowed
different religions

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:51.230 align:middle line:90%
to coexist within their country.

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:56.390 align:middle line:84%
But the climate change
caused a 10-year drought.

00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:59.060 align:middle line:84%
There was famine and poverty,
and it drove people out

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:01.040 align:middle line:84%
of the hill country
and into the cities.

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And that brought
about the unrest,

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:04.780 align:middle line:84%
and it brought about
the revolution.

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And then when there was
a civil war started,

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:11.310 align:middle line:84%
the generals looked at
what happened in Egypt

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:13.590 align:middle line:84%
and said to Assad,
said, hey, we've

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:15.700 align:middle line:84%
gotta to be really
hard on these people.

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.280 align:middle line:10%
We don't want to
end up like Egypt.

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:19.570 align:middle line:10%
And so it made this just
horrible, horrible thing.

00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:21.890 align:middle line:10%
So what's happening
now with climate change

00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:24.350 align:middle line:10%
is we're going to see
failed states more

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:26.170 align:middle line:10%
and more throughout the world.

00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:28.370 align:middle line:84%
And the refugees from
those failed states

00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:31.060 align:middle line:84%
are trying to leave
and find a way

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:32.919 align:middle line:84%
to live in the world
is going to be crushing

00:24:32.919 --> 00:24:35.210 align:middle line:84%
on the rest of the countries
that are still doing well,

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:37.420 align:middle line:84%
like the EU and
the United States.

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:40.210 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just somebody else's
problem in somebody else's

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:41.010 align:middle line:90%
neighborhood.

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Now it's our problem, because
millions and millions of people

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:45.785 align:middle line:84%
are on the road,
desperate, leaving

00:24:45.785 --> 00:24:47.910 align:middle line:84%
the countries they're in
that are failing and going

00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:49.070 align:middle line:90%
to another country.

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:51.486 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Matt, we're going to
go through some of the items

00:24:51.486 --> 00:24:54.360 align:middle line:84%
that you brought us here to get
us through natural disasters.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:57.030 align:middle line:84%
But let's take a look,
first of all, because water

00:24:57.030 --> 00:25:00.060 align:middle line:90%
is critical to all of us.

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:03.100 align:middle line:84%
>>STEIN: It's going to take
some effort and some time.

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:07.240 align:middle line:84%
But you can see I'm pumping
out of kind of a scummy stream

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:10.640 align:middle line:90%
here, sort of swamp water.

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:20.846 align:middle line:84%
And I get perfectly
good, drinkable water.

00:25:20.846 --> 00:25:23.330 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Matt, I can't
believe you drank water out

00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:24.970 align:middle line:10%
of a pond like that.

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:26.100 align:middle line:90%
>>STEIN: Not only a pond.

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:28.010 align:middle line:84%
That's a San Francisco
Bay Area pond

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:32.634 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of houses and septic
tanks upstream from that pond.

00:25:32.634 --> 00:25:34.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you felt
comfortable drinking out

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:34.910 align:middle line:90%
of that?

00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:35.490 align:middle line:90%
>>STEIN: Totally.

00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:36.350 align:middle line:90%
Totally comfortable.

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:37.808 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
about this filter.

00:25:37.808 --> 00:25:38.660 align:middle line:90%
>>STEIN: OK.

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:42.315 align:middle line:84%
So this is a bacteriostatic
filter from MSR.

00:25:42.315 --> 00:25:43.540 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Hold it straight up.

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:48.710 align:middle line:10%
>>STEIN: And this is
a standard in people

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:50.890 align:middle line:10%
traveling in Nepal, Himalayas.

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:55.660 align:middle line:84%
These are places where there's
no high tech sewage control.

00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:58.740 align:middle line:84%
So most of the population is
living with giardia in them.

00:25:58.740 --> 00:25:59.750 align:middle line:90%
They have diarrhea.

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:02.430 align:middle line:84%
It's a regular thing--
giardia, dysentery.

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And so with this filter, you
can put it in a scummy ditch

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:10.520 align:middle line:84%
and then you can get clean,
pure, good tasting drinking

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:12.390 align:middle line:84%
water out of it
that's totally safe.

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:15.010 align:middle line:90%
Now, water is so important.

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:18.340 align:middle line:84%
Three days without water, if you
have to be physically active,

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:20.182 align:middle line:90%
and people start dying.

00:26:20.182 --> 00:26:21.640 align:middle line:84%
That's a very short
period of time.

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:25.050 align:middle line:84%
Most of us could live a
month or more without food.

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:26.550 align:middle line:90%
You may not feel good.

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:27.650 align:middle line:90%
You may not like it.

00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:28.110 align:middle line:90%
But you can do it.

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:28.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
going to lose weight.

00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:29.670 align:middle line:84%
>>STEIN: You're
going to lose weight.

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:30.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But you could live.

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:30.710 align:middle line:90%
>>STEIN: That's right.

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:31.560 align:middle line:90%
But you can live.

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:32.870 align:middle line:90%
But without water, you can't.

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And water is so
important, so I like

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:37.860 align:middle line:84%
to have multiple things
in my grab-and-go kit.

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:41.430 align:middle line:84%
And my grab-and-go kit
allows me to pick up

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:46.440 align:middle line:84%
my backpack with my
stuff in it and hike down

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:47.840 align:middle line:90%
the road if I have to.

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:50.245 align:middle line:84%
Now, naturally I'd rather
throw everything in my car.

00:26:50.245 --> 00:26:51.880 align:middle line:84%
I have a nice
four-wheel drive truck.

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:53.570 align:middle line:84%
I have a big trailer
with a solar panel.

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:55.040 align:middle line:90%
I'd much rather do that.

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:57.510 align:middle line:84%
But I live in a place
in the high Sierras

00:26:57.510 --> 00:27:00.130 align:middle line:84%
that's earthquake country
and wildfire country.

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:02.250 align:middle line:84%
So in the worst case
scenario, it's summer,

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:03.900 align:middle line:90%
an earthquake hits.

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:06.900 align:middle line:84%
The bridges on both
sides of me go down.

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:09.780 align:middle line:84%
Fires break out, typically
with earthquakes.

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Water heaters and
things fall over,

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:14.020 align:middle line:84%
gas lines break,
fires break out.

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:17.550 align:middle line:84%
So if there's a big
fire coming my way

00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:19.840 align:middle line:84%
and I can't get in my truck
and go either direction

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:21.420 align:middle line:84%
because the bridges
are out, I've

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:23.190 align:middle line:84%
got to be able to
put things in my pack

00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:25.330 align:middle line:84%
and go down by
the river and have

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:28.610 align:middle line:84%
what I need to live for a few
days 'til whatever happens,

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:30.750 align:middle line:84%
you know, the cavalry
comes and saves me.

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:34.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, water's so important,
so this is my SteriPEN.

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:37.190 align:middle line:84%
And you could see in the
film that it took some time

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:38.770 align:middle line:90%
to pump that water.

00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:40.230 align:middle line:84%
You can also
chemically treat it.

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:42.880 align:middle line:84%
But if it's cold water and you
have Clorox bleach, about 10

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.800 align:middle line:90%
drops of water in a quart.

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.490 align:middle line:84%
If it's warm water, that's
good in about a half hour.

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:49.580 align:middle line:84%
If it's chilly water,
you got to let it sit

00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:50.970 align:middle line:90%
an hour to kill all the bugs.

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:53.190 align:middle line:84%
If it's ice cold water,
it takes four hours.

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And there's certain
nasty bugs that even

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:57.010 align:middle line:90%
Clorox bleach won't kill.

00:27:57.010 --> 00:27:59.820 align:middle line:84%
But if it's clear water,
I take this SteriPEN

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:02.470 align:middle line:84%
in-- it's kind of like the
little pen in "Men In Black"

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:05.440 align:middle line:84%
when he gives the flashy thing
and their memory goes away.

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:08.380 align:middle line:84%
I stick it in the water
and I stir it around.

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:10.620 align:middle line:84%
And when these
sensors detect water,

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:12.870 align:middle line:84%
that it's submerged
in there, a blue light

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:15.602 align:middle line:84%
goes on and in 15 seconds
all the bugs are dead.

00:28:15.602 --> 00:28:17.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So when you
stick that in there,

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:18.226 align:middle line:90%
what does it do, Matt?

00:28:18.226 --> 00:28:20.390 align:middle line:84%
>>STEIN: When you stick
it in there like this,

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:23.240 align:middle line:84%
the blue light goes off
and you stir it around.

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's a UV sterilizing light
and it kills all the bugs.

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And you stir it so to make sure
the water circulates around

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:32.220 align:middle line:84%
so if there's little
tiny particles

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:34.730 align:middle line:84%
that the light gets behind
those and kills them.

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:39.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, all bets are off-- if you
have some scummy, green water,

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:41.029 align:middle line:90%
don't use your SteriPEN.

00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:42.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's for the filter.

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.950 align:middle line:90%
>>STEIN: You need the filter.

00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:46.220 align:middle line:84%
And if you're really
scared about the water,

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:48.760 align:middle line:84%
like, there's some nasty thing
and you see people dropping

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:52.840 align:middle line:84%
dead around you, then I'd
filter it first so it's clear,

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:55.070 align:middle line:84%
and then double hit
it with the SteriPEN.

00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And then anything that survived
the filter, if there's a virus,

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:02.120 align:middle line:84%
this filter will get most of
the viruses and all the bacteria

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:04.710 align:middle line:84%
and all the protozoa
out of the water.

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:06.960 align:middle line:84%
But the ones that are super
fine that filter viruses--

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.543 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's what
you use that for.

00:29:08.543 --> 00:29:09.920 align:middle line:84%
>>STEIN: --they
plug up too fast.

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:12.890 align:middle line:84%
In this one, you can take it
apart and field service it.

00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:16.290 align:middle line:84%
The first time you put your
viral filter in a scummy ditch,

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:18.470 align:middle line:84%
it's probably going to
be plugged and worthless.

00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:19.470 align:middle line:90%
That's why I like this.

00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:22.325 align:middle line:84%
Because without any hand
tools, you can field service it

00:29:22.325 --> 00:29:23.670 align:middle line:90%
and get it going again.

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:25.020 align:middle line:90%
And then this is my backup.

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:27.790 align:middle line:84%
If I'm really worried, like,
some scary thing that's

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:29.800 align:middle line:84%
killing people, I'll
zap it with this

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:31.190 align:middle line:84%
after I've filtered
it with that.

00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:33.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why don't you
always do that anyway?

00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:34.761 align:middle line:90%
>>STEIN: Well--

00:29:34.761 --> 00:29:36.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It won't hurt, right?

00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:37.000 align:middle line:90%
>>STEIN: It won't hurt.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.920 align:middle line:84%
When my daughter went to
Africa with her future husband,

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:47.090 align:middle line:84%
they went to Tanzania and he
was working in a medical clinic.

00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And they went up Kilimanjaro
and she took my SteriPEN.

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And she religiously
used the SteriPEN,

00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:53.677 align:middle line:90%
and not everybody did.

00:29:53.677 --> 00:29:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And she's the only one who
didn't get sick in the group.

00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:57.010 align:middle line:90%
She SteriPENed--

00:29:57.010 --> 00:29:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:59.730 align:middle line:84%
>>STEIN: --everything that she
drank, and she never got sick.

00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:00.810 align:middle line:90%
Everybody else got sick.

00:30:00.810 --> 00:30:02.360 align:middle line:90%
They all got dysentery.

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:04.297 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
is that called?

00:30:04.297 --> 00:30:05.630 align:middle line:90%
>>STEIN: A SteriPEN right there.

00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:06.556 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: SteriPEN.

00:30:06.556 --> 00:30:08.130 align:middle line:90%
>>STEIN: And it sterilizes it.

00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:11.160 align:middle line:84%
And you can get these things in
any kind of back country store,

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:15.480 align:middle line:84%
like an REI, a Cabela's,
an Eastern Mountain Shorts.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And also online I have,
on whentechfails.com,

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:22.950 align:middle line:84%
I have an article
posted on my website

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:25.620 align:middle line:84%
called "Building the
Ultimate Survival Kit."

00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:27.700 align:middle line:84%
So if you go to that
article, then you'll

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:31.490 align:middle line:84%
see all of these items and many
more than I can show you today,

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:34.500 align:middle line:84%
and they're all guaranteed
high quality things.

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not selling
anything directly.

00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:37.649 align:middle line:90%
They're just links to buy them.

00:30:37.649 --> 00:30:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And you can know that it's
stuff that I recommend

00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:41.090 align:middle line:84%
and it's high quality
and will do the job.

00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:43.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But people should
put a pack together, right?

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:46.530 align:middle line:90%
>>STEIN: I highly recommend it.

00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:50.670 align:middle line:84%
A go bag, they call it
a 72-hour survival kit.

00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:53.590 align:middle line:84%
And it covers your
food, your clothing,

00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:56.530 align:middle line:84%
your shelter, any
medicines you might need,

00:30:56.530 --> 00:30:59.670 align:middle line:84%
prescription medicines,
your entertainment,

00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:01.220 align:middle line:90%
maybe a deck of cards.

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:04.010 align:middle line:84%
Something so that you
can put it on your back,

00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:06.350 align:middle line:84%
or hopefully you can
throw in your car,

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:08.160 align:middle line:84%
and you and your
family will have

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:09.820 align:middle line:84%
what they need for
at least three days

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:10.861 align:middle line:90%
until things settle down.

00:31:10.861 --> 00:31:12.950 align:middle line:84%
Like, if you look
at Kobe, Japan,

00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:15.050 align:middle line:84%
it was a week or more
before most people

00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:17.360 align:middle line:90%
had any kind of relief.

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:19.030 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
Hurricane Katrina,

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:22.080 align:middle line:84%
it was about three or four days
before they got much relief.

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:25.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long do
you plan for this?

00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:26.599 align:middle line:90%
I mean, if a grid goes down--

00:31:26.599 --> 00:31:27.931 align:middle line:90%
>>STEIN: If the grid goes down--

00:31:27.931 --> 00:31:29.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It could
be indefinitely.

00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:33.670 align:middle line:84%
>>STEIN: If the grid goes down,
you're talking months to years

00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:35.750 align:middle line:90%
before life's back to normal.

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And it may never come
back to totally normal.

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:42.260 align:middle line:90%
It depends on how bad.

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:46.270 align:middle line:84%
For instance,
long-term grid down

00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:51.820 align:middle line:84%
can cause-- nuclear power plants
must keep themselves cooled.

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:53.017 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:31:53.017 --> 00:31:54.850 align:middle line:84%
>>STEIN: It's not like
turning a switch off.

00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:55.975 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They'll melt down.

00:31:55.975 --> 00:31:58.240 align:middle line:84%
>>STEIN: So when a nuclear
power plant loses the grid,

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:00.850 align:middle line:84%
it goes into emergency
shutdown mode.

00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And backup generators come in,
and those backup generators

00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:05.250 align:middle line:90%
are run on fuel.

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:06.850 align:middle line:90%
They're run on diesel fuel.

00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:10.810 align:middle line:84%
And if those generators
fail, they run out of gas,

00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:14.310 align:middle line:84%
then the pumps stop running
that keeps nuclear power plant--

00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:15.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Cooled.

00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:18.660 align:middle line:84%
>>STEIN: --cool, and then you
have a Fukushima-like event.

00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:20.980 align:middle line:84%
Apparently in Fukushima,
the earthquake

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:24.890 align:middle line:84%
itself did not cause the
meltdowns in the reactors.

00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:28.110 align:middle line:84%
What happened is the
earthquake took down the grid.

00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:31.420 align:middle line:84%
So all four-- they had four
out of the six reactors

00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:33.240 align:middle line:90%
in Fukushima were operating.

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:35.740 align:middle line:84%
So all four reactors
went into emergency mode

00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:38.005 align:middle line:84%
where the generators kicked
in, the pumps kicked in,

00:32:38.005 --> 00:32:39.380 align:middle line:84%
and they started
keeping it cool.

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:40.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They all
worked for a while.

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:41.730 align:middle line:90%
>>STEIN: They all worked.

00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:43.870 align:middle line:84%
20 minutes later the
tsunami came along--

00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:46.804 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And wiped it out.

00:32:46.804 --> 00:32:49.610 align:middle line:84%
>>STEIN: Five out of the six
banks of generators and pumps

00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:50.410 align:middle line:90%
were wiped out.

00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:54.580 align:middle line:84%
One of those was on the uphill
side of the power plant,

00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:56.300 align:middle line:90%
and it stayed operating.

00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:59.800 align:middle line:84%
The other five out of
six generator banks

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:02.330 align:middle line:90%
were wiped out by the tsunami.

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:03.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The perfect storm.

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:04.320 align:middle line:90%
>>STEIN: Right.

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:07.280 align:middle line:84%
So two of those reactors
went into full meltdown.

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:10.600 align:middle line:84%
One of the reactors was
kept cool by the pumps.

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And then they shuttled power
from one reactor to the next,

00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:16.320 align:middle line:84%
and they only had
a partial meltdown.

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:19.660 align:middle line:84%
So the problem with a
long-term down scenario,

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:23.750 align:middle line:84%
like a solar storm or an
EMP, is that they only

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:27.580 align:middle line:84%
have mandated to keep a
week of backup fuel on hand.

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:30.110 align:middle line:84%
So in the long-term
grid down scenario,

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:33.820 align:middle line:84%
you're looking at not only the
disruption of your daily life,

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:36.650 align:middle line:84%
you're also looking at the
potential for these power

00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:40.250 align:middle line:84%
plants-- 104, now down to
98 in the United States

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:43.350 align:middle line:84%
operating nuclear power
plants-- running out of fuel,

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:47.120 align:middle line:84%
melting down, multiple
Fukushima-like events happening

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:50.500 align:middle line:90%
across the United States.

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:53.940 align:middle line:84%
In some of these
worst case scenarios,

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:57.260 align:middle line:84%
we're never coming back and
you're going to be on your own.

00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:01.330 align:middle line:10%
Now, in the vision
I saw back in 1997

00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:04.340 align:middle line:10%
when I was instructed by
some higher power-- it never

00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:07.250 align:middle line:10%
identified itself-- to write
this book that became "When

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:12.150 align:middle line:10%
Technology Fails," I was
shown a long-term collapse

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:15.110 align:middle line:10%
where the electricity, the
water, none of that stuff

00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:16.500 align:middle line:10%
was working for a long time.

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:20.270 align:middle line:10%
And I realized that even though
I have a bachelor of science

00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:24.739 align:middle line:10%
from MIT, I have cast metal
the old-fashioned way,

00:34:24.739 --> 00:34:28.780 align:middle line:10%
I've machined parts in a mill
and a lave, I've blown glass,

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:30.520 align:middle line:10%
I've done pit-fired pottery.

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:32.270 align:middle line:84%
Even though I've done
all of those things,

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:36.320 align:middle line:84%
I've been an outdoor enthusiast,
survived 10-day solo trips

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:38.310 align:middle line:84%
through the High Sierras
in below zero weather

00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:40.296 align:middle line:90%
at night in the deep snows.

00:34:40.296 --> 00:34:42.420 align:middle line:84%
With all of those skills
and all of that knowledge,

00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:44.760 align:middle line:84%
I realized if I was dropped
in the middle of the Amazon,

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:47.589 align:middle line:84%
I could not replicate anything
from our modern world.

00:34:47.589 --> 00:34:48.469 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:34:48.469 --> 00:34:51.360 align:middle line:84%
>>STEIN: So in putting together
"When Technology Fails,"

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:55.130 align:middle line:84%
I looked at the
old-fashioned technologies

00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:59.500 align:middle line:84%
that, in our grandparents'
day, somebody in every town

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:01.670 align:middle line:84%
knew how to make or
fabricate whatever

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:04.994 align:middle line:84%
was needed for a reasonable
standard of living.

00:35:04.994 --> 00:35:06.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, I realize
that none of us are

00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:09.240 align:middle line:84%
going to be able to
replicate an electronic chip.

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.600 align:middle line:90%
We just simply can't do that.

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:11.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:14.090 align:middle line:84%
>>STEIN: But we can replicate
the technologies of Abraham

00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:16.460 align:middle line:84%
Lincoln's days and
the technologies

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:18.860 align:middle line:90%
of George Washington's days.

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:20.970 align:middle line:84%
So in "When Technology
Fails," I tried

00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:23.720 align:middle line:84%
to give the basics of how
to do all of those things

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:26.910 align:middle line:84%
so that if things
really fell apart,

00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:28.930 align:middle line:84%
not only could you
survive the short-term,

00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:31.470 align:middle line:84%
but in the long-term,
you could go back

00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:34.320 align:middle line:84%
at least to the pioneering
day technologies.

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:36.360 align:middle line:84%
Because most of us don't
know how to do that.

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:38.960 align:middle line:84%
In our grandparents' day, people
knew that stuff; nowadays,

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:39.760 align:middle line:90%
they don't.

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:44.540 align:middle line:84%
So I tried to replicate that
so people could cope long-term.

00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:45.830 align:middle line:90%
And I hope it never happens.

00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:49.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm not somebody who's
looking forward to a "Mad Max"

00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:51.450 align:middle line:90%
scenario or survivalist thing.

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:53.980 align:middle line:84%
I really don't want to
ever have to shoot anybody.

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:56.550 align:middle line:84%
I hope I never have to
shoot somebody in my life.

00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:58.380 align:middle line:84%
But I acknowledge
the possibility

00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:03.470 align:middle line:84%
that current trends indicate it
may and probably will happen.

00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:05.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Matt,
what's the tape for?

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>>STEIN: This is probably
the most important item

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:10.280 align:middle line:90%
in your grab-and-go kit.

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:13.880 align:middle line:84%
This is inch and a half
cloth athletic tape.

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:16.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, what do you
see in a disaster?

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.410 align:middle line:84%
You see people
walking down the road.

00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:19.895 align:middle line:84%
If it's not that
big of a disaster,

00:36:19.895 --> 00:36:21.770 align:middle line:84%
they're in their cars,
and they're in hotels,

00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:23.140 align:middle line:90%
and they're in buses.

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:27.400 align:middle line:84%
But in real disasters--
you look at Kobe, Japan,

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:30.866 align:middle line:84%
you look at Fukushima, you look
at different places-- people

00:36:30.866 --> 00:36:31.990 align:middle line:90%
are walking down the roads.

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:34.425 align:middle line:84%
Now, most of us,
if you're not used

00:36:34.425 --> 00:36:36.550 align:middle line:84%
to doing this all the time,
what's going to happen?

00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:37.860 align:middle line:84%
You walk a couple
miles down the road,

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:39.276 align:middle line:84%
your feet are going
to blister up,

00:36:39.276 --> 00:36:41.870 align:middle line:84%
and then those blisters pop
and you're going nowhere.

00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:44.520 align:middle line:84%
So what you do is, when you
feel the hot spots on your feet,

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:46.310 align:middle line:90%
you pull out your roll of tape.

00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:49.460 align:middle line:84%
You take a little bit off
and you use the sticky side

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:53.260 align:middle line:84%
to scrub the scummy grease
and dirt off of your heels.

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:54.820 align:middle line:84%
You tape your
heels, or your toes,

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:56.140 align:middle line:90%
or wherever you have a problem.

00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:58.850 align:middle line:84%
Put your shoes and socks back
on and you're in business.

00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:00.810 align:middle line:84%
You get a sprained ankle,
you can tape it up.

00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:02.390 align:middle line:84%
You get a wound,
you can tape it up.

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:06.380 align:middle line:84%
So this is probably the most
important item in the kit.

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the
other most important items,

00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:11.114 align:middle line:90%
because in a real disaster--

00:37:11.114 --> 00:37:12.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like a
little TV antennae.

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:13.580 align:middle line:90%
>>STEIN: Yeah.

00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:17.860 align:middle line:84%
What this is is you put this
into a big canteen or water

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:20.980 align:middle line:84%
bottle, and you turn this
on-- it's a nine volt battery,

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:23.680 align:middle line:84%
and I have a 12 volt
adapter-- and this

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:24.990 align:middle line:90%
makes colloidal silver.

00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:26.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah, kills germs, right?

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:27.410 align:middle line:90%
>>STEIN: It kills germs.

00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:29.630 align:middle line:90%
So what you have is broadband.

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:30.600 align:middle line:90%
It kills germs.

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:35.376 align:middle line:84%
It may even help with viruses,
and it'll purify water

00:37:35.376 --> 00:37:36.500 align:middle line:90%
over a long period of time.

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:40.710 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly, if you
drink a quart of this a day--

00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:42.910 align:middle line:84%
and you can make that
in about 15 minutes--

00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:45.880 align:middle line:84%
if there's some really
nasty bug going on,

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:48.670 align:middle line:90%
you will probably kill that bug.

00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:51.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, 2,000 years ago,
Alexander the Great

00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:53.940 align:middle line:84%
didn't know anything
about germ theory.

00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:56.800 align:middle line:84%
But he knew that if he
stored water for his troops

00:37:56.800 --> 00:38:00.010 align:middle line:84%
in silver urns that his
troops didn't get sick.

00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:03.410 align:middle line:84%
And a warrior on a battlefield
that had dysentery and was

00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:07.510 align:middle line:84%
vomiting was a dead warrior,
but a warrior who was healthy

00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:08.830 align:middle line:90%
stood a good chance.

00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:13.200 align:middle line:84%
So nowadays they've discovered
that tiny charred silver

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:17.900 align:middle line:84%
particles have this almost
magical property of being

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:21.440 align:middle line:84%
deadly to all known
toxic bacteria,

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:23.430 align:middle line:90%
but not harmful to human beings.

00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:25.917 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's plenty of
metals that kill bacteria,

00:38:25.917 --> 00:38:27.250 align:middle line:90%
but they're also bad for people.

00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:27.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:30.340 align:middle line:84%
>>STEIN: Silver is the one
metal that kills the bacteria

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:32.120 align:middle line:90%
but is not bad for people.

00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, the same
extra thick cellular wall

00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:37.960 align:middle line:84%
that your probiotic
bacteria that's

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:40.620 align:middle line:84%
so essential to good
digestion and to assimilating

00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:44.070 align:middle line:84%
your food, the same extra thick
cellular walls that protect

00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:47.180 align:middle line:84%
the probiotic bacteria
from your stomach acids

00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:49.250 align:middle line:84%
also protects them
from the silver.

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:52.850 align:middle line:10%
So it seems kind of like Santa
Claus, and the Tooth Fairy,

00:38:52.850 --> 00:38:55.170 align:middle line:10%
and the Easter Bunny,
like, too good to be true.

00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:58.400 align:middle line:10%
But colloidal silver does
not kill the good bacteria

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:00.520 align:middle line:10%
in your gut, but kills
the bad bacteria, so

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:02.570 align:middle line:10%
a very important
item for your go-bag.

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:04.770 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And lastly,
what is this?

00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:08.202 align:middle line:10%
>>STEIN: Well, it's missing in
the tank which was over there--

00:39:08.202 --> 00:39:09.410 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's a little stove.

00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:11.140 align:middle line:10%
>>STEIN: A portable stove.

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:13.760 align:middle line:10%
And you get a gas bottle
with a little pump

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:17.020 align:middle line:10%
that goes in the gas bottle
and that hooks into this stove.

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:18.060 align:middle line:10%
And this stove--

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:19.310 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Propane?

00:39:19.310 --> 00:39:22.600 align:middle line:84%
>>STEIN: No, it's a white
gas-- which is Coleman fuel,

00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:26.150 align:middle line:84%
or white gas-- and
it folds up tiny.

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is a back
country standard.

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:31.334 align:middle line:84%
Another MSR product, it's
used all over the world.

00:39:31.334 --> 00:39:33.000 align:middle line:84%
And they have a little
different version

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.240 align:middle line:84%
that will burn kerosene, jet
fuel, alcohol, and gasoline

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:38.240 align:middle line:90%
all in one single stove.

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:39.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just to do
some emergency cooking

00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:40.350 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:41.540 align:middle line:84%
>>STEIN: Well, it'll
boil your water.

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:42.890 align:middle line:90%
It'll purify your water.

00:39:42.890 --> 00:39:45.210 align:middle line:84%
It'll melt snow and
it'll cook food.

00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:46.960 align:middle line:84%
So it will do all of
those things for you.

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:49.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Got some emails here
for you, Matt, of the time

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:50.140 align:middle line:90%
we have left.

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Carol from Montana
would like to know

00:39:52.770 --> 00:39:54.980 align:middle line:84%
if there is one future
threat that concerns

00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:57.010 align:middle line:90%
you more than anything else.

00:39:57.010 --> 00:39:58.230 align:middle line:90%
>>STEIN: The two.

00:39:58.230 --> 00:40:01.330 align:middle line:84%
The ecological one
we talked about.

00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:04.010 align:middle line:84%
The solar storm is
guaranteed to happen.

00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:06.787 align:middle line:84%
EMP is possible, but the solar
storm is absolutely guaranteed.

00:40:06.787 --> 00:40:08.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It will happen one day.

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:09.180 align:middle line:90%
>>STEIN: It will happen.

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:11.700 align:middle line:84%
We're overdue, and
that's guaranteed.

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that we have not
protected our nuclear power

00:40:14.450 --> 00:40:17.010 align:middle line:84%
plants so that they're
going to run out of fuel

00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:18.635 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to
start melting down

00:40:18.635 --> 00:40:21.090 align:middle line:84%
and that it's a
fixable problem, I'd

00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:23.200 align:middle line:84%
say that solar storm is
the one thing because it's

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:24.330 align:middle line:90%
so guaranteed to happen.

00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:26.474 align:middle line:90%
That's what I worry about most.

00:40:26.474 --> 00:40:28.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And again, these
items here you think

00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:32.080 align:middle line:84%
are very critically
important in a pack?

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:35.030 align:middle line:84%
>>STEIN: Well, these items
are critically important.

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And I have a list of
about 30 or 40 items

00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:40.100 align:middle line:84%
that is available online
or in both my books,

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:45.460 align:middle line:84%
"When Technology Fails" and
"When Disaster Strikes."

00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:47.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where do
we go in the future?

00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:48.630 align:middle line:90%
What happens next for us?

00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:53.680 align:middle line:84%
>>STEIN: Well, I believe
that human beings have

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:57.900 align:middle line:84%
this amazing ability
to be flexible,

00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:00.352 align:middle line:84%
and that there's a basic
goodness in human beings.

00:41:00.352 --> 00:41:02.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that
humans are basically evil.

00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:04.750 align:middle line:90%
I believe that they're good.

00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:09.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm concerned that the
natural trends on our planet

00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:11.860 align:middle line:84%
are going to
collapse the systems

00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:14.340 align:middle line:84%
and it will kill our planet
as far as human beings are

00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:15.140 align:middle line:90%
concerned.

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:16.500 align:middle line:84%
There will be plenty
of animal life

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:17.874 align:middle line:84%
and different
lives that survive.

00:41:17.874 --> 00:41:22.350 align:middle line:84%
But human beings, maybe none of
us will, maybe some of us will,

00:41:22.350 --> 00:41:25.150 align:middle line:84%
but it won't be in a way
that we look forward to.

00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:27.570 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we can
change this course.

00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:29.840 align:middle line:84%
That we're headed for
the giant train wreck,

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:31.560 align:middle line:84%
we're headed for
collapse, but I believe

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:33.130 align:middle line:90%
that we can change this.

00:41:33.130 --> 00:41:35.260 align:middle line:10%
And I've got a little
list of 10 things

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:39.980 align:middle line:10%
that we must do, I believe, if
we're going to actually avoid

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:41.480 align:middle line:10%
collapsing the planet.

00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:44.990 align:middle line:10%
Now, the hard part
is that it's going

00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:47.140 align:middle line:10%
to require some real
changes and it's

00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:49.306 align:middle line:10%
going to require
cooperation of the planet

00:41:49.306 --> 00:41:50.430 align:middle line:10%
to make the changes happen.

00:41:50.430 --> 00:41:51.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Give us just
a few highlights.

00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:51.670 align:middle line:90%
>>STEIN: OK.

00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:52.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We only have
time for a couple.

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:54.180 align:middle line:84%
>>STEIN: Change
the tax structure.

00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:59.340 align:middle line:84%
We have to make it financially
suicidal for companies to do

00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:02.449 align:middle line:90%
things in nonsustainable ways.

00:42:02.449 --> 00:42:03.990 align:middle line:84%
So we have to penalize
companies that

00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:07.180 align:middle line:84%
are doing things the wrong way,
and support companies doing

00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:08.360 align:middle line:90%
it the right way.

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:10.130 align:middle line:84%
We have to rebuild
our cities and homes

00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:13.360 align:middle line:84%
for maximum sustainability,
for minimum energy use.

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:15.930 align:middle line:84%
We have to rebuild our
railways and our mass transit.

00:42:15.930 --> 00:42:19.250 align:middle line:84%
Because how can we get around
if gas is $10 a gallon,

00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:20.750 align:middle line:90%
or $15 a gallon?

00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:22.480 align:middle line:90%
Rebuild our industries.

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:27.750 align:middle line:84%
We can put America back to work
rebuilding America and leading

00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:30.210 align:middle line:84%
the world in the
sustainability issue.

00:42:30.210 --> 00:42:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Unregulated capitalism-- if
we continue doing business

00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:37.520 align:middle line:84%
in a way that says
the maximum profit

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:41.935 align:middle line:84%
wins, then it will mean
using our natural resources

00:42:41.935 --> 00:42:44.980 align:middle line:84%
of the planet for maximum
profit as fast as possible

00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:46.960 align:middle line:84%
with as little
regulation as possible

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:49.790 align:middle line:84%
so we can make the most money
before the world dies on us.

00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:52.145 align:middle line:84%
And we can't continue
doing business that way.

00:42:52.145 --> 00:42:55.590 align:middle line:84%
We have to fund and support
renewable energy development.

00:42:55.590 --> 00:42:58.890 align:middle line:84%
We have to eliminate
population growth.

00:42:58.890 --> 00:43:01.830 align:middle line:84%
This is a huge one that's
taboo to talk about.

00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:03.520 align:middle line:84%
The reality is
that from the time

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:07.010 align:middle line:84%
Jesus walked the earth until
Abraham Lincoln was born,

00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:10.160 align:middle line:84%
more people were added to
our world in the last decade

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:11.960 align:middle line:84%
than from Jesus to
Abraham Lincoln.

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:12.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's
getting bigger--

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:13.160 align:middle line:84%
>>STEIN: We can't
keep doing that.

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --and
bigger and bigger.

00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:19.150 align:middle line:10%
>>STEIN: We passed the
point of sustainability

00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:22.580 align:middle line:10%
in the planet in 1975, and
we had half the population

00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:24.710 align:middle line:10%
we had then than we have now.

00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:26.730 align:middle line:84%
When I was a kid and
you were a kid in 1960,

00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:28.050 align:middle line:90%
we had three billion people.

00:43:28.050 --> 00:43:30.470 align:middle line:90%
We're up to 7.4 billion now.

00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:35.180 align:middle line:10%
They're projecting in 30 years
it's going to eight to nine,

00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:36.870 align:middle line:10%
possibly a high variant.

00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:39.065 align:middle line:10%
If they don't do things
right, could be 10 or 11.

00:43:39.065 --> 00:43:40.690 align:middle line:10%
I don't honestly
don't think we'll ever

00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:43.030 align:middle line:10%
reach that, because I think
the planet can't stand it.

00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:43.920 align:middle line:84%
I think it's going
to fall apart.

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:45.711 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the
important thing right now,

00:43:45.711 --> 00:43:48.250 align:middle line:84%
Matt, based on what
I'm hearing from you,

00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:52.630 align:middle line:84%
is to get this little ability
taken care of right now.

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:56.151 align:middle line:84%
Put a nice pack together for
an emergency and just be safe.

00:43:56.151 --> 00:43:57.900 align:middle line:10%
Matt, thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

>>STEIN: It's been
such a pleasure,

00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:00.250 align:middle line:10%
and thank you so much.

00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:00.560 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I appreciate it.

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:02.434 align:middle line:10%
>>STEIN: Nice to meet
you, George, in person.

00:44:02.434 --> 00:44:03.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Take the information.

00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:05.100 align:middle line:90%
Store it away.

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:08.080 align:middle line:84%
His book, "When Technology
Strikes will help you

00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:10.820 align:middle line:84%
tremendously,
because we don't know

00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:12.240 align:middle line:90%
how long this could happen.

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:15.850 align:middle line:10%
Could be a day, a
week, a month, a year.

00:44:15.850 --> 00:44:17.690 align:middle line:10%
Protect yourself
and your family.

00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:18.680 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:20.146 align:middle line:90%
This is "Beyond Belief."
