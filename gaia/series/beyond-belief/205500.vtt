was created to know the truth.

JEANEE: Hi.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.980 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: How did you get
involved in remote viewing?

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.990 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: Well, so my director,
he works with the Farsight

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.920 align:middle line:90%
Institute, and he saw me.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.530 align:middle line:90%
I used to be an art model.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.560 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: You were?

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.130 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.670 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: Yeah, I'm an--
oh, I still am, actually.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:04.890 align:middle line:90%
So he used to draw me.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.210 align:middle line:90%
He was a drawer.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.760 align:middle line:10%
And he watched me,
realized I was open-minded,

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.220 align:middle line:10%
and then he goes,
watch this video.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.900 align:middle line:90%
See if you want to do it.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.060 align:middle line:84%
And it took me about
two months to watch it,

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.410 align:middle line:90%
because I was thoroughly bored.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.950 align:middle line:90%

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.680 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: I was
thoroughly bored by it.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.390 align:middle line:90%
But he--

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.265 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: There's not much you can
see on a remote viewing video,

00:01:24.265 --> 00:01:25.065 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:01:25.065 --> 00:01:27.560 align:middle line:84%
You just-- somebody sitting
there meditating or something

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.440 align:middle line:90%
and writing?

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.750 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: Writing on a whiteboard.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- it just
didn't catch my attention,

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:33.780 align:middle line:90%
because I'm like a cat.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.580 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Yeah.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.502 align:middle line:10%
JEANEE: So I have to--

00:01:35.502 --> 00:01:36.960 align:middle line:10%
you know, so I kept
falling asleep.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.080 align:middle line:10%
Eventually I watched it, and I
saw that multiple people were

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.290 align:middle line:10%
getting the same thing, and
they were in different parts

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.090 align:middle line:10%
of the world.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.580 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Right.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:45.538 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: And I started--

00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:47.580 align:middle line:90%
when it got juicy, I guess.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And I-- I was like, OK,
well, I want to try it.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.263 align:middle line:84%
He goes, I'll pay
you to teach you.

00:01:55.263 --> 00:01:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, I just
did it for the money.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.310 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Well, why not?

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.610 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: Whatever.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:59.410 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.230 align:middle line:84%
OK, because I was
cleaning houses.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.990 align:middle line:84%
And when I-- I first started
doing it, I was like, OK.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.670 align:middle line:90%
That was a coincidence.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:08.759 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:09.559 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: You hit it.

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:10.550 align:middle line:90%
You hit it right on.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:11.350 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: Yeah.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.340 align:middle line:84%
It was something
small like a mountain,

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.490 align:middle line:90%
some rivers, some water.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.573 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, coincidence.

00:02:15.573 --> 00:02:16.373 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:02:16.373 --> 00:02:17.870 align:middle line:90%
I believe in coincidences too.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:18.280 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: OK.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.800 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: And then
it happened again.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And then me and
another young lady

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.790 align:middle line:84%
got the same information
at the same time.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:24.590 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: All right.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.310 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: And I think--

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.700 align:middle line:84%
I said, OK, let
me try something.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:33.280 align:middle line:84%
I said-- I said, pick
the target and put it

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.003 align:middle line:84%
beside me closed, because
I do everything blind,

00:02:37.003 --> 00:02:38.170 align:middle line:90%
because I don't believe you.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.470 align:middle line:90%
I just feel like--

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.315 align:middle line:84%
I said, you're waiting
until I get the information.

00:02:40.315 --> 00:02:42.070 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: You thought this
was all mumbo jumbo.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.870 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: Yeah.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.550 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] I said, you're waiting
until I get the information.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:46.510 align:middle line:90%
So he goes, OK.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:47.552 align:middle line:90%
Your target's right here.

00:02:47.552 --> 00:02:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And he sat it in front of me
and covered it up in, like,

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.110 align:middle line:90%
a manila folder.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.400 align:middle line:90%
And I did the whole thing.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.840 align:middle line:84%
And he just pulls it
out and shows it to me.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.640 align:middle line:90%
And I flipped.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.200 align:middle line:90%
I lost it.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.242 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: You were right on.

00:03:00.242 --> 00:03:01.450 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: Right on it.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.730 align:middle line:84%
I started experiencing
so many different things,

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.230 align:middle line:84%
and that's when I
fully believed it.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And I-- and so instead of me
doing it for just the money,

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.780 align:middle line:90%
I became passionate about it.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:12.580 align:middle line:90%
So passionate.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.990 align:middle line:84%
So it all started with
me at an art cafe and--

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.850 align:middle line:84%
and him saying, hey,
you look like you'd be

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.320 align:middle line:90%
interested in this weird crap.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.680 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.513 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: And you were.

00:03:21.513 --> 00:03:22.660 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: And I was.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:23.460 align:middle line:90%
And I was.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.090 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Did it come easy for you?

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.685 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: Well, I won't say
anything is easy or hard.

00:03:27.685 --> 00:03:31.400 align:middle line:90%


00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.040 align:middle line:84%
The hardest part about
remote viewing is letting go.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.840 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Yeah.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.320 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: And so I'm
very analytical.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm a natural-born
scientist, I would say.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.440 align:middle line:84%
Like, I'm looking at theories,
blah, blah, you know?

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.590 align:middle line:84%
So I'm-- numbers and
this and that, and very,

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:47.780 align:middle line:90%
very analytical.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And so it takes a lot for
me to believe in things

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.530 align:middle line:90%
I can't prove.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:53.330 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Right.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:54.788 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: And so I
couldn't prove it.

00:03:54.788 --> 00:03:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And so it was like, no,
that doesn't make sense.

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.070 align:middle line:84%
He goes, stop trying
to make sense.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.070 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Go with the flow.

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.340 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: Just let it go.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.140 align:middle line:90%
Breathe with it.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
hardest part for me.

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.640 align:middle line:84%
So hard or easy
depends on the person.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.620 align:middle line:84%
It depends on if you're able and
ready and willing to just take

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.560 align:middle line:90%
a step back and go, [SIGH].

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.360 align:middle line:90%
And say, OK.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.790 align:middle line:90%
What I get I get.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.600 align:middle line:90%
And go from there.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.450 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Now before we
get really into this,

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.080 align:middle line:84%
tell me about this amazing hedge
piece that you've got up there.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.810 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: This is a
grounding crown.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.130 align:middle line:84%
I have tendencies to
randomly astral project.

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.930 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.160 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Special stones?

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.960 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: Yes.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And so I had someone
make this for me.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.440 align:middle line:90%
I wear copper.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:43.390 align:middle line:84%
Copper-- copper helps with
all kinds of immunities.

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:44.380 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: It's a purifier.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.680 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: Mm-hmm.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.640 align:middle line:90%
It's a purifier.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.250 align:middle line:84%
I have shungite crystals,
which help purify

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.350 align:middle line:90%
your body, your system.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.250 align:middle line:90%
It rids anxiety.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.710 align:middle line:84%
So this is-- I have
very bad anxiety,

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.175 align:middle line:84%
so this helps keep me
grounded and it helps when

00:04:57.175 --> 00:04:58.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm around a lot of people.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.227 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: It's gorgeous.

00:04:59.227 --> 00:05:00.310 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: Thank you so much.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.270 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Can I touch it?

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.145 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: Um, I usually
don't let people, but--

00:05:03.145 --> 00:05:03.945 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:05:03.945 --> 00:05:05.080 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Feel my vibration.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.680 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: Yes.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.480 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: OK.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.290 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: Yes, yes.

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.770 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:09.440 align:middle line:90%
This is beautiful.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.898 align:middle line:84%
This is one of
three crowns I have,

00:05:10.898 --> 00:05:14.440 align:middle line:84%
and this right
here was made by--

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.800 align:middle line:84%
he calls himself
the Drip God Arulu.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.050 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: The Drip God Arulu.

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.780 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: And so this is
what he calls his drip.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.790 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] I was
like, what's drip?

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.267 align:middle line:84%
I'm way out of all the,
like, hip statuses.

00:05:28.267 --> 00:05:29.350 align:middle line:90%
Or what do they call them?

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.240 align:middle line:90%
Slang, I guess.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm so out the loop.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.440 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.570 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: The latest things.

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.060 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: Yeah, like,
I'm never able to talk

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.360 align:middle line:84%
the way other people talk,
because I don't watch

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.960 align:middle line:90%
TV or listen to radio much.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:42.760 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.468 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Radio, you
should start listening.

00:05:44.468 --> 00:05:46.810 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: You know-- exactly.

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.490 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] When I
found out about you,

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.470 align:middle line:90%
I started to do some research.

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And I still want to
watch some things here.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:53.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, OK.

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go see if I
can go to their backlog

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:56.410 align:middle line:90%
and just watch--

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:57.670 align:middle line:90%
watch some more things.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:59.792 align:middle line:90%
And I'm very excited to be here.

00:05:59.792 --> 00:06:01.000 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Well, that's exciting.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, does that help
you in remote viewing?

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.740 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: I can say yes and no.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.580 align:middle line:84%
The reason I say yes is
because amethyst helps you

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.500 align:middle line:90%
with your third eye and--

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.210 align:middle line:84%
but the shungite keeps
me here on this plane.

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:17.010 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Right.

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:18.820 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: And so with
remote viewing,

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:24.490 align:middle line:84%
we pretty much learn to use
all of our mind at one time.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm using my
subconscious mind more so

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:29.880 align:middle line:84%
than anything else,
and I'm trying

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.270 align:middle line:90%
to distract my conscious mind.

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.180 align:middle line:90%
And so this crown, I do wear it.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:35.980 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes I don't.

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.580 align:middle line:84%
I wear what you see
here, my pendant here.

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.040 align:middle line:84%
Or I'll keep-- you see
I have them all over me.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.540 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Oh, yeah,
they're everywhere.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:43.340 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: Everywhere.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.550 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] I even have
them on my waist.

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.750 align:middle line:84%
I have waist beads
with rakhi in them.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And-- or I'll have
them on my desks.

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:51.870 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Not around your ankles.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.010 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: Usually I do.

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:57.420 align:middle line:84%
I recently lost a piece, and
they say whenever you lose them

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.383 align:middle line:90%
that their job for you is done.

00:06:59.383 --> 00:07:01.800 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Do you wear these going
through an airport scanner?

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.270 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: I surely did.

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:04.380 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Does it ring off?

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.045 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: It did not, but they--

00:07:06.045 --> 00:07:08.670 align:middle line:84%
they wanted me to take it off so
they can, I guess, look at it.

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:10.650 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Oh, that's
a hassle, isn't it?

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:12.570 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: Yeah, but
I just took it off.

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:14.620 align:middle line:90%
But I went through it just fine.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.415 align:middle line:84%
And I think they were more
intrigued by it than anything.

00:07:17.415 --> 00:07:18.930 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] So--

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.290 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Well, have you
always been intuitive?

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:22.900 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: Yes.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:23.700 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: As a child?

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.530 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: As a child,
my mother would

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:28.800 align:middle line:84%
say I said very
profound things, like--

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.680 align:middle line:84%
that didn't make sense for a
four-year-old or a six-year-old

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.750 align:middle line:90%
to say to their mom.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:37.190 align:middle line:90%
And I could feel energy.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:39.210 align:middle line:90%
I can tell when someone was sad.

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:44.520 align:middle line:84%
I could feel-- I won't say
death, but other beings.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.350 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: You sense it or felt it?

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:47.460 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: Sense.

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.320 align:middle line:90%
I could-- all of it.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:52.740 align:middle line:84%
It was just like I was in tune
with the things around me,

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.650 align:middle line:84%
other people, able
to connect easily.

00:07:55.650 --> 00:08:00.800 align:middle line:84%
You know, my family's
not like me, so I can--

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm like what you
would call a chameleon.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:07.253 align:middle line:84%
And so I almost blend
in to the person--

00:08:07.253 --> 00:08:09.545 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: With whatever environment
or person you're with.

00:08:09.545 --> 00:08:11.462 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: With my environment,
and so I'm able--

00:08:11.462 --> 00:08:13.370 align:middle line:84%
and if I can't, I
won't be in that space.

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:13.970 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: OK.

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:16.553 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: If I can't, I will move,
because I feel uncomfortable.

00:08:16.553 --> 00:08:18.090 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: So you do
it intentionally.

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:19.010 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: No.

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:22.160 align:middle line:84%
I feel like it used to
be a defense mechanism.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.740 align:middle line:84%
Now I've learned
to kind of tap in.

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:27.540 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: OK.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:31.560 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: So I'm able to tap in
with all the energies of people

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.850 align:middle line:90%
around me.

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people are,
like-- they call it empathic

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:37.620 align:middle line:90%
is what I learned.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.559 align:middle line:84%
And so I used to watch a lot
of TV when I was younger,

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:43.200 align:middle line:84%
and there was a show
called "Charmed,"

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.910 align:middle line:90%
and it was about three witches.

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:48.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, I grew up in a Christian
home, and so [LAUGHS]

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:52.110 align:middle line:84%
abnormal things or
spiritual things

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:55.140 align:middle line:84%
are kind of frowned upon
in the African Methodist

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.240 align:middle line:90%
or Christian community.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.340 align:middle line:84%
Witchcraft is frowned
upon, and anything

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:02.520 align:middle line:84%
that's not by the Bible
is considered that.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:09.415 align:middle line:84%
And so I felt connected
to one of the characters

00:09:09.415 --> 00:09:12.050 align:middle line:84%
in the TV show "Charmed"
that I used to watch.

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:12.850 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Sure.

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:14.100 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: And she was an empath.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And my mom recognized
it too, so that

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.540 align:middle line:90%
helped her to understand me.

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:22.890 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Dr. Courtney Brown
is an amazing remote viewer,

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:24.560 align:middle line:90%
and I guess worked with you?

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.360 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: Yes.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.520 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: How did that happen?

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:27.780 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: He's the
person who found me.

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:28.380 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Oh, he's that person.

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:29.422 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: He's that person.

00:09:29.422 --> 00:09:30.420 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: OK.

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:31.110 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: He's my best friend.

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:33.840 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Well, you were lucky to
have one of the best find you.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.310 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: Yes.

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:37.680 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, I had
no idea what it was.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.570 align:middle line:84%
Most people who get
into remote viewing,

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:40.800 align:middle line:90%
they've heard of it before.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:41.850 align:middle line:90%
They've watched it.

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:46.560 align:middle line:84%
They've researched it for
some odd reason, whether it--

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.450 align:middle line:84%
for however they
found out about it.

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:52.290 align:middle line:90%
Me, I was just a young artist.

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:55.800 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I can't change
the world with these old hags.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.500 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] Well, he didn't
really say hold hags, but like,

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.416 align:middle line:84%
he was like-- you know,
he goes, we need younger--

00:10:01.416 --> 00:10:02.370 align:middle line:90%
younger people to--

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:03.420 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: The younger
blood in this thing.

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:06.045 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: You know, to be able to
bring in a younger demographic,

00:10:06.045 --> 00:10:08.460 align:middle line:84%
because right now, our
demographic is of the older

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:08.840 align:middle line:90%
generation.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:09.660 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Sure.

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.700 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: And eventually, you
know, they fade away, and then

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:12.852 align:middle line:90%
who's going to step in?

00:10:12.852 --> 00:10:14.310 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Some of them
probably worked

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:16.240 align:middle line:84%
on the military's
remote viewing program.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.040 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: You know?

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:17.490 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: You know?

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:19.470 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: And so there's
so much controversy.

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And in the beginning,
it was just-- he said,

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:24.900 align:middle line:84%
I can't teach people
how to be on camera,

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:26.700 align:middle line:84%
but I can teach
someone who knows

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:30.330 align:middle line:84%
how to be on camera, because I
model, I sing, I act, I dance.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:31.330 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: And that was you?

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:33.455 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: And he says, I can
teach someone who can be

00:10:33.455 --> 00:10:35.280 align:middle line:90%
on camera how to remote view.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.620 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: PrinCess Jeanee, I
want to talk with you about Ed

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.810 align:middle line:90%
Dames, another remote viewer.

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:41.850 align:middle line:84%
I had an opportunity
to talk with him

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:43.590 align:middle line:90%
about his remote viewing.

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:46.920 align:middle line:10%
When you were in the government
program, what was the mission?

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.420 align:middle line:10%
What did they want you to do?

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:49.290 align:middle line:10%
ED DAMES: In the--

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:50.290 align:middle line:10%
the psychic spying unit?

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:51.090 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: Yeah.

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:52.540 align:middle line:10%
DAMES: Predominantly two things.

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:56.980 align:middle line:10%
One was to locate hostages
and terrorists, which we did,

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:57.780 align:middle line:10%
that--

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:01.890 align:middle line:10%
Terry Waite, Terry Anderson,
and Colonel Higgins, those cases

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:05.790 align:middle line:10%
specifically, and their captors.

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:08.460 align:middle line:10%
But for the most
part, most of our time

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.790 align:middle line:10%
was attempting to penetrate
very, very secret facilities

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:12.690 align:middle line:10%
in Russia.

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:16.320 align:middle line:10%
Again, predominantly
biological warfare facilities,

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.790 align:middle line:10%
nuclear storage facilities.

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:22.030 align:middle line:84%
One of our missions-- and we
worked for all the intelligence

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:22.830 align:middle line:90%
agencies.

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:26.610 align:middle line:10%
For instance, the CIA asked
us on behalf of the Navy

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:29.610 align:middle line:10%
to locate some silkworm
missiles that the Iranians had

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:31.170 align:middle line:10%
purchased from the Chinese.

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:32.670 align:middle line:90%
These are anti-ship missiles.

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:35.880 align:middle line:84%
They based upon the Strait
of Hormuz in warehouses.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.770 align:middle line:10%
So we had to locate
which warehouse

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:40.380 align:middle line:10%
and then count the
missiles inside.

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:42.930 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: How accurate
was the group?

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:44.280 align:middle line:10%
DAMES: The group was--

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.760 align:middle line:10%
a lot of-- of the documents have
been released now to the public

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.460 align:middle line:10%
except the stuff that was
really, really accurate.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.160 align:middle line:10%
And what was classified
about the program

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.560 align:middle line:10%
was the existence
of the program,

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.497 align:middle line:10%
not the existence
of the protocols

00:11:57.497 --> 00:11:58.830 align:middle line:10%
that were developed at Stanford.

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:01.650 align:middle line:10%
That was not-- that was why
I was able to take those out

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:03.810 align:middle line:10%
from the deep, dark
world of intelligence

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:05.680 align:middle line:10%
and teach them to civilians.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:09.390 align:middle line:10%
The people who were involved
and our accuracy rates, those

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:11.220 align:middle line:10%
were the things that
were classified.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.110 align:middle line:10%
Some of the-- some of
the targets that I just

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:17.910 align:middle line:10%
talked about, for instance,
the CIA-requested targets

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:20.010 align:middle line:10%
and other things that
are highly classified,

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:21.647 align:middle line:10%
those were never released.

00:12:21.647 --> 00:12:23.730 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Are there different
kinds of remote viewing

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:27.120 align:middle line:84%
like controlled remote viewing,
scientific remote viewing?

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.070 align:middle line:90%
Or is it all the same to you?

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:31.200 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: There are differences.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:36.990 align:middle line:84%
That just thrilled me, honestly,
because I haven't seen much

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:38.220 align:middle line:90%
controlled remote viewing.

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:39.315 align:middle line:90%
And so he's a CRV.

00:12:39.315 --> 00:12:40.530 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: That one,
he's one of the best.

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:41.330 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: Yeah.

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And so now, I'm going
to go look him up.

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.990 align:middle line:90%
I know about it.

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:48.550 align:middle line:90%
SRV stems from it.

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:52.380 align:middle line:84%
But because of the
difficulties in everything--

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:57.390 align:middle line:84%
and I don't want to say
inaccuracies, but you know,

00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:59.690 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of a give
or take, right?

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:00.490 align:middle line:90%
With it.

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:02.830 align:middle line:84%
We have to kind of just, like
I said, go with the flow.

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:10.292 align:middle line:84%
And so SRV, which is Scientific
Remote Viewing, it's used to--

00:13:10.292 --> 00:13:15.110 align:middle line:84%
to kind of not know, to go
in blind, because now we

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:17.750 align:middle line:84%
don't have anything interacting,
that-- because you know,

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:19.370 align:middle line:84%
if you know something,
sometimes that

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:22.110 align:middle line:90%
can interfere with our finds.

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:22.910 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:24.743 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Like, they told
him to find missiles.

00:13:24.743 --> 00:13:25.740 align:middle line:90%
That's control.

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:26.330 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: Exactly.

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:28.830 align:middle line:84%
So now he knows he's going to
go in and find missiles, where

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:32.270 align:middle line:84%
if I were to go to that same
location, that same place,

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:35.360 align:middle line:84%
they would first
take me in and see

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.020 align:middle line:90%
if I can even get to Russia.

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:37.820 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Right.

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:38.570 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: You know?

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:40.190 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: And sketch a
missile out of nowhere.

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:42.690 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: Out of nowhere, which
lets them know that I'm there,

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:43.670 align:middle line:90%
which is why--

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:47.480 align:middle line:84%
like I said, why I think had it
been controlled remote viewing,

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:48.980 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have
believed it as much.

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:49.780 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Right.

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.238 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: And so this
is what made me

00:13:51.238 --> 00:13:53.630 align:middle line:84%
believe it to be able to go
in and say, OK, I found this.

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:54.470 align:middle line:90%
I found that.

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:57.142 align:middle line:84%
Let me go through these
movement exercises.

00:13:57.142 --> 00:13:58.850 align:middle line:84%
Let me go through
these different things.

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:00.440 align:middle line:90%
We have a template.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.410 align:middle line:84%
So controlled remote viewing
doesn't really have a template.

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:07.760 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: If you remote viewed,
let's say, my house and I was

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:11.240 align:middle line:84%
in it, and I was a
remote viewer too,

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:14.450 align:middle line:84%
would I know or
sense that you were

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:17.960 align:middle line:84%
trying to see me or
something like that?

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:19.430 align:middle line:90%
Not-- not physically seeing.

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:20.390 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: I do believe--

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:25.110 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I've never had this
happen before with humans.

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:27.170 align:middle line:90%
So-- but I do believe and I do--

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:33.140 align:middle line:84%
I have heard of other intuitive
remote viewers maybe feeling it

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.337 align:middle line:84%
in one of their sessions that
had nothing to do with it.

00:14:36.337 --> 00:14:38.420 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: But they knew that
something was happening.

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:40.010 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: Something is
happening that had nothing

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:41.260 align:middle line:90%
to do with what they're doing.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And-- but I don't think
you would know it was me,

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:47.060 align:middle line:84%
or you would know that that's
actually what's happening.

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:49.100 align:middle line:90%
But that's just a feeling.

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:50.120 align:middle line:90%
That's what I believe.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.470 align:middle line:90%
I don't know that for certain.

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:55.040 align:middle line:84%
The ETs, for certain, they'll
look me dead in your eye.

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:58.580 align:middle line:84%
Like, I can-- and I think
it's because if they're

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:00.530 align:middle line:90%
a remote viewer, maybe.

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:02.390 align:middle line:84%
But-- and you might
have felt it in a dream.

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:03.570 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you would
see it in a dream,

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.060 align:middle line:84%
and maybe we would
talk in a dream,

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:06.860 align:middle line:84%
and you would just
think it was a dream.

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:08.130 align:middle line:90%
That's just my belief.

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:09.780 align:middle line:90%
So I don't have a fact on that.

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:13.400 align:middle line:84%
But for fact,
extraterrestrials, they'll

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.880 align:middle line:84%
look-- they'll look at me
just like I'm looking at you,

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.230 align:middle line:90%
and they'll see me.

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:21.402 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are
opening, like Bashar.

00:15:21.402 --> 00:15:23.360 align:middle line:84%
He was very-- and I don't
want to even call him

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.370 align:middle line:90%
an extraterrestrial or--

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:27.830 align:middle line:84%
call Bashar an extraterrestrial,
because I believe

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:31.520 align:middle line:90%
Bashar to be non-binary.

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:34.040 align:middle line:90%
There's no gender for--

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.230 align:middle line:90%
for Bashar.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:39.680 align:middle line:84%
But extraterrestrials, like,
I was able to look at them

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:43.410 align:middle line:84%
and say, hey, you know,
what are we doing here?

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:46.450 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: But I mean, you tell
if you're being remote viewed?

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:47.250 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: I--

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:49.860 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: If that someone's
in the room right now.

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:51.110 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: I don't think I could.

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.910 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: OK.

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:54.050 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: But I believe
it to be possible?

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:56.990 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Do you sense it?

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:59.552 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: It's never
happened to me.

00:15:59.552 --> 00:16:01.260 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: What a gift
that would be, though.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.660 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: And if it
has, I don't know.

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:05.900 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Do we all have the
ability to remote view?

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:07.290 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: Yes.

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:09.810 align:middle line:84%
We all have the
ability to remote view.

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:14.940 align:middle line:84%
It's all a matter of
if you're willing or--

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:15.870 align:middle line:90%
to let go.

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:18.030 align:middle line:90%
Letting go, like I said earlier.

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:21.630 align:middle line:84%
Letting go is the hardest
part, because we're bred

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:23.860 align:middle line:90%
and we're trained to--

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:25.560 align:middle line:90%
to not believe.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.798 align:middle line:90%
We're-- like, to not--

00:16:27.798 --> 00:16:29.340 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: We put up a
barrier, don't we?

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:30.140 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: Exactly.

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:31.260 align:middle line:90%
We have these walls.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:32.860 align:middle line:90%
Magic isn't real.

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:34.240 align:middle line:90%
ETs aren't real.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:37.190 align:middle line:90%
We are taught that growing up.

00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to now
reprogram ourself.

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:43.635 align:middle line:84%
So I teach people how
to reprogram themselves.

00:16:43.635 --> 00:16:46.203 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Yeah, tell me about
your training company.

00:16:46.203 --> 00:16:47.370 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: So I have a company.

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:49.650 align:middle line:90%
It's called PrinCess Views.

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And-- which, I totally wish
I'd chose another name,

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:53.550 align:middle line:90%
but whatever.

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:56.580 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] I have a company
called PrinCess Views,

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:58.530 align:middle line:84%
and I do teach the
Farsight method.

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:01.080 align:middle line:84%
I have permission from
Dr. Courtney Brown

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:03.580 align:middle line:84%
to teach that method, because
that's what I'm proficient in.

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:04.380 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Sure.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:05.400 align:middle line:90%
And you know it well.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:05.960 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: And I know--

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.418 align:middle line:84%
I know it like the
back of my hand.

00:17:07.418 --> 00:17:08.550 align:middle line:90%
It's like breathing.

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:11.369 align:middle line:84%
It's like me walking to my
bedroom and back with my eyes

00:17:11.369 --> 00:17:12.240 align:middle line:90%
closed.

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.698 align:middle line:84%
I know it like the
back of my hand.

00:17:13.698 --> 00:17:15.329 align:middle line:84%
Now granted, of
course, science--

00:17:15.329 --> 00:17:18.569 align:middle line:84%
with science, things change,
so I do have to learn.

00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:22.109 align:middle line:84%
I'm continuously learning,
still to this day.

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:23.685 align:middle line:90%
I'm always going to be learning.

00:17:23.685 --> 00:17:25.319 align:middle line:84%
If we stop learning,
we're dying.

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:27.630 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: How many
people do you train?

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:29.370 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: I have
students that I train.

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:32.220 align:middle line:84%
So like, if you wanted to
learn, I could train you.

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:35.280 align:middle line:84%
So I have a number of
students that I've had.

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.633 align:middle line:90%
I teach group and I teach solo.

00:17:37.633 --> 00:17:39.300 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: They come to
you, you go to them?

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:40.650 align:middle line:90%
Or is it Zoom now because--

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:42.720 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: Zoom now
because of COVID.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.750 align:middle line:90%
They do come to me.

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:45.360 align:middle line:84%
I have not yet
started traveling,

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.700 align:middle line:84%
but I do want to
start soon, or--

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.710 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: You should
be doing seminars.

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:51.360 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: I do want
to do seminars.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:57.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how yet to really
program that-- the specifics

00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:58.090 align:middle line:90%
of what I do.

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:00.770 align:middle line:90%
So I'm working out those kinks.

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:07.280 align:middle line:84%
I have been invited to
do a seminar in April

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.650 align:middle line:90%
if I'm-- if I'm not mistaken.

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:11.660 align:middle line:84%
So hopefully things are
kind of molded down.

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:14.090 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: I had an interview with
another remote viewer, Lyn

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:17.460 align:middle line:84%
Buchanan, who used to work
for government projects.

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:19.590 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at what
he has to say.

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:22.370 align:middle line:10%
Am I correct, Lyn, that
with remote viewing,

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:24.890 align:middle line:10%
the more you think
about something,

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:26.790 align:middle line:10%
the least you'll be able to do?

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:30.080 align:middle line:10%
LYN BUCHANAN: The more you try
to interpret what you get--

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:33.365 align:middle line:10%
we tell everybody, whatever
comes through, you know--

00:18:33.365 --> 00:18:34.490 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: Just let it come in.

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:35.600 align:middle line:90%
BUCHANAN: Let it come in.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:41.840 align:middle line:84%
If it says red, don't
tell me it's an apple.

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:43.820 align:middle line:10%
Tell me it's red, you know?

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:47.570 align:middle line:84%
And don't try to
interpret anything.

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:50.690 align:middle line:10%
Let your subconscious
mind be your eyes.

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:51.830 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: Right.

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:57.290 align:middle line:10%
BUCHANAN: And in fact, in the
training that I'm doing now

00:18:57.290 --> 00:19:02.750 align:middle line:10%
on the-- on the
internet, we start out

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:07.460 align:middle line:10%
by having you look at a target,
look at the target picture,

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:08.700 align:middle line:10%
and describe it.

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:09.500 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: All right.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:10.580 align:middle line:10%
BUCHANAN: And then
we teach you--

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:11.850 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: By physically
looking at it.

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:13.433 align:middle line:10%
BUCHANAN: By physically
looking at it.

00:19:13.433 --> 00:19:15.350 align:middle line:10%
Most people don't know
how to describe things.

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:16.391 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: Well, that's true.

00:19:16.391 --> 00:19:18.560 align:middle line:10%
BUCHANAN: And we teach you
how to describe things.

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:22.050 align:middle line:10%
And then we say, OK.

00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:24.710 align:middle line:10%
Now we're going to
let your subconscious

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:27.770 align:middle line:10%
mind be your eyes for you.

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:32.360 align:middle line:10%
We hide the target,
let you do the session,

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:35.600 align:middle line:10%
and then immediately
give you the feedback

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.180 align:middle line:10%
and say, OK, what
were you right about?

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:39.410 align:middle line:10%
What were you wrong about?

00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:40.700 align:middle line:90%
And so on.

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:42.560 align:middle line:90%
Score this.

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.090 align:middle line:90%
Accept your accuracy.

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:45.920 align:middle line:90%
Accept your failures.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.960 align:middle line:90%
Accept your successes.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.230 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Amazing work.

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And I have found
with remote viewing

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:54.410 align:middle line:84%
that I've dabbled
with, PrinCess Jeanee,

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:58.650 align:middle line:84%
that the more you think,
the harder it is to do.

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:00.260 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: Yes.

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And again, that's
why I say, let go.

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:02.740 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Yeah.

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:04.160 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: Let go, let go, let go.

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.180 align:middle line:90%
Everything he just said is--

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:06.980 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Spot on.

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:09.217 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: --spot on.

00:20:09.217 --> 00:20:10.550 align:middle line:90%
If you start to think about it--

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:13.340 align:middle line:90%


00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:14.570 align:middle line:90%
what was it?

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:16.440 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Courtney Brown,
when he was teaching me,

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:18.800 align:middle line:84%
he goes, PrinCess--
or he looked at me,

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:20.150 align:middle line:90%
because I was, like, frantic.

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:21.172 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:20:21.172 --> 00:20:22.130 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Were you really?

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:23.030 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: Oh, yes.

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:24.140 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] He--

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.110 align:middle line:90%
I know he and I--

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:25.910 align:middle line:90%
I love him.

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:26.743 align:middle line:90%
He's like a brother.

00:20:26.743 --> 00:20:29.580 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] But we definitely
have some yelling matches.

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:30.380 align:middle line:90%
And I had these--

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:31.610 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Oh, you did?

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:33.050 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: I have
these same yelling

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:36.200 align:middle line:84%
matches with my students,
and they thank me for it,

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:43.210 align:middle line:84%
because he goes, this is the one
time you're allowed to actually

00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:45.850 align:middle line:84%
be pretty and not think,
because that's what

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:48.220 align:middle line:90%
they tell us growing up, women.

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.540 align:middle line:90%
You can't just be pretty.

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:50.430 align:middle line:90%
You have to think.

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:50.620 align:middle line:90%
You have to--

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:51.940 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Don't be
just a pretty face.

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:52.180 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: Yeah.

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:53.513 align:middle line:90%
You can't just be a pretty face.

00:20:53.513 --> 00:20:58.240 align:middle line:84%
He goes, just-- just do
that and stop thinking.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.640 align:middle line:90%
And when I stopped thinking--

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.740 align:middle line:84%
like, he's-- like Lyn
Buchanan just said--

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:04.390 align:middle line:84%
and I admire Lyn
Buchanan, actually.

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:05.190 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:07.780 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: He's a
giant in the field.

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:09.700 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: It's hard
to describe things.

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:13.252 align:middle line:84%
Like, I can't-- you as a
person, even as people,

00:21:13.252 --> 00:21:14.710 align:middle line:84%
you know how they
have the people--

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:16.390 align:middle line:84%
when something bad
happens, they tell

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:17.827 align:middle line:90%
the people to draw them out.

00:21:17.827 --> 00:21:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And they go, look
for them or whatnot.

00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:19.810 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Right.

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:22.060 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: Like, I would have
to be able to describe you.

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:23.740 align:middle line:90%
He's-- you know, he is--

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:24.760 align:middle line:90%
he has pale skin.

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:28.210 align:middle line:84%
You know, I do my best not
to give, like, ethnicities,

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:30.000 align:middle line:90%
because we never know.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.140 align:middle line:84%
You know, he has
pale skin, dark hair.

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:33.530 align:middle line:90%
I describe your hair.

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:35.380 align:middle line:90%
He has facial hair.

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:37.818 align:middle line:84%
You know, I have to know if
it's a mustache or a beard.

00:21:37.818 --> 00:21:40.360 align:middle line:84%
He-- you know, the shape of his
ears, the shape of your nose.

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.860 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: But you see these things
when you're doing it, right?

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:43.840 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: I don't see.

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:44.800 align:middle line:90%
I feel.

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:45.370 align:middle line:90%
Now, I do--

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:45.850 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Do you?

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:47.830 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: Every remote
viewer is different.

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:50.000 align:middle line:84%
There are some things
I can see straight on,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.030 align:middle line:84%
but I can't really
see in real life.

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:52.880 align:middle line:90%
So-- [LAUGHS]

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:53.680 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Interesting.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:55.810 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: But I do
always see afterwards.

00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:57.520 align:middle line:90%
It's like a memory.

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:00.140 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Do you use this
technique a lot for yourself?

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:00.940 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: Oh, yes.

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:01.898 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Everyday living?

00:22:01.898 --> 00:22:04.175 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: Every-- well, I
remote view every single day.

00:22:04.175 --> 00:22:05.050 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Do you really?

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:06.295 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: I do.

00:22:06.295 --> 00:22:09.670 align:middle line:10%
I haven't these past
two months because I've

00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:12.590 align:middle line:10%
been struggling with a
concussion, and it hurts.

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:13.390 align:middle line:10%
It hurt.

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:13.870 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: Oh, wow.

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:14.670 align:middle line:10%
Are you OK?

00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:15.700 align:middle line:10%
JEANEE: I am.

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:18.880 align:middle line:84%
Actually, on the
flight coming in,

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.452 align:middle line:84%
leaving didn't do so
much, but coming in--

00:22:21.452 --> 00:22:22.660 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: You felt the pressure.

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:25.285 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: --into Colorado, I could
feel the pressure to the point

00:22:25.285 --> 00:22:26.317 align:middle line:90%
where I was falling.

00:22:26.317 --> 00:22:27.400 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Was it hurting you?

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.340 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: I was in pain.

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:29.715 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I was
going to vomit.

00:22:29.715 --> 00:22:30.836 align:middle line:90%
It was bad.

00:22:30.836 --> 00:22:36.010 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] But-- so I am
recuperating from that.

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:38.740 align:middle line:90%
But I remote view daily.

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And I realize that
we as individuals,

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:46.370 align:middle line:84%
we use remote viewing in our
lives without even knowing.

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:47.170 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Right.

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:48.280 align:middle line:90%
It's a hunch.

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:49.165 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: It's-- it's intuition.

00:22:49.165 --> 00:22:50.000 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: For a lot of people.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:50.290 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:52.900 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: It's what I call-- and
I know this isn't something

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:58.666 align:middle line:84%
that's named, but what I call
intuitive remote viewing is--

00:22:58.666 --> 00:23:00.820 align:middle line:90%
is kind of-- is like a feeling.

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:04.630 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: But how many people do
not react to that intuition?

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:07.090 align:middle line:90%
They just scoff it off.

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:08.170 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: About 90%.

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:09.040 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Exactly.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:09.850 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: 90%.

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:11.110 align:middle line:90%
And we do that naturally.

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:12.880 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, we
do that naturally.

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:15.100 align:middle line:84%
In our everyday life,
we get that gut feeling,

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:17.150 align:middle line:84%
and people don't listen
to that gut feeling

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:18.400 align:middle line:90%
because it doesn't make sense.

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:24.040 align:middle line:84%
Like, I recently saw a Facebook
post of this young lady saying

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:27.657 align:middle line:84%
her grandmother always said
when her left eye twitches,

00:23:27.657 --> 00:23:28.990 align:middle line:90%
something bad's about to happen.

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:29.410 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Huh.

00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:31.180 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: And she
said, sure enough,

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:33.760 align:middle line:84%
for a week straight, my left
eye just kept twitching.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And I got in a--
she got into a car

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:38.440 align:middle line:84%
accident on the eve
of her car accident

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:39.730 align:middle line:90%
that she had last year.

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And then her eye
stopped watching.

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And-- and it was on the
way here that I saw that,

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:47.590 align:middle line:84%
so I didn't get to communicate
with her about that.

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:52.665 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to tell
her so bad to teach her

00:23:52.665 --> 00:23:54.040 align:middle line:84%
how to follow
those gut feelings,

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:57.010 align:middle line:84%
because she could
prevent certain things

00:23:57.010 --> 00:23:59.530 align:middle line:84%
from happening, which is what
we use remote viewing for, you

00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:00.700 align:middle line:90%
know?

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:03.382 align:middle line:84%
What it was started
to use for, bombs.

00:24:03.382 --> 00:24:04.840 align:middle line:84%
You know, being
able to find bombs.

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:07.030 align:middle line:90%
Could we have prevented 9/11?

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:09.700 align:middle line:84%
Or could we have prevented
the riots that occurred?

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:12.220 align:middle line:84%
I saw the riots that
recently happened

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:15.007 align:middle line:84%
over the state of this
pandemic that we were having.

00:24:15.007 --> 00:24:17.590 align:middle line:84%
I saw them before they happened,
and I was blocking some of it

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:19.260 align:middle line:90%
out, because it was too much.

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:20.200 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't believe it.

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:20.770 align:middle line:90%
I was like, no.

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:21.680 align:middle line:90%
This isn't happening.

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:22.638 align:middle line:90%
I've seen riots before.

00:24:22.638 --> 00:24:23.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm not seeing a riot.

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:25.810 align:middle line:84%
And I had to make
sure I didn't do that.

00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:28.240 align:middle line:84%
But I saw these riots
before they happened,

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:30.250 align:middle line:84%
and I documented it
before they happened.

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And whenever I saw them
on the news and my sister

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:36.070 align:middle line:84%
was calling me, because she
happened to be at one of them,

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:38.300 align:middle line:84%
just walking through
downtown Atlanta

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:42.400 align:middle line:84%
and just got into the crossfire,
got gassed, and I was--

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.780 align:middle line:90%
I could re-feel it.

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:46.195 align:middle line:90%
I recalled it.

00:24:46.195 --> 00:24:47.320 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I've seen this.

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:48.320 align:middle line:90%
And I started crying.

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.120 align:middle line:90%
I was--

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.170 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: That emotional.

00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:50.680 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: Oh, yes.

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.555 align:middle line:84%
I've had some very
emotional remote viewings.

00:24:52.555 --> 00:24:56.140 align:middle line:90%
I've cried on camera a lot.

00:24:56.140 --> 00:25:00.950 align:middle line:84%
I've cried after finding
out where I've been.

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:07.340 align:middle line:84%
Jack the Ripper had me in
tears, thinking about it now.

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:09.380 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: So you remote
view the past as well?

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:11.720 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: Past,
present, and future.

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.220 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Got to be
careful doing that.

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:14.020 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: Honey, yes.

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:16.460 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] But that's
why I go in blind,

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:18.500 align:middle line:90%
because it can interfere.

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:21.140 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Another great
remote viewer, Paul Smith,

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:23.220 align:middle line:90%
explained about remote viewing.

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And he says, it's more than
just letting the mind wander

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:27.950 align:middle line:90%
and picking up things.

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:30.470 align:middle line:10%
PAUL SMITH: What
you do is you focus

00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:38.090 align:middle line:10%
on perceiving the intended
target of your conscious mind.

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:40.820 align:middle line:10%
And it's interesting
that you-- we can pick up

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:42.110 align:middle line:10%
all kinds of things.

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:44.540 align:middle line:10%
We can pick up sensory
experiences such as colors,

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:46.790 align:middle line:10%
tastes, sounds, smells.

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:49.310 align:middle line:10%
We can pick up more
intangible information.

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:54.950 align:middle line:10%
Purposes, actions,
intentions, things like that.

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:57.170 align:middle line:10%
We can pick up shapes.

00:25:57.170 --> 00:26:00.320 align:middle line:10%
We can pick up some
motion, movement.

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:01.850 align:middle line:10%
You can pick up whole scenes.

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:04.370 align:middle line:10%
It all depends where
you are in the process.

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:07.310 align:middle line:10%
But it is-- it can be--

00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:10.250 align:middle line:10%
I wouldn't say it's like
being there physically,

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:11.050 align:middle line:10%
but it's like--

00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:12.092 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: Pretty darn close.

00:26:12.092 --> 00:26:13.180 align:middle line:10%
SMITH: Pretty close, yes.

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:14.440 align:middle line:10%
Pretty close.

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:18.100 align:middle line:10%
NOORY: Can you depict
time with remote viewing?

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:21.730 align:middle line:10%
And by that I mean, if
you're looking at something

00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:29.140 align:middle line:10%
and you see an explosion,
can you say May 2018?

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:30.670 align:middle line:10%
I know that's the date.

00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:31.510 align:middle line:10%
Can you do that?

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:34.300 align:middle line:10%
SMITH: You know,
unfortunately, you can't.

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:36.850 align:middle line:10%
Remote viewing is
a descriptive kind

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:40.570 align:middle line:10%
of approach to this
projected consciousness.

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:45.130 align:middle line:10%
And what that means is you
could describe what happened.

00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:48.145 align:middle line:10%
You could say, I perceive
this big ball of rolling fire

00:26:48.145 --> 00:26:49.395 align:middle line:10%
or whatever, a loud explosion.

00:26:49.395 --> 00:26:50.770 align:middle line:10%
It reminds me of--

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:52.720 align:middle line:10%
reminds me of some kind of--

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:56.240 align:middle line:10%
well, explosion, at
a certain location.

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.000 align:middle line:10%
But if you say, well,
when did it happen?

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.560 align:middle line:10%
You'll say, well, I
know it's in the past.

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:01.360 align:middle line:10%
Say, OK.

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:01.840 align:middle line:10%
Well, that's good.

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:02.640 align:middle line:10%
When?

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:06.310 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHS] And you say,
well, I don't know when,

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:10.180 align:middle line:10%
but this happened before,
and this other thing

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:11.800 align:middle line:10%
happened afterwards.

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:15.400 align:middle line:10%
And so using that, you may be
able to kind of triangulate

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.463 align:middle line:10%
when approximately
that happened.

00:27:17.463 --> 00:27:18.880 align:middle line:10%
But the thing about
remote viewing

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:20.510 align:middle line:10%
is it's very right brain.

00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:24.250 align:middle line:10%
And so-- and things
like measuring

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:27.195 align:middle line:10%
time and language
and mathematics

00:27:27.195 --> 00:27:29.680 align:middle line:10%
and all that kind of stuff is
fairly right-- or left brain,

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.870 align:middle line:10%
and the two don't really
cooperate very well

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:33.170 align:middle line:10%
in a remote viewing scenario.

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:35.530 align:middle line:10%
And so that's why it's more
descriptive rather than

00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:36.928 align:middle line:10%
labeling.

00:27:36.928 --> 00:27:38.470 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Paul wrote
a great book called

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:41.440 align:middle line:84%
"Reading the Enemy's
Mind" about how

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.630 align:middle line:84%
they were channeled
to read the enemy's

00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:45.310 align:middle line:90%
mind with remote viewing.

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:47.050 align:middle line:84%
But you had mentioned
that you had

00:27:47.050 --> 00:27:50.240 align:middle line:84%
an encounter with Jack the
Ripper at a remote viewing

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.040 align:middle line:90%
session.

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.760 align:middle line:90%
What was that all about?

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:54.720 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: So my encounter--

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:58.540 align:middle line:84%
and with "Reading
the Enemy's Mind,"

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:01.000 align:middle line:90%
I call that a deep mind probe.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.195 align:middle line:84%
And so what that is is I
go in after I've described.

00:28:04.195 --> 00:28:05.420 align:middle line:90%
I go into their mind.

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:06.220 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: OK.

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:08.053 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: And I see what
they're feeling like.

00:28:08.053 --> 00:28:09.130 align:middle line:90%
Is he schizophrenic?

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:11.320 align:middle line:84%
Like, this-- I can
almost feel it, you know?

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:12.400 align:middle line:90%
He feels spastic.

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.900 align:middle line:90%
He feels distant, like there.

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:15.400 align:middle line:84%
Like, I don't talk
to him, because I

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:18.070 align:middle line:84%
said I can't talk to humans,
or I can talk to ETs.

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:22.100 align:middle line:84%
But with Jack the
Ripper, I think

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:24.910 align:middle line:84%
that was the first time
I saw through his eyes.

00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:25.710 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Ooh.

00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:27.115 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: And-- oh, honey.

00:28:27.115 --> 00:28:28.740 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: The things he
did, you saw that?

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:29.720 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: I saw it
through his eyes.

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:30.845 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Like you were there.

00:28:30.845 --> 00:28:32.290 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: I was him.

00:28:32.290 --> 00:28:35.240 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if that's ever
happened before, but that's--

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:38.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm an emotional
being naturally,

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:42.230 align:middle line:84%
and so I tap into why that
person does what they're doing,

00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:43.130 align:middle line:90%
or if they are.

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:45.200 align:middle line:90%
So I could feel his--

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.755 align:middle line:84%
I could feel he
thought he was OK.

00:28:47.755 --> 00:28:49.130 align:middle line:84%
I could feel that
he didn't think

00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:50.910 align:middle line:90%
he was doing anything wrong.

00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:55.670 align:middle line:84%
I could feel that he had
this-- it was an urge, an urge.

00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:57.860 align:middle line:84%
But not only did I
see through his mind,

00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:59.910 align:middle line:90%
I saw through the woman's mind.

00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:00.710 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Jeez.

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:02.580 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: So I relived him--

00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:03.380 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: The victims.

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:05.180 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: I relived him
doing it, and then I

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:08.907 align:middle line:84%
relived the victim
feeling it back to back.

00:29:08.907 --> 00:29:10.490 align:middle line:84%
That was the most
traumatic experience

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:12.470 align:middle line:90%
I've ever had remote viewing.

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:13.760 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Why did you do this?

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.170 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: Well, I
didn't-- we don't know.

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:16.370 align:middle line:90%
And so we don't always know--

00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:17.390 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: You can't control it?

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:18.290 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: No.

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:19.670 align:middle line:90%
Again, I go in blind.

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:23.390 align:middle line:84%
So when-- I don't know I'm
going to visit Jack the Ripper

00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:24.935 align:middle line:90%
until after I've been.

00:29:24.935 --> 00:29:28.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm given the targets
by other people

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:31.430 align:middle line:84%
or by my director
or someone else.

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And like, we have different
remote viewers, right?

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:37.383 align:middle line:84%
And everyone experiences
things differently.

00:29:37.383 --> 00:29:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And so some people are like,
oh, this is what's happening.

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:40.460 align:middle line:90%
Blasé, blah.

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:40.715 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:40.715 --> 00:29:41.870 align:middle line:90%
And a story.

00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:46.220 align:middle line:84%
Me, because I'm an emotional
being naturally, I feel.

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:47.180 align:middle line:90%
I don't draw.

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:50.420 align:middle line:84%
If you-- and I think you'll
see in some of my videos

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:51.420 align:middle line:90%
that I don't draw.

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:52.220 align:middle line:90%
I don't write.

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:54.930 align:middle line:90%
I don't use a whiteboard.

00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:55.790 align:middle line:90%
I feel.

00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:56.030 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:57.660 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: As most
remote viewers do.

00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:58.970 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: Yeah, I don't do that.

00:29:58.970 --> 00:29:59.960 align:middle line:90%
I go into it.

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:02.480 align:middle line:90%
I become or-- and I look around.

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:03.388 align:middle line:90%
It's all here--

00:30:03.388 --> 00:30:04.430 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Do you act it out.

00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:05.810 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: --where I am.

00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:08.000 align:middle line:90%
And I-- or I am there.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And so I didn't know I was
going to visit Jack the Ripper.

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:11.870 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:13.078 align:middle line:90%
I never know where I'm going.

00:30:13.078 --> 00:30:15.480 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: When did you
realize that's who it was?

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.705 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: I was told after
I finished and completed.

00:30:17.705 --> 00:30:19.788 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: So you didn't know
while you were doing it?

00:30:19.788 --> 00:30:20.670 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: Not at all.

00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:21.470 align:middle line:90%
Never.

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:23.070 align:middle line:90%
And I never make assumptions.

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:23.870 align:middle line:90%
I will never make--

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:25.700 align:middle line:84%
now, there could have
been an assumption,

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:27.240 align:middle line:90%
but I never make assumptions.

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:29.390 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm remote viewing
somebody, I can say,

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:32.640 align:middle line:84%
this reminds me of
such and such and such.

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:33.440 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Sure.

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:37.243 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: But I will never
say this is so-and-so,

00:30:37.243 --> 00:30:38.660 align:middle line:84%
because I could
be wrong, and then

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:41.900 align:middle line:84%
that makes all my data
wrong, because now I'm

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:44.880 align:middle line:90%
going to pull in that data.

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:46.820 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: How are you able
to tap into something

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:49.250 align:middle line:90%
that's not existing anymore?

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:51.500 align:middle line:90%
Or does it always exist in time?

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:53.150 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: Everything
exists in time.

00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:55.820 align:middle line:90%


00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And so we do our best
not to make assumptions,

00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:03.050 align:middle line:84%
because we don't know
what timeline things are

00:31:03.050 --> 00:31:04.125 align:middle line:90%
going to be in.

00:31:04.125 --> 00:31:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't know
if I'm in the past,

00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:07.583 align:middle line:84%
if I'm in the present,
if I'm in the future.

00:31:07.583 --> 00:31:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And I am taught to and I
teach to make deductions.

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:18.520 align:middle line:84%
My deduction-- by
deductions, it's like, OK.

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:23.320 align:middle line:84%
When I remote viewed Martin
Luther King, I can't--

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:25.510 align:middle line:84%
I didn't say, this is
Martin Luther King.

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:27.670 align:middle line:84%
I said, this is an
African American

00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:33.760 align:middle line:84%
or a brown-skinned male in his
mid 30s who wants a difference.

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.610 align:middle line:84%
He reminds me of--
and I-- in that time

00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:40.210 align:middle line:84%
I said President
Obama, and then I

00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:43.910 align:middle line:84%
said Malcolm X. I never
said Martin Luther King.

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:48.940 align:middle line:84%
But those dynamics also fit
into his same personality.

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And so with Jack
the Ripper, I never

00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:54.638 align:middle line:84%
encountered anything
like that before.

00:31:54.638 --> 00:31:55.930 align:middle line:90%
I didn't study Jack the Ripper.

00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:56.590 align:middle line:90%
I knew of him.

00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:58.960 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: And I guess you would
not like to encounter it again.

00:31:58.960 --> 00:31:59.410 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: Nope.

00:31:59.410 --> 00:31:59.860 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:01.210 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: I don't blame you.

00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:02.152 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: Not at all.

00:32:02.152 --> 00:32:03.610 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Wouldn't it
be safer for you

00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:08.440 align:middle line:84%
to do controlled remote viewing
where you know your target

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:11.740 align:middle line:84%
and you go after it that
way rather than free flow

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:14.890 align:middle line:84%
and stumble across some
of these horrible things?

00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:18.010 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: Well, I
feel like I wouldn't

00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:22.850 align:middle line:84%
be able to get as much true
information that was missing

00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:25.390 align:middle line:84%
if I did do controlled
remote viewing,

00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:27.460 align:middle line:84%
because again, I'm
empathic, and I

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:29.110 align:middle line:90%
feel things that can't be told.

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:31.330 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Have you ever done
controlled remote viewing?

00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:33.730 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: I have done one
session, but that was just so

00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:36.140 align:middle line:90%
that I could experience it.

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And so I had my director with
me, teaching me in the moment

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:44.050 align:middle line:90%
how.

00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:46.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think because
I'm so used to--

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:48.050 align:middle line:84%
and I want to
experience it more.

00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:49.960 align:middle line:84%
I do want to experience
it more, but I--

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:51.400 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: It's a very
powerful thing.

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:52.990 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: I love my method.

00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:57.460 align:middle line:84%
I love the method
that I use, because we

00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:00.730 align:middle line:84%
do have a form of
controlled remote viewing

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:03.280 align:middle line:90%
that we call basic SRV.

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:07.600 align:middle line:84%
So what I do with scientific
remote viewing is advanced SRV.

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:13.570 align:middle line:84%
But basic SRV kind of
follows the path of CRV.

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:16.630 align:middle line:84%
But of course, we can't call
it that, because other people,

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:18.290 align:middle line:84%
you know, that's
trademarked, you know?

00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:19.090 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Right.

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:21.550 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: It's trademarked,
so we would never want to--

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:22.640 align:middle line:90%
so we change.

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:25.040 align:middle line:84%
You know, we don't use
the same terminology,

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:26.350 align:middle line:90%
but it is a similar pattern.

00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:29.200 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: How long does it take
you to get into this state

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.760 align:middle line:90%
to be able to do what you do?

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.950 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: I meditate.

00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:35.860 align:middle line:84%
We're-- I'm taught to meditate
for about 30 minutes before.

00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:38.020 align:middle line:84%
I personally meditate
three hours a day.

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:39.500 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Three hours a day?

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:40.300 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:40.780 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: Yes.

00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:41.770 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Continuously?

00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:43.480 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: Yes, continuously.

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:50.380 align:middle line:84%
I'll start, and I do what is
called pranayam and asanas,

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:54.325 align:middle line:84%
which is like a body
massage from head

00:33:54.325 --> 00:33:56.830 align:middle line:84%
to connect with the
heart, from our feet

00:33:56.830 --> 00:34:00.970 align:middle line:84%
to connect with the heart,
and a breathing exercise

00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:03.550 align:middle line:90%
before I then take us deeper.

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And then I clear my
mind with a mantra

00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:08.278 align:middle line:84%
that was created to release
tiredness, because--

00:34:08.278 --> 00:34:09.820 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: And it works
for you that way.

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:11.210 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: Yes.

00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:12.010 align:middle line:90%
It works.

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:13.210 align:middle line:90%
It helps to bring it in.

00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:16.750 align:middle line:84%
I do have advanced
perceptions, which

00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:19.750 align:middle line:84%
is something I might see in
my meditation, which sometimes

00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:22.787 align:middle line:84%
may or may not categorize
within where I'm going.

00:34:22.787 --> 00:34:24.370 align:middle line:84%
But it's just to get
it out of my mind

00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:25.828 align:middle line:84%
so I don't jump to
any conclusions.

00:34:25.828 --> 00:34:27.940 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: What is
mantra meditation?

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:30.370 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: Mantra meditation
is a repetition

00:34:30.370 --> 00:34:32.230 align:middle line:90%
of a phrase or a word.

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:36.250 align:middle line:84%
So how-- I think
people that meditate,

00:34:36.250 --> 00:34:38.500 align:middle line:84%
and they are like here or
here, and they're like, om.

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:39.730 align:middle line:90%
They say om.

00:34:39.730 --> 00:34:41.889 align:middle line:84%
Or if you're doing a
root chakra mantra,

00:34:41.889 --> 00:34:43.940 align:middle line:84%
you'll say lam over
and over again.

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:46.659 align:middle line:84%
So there are people who
meditate that are here,

00:34:46.659 --> 00:34:50.409 align:middle line:84%
and there like, (DRAWN OUT)
om, over and over again.

00:34:50.409 --> 00:34:51.780 align:middle line:90%
That's a mantra.

00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:55.739 align:middle line:90%
My mantra is shaneem manah.

00:34:55.739 --> 00:35:00.060 align:middle line:84%
And that mantra was created
to rid yourself of tiredness

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:02.160 align:middle line:90%
and clear the mind.

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:04.160 align:middle line:90%
And so it'll bring up anything.

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:08.240 align:middle line:84%
You'll have dreams
until it's just silence

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:09.980 align:middle line:90%
and you can hear a pin drop.

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:13.040 align:middle line:84%
I can hear someone move in
a different part of my home.

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:15.555 align:middle line:84%
I can hear-- almost
hear thoughts,

00:35:15.555 --> 00:35:17.930 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know if they're
mine or the people around me.

00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:20.270 align:middle line:90%
I can feel where--

00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:22.250 align:middle line:84%
you know, if I'm in a
place with other people,

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:23.690 align:middle line:84%
I can feel where
people are in my house.

00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:25.710 align:middle line:84%
I know someone's in the
kitchen or the bathroom.

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:27.290 align:middle line:90%
Or I'm moving.

00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:29.580 align:middle line:84%
I can feel everything,
and it empties,

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:32.480 align:middle line:84%
empties to where
all I have is just

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.870 align:middle line:90%
me and my subconscious mind.

00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And so I repeat shaneem manah
over and over again in my mind.

00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:42.290 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: "Falling in
Love with Meditation"

00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:43.760 align:middle line:90%
is another Gaia series.

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:46.963 align:middle line:84%
Teacher Sally Kempton
talks about that.

00:35:46.963 --> 00:35:48.630 align:middle line:10%
SALLY KEMPTON: The
definition of mantra,

00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:50.760 align:middle line:10%
there are many
definitions of mantra.

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:53.550 align:middle line:10%
The most simple comes
from the word itself.

00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:58.200 align:middle line:10%
Man means mind, tra
means tool or technique.

00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:02.710 align:middle line:10%
So in the simplest sense, a
mantra is a tool for the mind.

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:07.320 align:middle line:10%
And again, as many of you know,
when meditation practice first

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:14.340 align:middle line:10%
became popular in the West, the
recognition of using a word,

00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:19.140 align:middle line:10%
using a thought to focus
on became a major part

00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:22.170 align:middle line:10%
of some of the early work
that was done on meditation.

00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:24.270 align:middle line:10%
And one of the things
that was discovered

00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:28.320 align:middle line:10%
was that you can use any word
as a focal point for the mind,

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:31.320 align:middle line:10%
and it will start to
make the mind quiet.

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:35.310 align:middle line:10%
In fact, in the 19th century,
the great English poet Alfred

00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:38.530 align:middle line:10%
Lord Tennyson discovered
this practice for himself.

00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:41.700 align:middle line:10%
He wrote in one of his-- one
of his letters to a friend,

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:45.570 align:middle line:10%
I've discovered that if I
repeat my own name over and over

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:50.520 align:middle line:10%
again, it puts me into a very
pleasant trance-like state,

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:55.050 align:middle line:10%
and I go very deep into
an internal sense of rest.

00:36:55.050 --> 00:36:58.890 align:middle line:10%
So human beings naturally
discover the power

00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:02.220 align:middle line:10%
of using a word as a way
of settling the mind,

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:03.690 align:middle line:10%
turning it inside.

00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:05.730 align:middle line:10%
But the great Sanskrit mantras--

00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:07.860 align:middle line:10%
and when I say
Sanskrit mantras, I

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:11.670 align:middle line:10%
want to say that great
mantras of this kind

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:middle line:10%
exist in many
different languages.

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:17.700 align:middle line:10%
In Hebrew, for instance, in
Arabic, in other languages.

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:22.920 align:middle line:10%
There are words that have no
mundane association, words that

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:27.120 align:middle line:10%
have been used by
practitioners for hundreds

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:30.870 align:middle line:10%
and hundreds of years
and that have the power

00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:33.750 align:middle line:10%
to act as a kind
of a depth charge

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:39.210 align:middle line:10%
to take your awareness deep into
the subtle levels of the mind,

00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:41.645 align:middle line:10%
into the subtle
realms of the mind.

00:37:41.645 --> 00:37:43.020 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: What do
you think of that?

00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:43.820 align:middle line:90%
Is she right?

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:46.570 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: It's pretty much
exactly what I was saying.

00:37:46.570 --> 00:37:49.558 align:middle line:84%
And so shaneem
manah is-- you know,

00:37:49.558 --> 00:37:51.100 align:middle line:84%
people go, well,
what does that mean?

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:53.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to say something
that doesn't have meaning.

00:37:53.590 --> 00:37:54.390 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Right.

00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:56.940 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: But I'm-- if you think
about it, I don't believe--

00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:59.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that
any word has a meaning,

00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:02.460 align:middle line:84%
because every word means another
word, which means another word.

00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:04.410 align:middle line:90%
And so with that--

00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:07.350 align:middle line:84%
oh, she made the
most beautiful point.

00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:08.760 align:middle line:90%
Shaneem manah was created.

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:12.280 align:middle line:84%
It was a created
phrase to take us in

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:15.070 align:middle line:84%
and to sound like
everyday life around us.

00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:19.110 align:middle line:84%
So I can meditate on a train,
at a club, at the restaurant.

00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And that shh, aah, mna are
natural sounds around us.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.400 align:middle line:84%
If someone's vacuuming
or washing the dishes,

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:30.240 align:middle line:84%
they-- it mimics the
sounds of things.

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:33.870 align:middle line:84%
That way, I can tune
out and tune in.

00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:35.970 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: What is it about
meditation that just

00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:39.000 align:middle line:90%
seems to make all this work?

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:44.080 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: I believe it's the
quietness, the quietness

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:47.750 align:middle line:90%
and the center within self.

00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:53.560 align:middle line:84%
Self is powerful, but we
don't hear ourselves mostly,

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:57.340 align:middle line:84%
because we're too busy hearing
what people have told us,

00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:00.850 align:middle line:84%
or we're too busy hearing
negative thoughts or the things

00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:03.430 align:middle line:84%
that are created that we're
taught to believe that are--

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:05.050 align:middle line:90%
you know, quiet the mind.

00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:05.860 align:middle line:90%
Quiet the mind.

00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:06.660 align:middle line:90%
Quiet the mind.

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And so-- so meditation
helps you to just be.

00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:14.830 align:middle line:84%
It helps you to just be
in that moment, which

00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:18.130 align:middle line:84%
then can allow you to believe
and to hear and to see

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:19.850 align:middle line:90%
other things around you.

00:39:19.850 --> 00:39:23.230 align:middle line:84%
And so we're in
different realms daily.

00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:25.120 align:middle line:90%
It's a multiverse.

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:27.730 align:middle line:84%
And so this is happening
in another universe,

00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:30.640 align:middle line:84%
in a completely different way,
while I'm interviewing you.

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:32.240 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Do you teach meditation?

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:33.430 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: Yes.

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:36.715 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: And how quickly
does it take to learn?

00:39:36.715 --> 00:39:38.120 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: It all depends on you.

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:42.430 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't take-- it doesn't--
it doesn't take long to learn.

00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:45.670 align:middle line:84%
It does take a while
to get used to if you

00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:47.870 align:middle line:90%
aren't used to meditating.

00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:52.278 align:middle line:84%
So I teach you the pranayam
and asanas and I teach--

00:39:52.278 --> 00:39:53.570 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Show me how you do that.

00:39:53.570 --> 00:39:55.805 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: So I start with my face.

00:39:55.805 --> 00:39:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And some people like
to use their arms,

00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:59.080 align:middle line:90%
because our hands touch things.

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:02.440 align:middle line:84%
So I start with my face,
and I go to my head.

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:04.960 align:middle line:90%
I start with my head, down.

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:07.010 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: You teach the
students the same technique?

00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:08.177 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: Yes, before any day.

00:40:08.177 --> 00:40:09.748 align:middle line:90%
The day before I do anything.

00:40:09.748 --> 00:40:11.790 align:middle line:84%
That way, they can meditate
before every session.

00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:13.610 align:middle line:90%
It's important.

00:40:13.610 --> 00:40:18.790 align:middle line:84%
And they go back to our
heart, and I go to my hands,

00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:21.010 align:middle line:90%
back to my heart.

00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And women will massage
their left side first.

00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:25.900 align:middle line:84%
Men will massage their
right side first.

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:26.830 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Interesting.

00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:30.100 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: I can't
remember exactly why.

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:32.080 align:middle line:84%
It's something-- it
was a proven tool that

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:35.410 align:middle line:84%
was this long ago, that ancient
time that's been passed.

00:40:35.410 --> 00:40:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And so of course, the
terminology has changed.

00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:39.670 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: What does
the touching do?

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:41.890 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: It connects
you to yourself,

00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:47.960 align:middle line:84%
because we're so busy here,
traffic, work, children,

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:51.010 align:middle line:90%
spouses, anxiety.

00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:52.810 align:middle line:84%
And this reconnection,
this reminds you

00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:55.120 align:middle line:84%
that you're here,
back to our heart.

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:57.570 align:middle line:90%
Back to our heart, our feet.

00:40:57.570 --> 00:40:59.320 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Do you do it
with your eyes closed?

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.430 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: I do it
with my eyes open.

00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:01.660 align:middle line:90%
You can with your eyes closed.

00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:02.460 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: OK.

00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:06.340 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: And again, women will
massage their left first.

00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:09.880 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll do our
pranayam, our asanas,

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:11.410 align:middle line:90%
which is a nostril breathing.

00:41:11.410 --> 00:41:12.730 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: The nostrils, yeah.

00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:18.820 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: Out and in, out and
in, out and in, out and in.

00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:21.850 align:middle line:90%
And I speed the process up.

00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:24.230 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: How do you know
when you're finished?

00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:25.210 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: Just do.

00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:26.260 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: It just hits you?

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:27.093 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: You just do.

00:41:27.093 --> 00:41:28.780 align:middle line:84%
Everyone-- some
people do it shorter.

00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:30.700 align:middle line:90%
Some people do it longer.

00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:32.500 align:middle line:84%
Some people can't
meditate for long,

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:34.240 align:middle line:84%
because they're not
used to sitting still

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:35.720 align:middle line:90%
within themselves.

00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:38.200 align:middle line:84%
I used to only meditate
for 20 minutes a day.

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:39.710 align:middle line:90%
Then it started to grow.

00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:40.960 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Now you're three hours.

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:42.190 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: Now I'm three hours.

00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:45.460 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: Once you do this,
what does it do for you?

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:47.480 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: It calms me.

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:49.352 align:middle line:84%
I didn't meditate
today, so I'm still

00:41:49.352 --> 00:41:50.560 align:middle line:90%
kind of-- ch, ch, ch, ch, ch.

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:52.270 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: A little jittery?

00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:53.590 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: Yes, but it--

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:56.410 align:middle line:84%
it brings you into
a still moment

00:41:56.410 --> 00:41:59.140 align:middle line:84%
of breathing that's more
synchronized with your body

00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:00.750 align:middle line:90%
movement.

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:02.893 align:middle line:84%
And-- and it can rotate
through your mind,

00:42:02.893 --> 00:42:05.310 align:middle line:84%
and it allows your subconscious
mind-- your conscious mind

00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:07.980 align:middle line:84%
to calm down and your
subconscious mind

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:09.720 align:middle line:84%
to kind of fill
in and take over.

00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:12.810 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: What would you say
is the most important aspect

00:42:12.810 --> 00:42:16.250 align:middle line:90%
of remote viewing, why we do it?

00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:19.390 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: To find out the truth.

00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:24.420 align:middle line:84%
Remote viewing was
created to know the truth.

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:27.430 align:middle line:84%
There's so many mysteries
that are buried.

00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:28.570 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Many.

00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:35.180 align:middle line:84%
JEANEE: There's so
many things that just--

00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:36.000 align:middle line:90%
we don't know.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.150 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
really happened.

00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:39.920 align:middle line:90%
How was this really made?

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:41.420 align:middle line:90%
How did this really happen?

00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:43.760 align:middle line:90%
Who really did this?

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:45.320 align:middle line:90%
Do we have a hunch?

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:47.570 align:middle line:84%
Can we follow that
hunch and move forward?

00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:50.612 align:middle line:84%
And it's the
all-knowing, the truth,

00:42:50.612 --> 00:42:53.070 align:middle line:84%
which is why a lot of people
didn't want civilians to know.

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:53.870 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Interesting.

00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:54.765 align:middle line:90%
What's next for you?

00:42:54.765 --> 00:42:55.890 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: What's next for me?

00:42:55.890 --> 00:42:56.690 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Yes.

00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:58.770 align:middle line:90%
JEANEE: To continue to teach.

00:42:58.770 --> 00:43:00.000 align:middle line:90%
I want to teach.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:00.810 align:middle line:90%
I want to grow.

00:43:00.810 --> 00:43:02.070 align:middle line:90%
I want to do more conferences.

00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:04.590 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk more
about remote viewing.

00:43:04.590 --> 00:43:05.465 align:middle line:90%
I want to learn more.

00:43:05.465 --> 00:43:07.507 align:middle line:84%
NOORY: How do people get
a hold of you, PrinCess?

My website is being
constructed, reconstructed.

00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:28.230 align:middle line:10%
And my website is
princessviews.net.

00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:31.140 align:middle line:90%


00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:34.455 align:middle line:84%
But like I said, it's being
moved around at this moment,

00:43:34.455 --> 00:43:36.330 align:middle line:84%
so it looks a little
wonky, but you can still

00:43:36.330 --> 00:43:37.890 align:middle line:90%
find me there as well.

00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, that's
how you can find me.

00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:41.750 align:middle line:90%
NOORY: Fascinating.

00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:43.480 align:middle line:84%

I've interviewed many, many
remote viewers in my career,

00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:53.200 align:middle line:10%
but PrinCess Jeanee
is the very first one

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:56.110 align:middle line:10%
who has undergone
a training program

00:43:56.110 --> 00:43:58.000 align:middle line:10%
and now is teaching
other people.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:58.960 align:middle line:10%
Fascinating.

00:43:58.960 --> 00:43:59.950 align:middle line:10%

00:43:59.950 --> 00:44:02.020 align:middle line:10%
