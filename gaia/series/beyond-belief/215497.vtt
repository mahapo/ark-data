>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.680 align:middle line:10%
Debbi Dachinger is back with
us, a journalist and shaman

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.400 align:middle line:10%
who explores interactions
between extraterrestrials

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.260 align:middle line:10%
and worldwide
Indigenous cultures.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, she focuses on how star
beings influenced our spiritual

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.830 align:middle line:84%
evolution, and how the history
between humans and ETs dates

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.180 align:middle line:90%
back as far as 14,000 BC.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And be sure to stay
tuned as you will

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.890 align:middle line:84%
find some incredible information
at the end of this program.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.910 align:middle line:84%
While it may be ancient
history, is actually

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.220 align:middle line:84%
applicable in your
life and you're

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.490 align:middle line:90%
going to want to know this.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.397 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back, Debbi.

00:00:57.397 --> 00:00:59.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DEBBI DACHINGER: It's a joy
and a pleasure to be here,

00:00:59.730 --> 00:00:59.940 align:middle line:90%
George.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:00.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How have you been?

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.275 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Really, really
well and really, really busy.

00:01:03.275 --> 00:01:06.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you mix
being a journalist and shaman?

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.650 align:middle line:10%
>>DACHINGER: I was
a journalist first,

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.260 align:middle line:10%
and I've always
been an aggregator,

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.980 align:middle line:10%
collector of information.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.070 align:middle line:10%
Shamanism came to me
in very unexpected ways

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.230 align:middle line:10%
but because I have a
really curious mind,

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.360 align:middle line:10%
I decided to go down
the rabbit hole.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it was about
gaining information, data,

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.210 align:middle line:84%
so I could better
understand shamanism

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.410 align:middle line:84%
and in regards to
myself and my life.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.160 align:middle line:10%
But what happened was
I changed tremendously

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.890 align:middle line:10%
and I found I have a
passion for the Indigenous

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.320 align:middle line:10%
and their culture,
I found that some

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.680 align:middle line:10%
of the things I was getting
downloads, such as I

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.080 align:middle line:10%
think that the Indigenous
and the shamans

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.370 align:middle line:10%
and extraterrestrials
have had a relationship.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And as I dug deeper,
I found that, indeed,

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.205 align:middle line:90%
throughout history, they do.

00:01:46.205 --> 00:01:47.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No question.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:48.640 align:middle line:90%
We'll get into that too.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.290 align:middle line:90%
Now, you're a certified shaman.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.520 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: A certified shaman
is somebody who actually I

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.790 align:middle line:84%
would put it akin to somebody
who's becoming a therapist.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.560 align:middle line:84%
You have to get
an education, you

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.330 align:middle line:84%
put in a certain
amount of hours.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And then you get
certified, you have

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.440 align:middle line:84%
to do clinical studies with
people and experiences.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.850 align:middle line:90%
And I did the same.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.550 align:middle line:84%
I started originally
working with a shaman,

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.530 align:middle line:90%
a female who lived in my town.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And we would meet for
eight months every week.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.780 align:middle line:84%
We would meet in the forest
and do this journeying work.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And then I went on to work
with Dr. Alberto Villoldo

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.070 align:middle line:90%
and The Four Winds Society.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.650 align:middle line:90%
Very intense six month program.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.010 align:middle line:84%
I went on to become a
Munich rights practitioner.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.770 align:middle line:84%
After that, I did animal spirit
medicine with Puma Fredy Singona

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:33.790 align:middle line:90%
Quispe.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.870 align:middle line:90%
And he's out of Peru.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And then finally with
Don Oscar Miro-Quesada.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And that specifically was
the Pachacuti mesa tradition.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.590 align:middle line:84%
So, again, I went into it
for knowledge, for curiosity,

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.130 align:middle line:90%
but I came out fully changed.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.590 align:middle line:84%
Because every time I learned
these healing practices,

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.410 align:middle line:84%
that I was so lucky
and fortunate to learn,

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.890 align:middle line:84%
everything that I did
in a trade changed

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.350 align:middle line:84%
me, everything I did with other
people outside of the class

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:01.410 align:middle line:90%
changed them.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.560 align:middle line:84%
And now, of course,
years later, I've

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.590 align:middle line:84%
been doing all these privates
and group sessions with people

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.730 align:middle line:84%
shamanically, and I see
massive changes with people.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And a
certified shaman is

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.115 align:middle line:84%
much better than being a
certifiable shaman, right?

00:03:15.115 --> 00:03:16.620 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Very good.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.790 align:middle line:90%
I would say so.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very clear to call
myself a shamanic practitioner

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.040 align:middle line:84%
because I am not somebody whose
lineage has deemed me a shaman,

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.270 align:middle line:84%
a spirit has not come to me,
I haven't been through some

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.700 align:middle line:84%
of the initiatory experiences
that true shamans have

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.850 align:middle line:84%
so I do call myself
a practitioner.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In any specific
tribe, who appoints the shaman?

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.165 align:middle line:84%
Or how does the shaman become
who he-- who he or she is?

00:03:43.165 --> 00:03:44.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: It's
a great question,

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.190 align:middle line:84%
because being called a shaman
is something of great respect.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.840 align:middle line:84%
And a shaman never calls
themselves a shaman,

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.780 align:middle line:84%
but, indeed, it is the
community, it's the lineage,

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.460 align:middle line:84%
it is the tribe and it is the
shamanic beings, the entities

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.160 align:middle line:84%
that surround the community
that say, you're next in line,

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.970 align:middle line:90%
my friend.

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And when they are
next in line, they

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.490 align:middle line:84%
have to go through an amazing
initiatory experience.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.800 align:middle line:90%
Part of that is death.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.420 align:middle line:84%
It's death, rebirth and coming
back with wild abilities.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.300 align:middle line:84%
So specifically
the death can look

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:22.290 align:middle line:84%
like a near-death experience, it
can look like a mental illness

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.610 align:middle line:90%
or being struck by lightning.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And another thing
that they experience

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.090 align:middle line:84%
is while in a
psychic trance, they

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.560 align:middle line:90%
will meet a ferocious animal.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.580 align:middle line:84%
That ferocious animal will
eat them, dismember them.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.910 align:middle line:84%
And I understand it's a
very terrifying experience.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And then-- yeah,
imagine 100 times

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.810 align:middle line:84%
boa constrictor meeting
you in a psychic trance

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.100 align:middle line:84%
and you know it's
very much looking

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.790 align:middle line:90%
at you like you are a meal.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And, indeed, it will
eat-- in a trance--

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.558 align:middle line:84%
it will eat the shaman and
then after it's ingested--

00:04:57.558 --> 00:04:58.725 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It seems realistic.

00:04:58.725 --> 00:05:01.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Oh, yes, very
much so because it's terrifying

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.630 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.780 align:middle line:84%
But then they're blown back into
being and when they come back,

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.826 align:middle line:84%
they have all these
uncanny and wild abilities.

00:05:08.826 --> 00:05:11.206 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you believe
in extraterrestrials?

00:05:11.206 --> 00:05:13.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: I
absolutely do, yes.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do shamans?

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:15.520 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Yes.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, shamans and
the Indigenous cultures

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.460 align:middle line:84%
worldwide have been
in communication

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:22.880 align:middle line:90%
with extraterrestrials.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.955 align:middle line:84%
What's fascinating about that is
that the Indigenous tribes come

00:05:26.955 --> 00:05:28.080 align:middle line:90%
from the extraterrestrials.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How far back?

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Over 100,000
years old and, frankly,

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.295 align:middle line:84%
since the inception of
the Indigenous cultures.

00:05:35.295 --> 00:05:36.105 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:05:36.105 --> 00:05:37.400 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Yeah.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.080 align:middle line:90%
So it's very prevalent.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.530 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in shamanic cultures
and Indigenous cultures,

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.200 align:middle line:84%
they wouldn't be
sitting around having

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.410 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the conversations
that white people have

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.570 align:middle line:84%
because it's so much a part
of their everyday life,

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.640 align:middle line:84%
they're benevolent
beings, they're friends,

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.230 align:middle line:84%
they're mentors,
they're teachers,

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.755 align:middle line:84%
and they have guided them
since the beginning of time.

00:05:56.755 --> 00:06:01.456 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Debbi, what makes the
Japanese so unusual with ETs?

00:06:01.456 --> 00:06:04.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: They went through a
period called the Jomon period,

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:09.780 align:middle line:84%
and that was 14,000
BCE through 300 BCE.

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.630 align:middle line:84%
That's about a
10,000 year period.

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And during the
Jomon period, they

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.430 align:middle line:84%
were visited by these
extraterrestrials.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.420 align:middle line:84%
And they created these
earthen clay ware.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:22.770 align:middle line:90%
They call them dogu.

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.842 align:middle line:90%
And dogu literally means clay.

00:06:24.842 --> 00:06:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got a
picture of that too.

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:27.720 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at that.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.245 align:middle line:90%
But explain what a dogu is.

00:06:29.245 --> 00:06:31.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: So if you look
at the picture of the dogu,

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.890 align:middle line:84%
you'll notice that
it's disproportionate.

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And so typically it
has bigger features

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.710 align:middle line:90%
like the hips, the legs.

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And in this
particular photo, you

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.715 align:middle line:84%
see it as large coffee
shaped bisected eyes.

00:06:45.715 --> 00:06:47.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were
these things alive?

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:49.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: These were
the extraterrestrial beings

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.780 align:middle line:90%
that came to visit them.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.970 align:middle line:10%
There are four
different kinds of dogu,

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.180 align:middle line:10%
but we're specifically
looking at what they

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.680 align:middle line:10%
called the goggle-eyed dogu.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.340 align:middle line:84%
The goggle-eyed had
these large eyes

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.750 align:middle line:90%
because they watched after them.

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:07.220 align:middle line:84%
But you'll see some of these
are for fertility so they were

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.560 align:middle line:84%
for different reasons,
and some of them

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.590 align:middle line:84%
were absolutely the
astronaut-looking dogu.

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And the dogu were
amazing to them.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.920 align:middle line:84%
They lasted all this
time, 10,000 years.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.400 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly, when
the Jomon period was over,

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.780 align:middle line:90%
it all disappeared.

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.230 align:middle line:84%
They were used for shamanic
rites, for rituals,

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:30.720 align:middle line:84%
and when they were
done, the shamans,

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.570 align:middle line:84%
the Indigenous, the
Japanese Indigenous

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:34.110 align:middle line:90%
would take them and break them.

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:37.010 align:middle line:84%
So you'll find a lot
of shards of the dogu.

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:40.045 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do the Japanese
still acknowledge the dogus?

00:07:40.045 --> 00:07:41.300 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Absolutely.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And what's incredible
is sometimes

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:45.750 align:middle line:84%
you can look at one of
their stores or stations,

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:49.470 align:middle line:84%
and they'll still have a bust
of a dogu above the store.

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:51.530 align:middle line:84%
So they're still
acknowledged, and they

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:54.325 align:middle line:84%
have unearthed thousands
and thousands of these.

00:07:54.325 --> 00:07:56.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, the
pictures we just

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:00.990 align:middle line:84%
saw, are they generally
universal in that kind of look?

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:03.040 align:middle line:84%
Are there many dogus
that look like that?

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Yeah, there's
four different kinds of dogu.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.740 align:middle line:90%
One of them is for fertility.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And there's other reasons
why they created the dogu.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.590 align:middle line:90%
They were very artistic.

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:16.080 align:middle line:84%
This particular period the
Japanese were hunter, gatherers.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And something that I
think is really important,

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.030 align:middle line:84%
germane to the
conversation you and I

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:24.470 align:middle line:84%
are having, is that all of these
Indigenous cultures believed in

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:25.650 align:middle line:90%
animism.

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:29.940 align:middle line:84%
Animism meaning that everything
is alive, everything has a soul.

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:32.010 align:middle line:84%
You and I, George,
are connected.

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:34.230 align:middle line:84%
Everybody here with
us today is connected.

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:37.049 align:middle line:84%
The skies, the
plants, the animals,

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:41.970 align:middle line:84%
the star brothers and sisters,
the oceans, we are all one.

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And so these particular people,
the Japanese, they were hunter,

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:45.810 align:middle line:90%
gatherers.

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:47.900 align:middle line:84%
And how they lived
on the land, how

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.820 align:middle line:84%
they related to the dogu
who came to visit them,

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.725 align:middle line:84%
they were taught the
laws by the dogu.

00:08:52.725 --> 00:08:55.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were there
other Indigenous cultures

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:57.796 align:middle line:84%
that benefited from
the ET relationships?

00:08:57.796 --> 00:08:59.190 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Oh, so many.

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:00.960 align:middle line:90%
So many.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.330 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'll talk about
the Zangbetos.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:08.670 align:middle line:84%
So in Zimbabwe, they have
this incredible festival.

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And something you'll notice,
besides the animism, that

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:13.980 align:middle line:84%
carries through all
these Indigenous

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:16.390 align:middle line:84%
cultures with the
extraterrestrials,

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:19.650 align:middle line:84%
the other thing is it's
ancient but it still carries

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:21.370 align:middle line:90%
on today in the modern world.

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:23.200 align:middle line:84%
So they've passed
this down orally,

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.470 align:middle line:84%
through painting on
things, rocks, caves.

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:27.725 align:middle line:90%
We still see it today.

00:09:27.725 --> 00:09:29.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's their tradition.

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:30.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Very much.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.110 align:middle line:90%
And they believe in this.

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And in Zimbabwe,
once a year they

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.720 align:middle line:84%
have this animal festival--
this annual festival.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And they dress up in
these palm fronds.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And they're quite large,
these extraterrestrial beings

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.260 align:middle line:90%
called Zangbeto.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.330 align:middle line:84%
They say that since the
beginning of time and even

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:53.930 align:middle line:84%
before, they were created,
the Zimbabwe people,

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:56.160 align:middle line:90%
that these Zangbeto were there.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.390 align:middle line:90%
They protect them.

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:59.460 align:middle line:84%
That is a big part
of what they do.

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:04.850 align:middle line:84%
What's amazing about the
Zangbeto, in particular, is

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:08.250 align:middle line:84%
that they could eat glass
and nothing will happen,

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.070 align:middle line:90%
they can walk on water.

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And what is the secret
to the Zangbeto?

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:14.130 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:16.800 align:middle line:84%
Meaning no thing
is inside of it.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.920 align:middle line:84%
You can see it dance
through the village,

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.810 align:middle line:84%
and you will pick it
up and see there's

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:23.130 align:middle line:90%
nothing inside making it dance.

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And they say that the spirits
of the extraterrestrials

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:29.240 align:middle line:84%
still come and they
inhabit these palm frond

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.005 align:middle line:90%
beings that dance and protect.

00:10:32.005 --> 00:10:33.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Truly remarkable.

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:36.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, the ET races that
are in communication

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:41.275 align:middle line:84%
with the ancient Aboriginals,
what kind of tie-in is that?

00:10:41.275 --> 00:10:42.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Yes.

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:45.680 align:middle line:84%
So that's over
100,000 years old.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:50.630 align:middle line:84%
In the Northwestern
location of Australia

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:52.470 align:middle line:90%
is a place called Kimberley.

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And every rock and
cave that you go into

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.760 align:middle line:84%
shows these
incredible depictions

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.110 align:middle line:90%
of extraterrestrial beings.

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:03.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, very specifically,
they're called

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.670 align:middle line:90%
Wandjina, which means hole.

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And you will see all of
these painted Wandjina,

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:13.220 align:middle line:84%
and they have these huge heads,
these really large eyes, a nose

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:14.670 align:middle line:90%
and no mouth.

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:19.530 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, why are
they painted white in the face?

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:21.090 align:middle line:90%
These were Aborigines.

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:22.910 align:middle line:90%
They have black faces.

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:25.650 align:middle line:90%
Why are there such large eyes?

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:27.750 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
always in contact.

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:30.510 align:middle line:84%
Why were they painted
with no mouth?

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:33.450 align:middle line:84%
No mouth because there
was no reason to speak.

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:34.405 align:middle line:90%
They used telepathy.

00:11:34.405 --> 00:11:36.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, the
cave art you just

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.190 align:middle line:90%
described is fascinating to me.

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:39.740 align:middle line:90%
We've got some pictures.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:42.070 align:middle line:84%
I want you to tell us what
we're looking at here.

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:43.190 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Yes.

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:46.113 align:middle line:84%
And so here's what's incredible
about these Wandjinas

00:11:46.113 --> 00:11:47.030 align:middle line:90%
that we're looking at.

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:50.520 align:middle line:84%
You see the big watchful
eyes and the no mouths,

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:54.450 align:middle line:84%
and what this is actually
representative of

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:55.938 align:middle line:90%
and reminiscent of, George--

00:11:55.938 --> 00:11:57.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They look like ghosts.

00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:00.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: They
look like Grey aliens.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And so these look like
modern day Grey beings.

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:08.220 align:middle line:84%
But you consider, if we were
looking at something 100,000

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:10.780 align:middle line:84%
years old that were
human, of course,

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:13.240 align:middle line:84%
we would have looked
very different back then.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.780 align:middle line:84%
So, of course, the Greys looked
very different back then.

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see they have a halo
over their head or a helmet,

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.750 align:middle line:90%
so it's like an astronaut.

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And they say that in this area,
the Aboriginal people were also

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:31.320 align:middle line:84%
visited by some beings from
a planet called Beta and also

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.460 align:middle line:84%
visited by beings
from the Pleiades.

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:37.170 align:middle line:84%
And the Pleiades had a lot to do
with many different Indigenous

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:38.710 align:middle line:90%
cultures around the world.

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:41.110 align:middle line:90%
In fact, there's a planet in--

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:43.090 align:middle line:84%
these are all
beautiful depictions.

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:47.830 align:middle line:84%
There is a planet in the
Pleiades called Maia, M-A-I-A,

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:51.820 align:middle line:84%
where a lot of the Indigenous
cultures were first conceived

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:53.130 align:middle line:90%
before they came to Earth.

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:54.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:59.080 align:middle line:84%
I've always wondered, Debbi, if
ancient cultures like the Mayans

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:03.660 align:middle line:84%
took things from visitors
for their own culture.

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Well, there's
a lot of contention

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:09.260 align:middle line:84%
that the Mayans came
from the planet Maia,

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.120 align:middle line:90%
and that was their inception.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And you think about
the Pleiadians,

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:14.150 align:middle line:90%
and they're wonderful healers.

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:16.130 align:middle line:84%
They're known for their
healing abilities.

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:18.910 align:middle line:84%
And so they have that in common
with all of the Indigenous

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:21.620 align:middle line:84%
cultures because a protocol
for them, of course,

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:24.470 align:middle line:84%
is healing the individual,
the community, the Earth,

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:28.700 align:middle line:84%
and this idea of being all
together, being one with.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And what is interesting
about the Mayans,

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:35.690 align:middle line:84%
they say what happened to them,
how did they suddenly disappear.

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:38.290 align:middle line:84%
And a large portion of
people believe they actually

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:39.890 align:middle line:90%
went back to Maia.

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:41.950 align:middle line:84%
They completed the
mission they had here

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:43.725 align:middle line:84%
and they went back
to their home planet.

00:13:43.725 --> 00:13:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can't
make that stuff

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:49.240 align:middle line:84%
up, that's what's so fascinating
about all this ancient culture.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:50.310 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Indeed.

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:52.910 align:middle line:84%
When something
disappears like that--

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:55.320 align:middle line:84%
I have another one
that's pretty incredible,

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:58.060 align:middle line:84%
the Dogons of Mali
in West Africa.

00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:59.305 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sirius star system.

00:13:59.305 --> 00:14:01.710 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Yes, exactly.

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:03.510 align:middle line:90%
Phenomenal story.

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:06.500 align:middle line:84%
Here are a group of
people, a culture

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:09.170 align:middle line:84%
of people who are deemed
by the rest of the world

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:10.560 align:middle line:90%
to be primitive.

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
they live remote.

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And yet, starting in 3,200 BC,
they have knowledge that Earth

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:20.760 align:middle line:90%
rotates on its axis.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:24.120 align:middle line:84%
They have knowledge of
Jupiter's moon, Saturn's rings

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.942 align:middle line:90%
and also the Sirius planet.

00:14:25.942 --> 00:14:27.025 align:middle line:90%
And what's so incredible--

00:14:27.025 --> 00:14:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They knew of
a binary star system

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:31.765 align:middle line:84%
when nobody had
telescopes at the time.

00:14:31.765 --> 00:14:32.990 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Exactly.

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:35.360 align:middle line:90%
Naked to the eye, invisible.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:39.960 align:middle line:84%
It was impossible to see, they
knew about Sirius B planet.

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:42.080 align:middle line:84%
And all the experts were
scratching their heads

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.400 align:middle line:84%
and saying, how in the
world is that possible?

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.130 align:middle line:84%
And they say, well, there
were beings thousands of years

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:48.850 align:middle line:90%
ago who came from Sirius.

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:50.140 align:middle line:90%
They were the Nommos.

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.910 align:middle line:90%
The Nommos were our friends.

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:55.600 align:middle line:84%
They taught us all about
agriculture and astronomy.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.460 align:middle line:90%
They taught us about the laws.

00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:01.480 align:middle line:84%
And they were with us
for thousands of years.

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:06.430 align:middle line:84%
Not only did they not create
a telescope until 1862,

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:10.500 align:middle line:84%
but they didn't even discover
the planet Sirius B until

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:12.160 align:middle line:90%
the 1900s.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.990 align:middle line:84%
So how did they
know in 3,200 BC?

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And they say that these
Nommos were these amphibious,

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.770 align:middle line:90%
fish-like beings.

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And they put
carvings on the walls

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:26.455 align:middle line:84%
to depict them and show these
Nommos, their friends, who

00:15:26.455 --> 00:15:27.255 align:middle line:90%
taught them.

00:15:27.255 --> 00:15:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Told that people were
talking to the Dogon tribe.

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And they asked them, where
did you get this knowledge?

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:36.730 align:middle line:90%
How did you learn this?

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:39.956 align:middle line:90%
And they all went--

00:15:39.956 --> 00:15:42.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Not so
primitive, right?

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:43.010 align:middle line:90%
Not so remote.

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:44.265 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It came from above.

00:15:44.265 --> 00:15:46.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Yes,
they've been deeply

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.840 align:middle line:84%
in contact and in relationship
with these beautiful beings who

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.240 align:middle line:84%
bequeath them all sorts
of knowledge that helped

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.745 align:middle line:90%
them, helped their culture.

00:15:53.745 --> 00:15:56.175 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what did
the Nommos look like?

00:15:56.175 --> 00:15:57.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Yeah.

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:59.680 align:middle line:84%
They're very interesting,
based on the rock art

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.370 align:middle line:90%
I've seen in the cave art.

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:06.580 align:middle line:84%
But they have feet, they have
hands and they have fish bodies

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:07.730 align:middle line:90%
and heads.

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:09.948 align:middle line:84%
And so they lived in land
and they lived in water.

00:16:09.948 --> 00:16:11.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you remember
the ancient movies

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:16.670 align:middle line:84%
we used to see of Africa, the
Zulu tribes and stuff like that?

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:18.600 align:middle line:84%
What's their connection
to star people.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Africa is a
real hotspot around the world

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:24.500 align:middle line:90%
for extraterrestrial activity.

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And in the Zulu, in
particular, they've

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:30.530 align:middle line:84%
got a word, much like
ours, which is star,

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:32.360 align:middle line:84%
but it's got a
different meaning.

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:35.210 align:middle line:84%
So for them, when they
say the word star,

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:37.370 align:middle line:84%
it means bringer
of enlightenment,

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:38.810 align:middle line:90%
bringer of knowledge.

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:41.620 align:middle line:84%
So they acknowledge
that the stars

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:45.020 align:middle line:84%
hold the wisdom that comes to
them, the benevolent brothers

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:46.555 align:middle line:90%
and sisters who visit them.

00:16:46.555 --> 00:16:50.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did they know
this without being told?

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:52.375 align:middle line:90%
It's obvious they were told.

00:16:52.375 --> 00:16:53.820 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: They were told.

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And they had deep relationship,
deep friendship, a deep kinship

00:16:58.070 --> 00:16:59.270 align:middle line:90%
with these beings.

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:02.270 align:middle line:84%
All over the world, the
shamans, the Indigenous

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:06.109 align:middle line:84%
have had relations have
been brought up by them.

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:11.359 align:middle line:84%
In 1996, there was a
remarkable gathering

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:15.440 align:middle line:84%
of tribes of the Indians,
the American Indians from all

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.460 align:middle line:90%
across the United States.

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And they met and they invited
John Mack, Dr John Mack,

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.970 align:middle line:84%
and the CSETI assistant
director at the time.

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:26.640 align:middle line:84%
There were a lot of
professionals in that audience.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And the American Indians said,
we have two things to tell you.

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:32.240 align:middle line:84%
The first thing is,
we want you to know

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.020 align:middle line:84%
since the beginning
of our people,

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.900 align:middle line:84%
we've been visited
by extraterrestrials.

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:37.800 align:middle line:90%
We love them.

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.420 align:middle line:84%
We've had relationship
with them.

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.380 align:middle line:84%
And they're a big
part of our culture.

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And second of all,
we're issuing a warning

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:46.290 align:middle line:84%
that you need to pay
attention because you're

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:49.380 align:middle line:84%
on the brink of monetary,
environmental, and spiritual

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:50.200 align:middle line:90%
collapse.

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.000 align:middle line:90%
And that was 20 years ago.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.310 align:middle line:84%
It was very kind of them
to issue that warning,

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:56.810 align:middle line:84%
but I think we still have
a lot of catching up to do.

00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:59.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Hopi
Native Americans

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.950 align:middle line:90%
talked about Ant People.

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:02.840 align:middle line:90%
What were they?

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Oh my goodness,
I can say so much about that.

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:09.180 align:middle line:84%
So the Ant People,
this is fascinating

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:11.500 align:middle line:84%
because, honestly, George,
when I first heard this,

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:14.650 align:middle line:84%
I thought giant ants
that live underground?

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:15.910 align:middle line:90%
I didn't believe it.

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:19.480 align:middle line:84%
But the journalist in me
started to dig very deep,

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.880 align:middle line:84%
and I was so
surprised to learn--

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.670 align:middle line:84%
so there have been
many catastrophes

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:25.710 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, about
three of them that

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:29.350 align:middle line:84%
wiped out all of civilization
before we began again.

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And during the second one,
there was a great flood.

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And during that time, the
Hopis didn't know what to do.

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And from underneath the ground
came these giant ant beings.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:44.417 align:middle line:84%
And the giant ant beings invited
the Hopis to come underground

00:18:44.417 --> 00:18:45.500 align:middle line:90%
to save them, essentially.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:46.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:48.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Amazing and
they went underground,

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.480 align:middle line:84%
and there was a whole
society down there.

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.510 align:middle line:84%
There were food
storages, there were

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:54.430 align:middle line:84%
ways of living so
that no matter what

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:58.070 align:middle line:84%
happened on top of the earth,
they were all going to be fine.

00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:59.810 align:middle line:90%
So the Hopi survived.

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:01.750 align:middle line:84%
So for many
generations, until it

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:04.220 align:middle line:84%
was safe to come back
from underground.

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And in that time they learned
enough from the ant beings

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:10.095 align:middle line:84%
to know how to survive
back on the planet Earth.

00:19:10.095 --> 00:19:13.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they look like ants
or do they call them Ant People

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:14.876 align:middle line:90%
because they lived underground?

00:19:14.876 --> 00:19:16.932 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Well,
it's an amalgam--

00:19:16.932 --> 00:19:18.640 align:middle line:84%
and I wish I knew the
real truth but I'll

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.390 align:middle line:90%
tell you what I do understand.

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:23.530 align:middle line:84%
First of all, they sometimes
say they call them ant beings

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:25.750 align:middle line:84%
because they had
very skinny waists.

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And they had skinny
waists because they

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:31.400 align:middle line:84%
were so busy feeding the
Hopi Indians their food.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.880 align:middle line:84%
So that's just a little funny
piece, but it may be true.

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
is, was it really ants?

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:40.670 align:middle line:84%
I hear different channelers,
channelers of extraterrestrials,

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:43.670 align:middle line:84%
sometimes say they were
called that because they

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:46.070 align:middle line:90%
looked so much like that.

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:47.125 align:middle line:90%
But were they really--

00:19:47.125 --> 00:19:48.583 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They really
had big heads.

00:19:48.583 --> 00:19:49.580 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Yes.

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And at one point I had
a great conversation

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:55.380 align:middle line:84%
with Tim Tactics
or Tim Tactical,

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:57.300 align:middle line:84%
as you may know him
here on Gaia TV.

00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:00.140 align:middle line:84%
He used to work for the
government in Germany.

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:01.440 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating guy.

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And he actually
has had experience

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:07.440 align:middle line:84%
seeing these ant beings,
and knows other people too

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.330 align:middle line:84%
in certain locations
in the earth.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.930 align:middle line:84%
So ostensibly they
actually exist.

00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:14.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Those cute
little Kachina dolls

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:17.346 align:middle line:84%
that the Hopis have,
what do they represent?

00:20:17.346 --> 00:20:19.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Kachina
dolls are amazing.

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:22.200 align:middle line:10%
And I was just leaving
Sedona and in the airport,

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.230 align:middle line:10%
and I was amazed to see
in the airport there

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:25.560 align:middle line:10%
was a whole display.

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:27.330 align:middle line:10%
I took a lot of
pictures of them.

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:29.850 align:middle line:84%
The Kachinas are
actually for the Hopi.

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:34.900 align:middle line:84%
They're beings that came in the
spinning silver disks, the sky

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:35.700 align:middle line:90%
beings--

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:36.870 align:middle line:90%
as they call them--

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:38.290 align:middle line:90%
who came to be with them.

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:40.900 align:middle line:84%
And there's a different
Kachina for different reasons,

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:43.360 align:middle line:84%
but each of those
symbolic Kachinas,

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:46.200 align:middle line:84%
we grew up seeing them as
dolls but they actually

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:49.300 align:middle line:84%
were representative
of extraterrestrials.

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:52.193 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you've had your
own encounters, haven't you?

00:20:52.193 --> 00:20:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: I have, indeed.

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell us what happened.

00:20:55.130 --> 00:21:00.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Well, as far
as UFO spacecraft, many,

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.105 align:middle line:84%
driving from Los
Angeles to San Diego--

00:21:03.105 --> 00:21:04.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How many is many?

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:05.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: I've
lost count, and I

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:07.438 align:middle line:84%
haven't thought about
it much but I would

00:21:07.438 --> 00:21:08.880 align:middle line:90%
say between 10 to 15 times.

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:09.755 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:21:09.755 --> 00:21:11.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: And
it's been lovely

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.720 align:middle line:84%
because I feel--
when it happens,

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:17.590 align:middle line:84%
it feels very much like there's
an awareness that happens.

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:19.770 align:middle line:84%
If you listen to Steven
Greer, Dr Steven Greer

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:22.830 align:middle line:84%
will say there are certain
pockets around the United States

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:24.520 align:middle line:90%
where there's a lot of activity.

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.230 align:middle line:90%
Joshua Tree is one of them.

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:29.160 align:middle line:84%
So we took the long drive from
Los Angeles out to Joshua Tree.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.605 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Contact in the desert.

00:21:30.605 --> 00:21:31.720 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: That's right.

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:32.550 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And out there in
Joshua Tree, we were

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:39.570 align:middle line:84%
doing all of our CE five close
encounters of the fifth kind

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:41.670 align:middle line:84%
work, and it was a
beautiful evening

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:43.290 align:middle line:90%
but actually nothing happened.

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:47.190 align:middle line:84%
So at 2:00 AM we got back in
our car, we were driving home,

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:49.970 align:middle line:84%
we were on the freeway,
and all of a sudden, bam,

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:52.800 align:middle line:90%
there is a giant spacecraft.

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And what is-- I woke
everybody up in the car

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:56.120 align:middle line:90%
because I was so amazed.

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.412 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right in front of you.

00:21:57.412 --> 00:22:00.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: No
propulsion, just--

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:01.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hovering.

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:02.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER:
--hovering right there.

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And what was
incredible, at 2:00 AM,

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:08.160 align:middle line:84%
the freeway was
packed with trucks,

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.560 align:middle line:84%
with cars and not
one of them stopped.

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:12.660 align:middle line:90%
Not one of them saw it.

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:16.260 align:middle line:84%
When we could safely get off to
the side of the road, we did.

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And we safely got off and
we were all, of course,

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:23.000 align:middle line:84%
taking pictures and
videos of what we saw.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.370 align:middle line:90%
And then it acknowledged us.

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:29.420 align:middle line:84%
We got back in the truck
to drive back home,

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:30.870 align:middle line:90%
and it followed us.

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:31.830 align:middle line:90%
It tracked us.

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And then at some point over
the 10 and 60 freeways,

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:36.580 align:middle line:90%
it went off on its own way.

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And I've had many
other experiences

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:41.046 align:middle line:90%
on Sacred Land in Arizona.

00:22:41.046 --> 00:22:41.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:42.670 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Yeah.

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:45.280 align:middle line:84%
I've had it in a group
where two nights in a row

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:50.380 align:middle line:84%
we had spacecraft come, and
we wanted spacecraft to come.

00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:54.970 align:middle line:84%
And there was orange triangles
and then incredible light show.

00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And they did it several
times both nights in a row,

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:01.470 align:middle line:84%
and it was without a
doubt they had awareness

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:05.650 align:middle line:84%
that we were there, what we were
doing and our desire to contact.

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:09.845 align:middle line:84%
So those experiences I consider
a good night's work for contact.

00:23:09.845 --> 00:23:11.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, Deb, you
sent us a clip of one

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:13.690 align:middle line:84%
of these extraordinary
sightings.

00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:18.140 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look and have
you tell us what we're seeing.

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:20.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: This is
after Joshua Tree.

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, by the time we
got off the side of the road--

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:25.720 align:middle line:84%
you can hear how busy
the freeway was--

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:26.950 align:middle line:90%
we were so far off.

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:28.265 align:middle line:90%
It's incredibly pixelated.

00:23:28.265 --> 00:23:30.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's not a drone.

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:31.630 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: No, not at all.

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:34.790 align:middle line:84%
It was quite big when
you were closer to it.

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:37.180 align:middle line:84%
And at some point I'm going
to pull back the camera

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:39.310 align:middle line:84%
and you'll get to see
how far I actually

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:42.330 align:middle line:90%
was from it by this point.

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:43.705 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
we could go to--

00:23:43.705 --> 00:23:45.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was
a long poke away.

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.580 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: It was a long poke.

00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:47.410 align:middle line:90%
And thank God for--

00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:48.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was huge.

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:49.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Yeah.

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:53.445 align:middle line:84%
I did a good job capturing
it, but it was amazing.

00:23:53.445 --> 00:23:56.617 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you also
had a healing situation.

00:23:56.617 --> 00:23:57.450 align:middle line:90%
What happened there?

00:23:57.450 --> 00:23:59.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Yeah.

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:02.560 align:middle line:84%
There was a channeler, a
very well-known channeler

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:04.370 align:middle line:90%
for extraterrestrials.

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:07.460 align:middle line:90%
And she was doing contact work.

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:10.820 align:middle line:84%
It was about 20 of us
sitting around in a circle.

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:15.220 align:middle line:84%
And I happened that night to
be sitting in a God-awful metal

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:16.600 align:middle line:90%
lawn chair.

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:20.120 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, I also
had extreme hip problems.

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:23.590 align:middle line:84%
I had osteoarthritis,
I was bone on bone.

00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting for a really
long time in this metal lawn

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:28.340 align:middle line:90%
chair.

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:30.620 align:middle line:90%
I was in excruciating pain.

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:34.110 align:middle line:84%
She's channeling, we're supposed
to be doing a meditation

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:36.640 align:middle line:84%
to bring in contact work
and all I was doing,

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:40.330 align:middle line:84%
George, was praying, please,
help me, please, help me.

00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:43.620 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to disturb the
group but I was in so much pain.

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
two things happened.

00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:50.940 align:middle line:84%
The channeler suddenly breaks
and starts speaking to something

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:53.140 align:middle line:90%
somewhere here in the group.

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know
what's going on.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
a cell phone goes off

00:24:57.930 --> 00:25:00.490 align:middle line:84%
and there's a sound,
there's a horn.

00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's screaming, medical
alert, medical alert.

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And everybody's scrambling
for their phone,

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:07.725 align:middle line:84%
trying to figure out,
is that my phone?

00:25:07.725 --> 00:25:08.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, is it me?

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:09.630 align:middle line:90%
Is it me?

00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:11.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: And it
turned out to be me.

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:12.790 align:middle line:90%
And that was incredible.

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:14.290 align:middle line:90%
My phone had been turned off.

00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:15.430 align:middle line:90%
It was impossible.

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:19.270 align:middle line:84%
But there it was, it was a
medical alert on my phone.

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And I apologized to the
group, I shut it off.

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:26.442 align:middle line:84%
And I turned to the channeler
and I said, I'm really sorry.

00:25:26.442 --> 00:25:28.350 align:middle line:84%
I was in a lot of
pain and I didn't

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:30.670 align:middle line:84%
want to disturb
anybody, and now this.

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:33.100 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh,
don't be sorry.

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:35.500 align:middle line:84%
Now I understand
what was going on.

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.950 align:middle line:84%
So we had visitors
from 500 years

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:41.410 align:middle line:84%
in the future who live
in this land, who came.

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:43.800 align:middle line:84%
And she described
what they looked like.

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And, essentially, they were
an amalgam of all people here.

00:25:47.290 --> 00:25:49.940 align:middle line:84%
They were Black, they were
Asian, they were Latino,

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:50.740 align:middle line:90%
they were white.

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:53.560 align:middle line:84%
They were this beautiful
mixture with long black hair.

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And she said they
were facing me.

00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:57.490 align:middle line:90%
And she was asking them, hi.

00:25:57.490 --> 00:25:58.390 align:middle line:90%
Who are you?

00:25:58.390 --> 00:25:59.950 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing here?

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And they were very
annoyed with her.

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And they were explaining, we're
from 500 years in the future.

00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:05.950 align:middle line:90%
We live in this land.

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:08.530 align:middle line:84%
But we are attempting--
if you will let us--

00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:11.050 align:middle line:84%
we are attempting to
heal somebody here.

00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And they were facing my
corner where I was sitting.

00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:18.370 align:middle line:84%
So she put together the iPhone
phone alert, medical alert,

00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:21.700 align:middle line:84%
them showing up to
heal me and my praying.

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And I felt very moved that
beings would have heard me

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:30.180 align:middle line:84%
in that way and would
have actually taken action

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:31.330 align:middle line:90%
to come help me.

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:33.230 align:middle line:84%
And they did get me
through the night.

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:34.110 align:middle line:90%
They did help me.

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:34.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They did.

00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:36.160 align:middle line:90%
You could feel the difference?

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:37.550 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: A huge difference.

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:39.700 align:middle line:84%
I was able to keep going
in that rickety chair

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:42.390 align:middle line:84%
and finish out the
night and enjoy myself.

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:43.675 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And how are you now?

00:26:43.675 --> 00:26:45.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: I'm great now.

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:48.980 align:middle line:84%
I will say that sometime after
that I had full hip replacement.

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:52.060 align:middle line:84%
So I still had to have
it tended to but they

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:54.010 align:middle line:84%
were able to do what
they did in the healing

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:56.040 align:middle line:84%
that evening to get
me through the night.

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us more
about the orb you absorbed.

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Oh, that was
such a special experience.

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:05.420 align:middle line:84%
We were on sacred land and we
had permission to be there.

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:07.130 align:middle line:90%
Very small group of us.

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:09.170 align:middle line:90%
And I'm just a curious person.

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:11.073 align:middle line:84%
It was pitch black
there out in Arizona.

00:27:11.073 --> 00:27:12.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got
a picture of it

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:14.055 align:middle line:84%
too so let's take
a look at that.

00:27:14.055 --> 00:27:15.860 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Yeah, fantastic.

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:18.882 align:middle line:84%
I decided there
was a tree, and I

00:27:18.882 --> 00:27:20.590 align:middle line:84%
thought it would be
very artistic to take

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:24.350 align:middle line:84%
a photo of the stars through
the branches of the tree.

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:26.930 align:middle line:84%
So I took my phone,
and without a flash,

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:28.930 align:middle line:90%
I kept shooting pictures.

00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, when you--
we don't use a flash,

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:34.500 align:middle line:84%
you have to hold your phone
very, very still for a while.

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:38.820 align:middle line:84%
But time after time, I saw
my finger was in the picture.

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:40.440 align:middle line:90%
And I was really frustrated.

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:42.900 align:middle line:84%
I kept taking photos and I
realized, that's not a finger.

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.660 align:middle line:84%
And I looked and I blew
it up and I realized,

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:47.280 align:middle line:90%
that's some kind of an orb.

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.140 align:middle line:84%
So here's what's
fascinating about this.

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:52.350 align:middle line:84%
If you look down below,
you'll see an angel orb.

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And I think we've all
seen multiple angel orbs

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:56.010 align:middle line:90%
over our time.

00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:58.190 align:middle line:84%
But this is actually
something very different

00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:59.820 align:middle line:90%
in the upper corner here.

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:03.660 align:middle line:84%
It is so huge, it's covering
the tree, the branches.

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:06.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's this beautiful
milky white color,

00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:09.920 align:middle line:84%
it's got these
beautiful pastels in it.

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:11.940 align:middle line:90%
I never knew what it was.

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And just recently I had a
conversation with Wendy Kennedy.

00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:17.790 align:middle line:84%
Wendy Kennedy channels
the ninth Pleiadians.

00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:19.170 align:middle line:90%
They're ninth dimensional.

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And I asked her about
this and she said--

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.840 align:middle line:84%
they said, the
Pleiadians said that this

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:27.390 align:middle line:84%
was a species who was
aware of my vibration,

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:31.245 align:middle line:84%
aware of my curiosity and they
were very curious about me.

00:28:31.245 --> 00:28:33.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could you see that
live or only on the film?

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Only on the film.

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:37.930 align:middle line:90%
Everything else was pitch black.

00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:41.510 align:middle line:84%
I even, at one point, took the
camera out in another direction,

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:45.020 align:middle line:84%
there was a fence, and I caught
a spacecraft on camera as well,

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:45.825 align:middle line:90%
holding very still.

00:28:45.825 --> 00:28:48.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you've had some
wild dreams too, haven't you?

00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:53.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: I have,
and I'm very grateful.

00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:55.730 align:middle line:84%
We're living in a really
interesting time, George,

00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:57.080 align:middle line:90%
where people are waking up.

00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:58.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm waking up.

00:28:58.220 --> 00:28:59.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm always upleveling.

00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's a beautiful
time because most people

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:03.520 align:middle line:84%
who are waking up,
it's not like it

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.960 align:middle line:84%
used to be where
it's a slow up level.

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:08.180 align:middle line:90%
Now it's like from zero to 100.

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the ways that
I've had experiences, especially

00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:16.270 align:middle line:84%
is with the Lyrans, the
lion-like beings, which

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:18.650 align:middle line:90%
is very dominant in my being.

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And they've come to
visit me in various ways.

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:23.370 align:middle line:84%
They've said, don't
you remember us?

00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:24.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
friendly to you?

00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:27.560 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Oh, they love me.

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:30.050 align:middle line:84%
And they've said,
we're your family.

00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:31.060 align:middle line:90%
We're here with you.

00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:32.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In your dream state?

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:34.585 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Also in
my waking state, yes.

00:29:34.585 --> 00:29:35.385 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:29:35.385 --> 00:29:37.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: And in dreams
they've come to visit me

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:40.040 align:middle line:90%
and just pour light over me.

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:43.220 align:middle line:84%
I need do nothing but
receive and be with them.

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And they, absolutely,
are my family.

00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And I feel this strong
kinship with them.

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people today
are waking up galactically.

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:53.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
they want, Debbi?

00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:56.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Oh, I think
they want to guide me.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.370 align:middle line:84%
I think they just
want to be with me.

00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:01.635 align:middle line:84%
I think they know this is
a very dense place to be,

00:30:01.635 --> 00:30:04.240 align:middle line:84%
and that all of us who agree
to be here at this time

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.140 align:middle line:90%
came with a big mission.

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:07.975 align:middle line:90%
And they're guiding us.

00:30:07.975 --> 00:30:12.020 align:middle line:84%
None of them-- for
everybody who's watching,

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:15.020 align:middle line:84%
we all have galactic
family that's here with us.

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:17.200 align:middle line:84%
We just have to open
to the fact that they

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:20.445 align:middle line:84%
are present to what we're
doing and being in this life.

00:30:20.445 --> 00:30:24.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many reasons are
people worldwide experiencing

00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:25.606 align:middle line:90%
these ETs?

00:30:25.606 --> 00:30:26.660 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: A lot.

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:28.260 align:middle line:90%
It's very prevalent.

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:30.770 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of
different ways in which

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:32.370 align:middle line:90%
people are being visited.

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:34.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, first you've
got the hybrid program,

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:38.510 align:middle line:84%
which for some people that
would be an abduction.

00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's a lot of
times the Grey aliens.

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:44.510 align:middle line:84%
I want to be clear, there's a
lot of master geneticist races

00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:47.040 align:middle line:84%
out there, so it's
not just the Greys.

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:51.720 align:middle line:84%
But the Greys are very
prominent in these abductions.

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:52.520 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:57.530 align:middle line:84%
Because the Greys, essentially,
had decided once upon a time

00:30:57.530 --> 00:31:00.390 align:middle line:84%
that these emotions are
not benefiting them.

00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And they thought if
we were emotionless,

00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:05.180 align:middle line:84%
we'd be way better as
scientists and doing

00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:06.690 align:middle line:90%
the other things we do.

00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:09.860 align:middle line:84%
So they literally
manipulated their own genes

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:11.120 align:middle line:90%
to remove all emotions.

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:11.920 align:middle line:90%
And what happened?

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:13.355 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No humor, no laughter.

00:31:13.355 --> 00:31:16.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: No humor, no laugh,
no feelings, no highs, no lows.

00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:18.450 align:middle line:90%
It didn't work for them.

00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, their species they
realize is going to die out.

00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:25.350 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of the hybrid
program are-- it's twofold,

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:29.550 align:middle line:84%
but they are re-engineering
again emotions in themselves

00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:31.630 align:middle line:90%
and creating new species.

00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
part of the program

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:36.700 align:middle line:84%
is the re-meeting of
our galactic family.

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:40.810 align:middle line:84%
So people are brought aboard
ships, they meet their families,

00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:44.470 align:middle line:84%
they have contact with their
families in dream state.

00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:46.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of these
galactic beings

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:51.330 align:middle line:84%
are-- they vibrate so high,
their frequency is so high,

00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:53.530 align:middle line:90%
they can't all materialize.

00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:57.750 align:middle line:84%
So they will meet their earthen
brothers and sisters in ways

00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:59.910 align:middle line:84%
the human beings
that they're related

00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:03.240 align:middle line:84%
to, that they are overseeing,
and they will still

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:05.590 align:middle line:84%
meet us in ways that we
can connect with them.

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:07.860 align:middle line:84%
So it can be psychic
abilities, it

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:11.990 align:middle line:84%
can be taken in our dreams,
many ways, but they are with us.

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:15.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Scientists are
regularly finding new things

00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:17.310 align:middle line:90%
about our DNA.

00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:21.590 align:middle line:84%
Is there any relationship
or correlation with ETs?

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:23.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Absolutely, George.

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:28.580 align:middle line:84%
Our DNA has 3.2
billion base pairs.

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And of those base pairs,
1.5% of it codes for protein.

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:37.040 align:middle line:84%
So for a long time
the scientists,

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:38.420 align:middle line:90%
what's this other stuff?

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:39.590 align:middle line:90%
It's junk DNA.

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:41.330 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
else to call it.

00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:44.110 align:middle line:84%
However, many
scientists since then

00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:46.280 align:middle line:84%
have been fascinated
with our DNA.

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:50.510 align:middle line:84%
So specifically, I'll refer
to the Human Genome Project.

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:55.160 align:middle line:84%
Human Genome Project has done
decades of incredible research.

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And specifically of
the many scientists

00:32:57.550 --> 00:33:02.180 align:middle line:84%
who have made discoveries there
is Mikhalkov and Sherback.

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:04.720 align:middle line:84%
And they wrote a
paper called The Wow!

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.240 align:middle line:90%
Signal, The Terrestrial Signal.

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:10.100 align:middle line:84%
And what they found
out about our DNA,

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:11.920 align:middle line:90%
it's never been junk DNA.

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:15.620 align:middle line:84%
That there's actual
symbology in there.

00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:19.220 align:middle line:84%
They have found coding in
there, mathematical patterns,

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:20.540 align:middle line:90%
hieroglyphs.

00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And when they broke
all those down,

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:26.300 align:middle line:84%
they found that it is an
extraterrestrial interstellar

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:27.480 align:middle line:90%
communication.

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:29.160 align:middle line:90%
They're message boards.

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:31.760 align:middle line:84%
It shows that
advanced civilizations

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:36.420 align:middle line:84%
went throughout the cosmos and
spread life, including on Earth.

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:38.690 align:middle line:84%
And that this still is
some kind of a beacon

00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:42.270 align:middle line:84%
or a communication with our
star brothers and sisters.

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:47.550 align:middle line:84%
So we are made up of a lot of
beautiful different genetics.

00:33:47.550 --> 00:33:50.750 align:middle line:84%
We have over thousands
of different species

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:52.745 align:middle line:90%
from around the cosmos in us.

00:33:52.745 --> 00:33:54.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were saying
we're seeded by them.

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:55.667 align:middle line:90%
We are seeded by them.

00:33:55.667 --> 00:33:57.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Absolutely,
we're seeded.

00:33:57.570 --> 00:34:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And of those thousands
there's five specific

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:04.800 align:middle line:84%
that are dominant in
every single human being.

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:09.889 align:middle line:84%
And that's the feline, the
reptilians, the bird, the avian

00:34:09.889 --> 00:34:13.050 align:middle line:90%
and the Lyran light lion beings.

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:15.540 align:middle line:90%
We all have that inside of us.

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:18.110 align:middle line:84%
Those are the five
dominant genetic seeds

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:19.546 align:middle line:90%
from the extraterrestrials.

00:34:19.546 --> 00:34:23.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Debbi, the late
Zecharia Sitchin believe that

00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:26.870 align:middle line:84%
a ET race called the
Anunnaki came here,

00:34:26.870 --> 00:34:30.280 align:middle line:84%
that they're on a planet that
orbits the solar system every

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:32.510 align:middle line:90%
3,600 years.

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:35.389 align:middle line:84%
Comes around, plays
havoc with us.

00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:37.810 align:middle line:84%
But he believes that
they genetically

00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:42.471 align:middle line:84%
altered creatures that were on
planet Earth, and here we are.

00:34:42.471 --> 00:34:43.554 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:34:43.554 --> 00:34:45.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: 100% it's true.

00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:47.870 align:middle line:84%
Yes, they had a
catastrophe on their planet

00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:49.070 align:middle line:90%
with their atmosphere.

00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:51.860 align:middle line:84%
They needed to find gold, they
came to Earth to mine gold,

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:53.210 align:middle line:90%
specifically in Africa.

00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:56.320 align:middle line:84%
They realized, oh, this
labor is a little intensive

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.130 align:middle line:84%
and maybe we don't
want to do it.

00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And human beings
were fairly savvy,

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:03.230 align:middle line:84%
lived very long lives
at the time, very smart.

00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And so they decided to
genetically alter us.

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And I want to be clear,
that's not all Anunnaki.

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:11.270 align:middle line:84%
That was a rogue
faction, if you will,

00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:13.490 align:middle line:84%
that broke off and did
something they were never

00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:15.615 align:middle line:84%
supposed to do because
we're a planet of free will.

00:35:15.615 --> 00:35:16.815 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They are fallen angels.

00:35:16.815 --> 00:35:17.615 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Yes.

00:35:17.615 --> 00:35:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And we looked at them
like they were gods.

00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:22.640 align:middle line:84%
They changed the
strands of our DNA,

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:26.070 align:middle line:84%
and they altered us and we did,
indeed, do the work for them.

00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:27.570 align:middle line:90%
We did do the labor.

00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:31.740 align:middle line:84%
But the problem was then human
beings started to die earlier.

00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:33.810 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't carry
through on childbirth.

00:35:33.810 --> 00:35:36.030 align:middle line:84%
They started having a
lot of physical issues.

00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's why those five
seed races came to our rescue.

00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:41.580 align:middle line:90%
They saw what was happening.

00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And then the Felines, the
Reptilians, the bird, the Avian,

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:47.570 align:middle line:84%
the Lyrans all donated
to us so that we

00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:50.740 align:middle line:84%
would become who we are now,
the Homo sapiens that we are.

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:53.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So there was a mishap
in the genetic alteration

00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:54.340 align:middle line:90%
of humans?

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:55.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Yeah.

00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:57.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they tried to dumb
us down, the Anunnaki,

00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:59.220 align:middle line:84%
and they did a very
good job of it.

00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:01.610 align:middle line:84%
But it also was
shortening our lives

00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:06.597 align:middle line:84%
and stopping our health so we
had a lot of help at that point.

00:36:06.597 --> 00:36:08.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, first of
all, the Anunnaki who

00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:10.908 align:middle line:84%
did this were
recalled, if you will.

00:36:10.908 --> 00:36:12.450 align:middle line:84%
They were brought
back to the planet.

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:13.740 align:middle line:84%
They were never
supposed to do it.

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And then the other benevolent
brothers and sisters

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.832 align:middle line:84%
from the stars
came and helped us.

00:36:17.832 --> 00:36:19.165 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did they bring us?

00:36:19.165 --> 00:36:22.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: And so they brought
us the genetics for long life.

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:27.040 align:middle line:84%
And what they really brought
us, going back to animism,

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:30.250 align:middle line:84%
going back to the idea
that we are all one,

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:32.800 align:middle line:84%
there is no separation
in this web of life,

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:35.200 align:middle line:84%
we are literally
made of the genetics,

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:38.500 align:middle line:84%
the same material as our
star brothers and sisters.

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:41.860 align:middle line:84%
So what we see, who we
see, who we interact with,

00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:45.190 align:middle line:84%
they are our cousins,
our brothers and sisters.

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:47.010 align:middle line:84%
There's a race
called the Yak Yak.

00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And they are part
extraterrestrial, part human.

00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:54.845 align:middle line:84%
The Sassani, Darryl Anka
who channels Bashar--

00:36:54.845 --> 00:36:55.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Know him well.

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:58.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: --they are the
Greys, the Zeta Reticuli

00:36:58.230 --> 00:36:59.290 align:middle line:90%
and human.

00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:02.860 align:middle line:84%
So also our genetics are
spread everywhere too.

00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes people here feel
like, oh, we're kindergartners.

00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:09.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're the young
people on the totem pole

00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:12.840 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to all these
cosmic beings and all

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:13.900 align:middle line:90%
the possibilities.

00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:17.010 align:middle line:84%
But, actually, they find
us fascinating because

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:19.750 align:middle line:84%
of our emotions, because
of our resilience because

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:22.370 align:middle line:84%
of our ability to
forgive and keep going.

00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:23.925 align:middle line:90%
We have a lot going for us.

00:37:23.925 --> 00:37:27.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Debbi, in your opinion,
what are the challenges facing

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:30.555 align:middle line:90%
humanity on this journey?

00:37:30.555 --> 00:37:32.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: I think
the biggest challenge

00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:35.170 align:middle line:84%
comes in everything
we've forgotten,

00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:36.850 align:middle line:90%
that we need to relearn.

00:37:36.850 --> 00:37:39.850 align:middle line:84%
That the Indigenous
cultures always knew.

00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:42.860 align:middle line:84%
The fact that we act like we're
separate from one another,

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:46.670 align:middle line:84%
separate from different
genders, cultures, religions,

00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:49.310 align:middle line:90%
ways of being, it isn't so.

00:37:49.310 --> 00:37:51.230 align:middle line:90%
We truly are all one.

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:53.780 align:middle line:10%
And even with the
conversation on disclosure,

00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:56.660 align:middle line:10%
the idea that we're all
separate from these beings,

00:37:56.660 --> 00:38:01.120 align:middle line:10%
there is such a huge
amount of benevolent beings

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:04.330 align:middle line:10%
who protect this Earth, who
protect humanity and are

00:38:04.330 --> 00:38:05.390 align:middle line:10%
well aware.

00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:09.910 align:middle line:10%
I truly believe that, first,
open undeniable contact

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:13.460 align:middle line:10%
is imminent, certainly
in my lifetime.

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And that as part of that,
we need to become prepared.

00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:21.180 align:middle line:84%
To become prepared, it
isn't that difficult,

00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:23.750 align:middle line:84%
but we need to get back
to the basics, such

00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:26.755 align:middle line:84%
as we are part of the
entire web of life.

00:38:26.755 --> 00:38:29.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people find
out more about what you do?

00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: They
can go to my website.

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:33.590 align:middle line:10%
It's my name,
debbidachinger.com.

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:35.790 align:middle line:10%
Also my YouTube channel.

00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:39.360 align:middle line:10%
I've got an 18 year
podcast and radio show.

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:42.150 align:middle line:84%
You can look me up
under Debbi Dachinger.

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:44.160 align:middle line:90%
I offer shamanic classes.

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And I'm offering
them quite a lot

00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:50.000 align:middle line:84%
right now because I think
the planet is wanting

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.270 align:middle line:84%
a healing, community, ways to
get together and change things.

00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:58.050 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really here to be
of service in that way.

00:38:58.050 --> 00:38:58.870 align:middle line:90%
It's a great joy.

00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:02.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Debbi, tell us
about this entire business

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:07.082 align:middle line:84%
of shamanism and how important
it is to heal the world.

00:39:07.082 --> 00:39:10.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: The ancient
shamans and the Indigenous

00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:13.160 align:middle line:90%
knew what we need to relearn.

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And what they teach us
is that we are totally

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:19.230 align:middle line:84%
connected to the
entire web of life,

00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:21.970 align:middle line:84%
that everything has a heart,
everything has a soul,

00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:27.450 align:middle line:84%
everything is living and
to live with such respect.

00:39:27.450 --> 00:39:32.140 align:middle line:84%
In April of 2024, George,
a white calf, was born.

00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:34.590 align:middle line:90%
And this is part of a prophecy.

00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:39.040 align:middle line:84%
White Buffalo Woman prophesied
this and all the Lakota,

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:41.860 align:middle line:84%
the Comanche, the Navajo,
all prophesies this.

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:44.680 align:middle line:84%
This is a one in
10,000,000 chance,

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:46.890 align:middle line:84%
said the National
Bison Association,

00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:48.640 align:middle line:90%
that a white calf could be born.

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And as part of the
prophecy it says, hope.

00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:53.820 align:middle line:84%
A lot of chaos, but
it will lead to hope,

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:55.720 align:middle line:90%
a resurgence on the earth.

00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:57.690 align:middle line:90%
So how do we get there?

00:39:57.690 --> 00:40:00.600 align:middle line:84%
I know that every
extraterrestrial being I've ever

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:02.940 align:middle line:84%
spoken to who's been
channeled through somebody

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:05.200 align:middle line:84%
has said one thing,
come from the heart.

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:06.870 align:middle line:84%
You want to do
contact work, you want

00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:08.980 align:middle line:84%
us to know about you,
come from the heart.

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:10.360 align:middle line:90%
How do we heal the planet?

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:11.290 align:middle line:90%
Come from the heart.

00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:12.850 align:middle line:90%
How do we heal humanity?

00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:13.960 align:middle line:90%
Come from the heart.

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:16.360 align:middle line:84%
The heart is where
we all need to live

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:18.650 align:middle line:84%
to become part of
the web of life,

00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:20.840 align:middle line:84%
and to stop pretending
that we're separate.

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:23.800 align:middle line:90%
The Indigenous always knew this.

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And I thank them for reshowing
us the way, reminding us the way

00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:33.370 align:middle line:84%
that once we do that, once
we can live with compassion

00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:35.600 align:middle line:84%
and kindness
towards one another,

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:38.660 align:middle line:84%
once we can remember the
old ways and the practices.

00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And that since the
beginning of time,

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:43.130 align:middle line:84%
these extraterrestrials
have been with us

00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:45.290 align:middle line:90%
and they will be once again.

00:40:45.290 --> 00:40:48.477 align:middle line:84%
They are indeed coming to
visit us in a whole new way.

the beginning of time.

they have healed us,
