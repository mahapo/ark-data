00:00:26.491 --> 00:00:28.490 align:middle line:10%
>> GEORGE NOORY: And
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.610 align:middle line:10%
You know it's
called the Hat Man.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.030 align:middle line:10%
Now, you might be saying,
now what is this all about?

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.940 align:middle line:10%
Heidi Hollis with us,
expert on shadow people.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.800 align:middle line:10%
And now the Hat Man?

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.140 align:middle line:10%
What are we talking about here?

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.570 align:middle line:10%
>> HEIDI HOLLIS: Indeed,
the Hat Man, oh my gosh.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.190 align:middle line:10%
When I had first started talking
about the topic of shadow

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.730 align:middle line:10%
people, I initially
called this phenomenon

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.770 align:middle line:10%
the Hat Man shadow phenomenon.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.517 align:middle line:10%
I thought it was just
part of the same--

00:00:51.517 --> 00:00:52.600 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: One in the same.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.340 align:middle line:10%
>> HOLLIS: Yes, I truly did.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.640 align:middle line:90%
But I did something.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.800 align:middle line:84%
I put all these different
forms of shadow people

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.938 align:middle line:84%
up on my website,
heidihollis.com.

00:01:02.938 --> 00:01:06.820 align:middle line:84%
And I started getting
responses, and oh, I've

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:07.850 align:middle line:90%
seen the shadow cloud.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.420 align:middle line:84%
I've seen the head
and shoulder shadow.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.590 align:middle line:84%
But the responses I got
to the Hat Man shadow

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.020 align:middle line:90%
were way different.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And wow, and I saw the
pattern emerge to a point

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.590 align:middle line:90%
that it terrified me.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.050 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to address it.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.670 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to look at it.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.450 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to-- I just
didn't want to touch the topic.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, what had
initially occurred,

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.950 align:middle line:90%
and I had not seen him.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.920 align:middle line:84%
My college roommate and
I, who had experienced

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.760 align:middle line:84%
a lot of odd
things-- alien beings

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.270 align:middle line:84%
coming our way, positive aliens,
negative aliens, shadow people,

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.180 align:middle line:84%
and then this Hat Man
thing showed up to her.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.972 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I would often
hear her screaming

00:01:48.972 --> 00:01:50.680 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the
night and, you know,

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.770 align:middle line:84%
that something's in her room,
and I used to go running

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.620 align:middle line:84%
and go and check
and see if she's OK.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.675 align:middle line:84%
But that was just her response
to something coming in her face

00:01:59.675 --> 00:02:01.120 align:middle line:90%
she didn't recognize.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.510 align:middle line:84%
So she wasn't ever really
absolutely terrorized

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.500 align:middle line:90%
or terrified.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, this one night I heard
gut-wrenching screaming.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.710 align:middle line:84%
I was sure somebody
was killing her.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:11.550 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh my.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.000 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLLIS: And I mean, I can't
even tell you I just bolted.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.580 align:middle line:90%
I ran to her room.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.620 align:middle line:90%
And I mean, I was panting.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.510 align:middle line:90%
I turned the lights on.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm expecting to see
I don't know what.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And she was backed into a
corner, and she was panting,

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.935 align:middle line:84%
and she was just pointing
and just trembling.

00:02:30.935 --> 00:02:31.850 align:middle line:90%
And I said what?

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:32.760 align:middle line:90%
What is going on?

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.870 align:middle line:90%
She was like, the man.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.120 align:middle line:84%
He just disappeared, just
before you walked into the door.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.520 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what man?

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And she described this man
in a three-piece black suit

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.080 align:middle line:84%
with a chain watch on his
hip, saw this gaucho type

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.980 align:middle line:90%
black hat with a trench coat.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And she said she
saw he had a goatee

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.250 align:middle line:84%
and his eyes were solid black,
and a very pointed nose,

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.050 align:middle line:90%
very pointed chin.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I screamed,
and he did not move.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.200 align:middle line:90%
I was yelling at him.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.390 align:middle line:90%
He did not move.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.730 align:middle line:84%
She said, I don't know what
was going on, what he was.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.720 align:middle line:90%
She said he was so solid.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.170 align:middle line:84%
But again, I had categorized
it as a shadow thing.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.960 align:middle line:90%
I had not experienced him.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.440 align:middle line:84%
But then when I started
getting these emails and people

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.300 align:middle line:84%
were describing the clothing,
the hat-- the different hats.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.800 align:middle line:84%
They weren't always
this gaucho hat.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.450 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it was a fedora.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.320 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it was a top hat.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.574 align:middle line:84%
That's probably the second
most common one is the top hat.

00:03:34.574 --> 00:03:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And George, you're
going to a kick

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.904 align:middle line:90%
out of this one, cowboy hat.

00:03:38.904 --> 00:03:39.820 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Cowboy hats.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.040 align:middle line:90%
>> HOLLIS: Cowboy hat.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.090 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Now, do all
shadow people wear hats?

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.490 align:middle line:84%
Or are all hat
people shadow people?

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.360 align:middle line:10%
>> HOLLIS: That's a
good question there.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.890 align:middle line:84%
The interesting thing, he's
not a shadow person at all.

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.239 align:middle line:90%
He is a total separate entity.

00:03:58.239 --> 00:03:59.280 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Something else.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.613 align:middle line:90%
>> HOLLIS: He is something else.

00:04:00.613 --> 00:04:02.304 align:middle line:90%
He is not-- I mean, darkness--

00:04:02.304 --> 00:04:03.220 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Is he solid?

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.178 align:middle line:90%
>> HOLLIS: He is solid.

00:04:04.178 --> 00:04:05.900 align:middle line:90%
He is a solid entity.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have had reports
from people who describe him

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.840 align:middle line:84%
as being all in a black shadow,
but he's got distinctive edges.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.430 align:middle line:90%
And you don't see through him.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.100 align:middle line:84%
No, some people, I think
sometimes when he's forming,

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.760 align:middle line:84%
people can kind of
see through him.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And I think he can go
in between dimensions.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.580 align:middle line:84%
So he can look like
that sometimes,

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.610 align:middle line:84%
but for the most part
he's a pretty solid guy.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.960 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Now,
what does he want?

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.435 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLLIS: Well, what's
fascinating about him,

00:04:34.435 --> 00:04:37.060 align:middle line:90%
he just stares at people.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.627 align:middle line:84%
And one time, when I was
speaking to you prior,

00:04:39.627 --> 00:04:41.960 align:middle line:84%
you talked about the boogeyman
coming out of the closet,

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what it is with
this guy, but he loves closets.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.790 align:middle line:90%
He loves hanging out in them.

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.080 align:middle line:90%
He likes walking out of them.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.460 align:middle line:90%
He likes walking back into them.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.760 align:middle line:84%
His intimidation
is his presence.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:00.410 align:middle line:84%
For the most part,
he's a being that-- I'm

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.900 align:middle line:84%
suspicious that he does
call upon other forces

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.504 align:middle line:90%
to do his dirty deeds.

00:05:06.504 --> 00:05:07.920 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Doesn't
do them himself.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.120 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLLIS: He does not
generally do it himself.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.410 align:middle line:84%
But he has at times
choked people,

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:14.640 align:middle line:90%
similar to a shadow person.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.640 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So there is
some physical violence.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.598 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLLIS: There can be
some physical violence.

00:05:17.598 --> 00:05:21.730 align:middle line:84%
I've had people
say he shoves them.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.110 align:middle line:84%
What's really rare, he
does speak sometimes.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, the shadow
people-- separate

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.230 align:middle line:90%
beings-- they rarely speak.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:34.360 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they growl.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.590 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes they say things.

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:36.673 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: This one speaks.

00:05:36.673 --> 00:05:39.230 align:middle line:10%
>> HOLLIS: Yes, this
guy, he will talk.

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.330 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What does he say?

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLLIS: Wow, it just
gives me chills, because he--

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:44.748 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And is he guttural?

00:05:44.748 --> 00:05:45.840 align:middle line:90%
[GROWLS]

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.280 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLLIS: He can be, but
sometimes down to a whisper.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And he kind of acknowledges
that he's as bad as they come.

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And one gentleman told
me about this scenario

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.110 align:middle line:90%
that he saw appear on his wall.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.635 align:middle line:84%
And he saw waves and
a storm going on.

00:06:05.635 --> 00:06:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, what
am I looking at?

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.320 align:middle line:90%
This is on my wall.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And Hat Man came up behind
him, and a ship showed up

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:19.460 align:middle line:84%
on this stormy water, and
there was a guy on the ship.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.290 align:middle line:84%
He could see him, and the
ship started to go down.

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And the guy went down with
the ship, like proudly almost.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:30.960 align:middle line:84%
And hat man said, such a man
would do the same for me.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:31.740 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Whoa.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.820 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLLIS: Yes, and I'm
like, he gives these riddles,

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:41.670 align:middle line:84%
but his indication is that he
is where the buck stops when it

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:45.660 align:middle line:90%
comes to negativity.

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.660 align:middle line:84%
But this one other
time, I had a gentleman

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:52.680 align:middle line:84%
that told me that he
introduced himself as Scratch.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's an Old Norse
term for the devil.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.210 align:middle line:90%
So is he the devil?

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.860 align:middle line:90%
Is there just one of them?

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.500 align:middle line:84%
It's different for me
to get these reports

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:09.870 align:middle line:84%
and to distinguish, is this
the same guy sometimes.

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.430 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes
his eyes glow red.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.050 align:middle line:90%
Other times they're solid black.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:15.440 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes he has a goatee.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.640 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes he's clean shaven.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.790 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You think it's the
same entity in this case?

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:22.750 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLLIS: This is what
is-- it's kind of puzzling.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'm still researching
it, because it

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:29.540 align:middle line:84%
is something that is so
absolutely bizarre that it's

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:33.440 align:middle line:84%
hard to put my finger on
exactly if it's the one guy.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.410 align:middle line:84%
I've had people see him with
shadow people next to him.

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:40.010 align:middle line:90%
That has happened.

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:41.680 align:middle line:84%
But I think darkness
is darkness.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.567 align:middle line:84%
I think they're
kind of in cahoots,

00:07:43.567 --> 00:07:45.150 align:middle line:84%
but then do you know
a band of thieves

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:46.559 align:middle line:90%
that ever worked well together?

00:07:46.559 --> 00:07:48.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they work
very well together.

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.090 align:middle line:84%
I think that this guy
sometimes calls upon them,

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:54.800 align:middle line:84%
and they kind of do
his bidding sometimes.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.940 align:middle line:84%
But to say for sure
that it's just the one,

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.220 align:middle line:90%
he's not seen with others.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:01.740 align:middle line:90%
He's usually by himself.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.220 align:middle line:90%
You don't see a whole string--

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:04.261 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: How tall is he?

00:08:04.261 --> 00:08:05.561 align:middle line:90%
>> HOLLIS: --of hat men.

00:08:05.561 --> 00:08:06.850 align:middle line:90%
He's quite tall.

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:08.920 align:middle line:84%
He's usually 7 feet
to 10 feet tall.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:09.670 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh, wow.

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:10.910 align:middle line:90%
>> HOLLIS: He's huge.

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:12.290 align:middle line:90%
He's absolutely huge.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.581 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I would get
these reports, and they said,

00:08:14.581 --> 00:08:15.480 align:middle line:90%
a tall hat man.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, a tall hat man,
tell me how tall this guy is.

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And I started getting
crazy reports.

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:25.430 align:middle line:84%
I had one gentleman tell me he
saw him going down a street,

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:27.210 align:middle line:90%
and he was like 20 feet tall.

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:28.480 align:middle line:90%
He was humongous.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.080 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like--

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.110 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Going down the street.

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:31.568 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLLIS: Walking
down the street.

00:08:31.568 --> 00:08:33.919 align:middle line:90%
He's often seen walking away.

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:35.409 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Nighttime, daytime?

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:36.780 align:middle line:90%
>> HOLLIS: It doesn't matter.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:37.905 align:middle line:90%
Honestly it doesn't matter.

00:08:37.905 --> 00:08:40.830 align:middle line:84%
He is seen more often
at night, but he's

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:41.990 align:middle line:90%
seen at any time of day.

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:44.825 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is he ever seen in
the back seat of your car?

00:08:44.825 --> 00:08:46.450 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLLIS: Why do
you ask that, George?

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:48.120 align:middle line:84%
Is there something
you'd like to share?

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.270 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: No, it's just
that I think he would be.

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:54.950 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLLIS: That is actually
something that has happened.

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:56.940 align:middle line:90%
It happened to a sister of mine.

00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is the scenario,
because I had just

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:05.859 align:middle line:84%
put up my website
that showed him.

00:09:05.859 --> 00:09:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And I'm telling my sister,
hey, you've got to see this.

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:09.410 align:middle line:84%
I want to show you
my new website.

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, Heidi,
I experienced something.

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:12.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
what to think of it.

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:13.911 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, oh,
and here's my site.

00:09:13.911 --> 00:09:16.315 align:middle line:84%
And I pull it up, and
she screams, that's him.

00:09:16.315 --> 00:09:18.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, what are
you talking about?

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:19.990 align:middle line:90%
That's the guy.

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:22.520 align:middle line:84%
She went down her
stairs to-- this

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:26.340 align:middle line:84%
will give you chills--
to go get her laundry,

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:30.120 align:middle line:84%
and he rose up from
behind the dryer,

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:34.480 align:middle line:84%
huge, 7 feet tall or
whatever, and leaning over.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.340 align:middle line:84%
She said, I don't think I
touched a stair going up.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And then the next day,
she gets into her car.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.250 align:middle line:84%
She looks into her
rear-view mirror.

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:45.680 align:middle line:84%
He was in the backseat, and
he had glowing red eyes.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.560 align:middle line:84%
Another time, myself, I
got into my friend's car.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.060 align:middle line:90%
She adjusted her mirror.

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:54.528 align:middle line:90%
He was is in the backseat.

00:09:54.528 --> 00:09:55.800 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Strangling her.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.220 align:middle line:90%
>> HOLLIS: Yeah, right.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:59.235 align:middle line:90%
Why is he doing this?

00:09:59.235 --> 00:10:00.110 align:middle line:90%
Why is he showing up?

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:01.480 align:middle line:90%
He's doing it on purpose.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.120 align:middle line:90%
So is he feeding off the fear?

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:03.880 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.360 align:middle line:84%
I honestly believe he's
marking his territory.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.010 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Tell me the difference
that you think are between

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:13.074 align:middle line:84%
the shadow people
and this Hat Man.

00:10:13.074 --> 00:10:14.740 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLLIS: The
distinction between them,

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:18.910 align:middle line:84%
the shadow people, I mean, they
try to get those gut reactions.

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:20.220 align:middle line:90%
They try to choke people.

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.470 align:middle line:90%
They try to scare people.

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:24.590 align:middle line:84%
They try to trap souls
in certain areas.

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:25.330 align:middle line:90%
They do.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.880 align:middle line:84%
They scatter about,
taking different forms.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.690 align:middle line:90%
This guy comes as he is.

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:32.040 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't try to
hide who he is either.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.660 align:middle line:84%
I think that forms, different
forms, are taken to think,

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:40.369 align:middle line:84%
oh I just saw a bat go by
me, or a bug, or something.

00:10:40.369 --> 00:10:42.160 align:middle line:84%
It's like you just
don't know what you saw.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.154 align:middle line:84%
But this guy wants
to be recognized.

00:10:44.154 --> 00:10:45.320 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And wants to hurt.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.420 align:middle line:90%
>> HOLLIS: He wants to harm.

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:50.420 align:middle line:84%
Why is he showing he's got
the same essential duds?

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.670 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it looks like
a cape people describe,

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:54.060 align:middle line:90%
but it's usually a trench coat.

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.870 align:middle line:84%
But he wants people
to see the trend.

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:58.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm here, and now I'm
here, and now I'm there.

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'm watching you,
and I'm watching you,

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:01.990 align:middle line:84%
and I'm doing the same
thing to all of you.

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:03.240 align:middle line:84%
So what do you
think is going on?

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.573 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And you can't stop me.

00:11:04.573 --> 00:11:06.630 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLLIS: Exactly,
why is he doing this?

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:08.840 align:middle line:90%
What's his point?

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What do
you think he is?

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:13.810 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLLIS: I think he is the
most negative being out there.

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:16.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people want to
call it Satan, the devil.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:20.680 align:middle line:84%
I think he is the culmination
of whatever is to come next.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.312 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why a hat?

00:11:22.312 --> 00:11:23.020 align:middle line:90%
What's he hiding?

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:24.270 align:middle line:90%
>> HOLLIS: He's probably bald.

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:25.646 align:middle line:90%
Just kidding, I don't know.

00:11:25.646 --> 00:11:26.312 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Horns?

00:11:26.312 --> 00:11:28.350 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLLIS: You know,
that would be really,

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:31.350 align:middle line:84%
really disturbing if
he had such a thing.

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:34.634 align:middle line:84%
I haven't had anybody--
oh no, I take that back.

00:11:34.634 --> 00:11:36.050 align:middle line:84%
There have been a
couple of people

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:38.120 align:middle line:84%
say that they did not
see a hat on his head.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.560 align:middle line:84%
But it's usually he's
so in the shadows

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.814 align:middle line:90%
they don't see anything else.

00:11:41.814 --> 00:11:42.480 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:46.360 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLLIS: But I even
had somebody write me--

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.610 align:middle line:90%
you'll get a kick out of this.

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Somebody wrote me and said that
he stole their Freddy Krueger

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.340 align:middle line:84%
hat that they bought from
a store that was for the--

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:55.840 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: The Hat
Man stole the hat.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.850 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLLIS: The Hat
Man stole the hat.

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:00.984 align:middle line:90%
So I'm like, wow, what is that?

00:12:00.984 --> 00:12:02.150 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: He'll put this on.

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:03.240 align:middle line:90%
>> HOLLIS: He will put this on.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.220 align:middle line:90%
So why would he do that?

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:04.845 align:middle line:90%
It disappeared.

00:12:04.845 --> 00:12:05.740 align:middle line:90%
It was gone.

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And it was his
brother's, and he said,

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:10.490 align:middle line:90%
I saw this guy come and take it.

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:13.580 align:middle line:84%
He was wearing the suit, the
trench coat, and everything.

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And he stole the
Freddy Krueger hat.

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:20.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, my book on the hat
man is called The Hat Man.

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
with the phenomenon of him

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.140 align:middle line:84%
is that there's another
phenomenon going

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:31.450 align:middle line:84%
on that's expanding
exponentially as well,

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:34.230 align:middle line:90%
which are encounters with Jesus.

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:36.900 align:middle line:84%
I wrote a book called
Jesus Is No Joke.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And it is essentially-- I mean,
I was a skeptic of such things.

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And for myself to have
had four encounters

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.820 align:middle line:84%
with seeing Jesus of something
that I was like, you know,

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:49.327 align:middle line:90%
come on.

00:12:49.327 --> 00:12:51.660 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So could the Hat
Man be the opposite of Jesus?

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:54.780 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLLIS: You know what,
it's like going back to back.

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:57.980 align:middle line:84%
I've had people have
both types of encounters,

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:00.870 align:middle line:90%
seeing Jesus and the Hat Man.

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:06.200 align:middle line:84%
Not together, but it seems
like Jesus is showing up

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.450 align:middle line:84%
to people on his
side of the fence.

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:11.270 align:middle line:84%
Hat Man is showing up to people
on his side of the fence.

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:14.340 align:middle line:84%
If you've seen the Hat
Man, be a little worried.

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:15.340 align:middle line:90%
Be a little worried.

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:16.280 align:middle line:90%
I have not seen him.

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.160 align:middle line:90%
I have not experienced him.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.330 align:middle line:84%
I think he gets
very close to me.

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:24.390 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But some
shadow people wear hats.

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:25.785 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLLIS: Not
shadow people, no.

00:13:25.785 --> 00:13:26.660 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They don't.

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:27.160 align:middle line:90%
>> HOLLIS: They do not.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.930 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: OK, so
I've heard then--

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:31.100 align:middle line:84%
and I've had a lot of calls
into "Coast to Coast"--

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:35.430 align:middle line:84%
from people who claim to see
beings they've called shadow

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:37.560 align:middle line:90%
people who are wearing hats.

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:38.420 align:middle line:90%
>> HOLLIS: Mm-hmm.

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:39.850 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So you're saying
they're not shadow people.

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:40.870 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLLIS: They are
not shadow people.

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:41.995 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's the Hat Man.

00:13:41.995 --> 00:13:43.990 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLLIS: I've put
out apologies on that,

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:46.700 align:middle line:84%
because I was trying to figure
out the phenomenon myself when

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.290 align:middle line:90%
I first said Hat Man Shadow.

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:51.970 align:middle line:84%
And I was calling him Hat
Man Shadow for a long time,

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:53.930 align:middle line:84%
and then I'm like,
oh, he's not a shadow.

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:57.490 align:middle line:84%
He's actually something worse,
and he's more distinctive.

00:13:57.490 --> 00:14:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And I know a lot of people
do confuse the topics.

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:05.530 align:middle line:84%
But that was early stages for
me trying to solve and figure it

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:06.420 align:middle line:90%
out myself.

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:08.670 align:middle line:84%
And then there are
the hooded beings

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:11.497 align:middle line:84%
that they say are
shadow people as well.

00:14:11.497 --> 00:14:13.080 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's like
the movie "Ghost."

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>> HOLLIS: Yeah.

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:13.620 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Remember them?

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:14.550 align:middle line:90%
>> HOLLIS: Yes, oh gosh, yeah.

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:14.920 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: [GHOST NOISE].

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:15.270 align:middle line:90%
>> HOLLIS: Yeah.

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:16.210 align:middle line:90%
Those are not cool.

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:17.626 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They got
you at the end.

00:14:17.626 --> 00:14:20.620 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLLIS: But yeah, so the
hooded beings are an alien,

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:21.970 align:middle line:90%
and they are dark.

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And the alien beings
work hand in hand

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:27.390 align:middle line:90%
with these shadow beings.

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:28.829 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Are they good, bad?

00:14:28.829 --> 00:14:31.370 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLLIS: The negative beings
that do abductions and whatnot

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:32.690 align:middle line:90%
work with shadow people.

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:33.735 align:middle line:90%
The more positive--

00:14:33.735 --> 00:14:34.120 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Can't be good.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.500 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLLIS: No,
they are not good.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.010 align:middle line:90%
They're horrible.

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:42.280 align:middle line:10%
But it's something that, when it
comes to this whole phenomenon,

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:46.380 align:middle line:10%
when it comes to the
negative versus the positive,

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:49.570 align:middle line:10%
I think it's important
that the only thing

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:52.000 align:middle line:10%
that you can fight
fire with fire.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.506 align:middle line:10%
These things know
how bad they are.

00:14:53.506 --> 00:14:54.130 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:56.530 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLLIS: And you can
feel their presence.

00:14:56.530 --> 00:15:00.590 align:middle line:84%
Why do our cells, very
cells in our body,

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:02.200 align:middle line:90%
scream, oh, get out of the way.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.010 align:middle line:90%
Something's bad.

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:05.280 align:middle line:90%
What's that gut reaction?

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
tell people, you

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:09.840 align:middle line:84%
have to get that gut
reaction to be like,

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.610 align:middle line:90%
I can push it away too.

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is the book
that I was talking about.

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:16.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's see.

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:16.870 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:18.369 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLLIS: The Jesus
Is No Joke book.

00:15:18.369 --> 00:15:19.570 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Jesus Is No Joke.

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:23.150 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLLIS: Yes, and
this is my newest book.

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:25.470 align:middle line:84%
This one is-- I've only
heard back from adults.

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:26.780 align:middle line:90%
But it is a kids' book.

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:28.960 align:middle line:10%
I will have an adult
version, but it's

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.090 align:middle line:10%
to build faith,
the other F word.

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:32.590 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: And of
course the Hat Man.

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:34.631 align:middle line:10%
>> HOLLIS: And the Hat
Man, so this is Diary Blog

00:15:34.631 --> 00:15:36.340 align:middle line:10%
of the Fickle Finders.

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:39.110 align:middle line:10%
But yeah, I mean, I
think it's important

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:43.690 align:middle line:10%
that people build their faith
in order to repel these things,

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:45.600 align:middle line:10%
because if you're
just standing there,

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.475 align:middle line:10%
I mean, oh my gosh, some of the
people that have written me.

00:15:48.475 --> 00:15:51.750 align:middle line:84%
I swung at this thing, and we
started tussling on the floor.

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:52.989 align:middle line:90%
This was a Hat Man.

00:15:52.989 --> 00:15:53.780 align:middle line:90%
This was a Hat Man.

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:57.750 align:middle line:84%
This guy punched him, and he
got thrown up against the wall

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:00.347 align:middle line:84%
and I guess essentially
knocked out.

00:16:00.347 --> 00:16:01.805 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You
believe these people.

00:16:01.805 --> 00:16:03.540 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLLIS: You know,
that's so funny,

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:05.871 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of people--
I'm actually an occupational

00:16:05.871 --> 00:16:06.370 align:middle line:90%
therapist.

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:08.270 align:middle line:84%
I work with a lot
of psych people,

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:10.350 align:middle line:84%
and emotionally disturbed,
and also physically

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:11.590 align:middle line:90%
disabled people.

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:17.110 align:middle line:84%
I know the distinctions between
what's diagnosable and whatnot.

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:20.370 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to this
topic, because I've personally

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:22.990 align:middle line:84%
experienced an array
of strange things.

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:25.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm the queen of
strange, I guess.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a psychic or
anything like that.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:31.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm a Christian, and I don't
hold onto crystals and whatnot.

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:34.340 align:middle line:10%
But it's so much
a part of myself

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:38.370 align:middle line:10%
now to have the faith that I do
in order to repel these things

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:42.490 align:middle line:10%
and to pull everything
full circle with my faith.

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:44.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I try
to tell people in order

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:47.750 align:middle line:84%
to withstand the
coming times, I tell

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:49.980 align:middle line:84%
people you have to be
able to close your eyes

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.560 align:middle line:90%
and feel what's in front of you.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.601 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Why do you seem
to be dabbling, though,

00:16:53.601 --> 00:16:57.100 align:middle line:90%
with this occult type thing?

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:58.790 align:middle line:10%
Isn't that dangerous?

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:00.990 align:middle line:10%
>> HOLLIS: You know, I
don't go looking for it.

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't
come to me anymore.

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:07.069 align:middle line:84%
I'm able to block this stuff
off where my place is clear.

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:10.790 align:middle line:84%
The problem comes when I'm
around others who will ask me

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:13.456 align:middle line:84%
questions on these
things-- George--

00:17:13.456 --> 00:17:14.817 align:middle line:90%
and they tend to have--

00:17:14.817 --> 00:17:16.400 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's what
I do for a living.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:17.109 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLLIS: They
tend to have issues.

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:18.525 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Somebody's
got to do it.

00:17:18.525 --> 00:17:21.990 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLLIS: Yeah, I mean, I
was practicing as a therapist.

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:24.232 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
wanted to finish up.

00:17:24.232 --> 00:17:25.691 align:middle line:84%
I don't judge people
for what it is

00:17:25.691 --> 00:17:27.315 align:middle line:84%
they believe to be
true for themselves.

00:17:27.315 --> 00:17:29.120 align:middle line:84%
So when they tell me
one of their stories.

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.280 align:middle line:90%
I take it for what it is.

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.160 align:middle line:90%
But as a therapist--

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:31.890 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They believe it.

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:33.265 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLLIS: Yeah,
they believe it.

00:17:33.265 --> 00:17:35.930 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I'm not going to sit
there and try to diagnose them.

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:38.540 align:middle line:84%
But practicing as a
therapist, I don't always

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:40.130 align:middle line:90%
advertise what it is I do.

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:42.660 align:middle line:84%
I've had other fellow
therapists that like, hey.

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.220 align:middle line:90%
They ask me questions.

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:46.060 align:middle line:90%
This happened not too long ago.

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:47.060 align:middle line:90%
They ask me questions.

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:49.250 align:middle line:84%
15 minutes later,
one of my patients

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:50.890 align:middle line:84%
is screaming out
in the therapy gym.

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:52.890 align:middle line:84%
The Hat Man showed
up in the mirror.

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:56.160 align:middle line:84%
So it comes in that
sense where it's

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.220 align:middle line:84%
like, I have to tell people
and kind of educate them, like

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:03.500 align:middle line:84%
if you want to talk about this,
you better put up your dukes

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:07.160 align:middle line:84%
and protect yourself,
because they're listening.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And also what's important to
know is so is the good side.

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:13.940 align:middle line:84%
Jesus encounters,
angel encounters,

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:17.040 align:middle line:84%
I have book called Picture
Prayers on angelic encounters,

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:20.240 align:middle line:84%
and how to know that
that's there too,

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.650 align:middle line:84%
and having no doubts
in yourself and where

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:25.750 align:middle line:84%
you stand in your
faith when you're

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:28.970 align:middle line:90%
facing these horrible things.

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:31.860 align:middle line:84%
So often I get people
who are writing

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:34.720 align:middle line:84%
me who are ghost
hunters, and they're

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:35.900 align:middle line:90%
challenging these things.

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, please
don't do that.

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.250 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Don't do that.

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:38.715 align:middle line:90%
>> HOLLIS: Yeah.

00:18:38.715 --> 00:18:39.180 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Don't dabble.

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:41.638 align:middle line:10%
>> HOLLIS: And they're asking
me, how do I get rid of this?

00:18:41.638 --> 00:18:43.820 align:middle line:10%
I had a pretty well-known
psychic recently

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:46.240 align:middle line:10%
come to me, writing
me saying, oh my gosh.

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:49.060 align:middle line:84%
I have somebody coming to me
who has the Hat Man encounters.

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:50.484 align:middle line:90%
I don't want him coming to me.

00:18:50.484 --> 00:18:51.442 align:middle line:90%
Can I send them to you?

00:18:51.442 --> 00:18:54.570 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, I'm not a psychic.

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:56.704 align:middle line:84%
But sure, I'll do my
best to give them advice.

00:18:56.704 --> 00:18:58.120 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You're
becoming, though,

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:01.150 align:middle line:90%
a specialist in this area.

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:02.930 align:middle line:84%
Not a lot of people
dabble in this.

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:03.520 align:middle line:90%
>> HOLLIS: No.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.020 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: So you're there.

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:06.430 align:middle line:90%
You're a clinical person.

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:07.130 align:middle line:90%
>> HOLLIS: Yes.

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:10.686 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And does
that help or hurt you?

00:19:10.686 --> 00:19:13.490 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLLIS: I think it helps,
because I am a people person,

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:16.620 align:middle line:84%
and I do treat these topics as
I would with any other topic

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:21.230 align:middle line:84%
in my life, as casual,
easygoing as I possibly can be

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:23.980 align:middle line:84%
and keeping a sense of humor
about it without making fun

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:25.880 align:middle line:90%
of it.

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:30.330 align:middle line:84%
I try to essentially
make myself available.

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:33.200 align:middle line:84%
I do give advice
oftentimes on these topics.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.070 align:middle line:90%
People write me.

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:37.810 align:middle line:84%
I do it on my radio
show, just to try

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:42.029 align:middle line:84%
to give on-the-level
advice and be as I am.

00:19:42.029 --> 00:19:44.070 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm somebody who's
been there, seen that,

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:46.656 align:middle line:84%
experienced it, got
over it, wrote about it,

00:19:46.656 --> 00:19:49.280 align:middle line:84%
and now I'm trying to help other
people do the same darn thing.

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:53.740 align:middle line:84%
Because it's so difficult
to be faced with this stuff,

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:56.950 align:middle line:84%
and you can't turn to the
person next to you to say,

00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:58.460 align:middle line:90%
hey, look what happened.

00:19:58.460 --> 00:19:59.510 align:middle line:90%
What do I do about this?

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And it breaks my heart
because those people,

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:05.489 align:middle line:84%
if they keep getting laughed
at and their experiences--

00:20:05.489 --> 00:20:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And they
do get laughed at.

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:08.600 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLLIS: They
do, and it's sad.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.270 align:middle line:84%
But some of these
experience that I

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:13.860 align:middle line:84%
get, that I talk to
people, they're gems.

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:16.410 align:middle line:84%
They're something that could
probably change the whole world

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:19.050 align:middle line:84%
if you heard it, but they've
kept it to themselves

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:20.930 align:middle line:90%
because they're so fearful.

00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:23.590 align:middle line:84%
What was interesting to me,
I went to a UFO conference,

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:25.120 align:middle line:84%
and I wasn't going
to lecture there.

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.360 align:middle line:84%
But I had my book, Jesus
Is No Joke with me.

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.901 align:middle line:84%
I said I'm not going
to lecture here.

00:20:28.901 --> 00:20:30.874 align:middle line:90%
My book is on Jesus encounters.

00:20:30.874 --> 00:20:32.040 align:middle line:90%
Do you know how many people?

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:32.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm not kidding you.

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:35.240 align:middle line:84%
21 people came up
to me and said,

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.940 align:middle line:90%
you really got to talk then.

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:39.430 align:middle line:84%
I had an experience
too with Jesus.

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:41.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, what is going on here?

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:44.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm at a UFO conference,
and these people have all

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:47.000 align:middle line:84%
been having these
Jesus encounters,

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.750 align:middle line:84%
but they've kept
it to themselves.

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:49.800 align:middle line:90%
So guess what?

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.320 align:middle line:84%
I lectured about Jesus
at a UFO conference.

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.570 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, well,
here we go, people.

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:55.570 align:middle line:90%
Let's go down this road.

00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:56.570 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And it worked.

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:58.690 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLLIS: It did,
and people were open.

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:01.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not talking about
being preachy religious.

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:01.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm not like that.

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:02.626 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:21:02.626 --> 00:21:05.140 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLLIS: Just, look,
this happened to me.

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:09.890 align:middle line:84%
My faith was in me to
know that the bad is bad

00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:12.010 align:middle line:90%
and call on God for help.

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:14.600 align:middle line:84%
But not to the
extent that I went.

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:18.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's been beautiful,
and it's been fun.

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And as a prior
cartoonist, putting

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:25.340 align:middle line:84%
my book, Diary Blog
of the Fickle Finders,

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:29.930 align:middle line:84%
investigating the other
F word is for faith,

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:33.800 align:middle line:84%
to try to get people to
look at faith with open arms

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.570 align:middle line:90%
without being weird about it.

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:37.950 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Right, so let's
bring this back home to the hat

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:39.850 align:middle line:90%
person for a moment.

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:41.890 align:middle line:90%
Is this a spiritual encounter?

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:43.884 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:21:43.884 --> 00:21:45.300 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLLIS: He's
physically coming,

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:48.560 align:middle line:84%
but I think people's souls
are screaming to them that

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.727 align:middle line:84%
something isn't right about
what's standing in front

00:21:50.727 --> 00:21:51.226 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:21:51.226 --> 00:21:51.870 align:middle line:90%
And I think--

00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:53.150 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Is he death?

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:54.460 align:middle line:90%
>> HOLLIS: He's not death, no.

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:58.262 align:middle line:84%
There's actually another
phenomenon I'm looking into.

00:21:58.262 --> 00:21:59.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you've heard
of this Grim Reaper

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:00.730 align:middle line:90%
looking type of guy.

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:01.330 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:02.250 align:middle line:90%
>> HOLLIS: Oh, I'm on it.

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:04.583 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I keep thinking
back to an old "Twilight Zone"

00:22:04.583 --> 00:22:07.330 align:middle line:84%
show with Robert Redford playing
the role of a wounded police

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:12.860 align:middle line:84%
officer who talked his way into
the home of an old lady who was

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:16.069 align:middle line:84%
convinced he was death
there to take her.

00:22:16.069 --> 00:22:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to give away
the end of the "Twilight Zone"

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:21.536 align:middle line:90%
episode, but she was right.

00:22:21.536 --> 00:22:22.410 align:middle line:90%
>> HOLLIS: Oh really.

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:26.431 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And so death visits
people in different ways,

00:22:26.431 --> 00:22:30.520 align:middle line:84%
ways to comfort you,
maybe ways not to.

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And there was an Anthony
Hopkins movie several years ago

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.740 align:middle line:90%
where death visited him too.

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And so that's
interesting, but you

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:41.640 align:middle line:84%
don't think a hat
person is death.

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:43.140 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLLIS: I don't
think he's death.

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:47.260 align:middle line:84%
I think he is essentially
gathering the troops.

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:50.740 align:middle line:84%
But again, there's
more to it, and that's

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:54.370 align:middle line:84%
why I put together the
book The Hat Man to try

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:56.940 align:middle line:84%
to let people be able
to see their stories

00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:01.720 align:middle line:84%
within the whole phenomenon so
they can pick and understand,

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:02.880 align:middle line:90%
he doesn't just do this.

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:03.910 align:middle line:90%
He also does that.

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:04.680 align:middle line:90%
He also speaks.

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:05.700 align:middle line:90%
He says this and that.

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:08.840 align:middle line:84%
So I do have a lot more in there
as far as segments for people

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:12.850 align:middle line:84%
to connect and to relate
what is going on with that.

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:19.430 align:middle line:84%
But it's really, again, I
think it's very, very, very

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:22.070 align:middle line:84%
sad to the extent
that people are having

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:24.350 align:middle line:84%
such horrendous
experiences with them

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:26.706 align:middle line:84%
where they feel their
soul is in jeopardy.

00:23:26.706 --> 00:23:28.830 align:middle line:84%
And people are answering
their own questions to me.

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:29.400 align:middle line:90%
They're like, who is he?

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.601 align:middle line:90%
He's the devil, isn't he?

00:23:30.601 --> 00:23:31.100 align:middle line:90%
Who is he?

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:32.670 align:middle line:90%
He's here for my soul, isn't he?

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:33.170 align:middle line:90%
Who is he?

00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:34.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, what is
your gut telling you?

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:36.510 align:middle line:90%
You have that gut for a reason.

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:38.320 align:middle line:90%
Don't let me delegate to you.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.030 align:middle line:90%
It's like, trust yourself.

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:40.750 align:middle line:90%
Go with that.

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:44.410 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You've worked
with stories on aliens.

00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:48.320 align:middle line:84%
Do you encounter positive
and negative aliens?

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.090 align:middle line:90%
>> HOLLIS: I had.

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:52.360 align:middle line:84%
I have not been
abducted, but I've

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:56.430 align:middle line:84%
seen nine grays in my
apartment and shooed them away.

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:59.120 align:middle line:84%
A couple days later
shadow people,

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:00.654 align:middle line:84%
and I grew up in
a haunted house.

00:24:00.654 --> 00:24:02.320 align:middle line:84%
So I do have a broad
range of interests.

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.310 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah, you sure go.

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:05.559 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLLIS: So I do look into
a lot of different things

00:24:05.559 --> 00:24:07.479 align:middle line:84%
because I did experience
a lot of odd stuff.

00:24:07.479 --> 00:24:09.270 align:middle line:84%
Some people would say
that's like a medium.

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:12.720 align:middle line:84%
But a medium is somebody
to me that looks into that.

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm just like, hey, it happens.

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:15.280 align:middle line:90%
I get deja vu to me.

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.280 align:middle line:84%
Whatever, I'm going
to live my life.

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:21.170 align:middle line:84%
It happens, OK, and
just address it.

00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And then going on to
the angel encounter

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:27.070 align:middle line:84%
and then the Jesus
encounters, and people ask me,

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:28.000 align:middle line:90%
was that confusing?

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:28.720 align:middle line:90%
What the heck.

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:33.050 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, actually the Jesus
encounters brought clarity.

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:37.110 align:middle line:84%
It helped me to understand, this
is what's been warned about,

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:39.490 align:middle line:84%
these negative and
positive things.

00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:41.640 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are you concerned
at all about them?

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:43.723 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLLIS: I'm concerned
for others who don't know

00:24:43.723 --> 00:24:46.260 align:middle line:84%
what's going on and how they're
laughing at these topics

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:48.060 align:middle line:90%
and not taking them seriously.

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:49.630 align:middle line:90%
Because they are serious.

00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:51.292 align:middle line:90%
But what's that saying?

00:24:51.292 --> 00:24:53.250 align:middle line:84%
What was the greatest
thing that the devil ever

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:55.360 align:middle line:84%
did was make people
believe he didn't exist.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:56.110 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Exactly.

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:58.320 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLLIS: And I'm like, you
better be on top of your game,

00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:58.830 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:02.100 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's such
a passion for me.

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:05.680 align:middle line:84%
It's not stressful for me to
be working on these things.

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:08.220 align:middle line:84%
I love it, and
I'll always do it.

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:10.860 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What do you recommend
to people who encounter shadow

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:13.340 align:middle line:90%
people or the Hat Man?

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:15.910 align:middle line:10%
>> HOLLIS: I tell them, whatever
it is that they're showing

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:18.400 align:middle line:10%
an interest in that they're
looking so deep within you,

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:20.930 align:middle line:10%
you need to find what it
is and break that tie.

00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:21.720 align:middle line:10%
I don't care.

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.940 align:middle line:10%
It's until your last
breath you have a chance

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:26.840 align:middle line:10%
to break that tie.

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:29.340 align:middle line:10%
Even the negative
alien beings, there

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:30.600 align:middle line:10%
are positive alien beings.

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:32.860 align:middle line:84%
There are positive
holy encounter

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:36.610 align:middle line:84%
like beings, angelic
Jesus encounters.

00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:38.130 align:middle line:90%
Call upon that.

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:40.270 align:middle line:84%
Find that within
yourself, and know,

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:42.080 align:middle line:84%
and have no doubts
about yourself

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.452 align:middle line:84%
and where you stand when
you're met with these things.

00:25:44.452 --> 00:25:46.660 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Heidi, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:46.730 align:middle line:90%
>> HOLLIS: Yeah.

00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:47.950 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I
appreciate it always.

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:48.280 align:middle line:90%
>> HOLLIS: Definitely.

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:49.940 align:middle line:10%
