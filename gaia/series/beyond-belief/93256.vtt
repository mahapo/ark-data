00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.815 align:middle line:84%
>>And I think many
people today don't

00:00:07.815 --> 00:00:09.023 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:09.023 --> 00:00:10.777 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:13.660 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.700 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.412 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.412 --> 00:00:19.210 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:26.162 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.162 --> 00:00:28.370 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well, welcome
back to "Beyond Belief"

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:29.480 align:middle line:10%
this holiday season.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.580 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.380 align:middle line:10%
In our previous program with
psychic medium, Laure Lee,

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.460 align:middle line:10%
we talked about the other side.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.500 align:middle line:84%
In this show, we're
going to be talking

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.090 align:middle line:90%
about the angelic realm.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.000 align:middle line:90%
Angels who are there to help us.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.150 align:middle line:90%
Laura Lee, welcome back.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LAURA LEE: Well, thanks
for having me again.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: First of all, you've
got to explain what are angels.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.740 align:middle line:84%
Because I hear so many
different definitions about what

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:56.240 align:middle line:90%
they are.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Right.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.020 align:middle line:10%
Well, ethereal beings
of light, which

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.060 align:middle line:10%
have been recognized
by all scriptures,

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.530 align:middle line:10%
all different
religions, that are here

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.210 align:middle line:10%
to help us on our journey in
life, and they are messengers.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.690 align:middle line:84%
I think angels is actually
the word messenger.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And they guide us,
but a lot of us

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.250 align:middle line:84%
don't realize we have that
guidance accessible to us.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.480 align:middle line:10%
They may believe
in them, but they

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.520 align:middle line:10%
don't utilize their services
that are here for us.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Before the
physical realm was created.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Yes.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were the
angels here first?

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: That's a good question.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.472 align:middle line:90%
I didn't expect that one.

00:01:43.472 --> 00:01:44.430 align:middle line:90%
That's a good question.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.507 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think, I
would imagine so.

00:01:46.507 --> 00:01:47.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I would think so.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:48.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: I would imagine so.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they were always here.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.870 align:middle line:84%
They're always part
of the divine plan,

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.240 align:middle line:84%
that their presence
is among us to help us

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.030 align:middle line:84%
through this myriad of--
what do you want to call it?

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.760 align:middle line:84%
A maze, or a matrix,
an experience

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.919 align:middle line:84%
that we're all experiencing,
we're just experiencing it.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:13.164 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And assuming there's
life on other planets.

00:02:13.164 --> 00:02:13.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: There is.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I assume
that they, too,

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.340 align:middle line:90%
know about the angelic realm.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Yes.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.270 align:middle line:84%
I think they are a powerful
force that is highly recognized

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.140 align:middle line:90%
not only with humans.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.710 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of
people in my genre,

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.810 align:middle line:84%
in my field, who might even
recognize them as alien-ish,

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:34.765 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:02:34.765 --> 00:02:36.697 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was going
to ask you that.

00:02:36.697 --> 00:02:37.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: I know.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you read the
book of Genesis in the Bible,

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.770 align:middle line:84%
and you replace angels
with extraterrestrial,

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.500 align:middle line:90%
it's almost the same.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: I know.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
of experts out there

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.580 align:middle line:84%
who would probably validate
that with their own personal

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.110 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.430 align:middle line:84%
But angels will
appear in the form

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.670 align:middle line:84%
that we're most receptive to
receive their messages, which

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.040 align:middle line:84%
can even-- they can even
transform themselves

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.517 align:middle line:90%
to appear in a moment notice, as

00:03:08.517 --> 00:03:09.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Human-like?

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: --human-like, and
maybe even like a loved one.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.222 align:middle line:84%
So we'll receive their
message in that instant.

00:03:16.222 --> 00:03:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
there to help us?

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Absolutely.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:19.590 align:middle line:90%
100% percent.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pull us out of danger.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.920 align:middle line:90%
Things like that.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:21.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Absolutely.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.850 align:middle line:84%
We hear of miracles all
the time of situations

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.715 align:middle line:84%
where people are in
a crisis situation

00:03:27.715 --> 00:03:30.830 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden somebody
will appear, help them out

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.490 align:middle line:84%
of the tragedy, and never see
or hear of this person again.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.560 align:middle line:90%
It's almost mysterious.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And we hear those
experiences all the time.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And yes, those are moments that
angels intervene in our lives.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And they can be there at any
moment, if we call upon them.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:56.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the difference
between an angel and something

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.412 align:middle line:90%
evil, a demon, for example?

00:04:00.412 --> 00:04:01.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: What's the difference?

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.911 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is there a difference?

00:04:02.911 --> 00:04:04.460 align:middle line:90%
They're both spirits, I think.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:05.918 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: I think
they're both spirits

00:04:05.918 --> 00:04:08.470 align:middle line:84%
and they're all
part of the plan.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.260 align:middle line:84%
I think the darker
entities are there

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.010 align:middle line:84%
to help us remember
there is a light.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I think
they all work together

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.441 align:middle line:90%
so we recognize it's our light.

00:04:19.441 --> 00:04:21.399 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've
heard that quote before,

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:24.610 align:middle line:84%
but I think Marianne Williamson
said it so brilliantly,

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.230 align:middle line:84%
that it's not our darkness
that we're most frightened of,

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.412 align:middle line:84%
it's our light that
we're scared of.

00:04:30.412 --> 00:04:32.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's because
we don't understand it.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.505 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: We don't.

00:04:33.505 --> 00:04:36.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've got some images
that you brought along with us,

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.330 align:middle line:84%
and I want to take a
look at image number

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.640 align:middle line:90%
one, which is Archangel Michael.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.350 align:middle line:10%
Tell us about Archangel
Michael, first of all.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.620 align:middle line:10%
>>LEE: Well,
particularly, these images

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.800 align:middle line:10%
are just an artist's
depiction of the archangel.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.430 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Why do
they all have wings?

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.171 align:middle line:10%
>>LEE: Because
one of two things,

00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:58.670 align:middle line:10%
I've seen them with wings, and
I've seen them without wings.

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:03.150 align:middle line:10%
But they vibrate at such a high
frequency and such a high level

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.920 align:middle line:10%
that they can come with
the speed of thought.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's almost like
they could be bird-like.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Yeah, I know.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:11.435 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's strange.

00:05:11.435 --> 00:05:14.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: There was a culture
that was considered bird-like.

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:15.396 align:middle line:84%
You might have had
that discussion on one

00:05:15.396 --> 00:05:15.980 align:middle line:90%
of your shows.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.040 align:middle line:10%
But anyway, Archangel Michael
is usually shown with a sword,

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.190 align:middle line:10%
and he's about to give
somebody courage and strength.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.740 align:middle line:10%
So if you're in fear
about something,

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.020 align:middle line:10%
this is the angel you'd
want to call upon.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.720 align:middle line:10%
And here in this
particular picture,

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:37.090 align:middle line:10%
he's killing a serpent, which
is, again, a symbol of fear

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.930 align:middle line:10%
to overcome.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.270 align:middle line:84%
So if at any point in time
you're scared about something,

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.240 align:middle line:84%
this is the angel you want to
call in, as God is my strength,

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.660 align:middle line:90%
you see he's recognized as.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.419 align:middle line:90%
So he's a powerful angel.

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:49.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So he's
there to protect us.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:50.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Yes.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And he's always in
this-- there's always

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:57.780 align:middle line:84%
an ultra-blueish light
that comes with him,

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.300 align:middle line:90%
sometimes almost violet-like.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.450 align:middle line:84%
So even if you see
those kind of colors

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.530 align:middle line:84%
that flash in your
sphere, I know

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.590 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people who've had
experiences with colors,

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.030 align:middle line:84%
and seeing auras, this
is his coloring, usually.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How high up
is he in the hierarchy?

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:15.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Well, they're archangels.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.265 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's way up there.

00:06:16.265 --> 00:06:18.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Yeah, they're up there.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just about
as high as you can go.

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.248 align:middle line:10%
>>LEE: I'm going to share with
you the top four angels that

00:06:22.248 --> 00:06:27.820 align:middle line:10%
are known across Islamic,
Judaism, the Kap-- Kabbalah-- I

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.220 align:middle line:10%
can't even say the
word, Christianity.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.670 align:middle line:84%
They are all recognized
angels in some way

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:34.850 align:middle line:90%
in their scriptures.

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So he's one of them
you want to get to know.

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Yeah.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.510 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
recognize him, and a lot

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:43.805 align:middle line:84%
of children on this planet
have been named Michael.

00:06:43.805 --> 00:06:45.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, let's
go to our next image, who

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.660 align:middle line:90%
will be Archangel Gabriel.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.690 align:middle line:10%
My late father's
name, of course.

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:53.470 align:middle line:10%
Tell me about Gabriel.

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:57.990 align:middle line:10%
>>LEE: Gabriel is
the word of God.

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.540 align:middle line:84%
So if you're having
trouble to find the words,

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:02.210 align:middle line:90%
this is the angel to call upon.

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:04.730 align:middle line:84%
Angel also known
as life and death.

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.873 align:middle line:84%
I work with this
angel a lot because I

00:07:06.873 --> 00:07:09.480 align:middle line:84%
am a spiritual
medium, a medium that

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.890 align:middle line:84%
communicates with
the other side.

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:14.080 align:middle line:10%
So of course,
Gabriel's also known

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.900 align:middle line:10%
to share the message that
Christ was coming, not that I'm

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.500 align:middle line:10%
pinpointing a
particular religion,

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.920 align:middle line:10%
because angels
are not religious.

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:23.420 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.960 align:middle line:10%
But they happen to be
recognized in Christianity,

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.920 align:middle line:10%
and this particular angel was.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, a lot of
times people or artists

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.750 align:middle line:84%
have depicted this
angel as masculine,

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:40.040 align:middle line:84%
but I see it as a
she most often times.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.780 align:middle line:10%
And then the lily usually
is depicted by artists,

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.360 align:middle line:10%
and that means truth.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.420 align:middle line:10%
So it's always about
speaking the truth, which

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:49.930 align:middle line:10%
will get us much further.

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:52.420 align:middle line:10%
Even though sometimes
it's not always good,

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:56.840 align:middle line:10%
but speaking the truth,
God's word through us.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:57.560 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:01.660 align:middle line:10%
Let's go to our third angel,
the Archangel Raphael,

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.710 align:middle line:10%
with a nice sword.

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:05.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Yeah.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:07.280 align:middle line:90%
Usually he's in a green light.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.716 align:middle line:84%
Green light,
usually, because this

00:08:09.716 --> 00:08:10.840 align:middle line:90%
is the angel about healing.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:15.404 align:middle line:84%
So if you're suffering from
a health issue, or a terminal

00:08:15.404 --> 00:08:17.945 align:middle line:84%
illness, or something of that
sort, call in this particular--

00:08:17.945 --> 00:08:18.861 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's the one.

00:08:18.861 --> 00:08:22.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: He is the angel
that will assist you

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:26.510 align:middle line:90%
in overcoming any ailments.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:30.680 align:middle line:84%
Physically, mentally,
emotionally-- he's the one.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.995 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, he's usually
carrying a scepter, not

00:08:34.995 --> 00:08:36.179 align:middle line:90%
a sword.

00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:38.980 align:middle line:84%
But the sword could also
be cutting the cords

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:43.330 align:middle line:84%
to this disease,
which is also a fear.

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:47.647 align:middle line:84%
Because we'll think an illness
is transmitted from generation

00:08:47.647 --> 00:08:48.355 align:middle line:90%
after generation.

00:08:48.355 --> 00:08:51.240 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have to be that way.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.146 align:middle line:84%
I know that might
make a lot of people

00:08:53.146 --> 00:08:55.520 align:middle line:84%
angry because they want to
hold on to their health issues

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.228 align:middle line:84%
because it gives them
some sort of power.

00:08:57.228 --> 00:08:59.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is there
a child with him?

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:01.994 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: I think
that's the innocence.

00:09:01.994 --> 00:09:03.410 align:middle line:84%
Because you almost
have to go back

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:06.655 align:middle line:84%
into that space, the
innocence, to really believe.

00:09:06.655 --> 00:09:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
thing with angels,

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:12.040 align:middle line:84%
you have to believe in order
for their power to take effect.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The next archangel, of
course, is the Archangel Uriel.

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:16.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Uriel.

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:18.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take
a little look here.

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:19.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Yeah.

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And usually Uriel is depicted by
artists with fire in the hands,

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.040 align:middle line:90%
God is light.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:30.520 align:middle line:84%
And it usually means the
divine wisdom and knowledge

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.470 align:middle line:84%
that comes through
to give you knowledge

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:35.580 align:middle line:90%
of the presence of spirit here.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.930 align:middle line:84%
Or if you're struggling
with anything

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:43.070 align:middle line:84%
such as needing guidance
on a particular matter,

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.410 align:middle line:84%
this is the archangel
you want to call upon

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:47.500 align:middle line:84%
for that kind of
guidance, assistance.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.525 align:middle line:84%
Because that's why
he's carrying the book.

00:09:49.525 --> 00:09:53.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Laura Lee, do most
people believe in angels?

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:58.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: I have seen polls that
said 85% believe, or 77%.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:00.310 align:middle line:84%
But yes, I think a
high majority of people

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:04.280 align:middle line:84%
believe whether or not they're
religious, or nonreligious.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.243 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it going up or down?

00:10:06.243 --> 00:10:08.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: I think it has stayed
steady over the years.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:11.150 align:middle line:10%
Because I've been talking about
this subject for many years,

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:13.066 align:middle line:10%
and every time I go back
to look at the polls,

00:10:13.066 --> 00:10:15.050 align:middle line:10%
it looks like it's
about the same.

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:20.700 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of that's rooted
from our histories and religion

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.870 align:middle line:90%
and what we're taught.

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:26.090 align:middle line:84%
But the odd thing
I find, though,

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:31.190 align:middle line:84%
is even if they believe, they
might not utilize the angels

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:32.732 align:middle line:84%
in the way that they
can be utilized.

00:10:32.732 --> 00:10:34.398 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
where a lot of people

00:10:34.398 --> 00:10:37.000 align:middle line:84%
are missing the point, because
they think it's just maybe,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.600 align:middle line:90%
yeah, it's a story.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, sure, they're
there, but they are there

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:44.660 align:middle line:84%
to assist us, and we can ask
for that divine intervention

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.010 align:middle line:90%
at any point.

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter,
it can be mundane issues,

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.285 align:middle line:84%
and it can be really
important issues.

00:10:51.285 --> 00:10:54.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My favorite
movie this holiday season,

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:55.051 align:middle line:90%
"It's a Wonderful Life."

00:10:55.051 --> 00:10:56.133 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: That's my favorite.

00:10:56.133 --> 00:10:57.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With Jimmy Stewart.

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:02.010 align:middle line:84%
My mother, when I was about
seven, sat me down to watch it.

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:03.842 align:middle line:90%
And I watch it every year.

00:11:03.842 --> 00:11:04.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: I do, too.

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:05.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's got
a great message.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: And don't
you cry every year?

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:08.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No, I don't
cry every year.

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:09.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: I cry every year.

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:12.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's because
you're a woman; you cry.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:12.995 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: I'm sensitive.

00:11:12.995 --> 00:11:14.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm not going
to cry at an angel movie.

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:15.996 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: That's what
makes me feel--

00:11:15.996 --> 00:11:17.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm a tough guy.

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:18.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Yeah, it happens to me.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.236 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But it
was a great movie,

00:11:20.236 --> 00:11:22.250 align:middle line:84%
and there was a
great message there.

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:24.690 align:middle line:84%
What would happen
had he not lived?

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:26.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: Right, because
the angel intervened

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:28.082 align:middle line:90%
to help him live his life.

00:11:28.082 --> 00:11:29.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was
the angel's name?

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:29.805 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Clarence.

00:11:29.805 --> 00:11:30.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Got it.

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:30.901 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Of course.

00:11:30.901 --> 00:11:32.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was a great movie.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:32.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: I know.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.780 align:middle line:90%
Jimmy Stewart classic.

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe you guys can play
a little clip of that for us

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:41.105 align:middle line:84%
and we could take a look
at that for a few minutes.

00:11:41.105 --> 00:11:41.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Right.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.416 align:middle line:90%
Love that movie.

00:11:43.416 --> 00:11:44.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
you get involved

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:46.150 align:middle line:90%
in dealing with the angels?

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:47.280 align:middle line:90%
You're a psychic medium.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.759 align:middle line:90%
You deal with the other side.

00:11:48.759 --> 00:11:50.050 align:middle line:90%
You deal with life after death.

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:51.460 align:middle line:90%
How about the angels?

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:53.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: That's a good
topic because it

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.630 align:middle line:90%
happened for me at an early age.

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:59.810 align:middle line:84%
I started seeing
spirits, which scared me,

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:02.040 align:middle line:84%
and I shared that on a
previous show with you.

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:05.880 align:middle line:84%
It scared the bejesus out of me
to the point where I literally

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:06.630 align:middle line:90%
hid under covers.

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:10.440 align:middle line:84%
I was so scared of the dark,
had an eating disorder.

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:13.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was a lot
associated because of this.

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.576 align:middle line:84%
Because I didn't want
to speak out and share

00:12:15.576 --> 00:12:17.200 align:middle line:84%
with too many people,
especially coming

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.570 align:middle line:90%
from my Midwestern upbringing.

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:20.986 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did your parents know
you had an eating disorder?

00:12:20.986 --> 00:12:23.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: They didn't
until I came out.

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is I
was in my freshman year,

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:31.280 align:middle line:84%
and I was literally on my
knees calling out for help,

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.824 align:middle line:84%
and I had a visitation
from an angel.

00:12:32.824 --> 00:12:34.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were your girlfriends
doing the same thing?

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:37.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: I don't know.

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure that I
wasn't the only one.

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:42.590 align:middle line:84%
At that time, it seemed
to be that or girls

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:45.440 align:middle line:84%
who had addictions to
alcohol, you know, college.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
solve this yourself?

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:49.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: Well, an
angel came to me.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.436 align:middle line:90%
Gabriel came to me.

00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:52.310 align:middle line:10%
And I didn't know it
was Gabriel at the time,

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:56.050 align:middle line:10%
but I had an experience
that was out of body.

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And came to me,
and shared with me,

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:02.580 align:middle line:90%
I'd be speaking with angels.

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I shared with
my roommate, and my college

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:11.500 align:middle line:84%
classmates, and they were
just-- whatever, Laura.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.080 align:middle line:84%
They thought I was out of
my mind, which maybe I was.

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:17.700 align:middle line:84%
But it turned my life
around immediately.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:21.000 align:middle line:84%
It just was like
a transformation

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.340 align:middle line:90%
within the night.

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:26.810 align:middle line:84%
So I was lifted off of my
bed and actually sat up,

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:28.720 align:middle line:84%
and I saw an angel
come before me

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:32.240 align:middle line:84%
and share with me that all
my experiences previously

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:36.350 align:middle line:84%
were to happen so I would
know that I can brace myself

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:37.050 align:middle line:90%
as I am.

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:40.130 align:middle line:84%
I am a communicator
for the other side,

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:41.720 align:middle line:90%
and that I need to share it.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did it illuminate
the room when it came in?

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: It more than
illuminated the room.

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:47.650 align:middle line:84%
They're so massive,
they're so big,

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:49.350 align:middle line:90%
it transcends time and space.

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:51.680 align:middle line:84%
I felt like only
her and I existed,

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.740 align:middle line:84%
and there was
nothing else around.

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:56.200 align:middle line:90%
No walls, no people, nothing.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:00.055 align:middle line:84%
And it felt like hours and
hours of conversations.

00:14:00.055 --> 00:14:03.050 align:middle line:84%
A conversation in
just a few minutes.

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:06.360 align:middle line:84%
But it was an
overwhelming sense of love

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:07.590 align:middle line:90%
that I can't even explain.

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:10.020 align:middle line:84%
Probably the closest
thing I can relate to it

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:12.710 align:middle line:84%
is the birth of my daughter
and that experience

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:14.580 align:middle line:90%
I share with my daughter.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:16.674 align:middle line:84%
But it's beyond
humanly experience.

00:14:16.674 --> 00:14:17.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's beyond belief.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: It's beyond belief, yes.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When I was a little
boy, lying on my back,

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.765 align:middle line:84%
looking at the sky, I saw
what could've been an angel.

00:14:24.765 --> 00:14:25.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Oh, I'm sure it was.

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:26.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It could
have been a cloud.

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:29.480 align:middle line:84%
You know how you make up
figures when you look at clouds.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: No, that's
one of the signs.

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:32.960 align:middle line:90%
That's one of the signs.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:36.570 align:middle line:84%
So if you see-- you can
see little notices of them

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:40.040 align:middle line:84%
in life, just to
recognize and they're

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:42.160 align:middle line:84%
trying to tell you
that they're here.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:45.285 align:middle line:84%
Just even art, artists,
or paraphernalia

00:14:45.285 --> 00:14:46.910 align:middle line:84%
that you might have
around, or somebody

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:49.700 align:middle line:84%
gives you a gift of an angel
just to tell you they're

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:50.580 align:middle line:90%
there with you.

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:51.160 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:51.980 align:middle line:90%
Clouds.

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.250 align:middle line:84%
If you come across a
feather on the ground,

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:57.480 align:middle line:84%
no matter what color,
an angel's with you.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.920 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:00.070 align:middle line:90%
You see the numbers.

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:02.974 align:middle line:84%
Numbers are really
important, 444 particularly.

00:15:02.974 --> 00:15:03.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.871 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: Yeah, angels
in your presence.

00:15:05.871 --> 00:15:06.370 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:08.760 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I jumped
in the car yesterday

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:11.190 align:middle line:84%
to get to the airport,
and it was 4:44.

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:12.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love it.

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:13.406 align:middle line:90%
A little sign from above.

00:15:13.406 --> 00:15:15.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: Little signs,
just little signs.

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:16.696 align:middle line:84%
I love playing with
those little things.

00:15:16.696 --> 00:15:19.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, when you get
that little intuitiveness,

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:22.830 align:middle line:84%
that little voice that
is in your head that

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:27.510 align:middle line:84%
tells you don't do this, or
do this, is that an angel?

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:30.400 align:middle line:84%
Or is that something
within yourself?

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: Well, some
people would say

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:35.860 align:middle line:84%
it's the spirit within
yourself, but I also

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:37.970 align:middle line:84%
feel there's a
connection to your angel.

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:41.730 align:middle line:84%
Because your angel is
your intuitive voice

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:43.310 align:middle line:90%
that is also speaking to you.

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And it is usually a
very soft whisper,

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:49.580 align:middle line:84%
but it'll be consistent,
and it'll be regular.

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And the difference
between discerning

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:56.500 align:middle line:84%
whether it's bad or
good is that the good,

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:59.700 align:middle line:84%
or the positive in knowing that
you're connected to the divine

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:03.690 align:middle line:84%
sources, it will encourage
you, and it will help.

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And you will be
inspired to do things,

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:07.580 align:middle line:90%
and good things for others.

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:10.950 align:middle line:84%
But if you're inspired to
hurt yourself or hurt others,

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:14.620 align:middle line:84%
then you know it's coming from
a source that's not divine.

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:16.610 align:middle line:84%
Or not-- I shouldn't
say not divine

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:18.110 align:middle line:84%
because I think
it's all connected.

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:23.090 align:middle line:84%
But it's coming from a
lower vibe, a lower entity,

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:24.120 align:middle line:90%
to derail you.

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think those that have
done atrocities in our world

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:30.890 align:middle line:84%
are so far removed
because of fear,

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:33.700 align:middle line:84%
or whatever their challenges
have been in life,

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:37.092 align:middle line:84%
removes them from making this
connection to the source.

00:16:37.092 --> 00:16:38.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Take a
few moments, Laura,

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:41.200 align:middle line:90%
to tell us about fallen angels.

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.250 align:middle line:84%
These are the ones
that just decided

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:46.730 align:middle line:84%
they weren't going to
be playing God's way.

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:49.050 align:middle line:90%
What happened to them?

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:53.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: Well, I know there's a
lot of stories that exist out

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:57.950 align:middle line:84%
there about the fallen
angels, or the lower vibes.

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:00.730 align:middle line:84%
But I think those are the ones
that they call the watchers,

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:03.910 align:middle line:84%
too, that have
merged with society.

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think they might
have just over generations,

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:13.750 align:middle line:84%
have merged and created
some sort of havoc.

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:15.910 align:middle line:84%
But I think I mentioned
in the previous show

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:18.300 align:middle line:84%
that I think it
all works together.

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:20.214 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what I'm saying?

00:17:20.214 --> 00:17:22.339 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you have to
have the good and the bad,

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:22.839 align:middle line:90%
don't you?

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:25.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: Yeah, you almost do
in order to see the light.

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:28.710 align:middle line:84%
And they have to play
against each other in order

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:34.290 align:middle line:84%
for us to remember and
to come back to that.

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we
need those moments

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:40.840 align:middle line:84%
of-- what do they call it--
the Dark Night of the Soul,

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:44.470 align:middle line:90%
in order to transcend.

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And like I had my
personal experience,

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:49.590 align:middle line:84%
in order to transcend
and become the person

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:52.630 align:middle line:84%
you're supposed to become, and
that's part of your character.

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, you'll
come out of it.

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:57.512 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes spirits are
souls, as you know,

00:17:57.512 --> 00:18:02.660 align:middle line:84%
are walking in this world of
hell and they never wake up.

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When I
was a little boy,

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:07.620 align:middle line:84%
my mother was born in
Fitchburg, Massachusetts.

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And her parents had
owned a furniture company

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:16.800 align:middle line:84%
and lived above it in a
huge apartment building.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:21.230 align:middle line:84%
They owned like 15
units, and their unit

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:23.870 align:middle line:84%
must have had four
bedrooms and stuff.

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:27.180 align:middle line:84%
So it was a very-- pretty
large apartment complex.

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And I remember, in
the dead of the night,

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:34.960 align:middle line:84%
being woken up by something
that had a mask on,

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.640 align:middle line:90%
and the house was full of smoke.

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And it ended up
being a firefighter.

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:42.630 align:middle line:84%
Somebody had
reported seeing smoke

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:44.500 align:middle line:90%
coming out of our apartment.

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.770 align:middle line:90%
Everyone was asleep.

00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And he was in there
waking us all up.

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:50.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: A guardian angel.

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:51.028 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Getting us up.

00:18:51.028 --> 00:18:53.007 align:middle line:84%
And I thought for a
moment he was an angel.

00:18:53.007 --> 00:18:53.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Well, he was.

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:54.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He may have been.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: He may have been.

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.560 align:middle line:84%
Because angels work, and
that's the misconception,

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.527 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people think
this glorious light

00:19:00.527 --> 00:19:01.610 align:middle line:90%
being is going to show up.

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:03.729 align:middle line:84%
But quite honestly,
if that happens,

00:19:03.729 --> 00:19:05.020 align:middle line:90%
it would scare a lot of people.

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:08.170 align:middle line:84%
Because they're so grand
and so magnificent.

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:11.660 align:middle line:84%
So they'll come through
and work through people.

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:13.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because they could
not find him afterward.

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:14.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Of course.

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:15.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was
nowhere to be found.

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: That's what
I'm telling you.

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:18.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Everybody tried to
look for him, but he was gone.

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:19.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: No sign.

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:19.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was gone.

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:20.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Yes.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:21.885 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we're
going to come back

00:19:21.885 --> 00:19:23.880 align:middle line:84%
in a moment on "Beyond
Belief," and Lisa

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:27.510 align:middle line:84%
will be talking to
Laura Lee about angels.

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:31.530 align:middle line:84%
And Laura will talk with her
about her angelic experience.

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:33.690 align:middle line:90%
That's next on "Beyond Belief."

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:35.670 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:40.797 align:middle line:90%


00:19:40.797 --> 00:19:42.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, welcome back
to "Beyond Belief."

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:44.754 align:middle line:10%
And as you know, we were just
talking with psychic medium

00:19:44.754 --> 00:19:47.680 align:middle line:10%
Laura Lee about angels,
the angelic realm.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:50.940 align:middle line:10%
And with us now is
Lisa, and Laura Lee

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:53.445 align:middle line:10%
will talk with
Lisa about angels.

00:19:53.445 --> 00:19:55.510 align:middle line:10%
>>LEE: All right.

00:19:55.510 --> 00:20:01.170 align:middle line:10%
Well, Lisa is easy because I
see tons of angels around Lisa.

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:06.240 align:middle line:10%
And when I see tons, some people
have just one, or two, George.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.650 align:middle line:84%
But Lisa has numerous
angels behind her

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:13.490 align:middle line:84%
because I understand she's
in the consulting, advising,

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:16.160 align:middle line:90%
coaching, teaching, healing.

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:19.070 align:middle line:84%
And people who touch
other people's lives

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:22.800 align:middle line:84%
to inspire and lift them, need
all the help that they can get.

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And Lisa is one of these
beings, the special beings

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:29.130 align:middle line:84%
on this planet that has to
do that in such grand ways

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:31.760 align:middle line:90%
she hasn't even uncovered yet.

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And she's just
scratching the surface.

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of her
life is just going

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:39.170 align:middle line:84%
to open up and flourish so ways
that she couldn't even imagine.

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, you think you're
rooted here, but you're not.

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:45.340 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be
all over the place.

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:47.510 align:middle line:90%
And that's my understanding.

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And I understand you
work with angels.

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:51.990 align:middle line:84%
So that's the other
thing; you call them in,

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:56.310 align:middle line:84%
and people who have
belief and trust in them,

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:59.290 align:middle line:90%
call them in for that support.

00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And they're just going to be
lifting you with your wings,

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:04.110 align:middle line:84%
because you're going through a
metamorphosis, a transformation

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:04.609 align:middle line:90%
yourself.

00:21:04.609 --> 00:21:07.740 align:middle line:84%
And I mean in all
ways, in relationships,

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:13.060 align:middle line:84%
career, and as well just
even where you're living.

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:16.060 align:middle line:84%
Because I see real estate
signs all around you,

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:18.010 align:middle line:84%
and I understand
you might even been

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:20.010 align:middle line:84%
in the business of real
estate at one point.

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:21.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I was for 27 years.

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:22.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Oh, wow.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.097 align:middle line:90%
So this is just a confirmation.

00:21:24.097 --> 00:21:24.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:25.179 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: OK.

00:21:25.179 --> 00:21:27.310 align:middle line:84%
Of what I'm telling
you, those messages.

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:29.752 align:middle line:84%
So you know the support
is here for you, OK?

00:21:29.752 --> 00:21:31.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, and
part of it is I'm

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:32.610 align:middle line:90%
thinking about going back in.

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:34.151 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: I know, that's
the other thing

00:21:34.151 --> 00:21:36.740 align:middle line:84%
that I wanted to discuss
with you because it's

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:39.870 align:middle line:84%
been a rough journey out here
on the metaphysical plane,

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:42.670 align:middle line:84%
because you're a healer,
and kind of an alternative.

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:45.510 align:middle line:84%
But I think there's a way to
warp those worlds together.

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:48.220 align:middle line:84%
Because you're going
to ground it now, OK?

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:50.730 align:middle line:84%
But you're still going to be
communicating and teaching,

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:52.050 align:middle line:84%
and I almost feel
like you're going back

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:53.560 align:middle line:84%
to school because
you love education.

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:53.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:55.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: You love schooling.

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:58.740 align:middle line:84%
And they tell me you have
multiple alternative degrees.

00:21:58.740 --> 00:21:59.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I do.

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:00.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: OK.

00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:02.200 align:middle line:84%
They tell me this,
but you might even

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:07.010 align:middle line:84%
go back for graduate degrees
and a formal education

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:10.740 align:middle line:84%
to ground yourself even more
and to identify yourself

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:14.870 align:middle line:84%
as something more respected--
what society would consider

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:17.100 align:middle line:84%
more respected,
that's more grounded.

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:18.960 align:middle line:90%
If that makes sense, OK?

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.610 align:middle line:84%
And part of this,
also, transformation

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:24.300 align:middle line:84%
might be coming because
of another relationship

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:26.050 align:middle line:84%
change that's
occurring in your life.

00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:27.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:28.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: OK.

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:29.110 align:middle line:90%
And it's all good.

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:29.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:31.026 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: Because,
of course, I think

00:22:31.026 --> 00:22:34.270 align:middle line:84%
you've been teaching and
learning in this process.

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:36.220 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like
it's going to shed,

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:38.480 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
embrace something new.

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:41.810 align:middle line:84%
And I see somebody who's really
into the outdoors around you.

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:42.630 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And might welcome you into
that world a little bit more.

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:50.079 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've been much
of an outdoors person yourself.

00:22:50.079 --> 00:22:50.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:51.260 align:middle line:90%
I always have been.

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:52.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: You always have?

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:52.750 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:54.620 align:middle line:84%
But this person's
really into it,

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:57.550 align:middle line:84%
and I mean seeing hiking
mountains and stuff like that,

00:22:57.550 --> 00:22:59.230 align:middle line:84%
which you already
do to some degree,

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:02.150 align:middle line:90%
but at a greater extent.

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And literally, that's how I see
this next phase of your life.

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:08.950 align:middle line:84%
You know what I
mean, metaphorically?

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And so when I say
graduate degree,

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:13.100 align:middle line:84%
I almost see-- have
you even considered

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:16.530 align:middle line:84%
at one point, graduate degree,
even master's, doctorate,

00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:17.420 align:middle line:90%
that type of level?

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:19.059 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what
I'm understanding.

00:23:19.059 --> 00:23:20.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No, no I haven't.

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: That's what
I'm understanding.

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:21.660 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:25.020 align:middle line:84%
But you've been
investigating some schools,

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:27.060 align:middle line:84%
some other schools
that they tell me.

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:28.580 align:middle line:84%
That you might have
over the years.

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:31.540 align:middle line:84%
You might have gone to look
at it and then stepped away.

00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:33.135 align:middle line:84%
Gone to look at
it, stepped away.

00:23:33.135 --> 00:23:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
come back again,

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:37.100 align:middle line:84%
and you need to trust
in those instincts

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:39.020 align:middle line:84%
when they come to
you because that's

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:42.110 align:middle line:84%
your guidance
imposing upon you, OK?

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think you'll
understand when

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.230 align:middle line:90%
that next part of the journey.

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:47.040 align:middle line:84%
But when I say real
estate, I almost

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:50.080 align:middle line:84%
feel like it might be from
a different standpoint.

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.450 align:middle line:84%
It might not be from
the selling aspect,

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:55.500 align:middle line:84%
but you actually getting
involved in real estate

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:58.210 align:middle line:84%
where you're going
to be managing

00:23:58.210 --> 00:24:02.220 align:middle line:84%
and also renting and
leasing and developing

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:04.640 align:middle line:90%
your own portfolio of things.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.420 align:middle line:84%
So it will be in
a different form

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:08.587 align:middle line:84%
than it was previously
because last time you sold.

00:24:08.587 --> 00:24:09.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:09.711 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Right?

00:24:09.711 --> 00:24:12.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:14.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are these the
angels telling you this?

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:14.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Yes.

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And when I say this,
I see specifically

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:21.860 align:middle line:84%
for you Archangel Michael
to give you lots of courage.

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And I also see Archangel
Gabriel, because now it's

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.700 align:middle line:84%
about communications
and teaching.

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And when I say this, also,
you've done workshops yourself

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:33.140 align:middle line:90%
and taught.

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:37.200 align:middle line:84%
I also feel like this might
expand to a bigger stage.

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:39.530 align:middle line:84%
And you've been
feeling this coming.

00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:40.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I have.

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:41.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Yes.

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.040 align:middle line:90%
They tell me this.

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:46.020 align:middle line:84%
So that's where I say
it's going to expand

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:49.880 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to be on stages
around the country, maybe even

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:50.630 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:53.310 align:middle line:84%
You might be invited
to certain places, OK?

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:55.210 align:middle line:90%
I feel this call, too, to India.

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:57.090 align:middle line:90%
Does this make sense?

00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:58.410 align:middle line:90%
This call to India.

00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:01.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've had any
affiliations or connections

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.910 align:middle line:84%
with people in your
life lately that

00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:06.350 align:middle line:84%
have been coming in that
have Indian descent.

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:07.820 align:middle line:90%
If that makes sense.

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:12.520 align:middle line:84%
Because I see a trip
over there, as well, OK?

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I have lots of
friends that have been there.

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:16.401 align:middle line:90%
And people--

00:25:16.401 --> 00:25:17.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: There's a reason.

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There's a reason, yeah.

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:20.034 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: Because they're
guiding you there, OK?

00:25:20.034 --> 00:25:23.079 align:middle line:84%
And there's lots
of talk about that.

00:25:23.079 --> 00:25:25.120 align:middle line:84%
But I feel like you might
find some answers there

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.470 align:middle line:90%
for yourself, OK?

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:30.800 align:middle line:84%
As I say this, I think
that at one point when

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.690 align:middle line:84%
you were a child,
you might have felt

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:37.160 align:middle line:84%
like you wanted to go
into the healing field

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:40.110 align:middle line:90%
but dismissed it as a child.

00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:41.300 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And you went into
this business aspect

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:45.167 align:middle line:84%
of things, just kind
of fumbled into it.

00:25:45.167 --> 00:25:45.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:46.160 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.701 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: But everything's
for a reason.

00:25:47.701 --> 00:25:50.420 align:middle line:84%
But now you're going
back into your roots,

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:52.300 align:middle line:84%
OK, because you're
really harnessing

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:55.300 align:middle line:84%
who you are in this next
part of the journey.

00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:57.260 align:middle line:84%
But you're much
more than what you

00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:58.930 align:middle line:90%
realize you are right now, OK?

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:04.230 align:middle line:84%
But it's going to take you away
from here, here in Colorado.

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:05.850 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be
all over the place.

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:07.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:10.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: I also sense a
connection to New York with you.

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:13.300 align:middle line:84%
Do you have-- you got some
friends out in New York?

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:13.867 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:26:13.867 --> 00:26:15.575 align:middle line:84%
I was just recently
there for a workshop.

00:26:15.575 --> 00:26:16.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not yet.

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:16.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: But, yeah, not yet.

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:19.013 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: You were just there
recently for a workshop

00:26:19.013 --> 00:26:20.470 align:middle line:84%
and you met some
people out there.

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:21.053 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I did.

00:26:21.053 --> 00:26:23.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: They tell me that are
from that particular area.

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:26.230 align:middle line:84%
There might be a connection
to them later on.

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And you will be revisiting
with them again.

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:33.330 align:middle line:84%
So that's sooner than later,
before the end of the year.

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And I just want you to
know that's on your way.

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:38.650 align:middle line:90%
That's starting it, OK?

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:40.250 align:middle line:84%
That'll be the start
of this next part

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:42.170 align:middle line:90%
of the leg of the journey.

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And as I say that, you've
overcome some major health

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:45.740 align:middle line:90%
issues yourself.

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:47.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you heard
me talking about some--

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:49.370 align:middle line:90%
in your past.

00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:52.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's behind you right now,
and that's part of the message

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:55.870 align:middle line:90%
you send out as well.

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:57.930 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to say
that as a confirmation

00:26:57.930 --> 00:26:59.680 align:middle line:84%
to some of the stuff
that was coming.

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:00.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:01.570 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate that.

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:05.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Any questions
for the angels, Lisa?

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:07.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: Well, she
works with angels

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:10.070 align:middle line:84%
so I almost think she
already has a lot of answers,

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:13.160 align:middle line:84%
but maybe it's rather trusting
it, even for ourselves.

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is trusting it.

00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:15.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Because you're a healer.

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:18.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's total trust
right now in my life

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:21.420 align:middle line:84%
because everything
shifted a few months ago.

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And all that trust that I had in
a future and in a lot of things

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:27.030 align:middle line:90%
went away.

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And so now I'm learning how to
re-trust myself and then trust

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:33.390 align:middle line:90%
the information.

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:36.630 align:middle line:84%
Something I got was flex
your clairvoyant muscles.

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:41.350 align:middle line:84%
It was like I've got to
get back into that realm.

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:44.630 align:middle line:90%
And it's-- you know--

00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:47.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: There's no reason why we
can't merge our intuitive side

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.340 align:middle line:84%
with our rational
side of the brain.

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:51.980 align:middle line:10%
And we need to even
in a practical sense,

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:55.000 align:middle line:10%
because our world is changing
so rapidly right now.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.930 align:middle line:10%
I've worked with stockbrokers
and businessmen and women,

00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:01.787 align:middle line:10%
and they need to grasp
that side of themselves

00:28:01.787 --> 00:28:04.120 align:middle line:10%
even to navigate some of the
changes that are occurring.

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:06.110 align:middle line:84%
So I think you'll be
helping a lot of people

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:08.851 align:middle line:84%
in both of those realms in
transcending and merging them

00:28:08.851 --> 00:28:09.350 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:13.140 align:middle line:84%
So that'll ground you
with your work, OK?

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:13.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:16.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Laura, how do
people get a hold of you?

00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:20.526 align:middle line:10%
>>LEE: Psychicmediumlauralee--
or mediumlauralee.com.

00:28:20.526 --> 00:28:21.582 align:middle line:10%
And you just Google me.

00:28:21.582 --> 00:28:21.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Simple as that.

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:22.762 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Yeah.

00:28:22.762 --> 00:28:23.553 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very good.

00:28:23.553 --> 00:28:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And Lisa thanks for being with
us on this holiday season.

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:26.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank you, George.

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:27.590 align:middle line:90%
It appreciate it.

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:28.190 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:30.356 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And to all of you
who have been watching us

00:28:30.356 --> 00:28:33.820 align:middle line:10%
on "Beyond Belief" over
so many months, thank you,

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:37.350 align:middle line:10%
and I hope you have a
joyous holiday season.
