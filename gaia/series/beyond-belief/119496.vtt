>>GEORGE NOORY:
Well, welcome back

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.310 align:middle line:84%
to another edition
of "Beyond Belief".

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.180 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and we
have an amazing guest for you

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.920 align:middle line:10%
in this edition of the program.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.600 align:middle line:84%
We talk a lot about
life after death,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.470 align:middle line:84%
and we have a lot
a psychic mediums

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:40.870 align:middle line:90%
that come on the program.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.210 align:middle line:84%
But there's one special
person out there

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.060 align:middle line:84%
who-- where ever I have been to
speaking engagements and events

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.790 align:middle line:84%
and he's on my
panel, I just stop

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.650 align:middle line:84%
in wonderment because of the
answers and his relationship

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:55.730 align:middle line:90%
with the audience.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.026 align:middle line:90%
Vincent Genna is with us.

00:00:58.026 --> 00:00:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to look
forward to this one.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.240 align:middle line:90%
Vince, welcome to the program.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.460 align:middle line:84%
>>VINCENT GENNA: Oh,
it's so great to be here.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.544 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for inviting me.

00:01:03.544 --> 00:01:04.585 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is amazing.

00:01:04.585 --> 00:01:05.160 align:middle line:90%
Look at you.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.350 align:middle line:84%
You look like you're
Hollywood, for crying out loud.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.310 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Well, yes.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.410 align:middle line:90%
Well, tell them that.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.740 align:middle line:10%
That's exactly--

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.450 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Did you buy that
jacket just for the show?

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.991 align:middle line:10%
>>GENNA: I bought
that jacket myself.

00:01:12.991 --> 00:01:16.040 align:middle line:10%
I even got the socks that
match and everything.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.160 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'm a closet Guido.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.644 align:middle line:84%
And so everything has to
be styling and profiling.

00:01:21.644 --> 00:01:22.810 align:middle line:90%
That's the way I do my work.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:23.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.120 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: And you know.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.022 align:middle line:90%
Look at you there.

00:01:24.022 --> 00:01:25.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You look meticulous.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.271 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Well, thank you.

00:01:26.271 --> 00:01:27.932 align:middle line:90%
Well, it takes one to know one.

00:01:27.932 --> 00:01:29.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's exactly
how I would dress,

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.760 align:middle line:90%
gorgeous pink tie like that.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.910 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, but see, they
see me from the desk up.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.943 align:middle line:84%
From the desk down,
they don't know I'm just

00:01:34.943 --> 00:01:36.730 align:middle line:90%
sitting here in my underwear.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: Which is
great, by the way.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.526 align:middle line:90%
You look great in that, too.

00:01:39.526 --> 00:01:41.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm only kidding.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.010 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: No, really.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.593 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've actually
got clothes on.

00:01:43.593 --> 00:01:45.884 align:middle line:84%
Vince, you've been doing
this for a long time.

00:01:45.884 --> 00:01:46.550 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: I have.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.815 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A long time.

00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:47.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: It's
about 32 years now.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:48.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell us your history.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:49.453 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:01:49.453 --> 00:01:50.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Oh, wow.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, all my life, I
must have had something

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.990 align:middle line:84%
going on within me,
because it was-- I

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.150 align:middle line:90%
had a completely different life.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.880 align:middle line:84%
It was total torment
for my early years,

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.990 align:middle line:84%
all the way up until I was about
17 years old between the kids

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.530 align:middle line:90%
in school between my parents.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.199 align:middle line:90%
They had emotional difficulties.

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:10.533 align:middle line:84%
And so they were taking it
out on both my brother and I.

00:02:10.533 --> 00:02:11.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, boy.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: I mean, all
the typical stuff

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.400 align:middle line:84%
with the physical, emotional,
and sexual abuse that went on.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.380 align:middle line:84%
So something carried
me through that.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And there was an inner
knowing that they were wrong,

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.802 align:middle line:90%
and I was OK.

00:02:23.802 --> 00:02:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
what told me that.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.240 align:middle line:90%
But it was 28 years old.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.620 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly when it
happened, where this just

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.040 align:middle line:90%
spontaneously awoke within me.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And George, it was amazing,
because all during my torment

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.329 align:middle line:84%
I believed in God, totally
different than what

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:43.120 align:middle line:90%
I was being taught.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Still do?

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:44.731 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Still do.

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:45.230 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.140 align:middle line:84%
We're like this just like
everybody else is with God.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.739 align:middle line:90%
I knew Jesus in a different way.

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:52.530 align:middle line:90%
You gotta remember.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.480 align:middle line:90%
You're Italian.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.840 align:middle line:90%
You're a New Yorker.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.390 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a law there
that states you must be an altar

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.622 align:middle line:90%
boy by 13 years old.

00:02:59.622 --> 00:03:00.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.990 align:middle line:90%
And religious.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.531 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: Otherwise,
they kick you out

00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:03.680 align:middle line:90%
of the church and New York.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.660 align:middle line:84%
So of course, I
was an altar boy.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And I used to argue with
the priests at 13 saying,

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.910 align:middle line:84%
you're teaching God
and Jesus wrong.

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.600 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea why
I was saying that.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did they listen to you?

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.250 align:middle line:90%
Or they'd whack you in the head?

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.650 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Well, no.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.320 align:middle line:84%
They didn't whack
me in the head.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.210 align:middle line:84%
When I got home, my mother
beat the crap out of me.

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.690 align:middle line:84%
Because she thought I was
destining them all to hell,

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.240 align:middle line:84%
the fire pits of
hell because I was--

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.545 align:middle line:90%
Would the priests call her?

00:03:29.545 --> 00:03:30.275 align:middle line:90%
How did she know?

00:03:30.275 --> 00:03:31.400 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: No, they loved me.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.480 align:middle line:90%
The priest would know me.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.400 align:middle line:84%
But because mom had
emotional issues,

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.750 align:middle line:90%
the priest would visit her.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:37.780 align:middle line:90%
And they would talk.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And she was always
apologizing for me.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And they would say, no,
Vinnie is a romanticist.

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.310 align:middle line:84%
He just sees that the
world can be perfect,

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.280 align:middle line:90%
and it really can't.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.930 align:middle line:84%
So they saw something
in me that I never knew.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.360 align:middle line:84%
But it was at 28, I never
ever prayed for myself

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.730 align:middle line:90%
during any of my torment.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.250 align:middle line:84%
But my friend that he was
the greatest tormentor

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.910 align:middle line:84%
during my youth, he became
a dear friend of mine

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.650 align:middle line:84%
after our 10 year
high school reunion.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.730 align:middle line:90%
And his life was falling apart.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.500 align:middle line:84%
And I had no idea
how to help him.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.570 align:middle line:90%
I was an actor.

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.199 align:middle line:84%
I wanted a Tony, an Emmy,
an Oscar, any other awards

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.990 align:middle line:90%
they came out with.

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:21.190 align:middle line:90%
I just wanted to achieve that.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And so his life
is falling apart.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm with him.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.710 align:middle line:90%
I felt such compassion for him.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.690 align:middle line:84%
Because with all the
torment I went through,

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:29.550 align:middle line:90%
I certainly know--

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:30.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With him.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: With him,
caused a lot by him.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.910 align:middle line:84%
What it was to have
no self-esteem,

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.820 align:middle line:90%
no self-belief whatsoever.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.070 align:middle line:90%
And I was feeling that in him.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.236 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was falling
apart right in front of you.

00:04:41.236 --> 00:04:42.830 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: He was falling apart.

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.260 align:middle line:84%
I didn't pray that
God helped him.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.770 align:middle line:84%
For some reason, I prayed
that God help me help him.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:51.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Help him.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.561 align:middle line:90%
You needed that strength.

00:04:52.561 --> 00:04:58.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: I needed that
empowerment in some way.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And I said not only him,
but people like him.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.420 align:middle line:84%
That was the complete
turning point.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.400 align:middle line:84%
Because it was shortly
after that that all

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.210 align:middle line:84%
of the paranormal stuff
started happening to me.

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.990 align:middle line:90%
And then it all came.

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really when I look
back on it in hindsight,

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:14.484 align:middle line:90%
it happened--

00:05:14.484 --> 00:05:15.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All the time.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: --all the
time and all at once.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:17.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You just
didn't recognize it.

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.903 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: I didn't recognize
it, but at this point,

00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:22.390 align:middle line:84%
it was unbelievable what
was being thrown at me.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, seeing dead people
coming around my house,

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.140 align:middle line:84%
reading people's minds, telling
the future, telling the past.

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.360 align:middle line:84%
I was like-- it was
just pouring in my head.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.949 align:middle line:84%
And my wife, we
were married for-- I

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:37.740 align:middle line:84%
think it was about six
years at that point.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've been
together a long time.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.080 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: We've been together
43 years, married 37.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.760 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: That was a soul
contract that we allowed

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.760 align:middle line:90%
to happen, because she--

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have
bucked the odds.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.700 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Somebody has to.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And if one person can, everybody
else can, too, as an example.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.820 align:middle line:90%
So she believed in me.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.730 align:middle line:90%
At first she thought I was nuts.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, who wouldn't
when I'm saying

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking to dead people.

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.430 align:middle line:84%
She just realized but there's
something coming out of him.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:08.810 align:middle line:84%
There's wisdom
and this knowledge

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.810 align:middle line:90%
that I know he doesn't know.

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.200 align:middle line:90%
So she stayed with me.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.790 align:middle line:84%
It was her belief in me that
pushed me to keep going.

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And then I finally
realized and come

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.670 align:middle line:84%
to understand why all of
this was happening for me.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:26.300 align:middle line:84%
So it was at that
point my destiny--

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.750 align:middle line:90%
I felt my destiny was changing.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.710 align:middle line:84%
I still didn't know the
direction it was going in.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know how I was
going to make that happen.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.470 align:middle line:84%
But I just let it go,
and I went with the flow.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.969 align:middle line:84%
And here I am today sitting
right in front of you

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:39.510 align:middle line:90%
on this show.

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:42.150 align:middle line:84%
And I would never ever
have expected that,

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.740 align:middle line:84%
not unless you had me here to
do a song and dance for you.

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:45.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which I may do.

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:46.610 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we're not done with that.

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:46.750 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Oh, God.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:47.760 align:middle line:90%
I bet that'll be fun.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:48.760 align:middle line:90%
All, right OK.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
ever have any doubts

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.350 align:middle line:84%
these things that
were happening to you,

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:57.810 align:middle line:84%
these psychic abilities,
these abilities

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.090 align:middle line:90%
to see the other side?

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:00.825 align:middle line:90%
Did you doubt it at all?

00:07:00.825 --> 00:07:04.830 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: All the time.

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.110 align:middle line:84%
When you go through the
torment that I went through--

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.300 align:middle line:84%
and I became a
psychotherapist, so I

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:15.710 align:middle line:84%
know all of the mental
pathologies that can happen,

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.870 align:middle line:90%
including narcissism.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:23.240 align:middle line:84%
My biggest concern
was I was developing--

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:29.130 align:middle line:84%
and even till today, not
as much as yesterday,

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:33.300 align:middle line:84%
but am I having grandiose
ideas about myself

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:37.762 align:middle line:84%
that I, me, Vincent Genna
can help save the world?

00:07:37.762 --> 00:07:39.720 align:middle line:84%
Because really that's
what I'm motivated to do,

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.954 align:middle line:90%
quite honestly.

00:07:40.954 --> 00:07:42.620 align:middle line:84%
I keep saying all the
torment out there,

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:43.450 align:middle line:90%
and that keeps motiving--

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:44.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, my gosh,
and it doesn't stop.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.590 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: --to do more.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.290 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to stop.

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And so I sit and I wonder
with all of the beings

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.970 align:middle line:84%
that I'm communicating
with, is this real?

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:55.200 align:middle line:90%
Is it real?

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.620 align:middle line:84%
What saves me is
Edgar Cayce material.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:03.150 align:middle line:84%
I was directed to the
Edgar Cayce material right

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:04.190 align:middle line:90%
as this happened.

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:08.004 align:middle line:84%
And that became the foundation
for all the work that I do now,

00:08:08.004 --> 00:08:08.920 align:middle line:90%
was a good foundation.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.086 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And great material.

00:08:10.086 --> 00:08:11.040 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Absolutely.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And Edgar when he was younger,
he used to sit with his mom.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And he used to-- early on in
the stages of his prophecies.

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And say to her what happens
if I'm making this all up,

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:28.660 align:middle line:84%
and I'm really
hurting the people.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And his mom wisely
said, as long as you

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:36.480 align:middle line:84%
carry that doubt with you, that
will always keep you in check.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.586 align:middle line:84%
And it's proof that you
can never hurt the people.

00:08:38.586 --> 00:08:39.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's good.

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:41.429 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: You're doing
it from a good place.

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:42.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mom knew.

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:43.549 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Mom absolutely knew.

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:46.699 align:middle line:84%
So I hope I'm not afraid
to have my doubts.

00:08:46.699 --> 00:08:48.240 align:middle line:84%
Because it's
certainly-- George, it's

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.500 align:middle line:84%
keeping me in check,
because I want

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.690 align:middle line:84%
to make sure I don't do anything
that can ever hurt people.

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:58.354 align:middle line:84%
And you've heard
some of my beliefs,

00:08:58.354 --> 00:08:59.395 align:middle line:90%
and they're pretty heavy.

00:08:59.395 --> 00:09:00.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, they are.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: And some
very contradictory

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:05.230 align:middle line:84%
of some of the other beliefs
that people have heard.

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:09.120 align:middle line:84%
But I still have to know in
my heart with my intention

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.800 align:middle line:84%
and my love of people,
only the right thing

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.200 align:middle line:90%
is going to come out.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.110 align:middle line:84%
It was so funny when I was
going to become a social worker,

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:19.320 align:middle line:90%
we were all adults.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.920 align:middle line:84%
I went to UNC, the
University of North Carolina

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:22.765 align:middle line:90%
at Chapel Hill Road.

00:09:22.765 --> 00:09:23.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good school.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.380 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Oh, it's great school.

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.565 align:middle line:84%
And all of the other students
used to make fun of me.

00:09:28.565 --> 00:09:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And they were really
concerned with me,

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:32.730 align:middle line:84%
because we would
do our internships.

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:34.749 align:middle line:84%
And then we would come
and meet, and the teacher

00:09:34.749 --> 00:09:35.790 align:middle line:90%
would be discussing them.

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:37.740 align:middle line:90%
OK, what were your experiences?

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And I was the only one feeling
good about what I was doing.

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And we were interning
before we learned

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.320 align:middle line:90%
all the tools of the trade.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.050 align:middle line:84%
So the students were
like, oh, Vincent.

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:52.580 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you can't be so
sure about yourself.

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:56.072 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've got to be a
little bit hesitant about what

00:09:56.072 --> 00:09:57.280 align:middle line:90%
you think you're doing there.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.920 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, no.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:04.000 align:middle line:84%
I've got these
people coming to me

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.750 align:middle line:84%
with these emotional
instabilities.

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And they're sitting
in front of me,

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:12.050 align:middle line:84%
and I'm supposed to have more
emotional instability than they

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:12.550 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:12.860 align:middle line:90%
Uh-uh.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, not gonna happen.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: No, they're
not going to happen.

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:16.900 align:middle line:84%
If I'm sitting
there, I don't care

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:20.860 align:middle line:84%
if I know how to do cognitive
behavioral therapy or any

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:22.120 align:middle line:90%
of those things yet.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm a person.

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting there
wanting to help them,

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:26.500 align:middle line:90%
and I care about them.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:30.520 align:middle line:84%
That alone is the core
basis of all healing.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.210 align:middle line:84%
So I know I'm doing
something good for them.

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:36.220 align:middle line:84%
And they were like, oh,
that's too much confidence.

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:37.054 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Blasphemer.

00:10:37.054 --> 00:10:37.719 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: I know.

00:10:37.719 --> 00:10:38.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, totally blasphemer.

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:44.040 align:middle line:84%
But I even had-- when I was
applying for my first job

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:47.380 align:middle line:84%
after I graduated, there
was a young director.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:48.610 align:middle line:90%
He was like 30 years old.

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:50.520 align:middle line:90%
I was already in my 40s.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me--
he said, I think

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:57.610 align:middle line:84%
you have a little bit too much
confidence to be working here.

00:10:57.610 --> 00:10:59.320 align:middle line:90%
Because we work in teams.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him, I
assure you you've not ever

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:06.730 align:middle line:84%
meet a confident
person before until me.

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:09.810 align:middle line:84%
Because I just sat here and
told you where my strengths are

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:12.110 align:middle line:90%
and where my weaknesses are.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:14.860 align:middle line:90%
A confident person can do that.

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:16.730 align:middle line:84%
Somebody who's trying
to hide something,

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:18.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm the first person to
turn to a team member.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They never
talk about weaknesses.

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:21.714 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: No, never
talk about weakness.

00:11:21.714 --> 00:11:23.940 align:middle line:84%
So I said, so you'll
have to redefine it.

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:24.530 align:middle line:90%
But that's OK.

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:26.280 align:middle line:84%
If that's what you
feel, that's all right.

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.363 align:middle line:84%
So they were always concerned
about my confidence.

00:11:28.363 --> 00:11:31.960 align:middle line:84%
But it was something
completely different than what

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:32.575 align:middle line:90%
they defined.

00:11:32.575 --> 00:11:35.830 align:middle line:90%


00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:41.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you feel with
this very topsy turvy planet

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:42.240 align:middle line:90%
we're in right now?

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.962 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's
unbelievable the stress

00:11:45.962 --> 00:11:47.170 align:middle line:90%
that's out there for people--

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:48.086 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: That's right.

00:11:48.086 --> 00:11:52.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --the road rage,
the anger, the wars.

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:57.140 align:middle line:84%
How much more can people put
up with before they crack?

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: Well the interesting
thing about all of that

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:04.330 align:middle line:84%
is these people aren't
necessarily putting up with it.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:06.560 align:middle line:90%
They're creating it.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:10.340 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
difference, is we're

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:12.890 align:middle line:90%
manifesting all of this stuff.

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:16.010 align:middle line:84%
All of the things,
whether it be politics,

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:18.480 align:middle line:90%
that is the result of society.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.750 align:middle line:90%
It's not the cause of society.

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:23.160 align:middle line:84%
And so each individual
person, what you

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.340 align:middle line:84%
see going on in the world
today with the devastations,

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:28.857 align:middle line:84%
and the shootings, and all
of that horrible stuff--

00:12:28.857 --> 00:12:30.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's one after another.

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:30.470 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't stop.

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:31.790 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: It absolutely is.

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:34.980 align:middle line:84%
It's a complete
reflection of what

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:37.100 align:middle line:84%
each individual
on the earth today

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:39.270 align:middle line:90%
is going through personally.

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:41.830 align:middle line:84%
We are shooting
ourselves down when

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:43.380 align:middle line:90%
we want to go after a dream.

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:45.550 align:middle line:90%
We say, oh, I'm not good enough.

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:48.780 align:middle line:84%
I do a whole workshop on
that, stopping yourself

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:50.330 align:middle line:90%
and become unstoppable.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:53.650 align:middle line:84%
Because it's our inner core
beliefs about ourselves

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:56.140 align:middle line:90%
that are getting in the way.

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:59.550 align:middle line:84%
Adults have these
wonderful adult beliefs,

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:01.600 align:middle line:84%
and they take all
of these classes.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And now I know this,
and I know that.

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And they're still not
able to get things done.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:13.377 align:middle line:84%
What the universe is helping
us with is shaking and bringing

00:13:13.377 --> 00:13:14.960 align:middle line:84%
to the surface-- the
way I look at it,

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.710 align:middle line:84%
it's like panning for
gold, a little reverse.

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:20.562 align:middle line:84%
When you get the old
miner, the gold miner,

00:13:20.562 --> 00:13:22.520 align:middle line:84%
he used to take a pan,
and he'd go to the river

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:22.740 align:middle line:90%
and he'd be shaking.

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:24.073 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Get his little nuggets.

00:13:24.073 --> 00:13:26.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: Little nuggets
would rise to the surface.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And some of the debris would
come out of the strainer.

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:33.700 align:middle line:84%
The way I see it is the
universe is shaking that pan,

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.430 align:middle line:84%
but the gold nuggets are
falling out of the bottom

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:37.730 align:middle line:90%
and leaving the debris--

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:38.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On the top.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.303 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: --on the surface.

00:13:39.303 --> 00:13:41.310 align:middle line:84%
So that all you have
to do is go toss it.

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:44.300 align:middle line:84%
So with all that's going
on in the world, yes.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:46.770 align:middle line:90%
Do I feel bad about it?

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:48.520 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And like Sodom and Gomorrah,
which is a metaphysical story,

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:52.970 align:middle line:90%
I was just talking about that.

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:55.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they just found
Sodom, that part of it.

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:56.311 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Yes, isn't that right?

00:13:56.311 --> 00:13:59.744 align:middle line:84%
So yes, and they're now showing
it's proof of the existence

00:13:59.744 --> 00:14:00.410 align:middle line:90%
of these places.

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:01.951 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
amazing, because it

00:14:01.951 --> 00:14:04.430 align:middle line:84%
makes you know that the
Bible is telling the truth.

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:06.620 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: It is
telling the truth,

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:10.840 align:middle line:84%
and it is also giving metaphors
about what went on there.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.950 align:middle line:84%
Because in Sodom
and Gomorrah, it

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:14.905 align:middle line:84%
wasn't that God was
going to destroy them.

00:14:14.905 --> 00:14:16.280 align:middle line:84%
They were destroying
themselves--

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:16.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They were, exactly.

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:18.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: --which is
what we are doing now.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.437 align:middle line:90%
And so the angels came.

00:14:20.437 --> 00:14:21.770 align:middle line:90%
The story is angels came a lot--

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:23.103 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: History repeats itself.

00:14:23.103 --> 00:14:26.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: --and said find
11 people, wake them up.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:29.420 align:middle line:84%
So where we're looking
for now is we probably

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:31.820 align:middle line:84%
need with 7.2 billion people
on the face of the earth,

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:32.900 align:middle line:84%
I think we need
a little bit more

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:33.810 align:middle line:90%
than 11 now for critical math.

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:34.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think so, too.

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:37.270 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Maybe a few billion.

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:40.760 align:middle line:84%
Wake them up, and it's their
spiritual understanding

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:44.470 align:middle line:84%
that will overthrow
and compensate

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:46.620 align:middle line:84%
for the negative stuff
going on, just like they

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:48.370 align:middle line:90%
did in Sodom and Gomorrah.

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
trying to do now.

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:53.420 align:middle line:84%
So yes, we can
destroy ourselves.

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:55.840 align:middle line:84%
We can completely
wipe this stuff out.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.490 align:middle line:90%
But that's the physical stuff.

00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:00.710 align:middle line:84%
The soul stuff can
never be destroyed.

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:03.270 align:middle line:84%
But the interim, all
of this suffering

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:05.010 align:middle line:90%
doesn't need to go on.

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:06.420 align:middle line:90%
That's the biggest problem.

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:09.480 align:middle line:84%
So I consider myself one of
those messengers who go out

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.200 align:middle line:90%
there to help wake up people.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.959 align:middle line:90%
I feel that exactly about you.

00:15:12.959 --> 00:15:14.500 align:middle line:84%
You're waking up
people all the time,

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:15.830 align:middle line:90%
everybody who watches this show.

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:17.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
have to wake them up.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:17.600 align:middle line:90%
You have to.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: We do, because
they're so asleep.

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:22.180 align:middle line:90%
So yes, it's devastating.

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:25.740 align:middle line:84%
I hear some of the
most painful stories.

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:28.640 align:middle line:84%
That even there's-- I sit there,
and I even say to myself, OK,

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.530 align:middle line:84%
you've got to give me some
really good words for this

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:31.030 align:middle line:90%
person.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:33.580 align:middle line:90%
Because I'm lost over here.

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:35.610 align:middle line:84%
What can I say to
make this person feel

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:38.252 align:middle line:84%
that they are divine, that
they can change their lives?

00:15:38.252 --> 00:15:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile they've
been living nothing

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:42.550 align:middle line:84%
but in the mud, and in the
right turmoil, and the trauma

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:43.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they can't
pull themselves out of it.

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:45.953 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: And they can't
pull themselves out of it.

00:15:45.953 --> 00:15:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And there's so
much fear going on.

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:54.820 align:middle line:84%
So I see it as a place for us to
help and a lot of opportunity.

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:58.550 align:middle line:84%
But I also don't deny this
is negative stuff that's

00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:59.790 align:middle line:90%
going on here.

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:05.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm not in such a place in
the paranormal or metaphysical

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:09.520 align:middle line:84%
field where I say
this is all OK.

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:10.500 align:middle line:90%
This is all OK.

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:12.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can't say
that, because it's not.

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:13.400 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: No.

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.110 align:middle line:90%
Exactly, it's not OK.

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:16.780 align:middle line:90%
This isn't the way it should be.

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:17.980 align:middle line:90%
We shouldn't be suffering.

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:20.200 align:middle line:84%
We shouldn't be dying
of all of these things.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.880 align:middle line:90%
We can stop it.

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:23.730 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to
wake people up.

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And I'm pretty strong in
being able to wake people up.

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:31.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On the day that you
join the other side, when

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:38.592 align:middle line:84%
that day comes, how would you
like your headstone to read?

00:16:38.592 --> 00:16:39.300 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Oh, wow.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Here lies
Vincent Genna.

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:43.780 align:middle line:90%
But what's the subtitle?

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:45.710 align:middle line:84%
What do you want
people to read there?

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:48.730 align:middle line:90%


00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:51.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: Who helped us
all believe in ourselves

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:53.580 align:middle line:84%
and love ourselves,
something to that effect.

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.200 align:middle line:90%
Because that's my major goal.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.890 align:middle line:84%
I want to help my
brothers and sisters

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:00.570 align:middle line:90%
know who they really are.

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:02.437 align:middle line:90%
So he empowered the world.

00:17:02.437 --> 00:17:05.290 align:middle line:90%


00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:06.607 align:middle line:90%
He made us see our dreams.

00:17:06.607 --> 00:17:09.660 align:middle line:90%


00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:13.530 align:middle line:84%
I just don't want it to say
what a pain in the ass he was.

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:15.877 align:middle line:84%
So I got to leave that out
of some of my family's hands.

00:17:15.877 --> 00:17:16.460 align:middle line:90%
I don't know--

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:17.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't want
anybody to graffiti

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:18.630 align:middle line:90%
that on your tombstone.

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:18.778 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: No, no, no.

00:17:18.778 --> 00:17:19.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, we don't want that.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.089 align:middle line:84%
That could be the sub subtext
that they want to put.

00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:25.166 align:middle line:84%
What a pain in the ass,
he changed our lives.

00:17:25.166 --> 00:17:26.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've
changed people's lives,

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:28.270 align:middle line:84%
and you do it in
a different way.

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:29.061 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Yes, I do.

00:17:29.061 --> 00:17:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Part of it
is through singing.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.280 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Oh goodness, yes.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So what do you sing?

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:36.340 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: What do I sing?

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:37.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah,
what kind of songs?

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:38.306 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: What type of songs?

00:17:38.306 --> 00:17:41.150 align:middle line:90%
Anything that's inspirational.

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:42.350 align:middle line:90%
I've been very involved in--

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:43.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ava Maria?

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.290 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: No, that's OK.

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:51.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about words
to help empower you.

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many
Broadway shows.

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:56.192 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually going to make a
CD of inspirational Broadway.

00:17:56.192 --> 00:17:57.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, fantastic.

00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:58.980 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: So that way,
people can really

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:01.450 align:middle line:90%
pay attention to those songs.

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:04.007 align:middle line:84%
One of the oldest ones is
"The Impossible Dream".

00:18:04.007 --> 00:18:04.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great song.

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:06.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: It's all about
going after that dream.

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:09.050 align:middle line:90%
There's so many messages.

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:11.510 align:middle line:84%
And that no matter
how hard it is,

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:12.950 align:middle line:90%
you still have to go after it.

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:16.210 align:middle line:84%
One of the ones that I sing
is "Climb Every Mountain".

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:20.320 align:middle line:84%
I absolutely don't profess to
sing it like the stars sang it

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.420 align:middle line:90%
in the movie.

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:27.940 align:middle line:84%
But I've had so many people say
that I've touched their heart.

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Just like the song says,
a teaspoon of sugar

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:32.250 align:middle line:90%
makes the medicine go down.

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:32.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:33.640 align:middle line:90%
Good ole Julie Andrews.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:34.740 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: That's right.

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:38.710 align:middle line:84%
My workshops have
such intense messages.

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:42.420 align:middle line:84%
Because I've gotta break
through your defense mechanisms.

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:44.030 align:middle line:90%
So it can get really hard.

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:48.100 align:middle line:84%
So I look at whatever I can
to have a gallon of honey.

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:49.190 align:middle line:90%
That's what I need.

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:51.840 align:middle line:84%
A teaspoon of sugar is not going
to make it, a gallon honey.

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.860 align:middle line:84%
So if I can use a
song to touch you,

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:58.420 align:middle line:84%
that's what I believe my
entertainment experience was

00:18:58.420 --> 00:18:58.960 align:middle line:90%
for.

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.918 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you been
singing for a long time?

00:19:00.918 --> 00:19:04.277 align:middle line:84%
Because I do that at some
of my events, and I love it.

00:19:04.277 --> 00:19:05.610 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: I heard that about you.

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:08.227 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Learned from
my mother's old records.

00:19:08.227 --> 00:19:09.060 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Absolutely.

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:10.140 align:middle line:90%
How wonderful is that?

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:13.550 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I always just was a
ham when I was a little kid.

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:15.400 align:middle line:84%
So I've been singing
for so many years.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:19.380 align:middle line:84%
But basically, 35 years I was
a professional actress, singer,

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:19.990 align:middle line:90%
and dancer.

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:21.705 align:middle line:84%
And I did some
television and movies.

00:19:21.705 --> 00:19:22.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, you did.

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:23.180 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Mostly--

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:24.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you did it well.

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:25.728 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: Well,
thank you very much.

00:19:25.728 --> 00:19:28.472 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to think
I did well at it.

00:19:28.472 --> 00:19:30.180 align:middle line:84%
That's why I want to
keep up the singing.

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:34.080 align:middle line:84%
Because I feel if that's part
of your package-- just like you,

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:35.930 align:middle line:84%
don't you continue
singing today?

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:37.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, I sure do.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:41.184 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: See, and I feel that
that's part of who we are.

00:19:41.184 --> 00:19:42.350 align:middle line:90%
And we have to include that.

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:48.280 align:middle line:90%
So I reach them anyway I can.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:50.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So I'm going to ask
you to very briefly do us

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:54.240 align:middle line:84%
a little acapella
song as we continue

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.070 align:middle line:84%
this incredible
discussion with you.

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:57.854 align:middle line:90%
Because I just want to hear you.

00:19:57.854 --> 00:19:59.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: You want
to hear me, huh?

00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:00.140 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: OK.

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:01.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And because
I'm the host--

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:02.400 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Yeah, I know--

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.691 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I can get what I want.

00:20:03.691 --> 00:20:09.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: All right, so
[SINGING] This is my quest

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:13.430 align:middle line:90%
to follow that star.

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:20.620 align:middle line:84%
No matter how hopeless,
no matter how far.

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:26.930 align:middle line:84%
To fight for the right
without question or pause

00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:33.800 align:middle line:84%
to be willing to march into
hell for a heavenly cause.

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And I know if I'll only be
true to this glorious quest

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:49.050 align:middle line:84%
that my heart will lie
peaceful and calm when

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:51.844 align:middle line:90%
my I'm laid to my rest.

00:20:51.844 --> 00:20:55.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, I notice
you put a lot of passion

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.190 align:middle line:90%
into your singing.

00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:59.840 align:middle line:90%
It's not just a voice.

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.550 align:middle line:90%
It's something from the heart.

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:03.180 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Thank you.

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:06.040 align:middle line:84%
I put a lot of passion
into everything I do.

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:08.872 align:middle line:84%
What you see is what you
get of me everywhere.

00:21:08.872 --> 00:21:10.330 align:middle line:84%
The funny thing
about that, George,

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:12.871 align:middle line:84%
is my wife always used to say
to me-- Eileen would say to me,

00:21:12.871 --> 00:21:15.530 align:middle line:84%
she said, Vinnie,
you're so intense.

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And I would say,
I'm not intense.

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:18.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm passionate.

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I was doing a workshop
about relationships one time.

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking
up the word passion.

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:28.641 align:middle line:84%
And there it is in bold
letters, an intense emotion.

00:21:28.641 --> 00:21:30.140 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, I
mean, you're right.

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:31.755 align:middle line:90%
I've been intense all my life.

00:21:31.755 --> 00:21:33.630 align:middle line:84%
That's how I get the
message through, George.

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:34.765 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Classic song.

00:21:34.765 --> 00:21:35.890 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: That's my passion.

00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:40.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why you started
your own spiritual center?

00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:43.310 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: Well, it's not
that I don't disbelieve

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:44.390 align:middle line:90%
in spiritual centers.

00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:48.960 align:middle line:84%
I absolutely believe they're
extremely beneficial.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:53.510 align:middle line:84%
But what they wind up producing
that I didn't want to produce

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:55.030 align:middle line:90%
are followers.

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:58.000 align:middle line:84%
There's a difference between
following me on Facebook.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:58.860 align:middle line:90%
I've got--

00:21:58.860 --> 00:21:59.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's easy.

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:02.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: --30,000 people
following me on Facebook.

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:03.700 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:07.230 align:middle line:84%
But the greatest part
of my job is empowering

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:09.570 align:middle line:90%
you to change your life.

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:11.000 align:middle line:90%
And here's what is interesting.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.130 align:middle line:90%
I follow Jesus' precepts.

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:17.980 align:middle line:84%
Whenever somebody came
to him for a healing,

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:19.840 align:middle line:90%
he may lay his hand out.

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.560 align:middle line:90%
He may touch them.

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.030 align:middle line:90%
And they were healed.

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And they would say,
thank you, Jesus.

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:27.740 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing he
said is I didn't heal you.

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:28.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They did.

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:29.000 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: You did.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They did, yeah.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: But if I gave you
the belief by touching you,

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:36.940 align:middle line:84%
that allowed you to believe
you were then healed,

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:37.780 align:middle line:90%
then so be it.

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:38.700 align:middle line:90%
That's my job.

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:42.315 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I always thought Jesus
was like the placebo effect.

00:22:42.315 --> 00:22:43.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: You're
absolutely right.

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:45.773 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You thought you
were getting the medicine

00:22:45.773 --> 00:22:47.640 align:middle line:90%
or getting whatever you needed.

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:48.790 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: That's right.

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:49.840 align:middle line:90%
And what did he do?

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.950 align:middle line:84%
He spoke with such
passion that he

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:56.879 align:middle line:84%
helped people finally believe
in something that strong.

00:22:56.879 --> 00:22:58.170 align:middle line:90%
And that's what made them work.

00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:00.410 align:middle line:90%
So I don't want followers.

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:03.640 align:middle line:84%
I want to empower you
to believe in yourself.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:06.690 align:middle line:84%
And I can't have one
place to do that.

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:08.892 align:middle line:84%
I want to be able to
travel all over the world.

00:23:08.892 --> 00:23:10.350 align:middle line:84%
I want to be able
to do television.

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:12.390 align:middle line:90%
I want to reach everybody.

00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:16.550 align:middle line:84%
But I don't necessarily
need a church for you

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:18.270 align:middle line:90%
to come to all the time.

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:22.200 align:middle line:84%
Empower the-- one man
can save a nation.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And what I believe by that
is by empowering one person,

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:29.260 align:middle line:84%
believing in one person,
they then can go on.

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:33.220 align:middle line:84%
So yes, believe in and at
least try what I have to say,

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:35.090 align:middle line:90%
but don't believe in me.

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:36.510 align:middle line:90%
That's not what I'm asking for.

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:37.390 align:middle line:90%
Even Jesus said that.

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:39.070 align:middle line:90%
Don't call me lord.

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:40.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm not lord.

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:42.520 align:middle line:90%
The God is lord, not me.

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:44.430 align:middle line:90%
So people have a habit of that.

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:47.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to create
followers in that way.

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:50.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, sometimes people
get dealt the wrong card.

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:50.857 align:middle line:90%
Don't they?

00:23:50.857 --> 00:23:55.430 align:middle line:90%


00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:58.570 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: I'll add on to that.

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:01.120 align:middle line:84%
People get dealt
the wrong cards,

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:03.684 align:middle line:90%
because they're the dealer.

00:24:03.684 --> 00:24:04.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:05.535 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: They're dealing
themselves the wrong card.

00:24:05.535 --> 00:24:07.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've got to
remember that the next time

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:07.742 align:middle line:90%
I'm in Vegas.

00:24:07.742 --> 00:24:08.408 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: I know.

00:24:08.408 --> 00:24:09.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, don't tell them that.

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:12.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's the only
place that it doesn't happen.

00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:14.390 align:middle line:90%
But we deal the deck.

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:15.810 align:middle line:90%
Nobody else deals it for us.

00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:17.690 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise we'd be victims.

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:19.870 align:middle line:90%
And here's what's interesting.

00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:23.550 align:middle line:84%
I did research when I was
getting my social works degree.

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And I got my degree
in psychology as well.

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:29.110 align:middle line:84%
So in my undergrad
work, I was really

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:30.820 align:middle line:90%
studying the self, so that

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:34.200 align:middle line:84%
I could truly understand
how people think

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:37.930 align:middle line:84%
and how people think about
themselves psychologically.

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:42.590 align:middle line:84%
And one of my papers that I did
I went and I asked 100 college

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:46.200 align:middle line:90%
students, are you happy?

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:49.090 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and 80% of them
right off the bat

00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:50.503 align:middle line:90%
without hesitation, oh, yes.

00:24:50.503 --> 00:24:51.003 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:24:51.003 --> 00:24:52.044 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course, yeah.

00:24:52.044 --> 00:24:54.860 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: 20%, they were between.

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:55.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:58.449 align:middle line:84%
And a few that said
no, definitely not.

00:24:58.449 --> 00:24:59.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not happy.

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:01.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: But so I'm
working with the 80%.

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:04.574 align:middle line:90%
Now I had follow up questions.

00:25:04.574 --> 00:25:05.490 align:middle line:90%
How's your life going?

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:07.370 align:middle line:90%
You have good relationships?

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:10.000 align:middle line:84%
No, I just broke up with my
boyfriend, my girlfriend.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.326 align:middle line:90%
And it sucks terrible.

00:25:11.326 --> 00:25:13.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they still
say they had a happy.

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:14.650 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Happy life, yes.

00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:16.820 align:middle line:84%
And what about your-- are
you going in the direction

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:18.361 align:middle line:84%
that you want to go
with your degree?

00:25:18.361 --> 00:25:19.567 align:middle line:90%
No, I have no idea.

00:25:19.567 --> 00:25:20.900 align:middle line:90%
I just dropped out of my degree.

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:22.920 align:middle line:84%
I go, all right, how's
your health doing?

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.530 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I just found out that
I have stage 1 diabetes.

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:26.440 align:middle line:90%
And I gone on.

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.340 align:middle line:90%
Hmm, how's family life going?

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:29.840 align:middle line:90%
Mom and dad just got a divorce.

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:32.080 align:middle line:84%
I said OK, now let me go
back to the top again.

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.371 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to you one more time.

00:25:33.371 --> 00:25:34.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ask it again.

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:36.480 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Are you really happy?

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And they turn around, and
they go, no, I guess I'm not.

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:41.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.990 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: And that
helped me to understand

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:46.420 align:middle line:84%
that people don't believe
what they think they believe.

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:49.330 align:middle line:84%
They believe what they
need to believe in order

00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:50.550 align:middle line:90%
to help them with coping.

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:52.133 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, was
there anything wrong

00:25:52.133 --> 00:25:54.640 align:middle line:84%
with them saying they're
happy from the get go?

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:57.580 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: Actually, yes.

00:25:57.580 --> 00:25:58.510 align:middle line:90%
And here's why.

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:01.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can still be
content with your life,

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:03.070 align:middle line:84%
and grateful for
what's going on,

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:05.480 align:middle line:84%
and still not have everything
in it that you want.

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.590 align:middle line:84%
But you're moving
in that direction.

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:11.930 align:middle line:84%
But what happens, people are
hiding with their adult defense

00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:13.520 align:middle line:90%
mechanisms.

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:17.890 align:middle line:84%
And I actually-- I have
a book out-- not out yet,

00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:20.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm finishing it-- about
God, it's not working.

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And I talk about different
divisions of the mind.

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:29.280 align:middle line:84%
And for example, the adult made
mind is a mind that I labeled,

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:33.400 align:middle line:84%
that in my research, it's where
we harbor all of the defense

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:37.480 align:middle line:84%
mechanisms to help protect us
against all those underlying

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.190 align:middle line:84%
bad feelings we have
about ourselves.

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:45.530 align:middle line:84%
And in that, we wind up hiding
what we are truly feeling.

00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:47.910 align:middle line:84%
So psychologically,
you go to a therapist,

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:49.790 align:middle line:84%
they try to teach
you coping skills.

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:53.390 align:middle line:84%
Coping skills are created
in that adult made mind.

00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:55.600 align:middle line:90%
But we're not physical beings.

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:58.460 align:middle line:84%
We are spiritual beings
having a physical experience.

00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:02.075 align:middle line:84%
And we're trying to get
beyond the metaphysical.

00:27:02.075 --> 00:27:03.700 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to get
beyond the physical

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:05.790 align:middle line:84%
in order to control
our lives better.

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:08.360 align:middle line:84%
So there's something
deeper going on.

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:12.045 align:middle line:84%
So your defense mechanism may be
getting you through your life.

00:27:12.045 --> 00:27:13.670 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not creating
anything because--

00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:15.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And he's not happy.

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: --underneath
where the real power

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:21.210 align:middle line:84%
is that voice that's
saying I'm not good enough.

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:22.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm not worthy enough.

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:24.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm not lovable enough.

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And by you having the defense
mechanism of oh, I'm happy,

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:32.240 align:middle line:84%
you're blocking what you're
really believing and therefore

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.660 align:middle line:90%
can't heal it.

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:37.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't want-- I'm not here
to burst people's bubbles.

00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:40.900 align:middle line:84%
But that winds up being
one of my major jobs.

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:44.980 align:middle line:84%
Because you have to get to the
core of what's bothering you.

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:48.350 align:middle line:84%
That's like going to a doctor
and telling the doctor,

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:49.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm in pain.

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:50.422 align:middle line:90%
I need you to heal me.

00:27:50.422 --> 00:27:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And when he turns around and
says well, what's hurting you?

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:53.810 align:middle line:90%
And you say, I don't know.

00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:54.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't know.

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:55.170 align:middle line:90%
I don't know where.

00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:56.336 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: I don't know where.

00:27:56.336 --> 00:27:58.030 align:middle line:84%
And so the doctor's
going, oh, how can I

00:27:58.030 --> 00:28:00.540 align:middle line:84%
help you if you don't
know where your injury is?

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:01.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:06.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: I help people see where
the injury is only for a moment

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:08.070 align:middle line:90%
to get to the healing.

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:10.330 align:middle line:84%
But it's that initial moment
that hurts them the most.

00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:11.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which is important.

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:13.630 align:middle line:84%
You're talking to lots
of people right now

00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:15.740 align:middle line:84%
who are watching this
program, Vincent.

00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:18.320 align:middle line:84%
What one message
do you want them

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:19.950 align:middle line:90%
to take away with themselves?

00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:20.855 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: One message.

00:28:20.855 --> 00:28:22.760 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I got to narrow it
down to one message?

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:23.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: One message.

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:24.535 align:middle line:90%
>>GENNA: One message?

00:28:24.535 --> 00:28:26.290 align:middle line:84%
You're asking an
Italian New Yorker

00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:30.410 align:middle line:84%
who talks all the time
to give you one message.

00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:34.200 align:middle line:84%
You cannot believe in anything
until you believe in yourself

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:35.490 align:middle line:90%
first.

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:38.570 align:middle line:84%
So if things are not
happening in your life the way

00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:41.080 align:middle line:84%
you're trying to
create them-- and we

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:45.770 align:middle line:84%
are unlimited beings who are
capable of manifesting anything

00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:46.800 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And we're capable of
doing that overnight.

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:53.680 align:middle line:84%
We have records of people
spontaneously healing

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:59.810 align:middle line:84%
stage 4 cancers, going from
zero to millions in just one

00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:01.620 align:middle line:90%
episode, one occurrence.

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:05.790 align:middle line:84%
All of that is to show
us what we're capable of.

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:10.000 align:middle line:84%
But you're not capable of
any of it just from studying,

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.130 align:middle line:84%
just from taking
all of the classes,

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:15.450 align:middle line:84%
just from saying that you
are a spiritual being.

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:17.270 align:middle line:90%
You have to believe it.

00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:19.920 align:middle line:84%
You have to not only
just believe in yourself,

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.910 align:middle line:84%
believe that you come
from some greater force.

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:24.285 align:middle line:90%
You've got to admit something.

00:29:24.285 --> 00:29:25.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There's got to be.

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:29.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GENNA: And believe that
you're worthy of your dreams,

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:34.990 align:middle line:84%
that you're lovable, that you
deserve them, that you are God.

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:38.425 align:middle line:84%
That's really the bottom line
that we're all evolving to,

00:29:38.425 --> 00:29:40.210 align:middle line:90%
to understand that.

00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:44.455 align:middle line:84%
And this life is to help
you experience all of that.

00:29:44.455 --> 00:29:47.710 align:middle line:84%
So it's not supposed to be
the sorrow that it is today.

00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:49.010 align:middle line:90%
It's supposed to be joyous.

00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:50.050 align:middle line:90%
And that's coming.

00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:51.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Vincent,
give out your website

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:53.850 align:middle line:84%
and how people can
find you on Facebook.

00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:57.940 align:middle line:10%

do is go to www.vincentgenna--

it's an abridged version of
"God and Your Ego Are One".

00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:11.180 align:middle line:84%
I have the habit of
filling in the spaces

00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:14.410 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes contradicting
some of the material that's

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:15.910 align:middle line:90%
been passed to us.

00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And you'll get that as
a gift, a free gift,

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:22.790 align:middle line:90%
for registering on my website.

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:24.140 align:middle line:90%
Catch me on Facebook.

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:27.244 align:middle line:84%
I'm constantly communicating
with everybody on Facebook.

00:30:27.244 --> 00:30:28.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:31.420 align:middle line:10%
>>GENNA: You go to Vincent
Genna MSW on Facebook.

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:34.630 align:middle line:10%
And you can communicate
with me, send me emails.

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:36.450 align:middle line:84%
I have fabulous
lectures on there

00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:37.840 align:middle line:90%
that you can even purchase.

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:40.940 align:middle line:84%
I have a wonderful
series of meditations.

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:44.360 align:middle line:84%
It's called "Seven
Journeys For Your Soul,"

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:47.550 align:middle line:84%
guided meditations to the
words and music of spirit

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:51.380 align:middle line:84%
that was totally tranced through
me and a master musician.

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:54.330 align:middle line:84%
So I try to at least put
out things for people

00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:56.270 align:middle line:90%
that they can use on their own.

00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:58.320 align:middle line:84%
But they have to hear
some of the words that

00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:59.487 align:middle line:90%
are going to get them there.

00:30:59.487 --> 00:31:00.694 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean, George?

00:31:00.694 --> 00:31:01.230 align:middle line:90%
So, yes.

00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:02.730 align:middle line:84%
So that's how people
can contact me.
