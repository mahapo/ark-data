>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.100 align:middle line:10%
We've got a great guest
for you, Jade Shaw,

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.940 align:middle line:10%
an out-of-body experience
researcher, teacher,

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.070 align:middle line:10%
astral projection expert.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And she's joining us
today on the program.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.890 align:middle line:90%
Jade, welcome.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.432 align:middle line:84%
>>JADE SHAW: Thank
you for having me.

00:00:32.432 --> 00:00:34.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Explain
because so many people

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.140 align:middle line:84%
have different definitions for
OBE, out-of-body experience.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.100 align:middle line:90%
What is yours?

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Yeah, great question.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.580 align:middle line:10%
So I actually sit on the fence.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.030 align:middle line:10%
So I don't lean towards one
definite answer or another.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.460 align:middle line:10%
So it depends who you're asking.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.260 align:middle line:10%
If you're asking
the Buddhists, they

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.350 align:middle line:10%
will say consciousness is
expanding beyond the body.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.940 align:middle line:10%
If you ask the
shamans, they will

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.280 align:middle line:10%
say spirit is leaving the body.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.260 align:middle line:84%
Many religions will say the soul
is actually leaving the body.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260 align:middle line:84%
But Western psychology
generally says

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.310 align:middle line:84%
our self-awareness is in some
way expanding beyond the body

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.630 align:middle line:84%
into a world of imagination
kind of like a virtual reality.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.720 align:middle line:84%
So those are the main ones
that people lean into.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it the soul?

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Ooh, great question.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.070 align:middle line:84%
We're going straight
in, George, the soul.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.980 align:middle line:84%
It depends how we
define the soul, right?

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:23.490 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: --is the soul the
psyche, the Greek word

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.330 align:middle line:90%
for soul, consciousness.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.150 align:middle line:84%
Is the soul something
tangible and dualistic

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.620 align:middle line:90%
that is separate from reality?

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.080 align:middle line:84%
Or is the soul
something more infinite

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.000 align:middle line:84%
and interconnected
to time and space?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.760 align:middle line:84%
And in which case, does
anything actually leave

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.800 align:middle line:84%
the body when we have an
out-of-body experience?

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.530 align:middle line:90%
So who knows for sure?

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.990 align:middle line:84%
But I like to lean into
that we're definitely

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.060 align:middle line:84%
tuning into something
beyond our own selves.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you have an
out-of-body experience?

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.080 align:middle line:84%
Or did something
happen to you to get

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.610 align:middle line:90%
you interested in this subject?

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Yeah, so I had
out-of-body experiences

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.630 align:middle line:90%
since a child.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And then many years ago,
I had a really big one

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.130 align:middle line:90%
that changed my life.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And it came about from
walking into a bookshop.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And I took a book off the
shelf that I was really

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.310 align:middle line:84%
drawn to called "Journeys Out
of the Body" by Robert Monroe.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.890 align:middle line:84%
So he's one of the first
people to start studying them.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.430 align:middle line:84%
It's where the CIA actually went
to train astral projection back

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.250 align:middle line:84%
in the 1980s with
the Stargate Program.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.140 align:middle line:90%
And I started reading the book.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.600 align:middle line:84%
And he was talking about
all these different things,

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.290 align:middle line:84%
floating out of the body,
feeling energy sensations,

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.368 align:middle line:90%
vibrating, and then--

00:02:29.368 --> 00:02:30.285 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Does it hurt?

00:02:30.285 --> 00:02:32.352 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: No, that's
a good question

00:02:32.352 --> 00:02:34.560 align:middle line:84%
because most people think,
oh, it sounds a bit scary.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.820 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't actually hurt.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.120 align:middle line:84%
But it does feel
very physical when

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.340 align:middle line:84%
you're having this
shift out of the body

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.860 align:middle line:84%
and then you see
yourself from a distance.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got
a clip of people

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.490 align:middle line:84%
talking about what
it feels like to have

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:48.840 align:middle line:90%
an out-of-body experience.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.326 align:middle line:90%
It's truly remarkable.

00:02:50.326 --> 00:02:53.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CAZ CORONEL: It can manifest
in a few different ways.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.800 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
conventional ways, I guess,

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.580 align:middle line:84%
is this feeling of
vibration occurring.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's as if you have
an energy body that's

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.864 align:middle line:90%
getting separated, you know?

[GENTLE MUSIC]

00:03:07.588 --> 00:03:13.330 align:middle line:10%
>>PAUL WOLSKI: The sounds, these
intracranial sounds of like,

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.462 align:middle line:10%
yeah, the radio interference,
the buzzing, the thunder.

00:03:19.462 --> 00:03:23.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DANIELLE BARTRAM: And all of
a sudden, this vibration would--

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.320 align:middle line:84%
it just felt like inside, not
so much it was on my lower body.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.700 align:middle line:90%
It was more all at the top.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And then it was the head and
this ringing, a really loud,

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.980 align:middle line:90%
intense roar and ringing.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.000 align:middle line:84%
It was really, really
uncomfortable, really,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.800 align:middle line:90%
really intense.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.450 align:middle line:90%
And I lifted my head up.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.387 align:middle line:90%
And it felt like a heavy weight.

00:03:39.387 --> 00:03:40.720 align:middle line:90%
My head was like a bowling ball.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.950 align:middle line:90%
And I'm lifting this up.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And it was like-- but I could
feel that I was separating

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.872 align:middle line:90%
from my physical body.

00:03:47.872 --> 00:03:52.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where do
you go during an OBE?

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.610 align:middle line:90%
What's that plane?

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Well, so many people
have so many different theories

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.290 align:middle line:84%
about where we go
in different planes.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.280 align:middle line:84%
Robert Monroe talks
about different locales,

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.040 align:middle line:90%
subtle levels of reality.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.410 align:middle line:90%
But effectively, we don't know.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.430 align:middle line:90%
And no one knows.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.640 align:middle line:84%
So if anyone says, we definitely
go here or definitely go there,

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.380 align:middle line:84%
then I'm like, OK, that's
coming from a belief system

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.180 align:middle line:90%
point of view.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it like
heaven and hell?

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Well, this is the thing.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.579 align:middle line:84%
So there does seem
to be something

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.590 align:middle line:84%
to do with our own beliefs and
then the places where we go.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.820 align:middle line:84%
So there are dimension called
belief system territory.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.920 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm a Christian, I might
experience heaven or hell.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.980 align:middle line:84%
If I am a Hindu, I might enter
into one of the Hindu realms.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.490 align:middle line:84%
So our belief systems
do tend to play

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.830 align:middle line:84%
a part in where we
go into when we leave

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.090 align:middle line:84%
our physical bodies, which is
why it's important to check

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.290 align:middle line:84%
our conditioning and our
religious, cultural, and

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.010 align:middle line:84%
personal trauma so that maybe
we can go beyond those belief

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.740 align:middle line:84%
systems into other higher,
let's say, levels of reality

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:55.540 align:middle line:90%
beyond them.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.715 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jade, you say there
are three types of OBEs.

00:04:58.715 --> 00:04:59.515 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:04:59.515 --> 00:05:01.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: So there's spontaneous.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.310 align:middle line:84%
So this is what
many of the viewers

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.130 align:middle line:84%
might have where just one night,
they find themselves floating

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.190 align:middle line:84%
out of the body, or even
they've had a traumatic event

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.510 align:middle line:90%
and it just happens.

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I happened to have
one when I was 11 years old.

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.810 align:middle line:84%
I woke up and I'm bouncing
on the ceiling looking down

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.200 align:middle line:90%
at my little body.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.265 align:middle line:84%
But it's that shock of seeing
it that just ran me right back.

00:05:22.265 --> 00:05:23.515 align:middle line:90%
But that's called spontaneous?

00:05:23.515 --> 00:05:25.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Yes, exactly.

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And that was a
wonderful example.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.900 align:middle line:84%
So many people have
had that experience.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.030 align:middle line:90%
And that's the spontaneous one.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.160 align:middle line:84%
Self-induced is
where we actually

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.882 align:middle line:84%
do some techniques to bring
about the experience ourselves

00:05:35.882 --> 00:05:37.465 align:middle line:84%
for well-being or
self-transformation.

00:05:37.465 --> 00:05:39.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's what Robert
Monroe would do all the time.

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Yes, so he would do
that to explore the multiverse.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And to find out
who he really is.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I teach as
well for people how to do it.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.750 align:middle line:90%
But then there's a forced one.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.040 align:middle line:90%
So this is the scary one.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.230 align:middle line:84%
If people have a
near-death experience,

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.650 align:middle line:84%
a traumatic accident, maybe
they are in pregnancy,

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.870 align:middle line:84%
they're on the operating
table, something

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:03.250 align:middle line:84%
happens to force their mind
or body into an experience

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.680 align:middle line:84%
where they then have an
out-of-body experience,

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.920 align:middle line:90%
like an accident.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.800 align:middle line:84%
So this is what we call
forced out-of-body.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
know this is not

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.830 align:middle line:90%
something made up in your head?

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.872 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Well, there's been
many stories of people

00:06:13.872 --> 00:06:15.518 align:middle line:90%
evidencing their experiences.

00:06:15.518 --> 00:06:16.810 align:middle line:90%
So they come out of their body.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And then they go down the
road, down the street.

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And they get a door number,
like I did in my big experience.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.220 align:middle line:84%
I went back to a street
I'd never been down before.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.730 align:middle line:84%
And so it was the same
number, number 18,

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:29.290 align:middle line:90%
that I'd had in my experience.

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.070 align:middle line:84%
That's what made me change
career because I thought,

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.945 align:middle line:90%
how is this possible?

00:06:31.945 --> 00:06:33.730 align:middle line:90%
It just absolutely blew my mind.

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:38.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There have been many
hospital OBEs where a person is

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.890 align:middle line:84%
on an operating table,
leaves his body,

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:45.220 align:middle line:84%
is looking down at the
surgeon and the staff

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.230 align:middle line:90%
working on his body.

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.520 align:middle line:90%
And then he'll come back later.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And he told these
doctors, why were you

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.090 align:middle line:90%
laughing about my operation?

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:56.710 align:middle line:90%
And they went, what?

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.830 align:middle line:90%
And he said, were you awake?

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And he said, no, I was watching
the whole thing from above.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:04.390 align:middle line:90%
Remarkable.

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Yeah, it's amazing.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.170 align:middle line:84%
There's so many on
the operating table.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:08.970 align:middle line:90%
You are right.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.932 align:middle line:84%
It reminds me of a researcher
called Dr. Penny Sartori.

00:07:11.932 --> 00:07:13.390 align:middle line:84%
She wrote a book
called "The Wisdom

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:14.920 align:middle line:90%
of Near-Death Experiences."

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.710 align:middle line:84%
And case study five
was this guy who

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:20.080 align:middle line:84%
came out of his body
on the operating table.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And he saw a doctor poke
his head around the door.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, that doctor wasn't
supposed to be in that day.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.470 align:middle line:90%
And he'd never seen him before.

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:28.840 align:middle line:84%
He came back to his body
after the operation.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh, there
was this doctor in today.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.213 align:middle line:90%
And this is what he looked like.

00:07:32.213 --> 00:07:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well,
how did you know that?

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.730 align:middle line:90%
You've never even met him.

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And he wasn't even supposed
to be in work today.

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.120 align:middle line:84%
So he couldn't have known
that that doctor came in.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.677 align:middle line:84%
And it's because he left his
body during the procedure.

00:07:42.677 --> 00:07:43.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Remarkable.

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:48.965 align:middle line:84%
Is the astral plane, Jade,
where you go when you die?

00:07:48.965 --> 00:07:51.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Well, this is
what a lot of the major--

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:53.550 align:middle line:84%
almost all of the
major religions

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:55.410 align:middle line:84%
say that this is where
you go when you die.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And they actually have different
names for the astral planes

00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:58.888 align:middle line:90%
in different religions.

00:07:58.888 --> 00:08:00.790 align:middle line:84%
For example, in
Tibetan Buddhism,

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:03.570 align:middle line:84%
which is my background, they
call it the bardo state.

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And then it's the
imaginal realms in Sufism.

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And this is why
we can meet people

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.870 align:middle line:84%
that have passed
over when we have

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.352 align:middle line:90%
these out-of-body experiences.

00:08:11.352 --> 00:08:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And I always get
asked, they always

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:15.090 align:middle line:84%
go, Jade, what is the
number one thing you would

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:16.600 align:middle line:90%
say that would benefit people?

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, healing
grief and getting closure

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.880 align:middle line:84%
because you can have that
connection to someone who's

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:22.680 align:middle line:90%
passed away.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
say that when you're

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:30.650 align:middle line:84%
alive in the astral plane,
you're connected by a cord.

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:33.409 align:middle line:84%
But when you die,
the cord is severed.

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:35.299 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Yes.

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:37.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, I might be a bit
controversial here,

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:40.520 align:middle line:84%
George, because I'm not sure
that that's a myth or not.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, some people have had
an experience of a cord.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.940 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know whether I
believe if the cord is cut,

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:47.770 align:middle line:90%
then we die.

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:49.520 align:middle line:84%
I certainly haven't
experienced it myself.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.435 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't want mine cut.

00:08:51.435 --> 00:08:54.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: No, no, and
hopefully it won't.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.540 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not sure
whether it exists.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:09:00.042 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by that is
some of the things that we see

00:09:00.042 --> 00:09:01.250 align:middle line:90%
are what we've read in books.

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:03.140 align:middle line:84%
If we've read a lot
about the silver cord,

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.400 align:middle line:90%
we might see a silver cord.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.950 align:middle line:84%
But if we don't know about
it, do we actually see it?

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:08.970 align:middle line:84%
Or does it exist
of its own accord?

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:10.940 align:middle line:84%
So this is the kind
of questions that I

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:13.295 align:middle line:84%
like to explore in an
out-of-body experience.

00:09:13.295 --> 00:09:15.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of people
have experienced, Jade,

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:17.030 align:middle line:90%
sleep paralysis.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:19.290 align:middle line:90%
Is that similar to an OBE?

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:20.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: OK.

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:22.490 align:middle line:84%
So sleep paralysis
is super scary.

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:24.350 align:middle line:90%
It's when your mind is woken up.

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:26.320 align:middle line:84%
But your body is still
paralyzed in bed.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can't move.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: You can't move
because you're dreaming.

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:31.430 align:middle line:84%
So your body makes itself
not move so you don't act out

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:32.360 align:middle line:90%
your dreams, right?

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.550 align:middle line:84%
But sleep paralysis is
where your mind is woken up.

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:37.020 align:middle line:90%
But your body is still there.

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And often people have
scary hallucinations.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:41.130 align:middle line:90%
They might sense a presence.

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:43.390 align:middle line:84%
So it is not an
out-of-body experience.

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:46.980 align:middle line:84%
However, it can be a
gateway to actually going

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:51.130 align:middle line:84%
into the astral realms, which is
why I say sleep paralysis isn't

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:51.970 align:middle line:90%
a nightmare.

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:53.230 align:middle line:90%
It's a gift.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:56.640 align:middle line:84%
So if any viewers are watching,
this is such a good place

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.060 align:middle line:84%
to be in because you're already
halfway to having an OBE

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.320 align:middle line:90%
if you have sleep paralysis.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
know how when you're

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:05.140 align:middle line:84%
ready to go to sleep you
feel that jarring effect?

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:05.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Yeah.

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:09.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that the astral
body leaving the physical body

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.980 align:middle line:90%
and then it jars back in?

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:12.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Oh, you know what?

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:13.810 align:middle line:90%
It could be.

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
is because when

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:17.160 align:middle line:84%
we have an
out-of-body experience

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.680 align:middle line:84%
on the cusp of sleep, we
enter the hypnagogic state.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.170 align:middle line:84%
This is when we're
falling asleep

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:24.780 align:middle line:84%
and we get the hypnic
jerks where you fall.

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And you've got this
jerking sensation.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.530 align:middle line:84%
But what most
people don't realize

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:30.970 align:middle line:84%
is there's a sweet
spot right there.

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And when we enter
this sweet spot,

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.590 align:middle line:84%
if you're awake
and aware, you can

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:37.020 align:middle line:84%
do a technique to
actually springboard

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:38.670 align:middle line:90%
into astral projection.

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:40.980 align:middle line:84%
So this is before
you've fallen asleep.

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:42.210 align:middle line:90%
So you could be right.

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:44.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And in
the astral state,

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:48.210 align:middle line:84%
there was a few astral
projectors called Hereward

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:50.610 align:middle line:90%
Carrington and Sylvan Muldoon.

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:51.630 align:middle line:90%
They wrote a book.

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:53.820 align:middle line:84%
They're from England,
as a matter of fact.

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And they said that
there are levels

00:10:56.370 --> 00:11:01.650 align:middle line:84%
in the astral plane that you
need to be careful about.

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:03.780 align:middle line:84%
You want to get to
the higher level.

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.850 align:middle line:84%
But you have to go
through the lower levels

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:07.260 align:middle line:90%
to get through that.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.480 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever experienced
that from other people?

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Yeah,
there has certainly

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:14.220 align:middle line:84%
been experiences of
feeling like there's

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.560 align:middle line:90%
lower planes and higher planes.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.630 align:middle line:84%
But I've come up with a
way of looking at that.

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:22.330 align:middle line:84%
So rather than seeing
it as a hierarchy--

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:25.170 align:middle line:84%
so there's lower planes that
are dark or negative or bad

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:27.840 align:middle line:84%
and higher that is good
or heavenly or divine--

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.940 align:middle line:84%
actually it's a
bit more quantum.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:33.270 align:middle line:84%
So rather than it be linear
and going straight up,

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:35.400 align:middle line:90%
it's more kind of spherical.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.470 align:middle line:90%
So I call this the valley view.

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:40.350 align:middle line:84%
So instead of seeing we're
in a negative, dark place,

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:42.930 align:middle line:84%
it might be like, OK,
now we're in a cave.

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:44.850 align:middle line:84%
OK, now we're coming
through a river.

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:47.800 align:middle line:84%
Now we're at the top of a
hill going into the clouds.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.610 align:middle line:84%
Now we are going forward
into a different place

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:51.570 align:middle line:90%
through a forest.

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:53.790 align:middle line:84%
So there's these
light and dark places

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:56.070 align:middle line:90%
we can shift and move into.

00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't mean
in a fashion where

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.130 align:middle line:84%
we're going from good
to bad but rather

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:04.170 align:middle line:84%
that we're just on a
journey of consciousness

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:07.080 align:middle line:84%
moving forward through
different planes.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.050 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:09.592 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It does
make a lot of sense.

00:12:09.592 --> 00:12:12.360 align:middle line:84%
And Jade, we briefly talked
about your personal OBE

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.500 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.200 align:middle line:84%
Elaborate a little bit more
on what happened to you.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Yeah.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.160 align:middle line:84%
So I tried some
techniques from the book

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.650 align:middle line:84%
"Journeys out of the Body"
and nothing happened.

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:23.550 align:middle line:90%
I tried for a month.

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:26.008 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, you know what,
it's probably just dreaming,

00:12:26.008 --> 00:12:27.480 align:middle line:90%
probably all in my head.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.730 align:middle line:84%
But then one night, I
got up to go to the loo,

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:33.210 align:middle line:84%
came back, and went straight
into the vibrational state.

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:36.670 align:middle line:84%
So this is when just
before we leave the body,

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:38.640 align:middle line:84%
these feelings of
energy vibration.

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:39.960 align:middle line:90%
And then you shift out.

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:40.830 align:middle line:90%
So I shifted out.

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:42.210 align:middle line:90%
And then I was in my bedroom.

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, OK,
I'm out of my body.

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.290 align:middle line:84%
I looked back, saw
myself lying there.

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And then I was thinking,
what do I do now?

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.770 align:middle line:84%
So thinking, OK,
go out the window.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:54.660 align:middle line:84%
So I flew through the window,
which was a strange feeling

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:58.230 align:middle line:84%
because it's very physical
even though you're nonphysical,

00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:59.520 align:middle line:90%
landed in the street.

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:03.750 align:middle line:84%
And I could sense the dew on the
tips of the grass to my right.

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:06.430 align:middle line:84%
I could see the molecules
in the sunbeam coming down

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:07.230 align:middle line:90%
to the left.

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:10.320 align:middle line:84%
I had heightened
sensory perception a bit

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.330 align:middle line:90%
like Spider-Man senses.

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:12.705 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Everything
was enhanced?

00:13:12.705 --> 00:13:16.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Yes, everything
was enhanced like 3D.

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, oh my
gosh, what should I do now?

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm in this other dimension.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.270 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, I'm going
to try to evidence it.

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:26.520 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, I'm going to
do what my Tibetan Buddhist

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.750 align:middle line:84%
teacher said and go
get a door number.

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:29.550 align:middle line:90%
So I went.

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And I found a street that
I'd never been to before.

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is important
because the skeptics

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.080 align:middle line:84%
will say, oh, you're just
drawing on your imagination.

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.170 align:middle line:84%
You're just drawing
on your past history

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:41.120 align:middle line:84%
to recreate a reality
that isn't real.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're making
it up in your head.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: You're making
it up in your head.

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:45.613 align:middle line:84%
But if you've never
been there before,

00:13:45.613 --> 00:13:47.540 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing for
you to draw from.

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:49.730 align:middle line:84%
So I got the door
number, number 18.

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:51.530 align:middle line:84%
I thought, OK, I
know where this is.

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:53.040 align:middle line:90%
I can come back and evidence it.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.560 align:middle line:90%
But what should I do now?

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
everything changed.

00:13:57.110 --> 00:14:01.820 align:middle line:84%
I called out to the
space, take me to nirvana.

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:05.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, nirvana to me is like
a pure heavenly realm.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.220 align:middle line:84%
So that's my
association to the word.

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:08.480 align:middle line:90%
I called that out.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And from the first way on,
I was out of my control.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:18.590 align:middle line:84%
Some unseen force picked me
up, up, up above the clouds.

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:21.740 align:middle line:84%
But before I got to
the crust of the Earth,

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:23.937 align:middle line:84%
I passed through
some thin membrane.

00:14:23.937 --> 00:14:25.520 align:middle line:84%
Do you know what it
felt like, George?

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:29.420 align:middle line:84%
It felt like a flat sheet of
static hanging in the air.

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And when I passed through,
I lost my astral body.

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:36.120 align:middle line:84%
There was no sense of space,
no up, down, left, right.

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.950 align:middle line:90%
And I was in this huge tunnel.

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:41.310 align:middle line:84%
It was so big, it filled
the whole periphery of me

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:42.750 align:middle line:90%
of my perception.

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And there was a white
light at the end.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And I was magnetized
moving towards it.

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:50.160 align:middle line:90%
I got halfway down.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.205 align:middle line:90%
And guess what happened.

00:14:51.205 --> 00:14:52.005 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What?

00:14:52.005 --> 00:14:53.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: I got super scared.

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:55.036 align:middle line:84%
And what happens in an
out-of-body experience--

00:14:55.036 --> 00:14:56.119 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It rams you back.

00:14:56.119 --> 00:14:58.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Yes, straight
back into my body.

00:14:58.570 --> 00:14:59.580 align:middle line:90%
I sat up in bed.

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:01.980 align:middle line:84%
I was covered in
static electricity.

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:03.843 align:middle line:84%
And my former husband
at the time wakes up.

00:15:03.843 --> 00:15:05.010 align:middle line:90%
He's going, what's happened?

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:05.810 align:middle line:90%
What's happened?

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And I go, think I've just had
an out of body experience.

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:10.140 align:middle line:90%
He goes, oh, OK.

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:11.635 align:middle line:84%
Rolls over and
goes back to sleep.

00:15:11.635 --> 00:15:12.435 align:middle line:90%
Typical.

00:15:12.435 --> 00:15:14.102 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's why
he's the ex-husband.

00:15:14.102 --> 00:15:15.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Yes, this
is why he is the ex.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.190 align:middle line:90%
I like that, George.

00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:18.120 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.790 align:middle line:84%
But that day, I went
back to the street.

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:23.910 align:middle line:84%
And I saw the door
number, number 18.

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:25.750 align:middle line:84%
The same one as
in my experience.

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:26.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:28.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: And I looked
at the tunnel of light.

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And of course, many
people have had

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:33.240 align:middle line:84%
this in out-of-body experiences,
near-death experiences.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.890 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't shake it off.

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:37.830 align:middle line:10%
And what I'd been working on
with my work before then--

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:40.140 align:middle line:10%
I was a choreographer
around my own dance school--

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:42.630 align:middle line:10%
was trying to get funding
from the UK government

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:45.720 align:middle line:10%
for four years for a
program to roll out

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.490 align:middle line:10%
a course across the
whole of the UK.

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:50.700 align:middle line:84%
I got the email a few
days later saying,

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:52.710 align:middle line:84%
we're going to give
you this funding.

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:54.340 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I'm so sorry.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.940 align:middle line:90%
But I can't take it.

00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:01.180 align:middle line:84%
I can't go on doing the same
work knowing what I know now.

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:03.420 align:middle line:84%
So I said, thank you,
but no thank you.

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:06.960 align:middle line:84%
I left my dance school
15-year career in the arts

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.150 align:middle line:84%
to go back to university
to study a master's

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:10.954 align:middle line:90%
in transpersonal psychology.

00:16:10.954 --> 00:16:11.954 align:middle line:90%
So that's the study of--

00:16:11.954 --> 00:16:13.537 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was a
huge move for you.

00:16:13.537 --> 00:16:15.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: It was a
huge move, exactly.

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:17.460 align:middle line:84%
It was massive to
leave everything

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:20.760 align:middle line:84%
you've worked for behind to try
something new and something,

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.920 align:middle line:84%
let's face it, a little
bit weird and a little bit

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.540 align:middle line:90%
alternative.

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:26.010 align:middle line:90%
But I knew I had to follow it.

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:27.540 align:middle line:84%
I knew it was part
of my purpose.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:29.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you've never
looked back, have you?

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:31.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: No, definitely not.

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:34.680 align:middle line:84%
This is wonderful work that's
changing people's lives.

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:39.555 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is astral projection
like remote viewing?

00:16:39.555 --> 00:16:41.105 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: It's a little different.

00:16:41.105 --> 00:16:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is how it's
different from remote viewing.

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:45.360 align:middle line:84%
Remote viewing is you go
into an altered state.

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.672 align:middle line:84%
You send your
perception somewhere.

00:16:47.672 --> 00:16:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And you see something
in your mind's eye.

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:50.640 align:middle line:90%
And you can draw it down.

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And you can get the
coordinates of something.

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:54.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And without thinking.

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:55.695 align:middle line:90%
You just do it fast.

00:16:55.695 --> 00:16:56.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Exactly.

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:59.580 align:middle line:84%
So it's like going into a
trance and then having a vision

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:01.470 align:middle line:84%
and putting that
vision down to paper,

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:03.090 align:middle line:84%
whereas in out-of-body
experiences,

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:05.910 align:middle line:84%
you have the visceral
sensation of leaving.

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:07.920 align:middle line:84%
So it's full-on "Doctor
Strange," if you've

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.329 align:middle line:90%
seen the superhero movie.

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:10.630 align:middle line:90%
Shift out of the body.

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:11.430 align:middle line:90%
Turn around.

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:12.930 align:middle line:84%
You can see yourself
lying there.

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:14.819 align:middle line:84%
So it's that sense
of separation.

00:17:14.819 --> 00:17:18.780 align:middle line:84%
When I did the consultancy
for the film "Behind Her Eyes"

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:22.470 align:middle line:84%
on Netflix, I gave a workshop
to all of the cast members.

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:25.569 align:middle line:84%
And the main character managed
to get her astral head out

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:26.369 align:middle line:90%
of her body.

00:17:26.369 --> 00:17:28.300 align:middle line:90%
It was so shocking.

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:29.520 align:middle line:90%
She snapped back.

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.765 align:middle line:90%
And she said to me--

00:17:30.765 --> 00:17:31.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Scared her.

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:32.490 align:middle line:90%
It scared her.

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:33.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: --I left my body.

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:34.230 align:middle line:90%
It scared her.

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:35.460 align:middle line:90%
She was really petrified.

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, it's
completely safe.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.420 align:middle line:84%
Don't worry, it's
absolutely fantastic

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.070 align:middle line:84%
that she did that
in one session.

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:42.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It scared
me when I was 11

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:45.870 align:middle line:84%
when I had that situation
bouncing on the ceiling looking

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:47.380 align:middle line:90%
down at my little body.

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:51.330 align:middle line:84%
But what it did do for me,
Jade, is I went to the library

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:54.600 align:middle line:84%
at 11 years old, stumbled
into the occult section

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.520 align:middle line:84%
where they had all
these kinds of books,

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.640 align:middle line:84%
and found the book "The
Projections of the Astral Body"

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:03.300 align:middle line:84%
by Sylvan Muldoon and Hereward
Carrington, Robert Crookall,

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:04.770 align:middle line:90%
another Englishman.

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:06.570 align:middle line:90%
Huge stuff.

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:07.560 align:middle line:90%
And it's ongoing.

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:12.420 align:middle line:84%
But when you die, at
the moment of death,

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:14.970 align:middle line:84%
tell me about the
astral projection.

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:16.860 align:middle line:90%
What happens then?

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Well, my background
is from Vajrayana Buddhism,

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:21.060 align:middle line:90%
Tibetan Buddhism.

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And I've learnt out-of-body
experiences from that

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:25.080 align:middle line:90%
perspective.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And one of the main
reasons they train

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:29.220 align:middle line:84%
it is for the moment
of death, that

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:32.400 align:middle line:84%
point where we take our last
breath, the heart stops,

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.280 align:middle line:84%
and then we have that
sense of separation.

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like a study
guide in dying, isn't it?

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:38.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Yeah, It is.

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And they say that
if we can recognize

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:42.730 align:middle line:84%
by having an
out-of-body experience

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:44.920 align:middle line:84%
and knowing that
we've died, we can

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:48.790 align:middle line:84%
move into the bardo state,
the next plane, the next step

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:50.230 align:middle line:90%
with conscious awareness.

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And we can choose where we
reincarnate, where we go next.

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And they say, this is
why it's good to practice

00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:59.200 align:middle line:84%
out-of-body experiences so
that we can die consciously.

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:02.950 align:middle line:84%
And get even this, that
we can die with joy.

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:06.910 align:middle line:84%
So they say imagine not just
dying in fear, or panic,

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:08.000 align:middle line:90%
or in pain.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.500 align:middle line:84%
But if you could embrace that
moment of death with joy.

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And then be aware
on the other side.

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And choose where
you want to go next.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us about
your Astral Academy.

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:19.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Oh, the Astral Academy.

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.498 align:middle line:84%
George, the community,
I love them so much.

00:19:22.498 --> 00:19:23.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's your baby, huh?

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:26.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Yeah, and oh,
everyone is so beautiful.

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:28.860 align:middle line:84%
Imagine all of the people
all around the world

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:31.080 align:middle line:84%
having these experiences
and not being

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.840 align:middle line:84%
able to talk about it for
fear of judgment or ridicule

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:36.000 align:middle line:84%
and then coming
together in one space

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.120 align:middle line:84%
where they can talk openly,
share experiences, and then

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.180 align:middle line:90%
practice.

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:41.880 align:middle line:90%
So we have a seven-week school.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And different teachers come
from different backgrounds

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:46.800 align:middle line:84%
and fields, neuroscience,
shamanism, Buddhism.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And then they learn different
tools and techniques.

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And then they put them
into practice each week.

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:52.808 align:middle line:90%
And then we have homework.

00:19:52.808 --> 00:19:53.850 align:middle line:90%
And then we get together.

00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And we have a huge
graduation ceremony

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:57.090 align:middle line:90%
at the end where we dance.

00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And then they keep
contact with each other

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:01.660 align:middle line:84%
in a WhatsApp group, a
private Facebook group

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:03.900 align:middle line:84%
so we can keep that
learning journey going.

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:05.595 align:middle line:90%
And they can support each other.

00:20:05.595 --> 00:20:10.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, are they learning
astral projection to study it,

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:15.180 align:middle line:84%
or to teach it, or to
just be able to do it,

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:16.440 align:middle line:90%
or all of the above?

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:18.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Kind of a bit
of all of the above.

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:21.100 align:middle line:84%
But mainly, they're
beginners to intermediate.

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:22.900 align:middle line:84%
So some people are
just starting out.

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:24.100 align:middle line:90%
They want to give it a go.

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:26.660 align:middle line:84%
They want to lose some
fear and limiting beliefs

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:28.630 align:middle line:84%
so that they can actually
have the experience.

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:31.300 align:middle line:84%
But others want to do it
for self-transformation,

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:35.620 align:middle line:84%
well-being, spiritual
awakening, to be able to evolve

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:36.490 align:middle line:90%
their consciousness.

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:40.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us a story of a
student who has transformed.

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:41.530 align:middle line:90%
Do you have one, a favorite?

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:44.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Yeah, and the
reason why I'm smiling

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:46.270 align:middle line:84%
is because the one
that came to mind first

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:48.850 align:middle line:84%
is Paul, who you
mentioned in the video.

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:53.200 align:middle line:84%
So he's had experiences, quite
scary ones when he was younger

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.030 align:middle line:90%
and then started to train it.

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:59.110 align:middle line:84%
So he was told at school that he
would never amount to anything.

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:00.160 align:middle line:90%
He dropped out of school.

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.320 align:middle line:84%
He had problems with
alcohol and addiction.

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.430 align:middle line:90%
He was a musician.

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And he was very
scared of education.

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:06.820 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't a good
experience for him.

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:09.850 align:middle line:84%
He had a very powerful
out-of-body experience.

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:15.070 align:middle line:84%
And when he came back from that,
he lost his fear of education.

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:17.620 align:middle line:84%
He knew that he was more
than his physical body.

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And he decided to
go back to school,

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:23.980 align:middle line:84%
back to university to complete
a master's degree in philosophy.

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:26.140 align:middle line:90%
And so he's just graduated.

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I would
have never have

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:30.837 align:middle line:84%
done that if it wasn't for
my fears dissolving away

00:21:30.837 --> 00:21:32.170 align:middle line:90%
from the out-of-body experience.

00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when you say
he had a powerful OBE, what

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:39.100 align:middle line:90%
does that mean, powerful?

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:41.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: The content
of the OBE can

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:42.710 align:middle line:90%
differ for different people.

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:44.407 align:middle line:84%
Some people just come
out of their body.

00:21:44.407 --> 00:21:45.490 align:middle line:90%
And they're in their room.

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:47.030 align:middle line:90%
And then they snap back.

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:48.730 align:middle line:84%
Some people come
out of their body

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:50.500 align:middle line:84%
and go into
different dimensions,

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:54.130 align:middle line:84%
experience other cosmic
levels of reality,

00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:56.870 align:middle line:84%
and meet different guides
and different beings.

00:21:56.870 --> 00:22:00.160 align:middle line:84%
So he had an
encounter with a being

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:03.530 align:middle line:84%
out there, which he felt
helped him dissolve his fear.

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:06.250 align:middle line:84%
So it was one of these
encounters that I say.

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And that really affected
him in a positive way.

00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:10.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if,
Jade, the brain

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:12.530 align:middle line:90%
is playing tricks with us?

00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:17.680 align:middle line:84%
What if we're not OBEing but
the brain is doing something?

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:18.525 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:22:18.525 --> 00:22:21.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Well, I mean, the
brain is doing everything.

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:24.110 align:middle line:84%
Every experience we
have, the brain is doing.

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:29.320 align:middle line:84%
For example, you can imagine
that you're smelling a tomato.

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.960 align:middle line:84%
And you can imagine
you're tasting a tomato.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And the same area of
the brain will light up

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:35.870 align:middle line:90%
as if it's actually happening.

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:40.390 align:middle line:84%
So we can't really trust the
neurochemicals of the brain

00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:42.610 align:middle line:84%
to tell us what is real
and what is not real

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:45.640 align:middle line:84%
because the brain thinks
almost every experience we

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:46.540 align:middle line:90%
have is real.

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And we see this
with lucid dreaming.

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.370 align:middle line:84%
You can put lucid dreamers
into a brain scanner.

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And the brain will think
it is really happening.

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:55.360 align:middle line:84%
But, of course,
it's not happening.

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.100 align:middle line:90%
It's happening in a lucid dream.

00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:00.740 align:middle line:84%
So we can't really trust the
neural correlates of the brain.

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:03.760 align:middle line:84%
But what I do believe is
that our reality is filtered

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.480 align:middle line:90%
through them to some degree.

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:09.220 align:middle line:84%
So when we have astral
projection experiences, what

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:12.550 align:middle line:84%
we try to do is filter away
all of the sensory input

00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:13.700 align:middle line:90%
from the brain.

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:17.980 align:middle line:84%
So we try and create a sensory
deprivation environment

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:19.820 align:middle line:84%
to be able to have
the experiences.

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:20.665 align:middle line:90%
So it does help.

00:23:20.665 --> 00:23:24.495 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've done
experiments and studies on OBEs.

00:23:24.495 --> 00:23:25.495 align:middle line:90%
What have you uncovered?

00:23:25.495 --> 00:23:28.372 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Yes, so I look
at healthy people.

00:23:28.372 --> 00:23:30.580 align:middle line:84%
The reason why I'm pointing
and saying it in that way

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:32.290 align:middle line:84%
is because many
experiments are done

00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:35.080 align:middle line:84%
on people with
mental health issues

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.070 align:middle line:84%
and out-of-body
experiences but not many

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:38.720 align:middle line:90%
with healthy individuals.

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at, OK, how
did their life change?

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:43.920 align:middle line:84%
So they were going about
their everyday life.

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:45.840 align:middle line:84%
They had a huge
out-of-body experience.

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.570 align:middle line:90%
How did it change afterwards?

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:49.620 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at
their sense of self.

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:52.220 align:middle line:84%
So how we feel about
ourselves in the world.

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And self-transformation
had eight themes.

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:58.570 align:middle line:84%
So across the board, the entire
group had eight things happen.

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:00.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, I might not
remember them all because

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.520 align:middle line:90%
a bad working memory.

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:05.510 align:middle line:84%
But a few of them are, they
had increased self-awareness.

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:07.850 align:middle line:84%
They became more aware
of their internal world.

00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:10.220 align:middle line:90%
They had increased inner peace.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.080 align:middle line:90%
They felt less anxiety.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.720 align:middle line:84%
They changed their
relationships with people.

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:17.460 align:middle line:84%
So they let go of toxic
relationships, welcomed

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:18.260 align:middle line:90%
in new ones.

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:21.930 align:middle line:84%
They knew what was good and
what wasn't for them anymore.

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:24.470 align:middle line:84%
And it became a
motivating catalyst.

00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:26.240 align:middle line:84%
So you said you came
out of your body.

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:27.740 align:middle line:84%
And it made you go
into the library.

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:29.130 align:middle line:90%
You wanted to look it up.

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:31.700 align:middle line:90%
So they had that big motivation.

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And from that motivation,
they made a huge change

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:34.730 align:middle line:90%
in their life.

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And that change
seemed reflective

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:41.240 align:middle line:84%
of their psyche wanting to
self-actualize a new path,

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.170 align:middle line:90%
a new reality into their life.

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:46.280 align:middle line:84%
So it was like an opening,
like a gateway for that person.

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:47.880 align:middle line:90%
And they all had this.

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:50.780 align:middle line:84%
So this is what makes me
believe they are evolutionary.

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:55.400 align:middle line:84%
It's the psyche trying to
self actualize into existence

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.485 align:middle line:90%
a new way of being.

00:24:56.485 --> 00:24:58.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is remarkable.

00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:00.065 align:middle line:84%
Is there a science behind
these eight themes?

00:25:00.065 --> 00:25:01.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: So psychology.

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:06.650 align:middle line:84%
So I studied how their psyche
changed after the experience.

00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And Western psychology clustered
as a quantum change experience

00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:13.730 align:middle line:84%
and an exceptional
human experience.

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:14.653 align:middle line:90%
What does this mean?

00:25:14.653 --> 00:25:16.070 align:middle line:84%
So in Western
psychology, it means

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:18.980 align:middle line:84%
that the change is
so radical that there

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:21.620 align:middle line:84%
is a shift in consciousness
almost overnight.

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:23.390 align:middle line:84%
And then that has
a domino effect

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:26.245 align:middle line:84%
onto all of the different eight
themes that I just spoke about.

00:25:26.245 --> 00:25:28.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, we've
got a clip explaining

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:30.590 align:middle line:84%
why out-of-body
experiences aren't

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:33.530 align:middle line:84%
studied enough in real science,
as we were just mentioning.

00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:36.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SPEAKER: People experience
them all the time right

00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:37.610 align:middle line:90%
across the world.

00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:39.665 align:middle line:84%
But scientists just
don't want to know.

00:25:39.665 --> 00:25:41.975 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't fit in.

00:25:41.975 --> 00:25:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM FREKE: There's three
reasons why they don't

00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:46.400 align:middle line:90%
get taken seriously enough.

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:52.520 align:middle line:84%
One is they're still
relatively rare experiences.

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:54.470 align:middle line:90%
I don't sometimes see.

00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:57.060 align:middle line:84%
I see whenever I open
my eyes, thank goodness.

00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:59.360 align:middle line:84%
But I only sometimes
have those experiences.

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:02.690 align:middle line:84%
They're on the cutting
edge of where we're going.

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:06.980 align:middle line:84%
It's a new possibility
that hasn't really--

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:09.330 align:middle line:84%
some people better than
others, all that stuff.

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:10.890 align:middle line:90%
That's the first reason.

00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:14.120 align:middle line:84%
The second reason is
science only looks

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.350 align:middle line:90%
at the sensual world.

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:18.260 align:middle line:84%
So it says that doesn't
exist, or that's just

00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:19.620 align:middle line:90%
an illusion or a byproduct.

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:21.207 align:middle line:84%
So it dismisses
it theoretically.

00:26:21.207 --> 00:26:22.790 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it
doesn't want to look

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:25.970 align:middle line:84%
at it, which is a shame,
because the odd things are

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:28.500 align:middle line:84%
where the new understanding
will come from.

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And the third thing is in the
causal world, the material

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:36.670 align:middle line:84%
world, you can reproduce
things generally.

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:39.380 align:middle line:84%
The more complicated it is, the
harder it is to reproduce it.

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:43.960 align:middle line:84%
So experiences like
telepathy happen in a story.

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:46.490 align:middle line:84%
They happened because something
occurred for my loved one.

00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:48.655 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can't make
that happen in a lab.

00:26:48.655 --> 00:26:51.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a noted
author on OBEs, isn't it?

00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:53.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Yeah, Tim Freke.

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:55.660 align:middle line:90%
He's an amazing author.

00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:59.080 align:middle line:84%
He's wrote over 25 different
books on spiritual awakening

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.820 align:middle line:84%
and the evolution
of consciousness.

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:04.960 align:middle line:84%
And he talks a lot about
how the more we individuate,

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:08.300 align:middle line:84%
the more we become ourselves,
the more the collective becomes

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:09.100 align:middle line:90%
different.

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:13.450 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, in that
paradox, we become more one.

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:16.990 align:middle line:84%
So there's this polarity
between individualization

00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:20.530 align:middle line:84%
and also the collective
and the dance between that.

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:25.545 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is it so
important to understand OBEs?

00:27:25.545 --> 00:27:28.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Wow, I've never been
asked that question before,

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:28.520 align:middle line:90%
George.

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:30.145 align:middle line:84%
Why is it important
to understand them?

00:27:30.145 --> 00:27:34.250 align:middle line:84%
I think if we can understand
out-of-body experiences, which

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:36.380 align:middle line:84%
is ultimately the
understanding of consciousness

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:39.800 align:middle line:84%
and conscious experience,
we can understand

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:43.670 align:middle line:84%
what it is to be human,
who we are, why we're here,

00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:46.570 align:middle line:84%
and the great mysteries
of the universe.

00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:48.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it make
you a better person

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:50.895 align:middle line:90%
if you understand what it is?

00:27:50.895 --> 00:27:53.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: I think it makes
you a better person

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:55.900 align:middle line:84%
if you have one because
it has the same effects

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:58.300 align:middle line:84%
that psychedelics
does on the ego.

00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:01.060 align:middle line:84%
So you get a bit
of ego dissolution

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:02.990 align:middle line:90%
dissolving when you come back.

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:05.500 align:middle line:84%
So there's this theory that
I have called the outer view

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:08.350 align:middle line:84%
effect, which is a spin on
the overview effect, which

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:10.870 align:middle line:84%
is what astronauts get
when they're in space.

00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:12.100 align:middle line:90%
They look back at Earth.

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And they feel
incredible compassion.

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:16.810 align:middle line:90%
They become more charitable.

00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:21.730 align:middle line:84%
Their self-identification with a
strong rigidness of their sense

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:23.317 align:middle line:90%
of self softens away.

00:28:23.317 --> 00:28:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And when you have an
out-of-body experience,

00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:28.300 align:middle line:84%
you look back at your body,
the same thing happens.

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:30.820 align:middle line:84%
And people feel like they
can kind of, ah, sit back

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:31.780 align:middle line:90%
into my life.

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:32.860 align:middle line:90%
They're more softer.

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:35.290 align:middle line:84%
They're less judgmental,
more accepting of people.

00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did "Forbes"
magazine pick up

00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:38.880 align:middle line:90%
on what you're working on?

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Yeah, so Forbes
published this year,

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:43.960 align:middle line:84%
my research on the
transformative effects

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:45.220 align:middle line:90%
of out-of-body experiences.

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:48.125 align:middle line:84%
And they did a report on the
eight different themes as well.

00:28:48.125 --> 00:28:49.000 align:middle line:90%
So this is fantastic.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.042 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's dramatic.

00:28:50.042 --> 00:28:52.065 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: It's massive,
out-of-body experiences

00:28:52.065 --> 00:28:52.865 align:middle line:90%
in the mainstream.

00:28:52.865 --> 00:28:54.845 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: By a
mainstream media outlet.

00:28:54.845 --> 00:28:57.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Yeah, and a reputable
one at that as well.

00:28:57.690 --> 00:28:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's because
the research was

00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:01.560 align:middle line:90%
scientifically peer-reviewed.

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.650 align:middle line:84%
So to get something
peer-reviewed, oh my gosh,

00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:06.860 align:middle line:84%
let me tell you, it's such
a rigmarole in academia.

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:08.250 align:middle line:90%
And it's very hard work.

00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:11.780 align:middle line:84%
So I'm so proud that that's
got out into the mainstream.

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:16.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
hypnopompic mindfulness?

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:18.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Hypnopompic
and hypnagogic

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:19.970 align:middle line:90%
is my favorite thing.

00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:23.460 align:middle line:84%
It's when you're falling
asleep and when you wake up,

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:27.120 align:middle line:84%
you go through this
transitory phase.

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:30.290 align:middle line:84%
And if we can bring
mindfulness to this place,

00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:33.170 align:middle line:84%
we can actually hack
when we fall asleep

00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:34.970 align:middle line:84%
and when we wake up
to be able to have

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:36.540 align:middle line:90%
an out-of-body experience.

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:39.930 align:middle line:84%
So it is falling asleep
consciously effectively.

00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:41.060 align:middle line:90%
It's from yoga nidra.

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:44.043 align:middle line:84%
So in order to do that,
something we can do when

00:29:44.043 --> 00:29:46.460 align:middle line:84%
we're falling asleep tonight--
and all the viewers can try

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:47.260 align:middle line:90%
this--

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:51.030 align:middle line:84%
is to just be aware
of what do I feel?

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:52.610 align:middle line:90%
What do I see?

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:54.320 align:middle line:90%
And what do I hear?

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:57.290 align:middle line:84%
But you have a few
moments to feel into that.

00:29:57.290 --> 00:29:58.460 align:middle line:90%
What do I feel?

00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:00.230 align:middle line:84%
OK, what are my
feeling sensations

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:01.700 align:middle line:90%
in the body around me?

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:02.630 align:middle line:90%
What do I see?

00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:04.850 align:middle line:84%
What am I seeing
behind my eyes, colors?

00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:06.980 align:middle line:84%
What am I seeing
in my mind perhaps?

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:07.940 align:middle line:90%
What do I hear?

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:09.440 align:middle line:90%
Am I hearing anything?

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:13.340 align:middle line:84%
Can I hear what's in my room,
maybe subtle sounds in my body?

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And then you keep
repeating that cycle.

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:19.070 align:middle line:84%
The more we repeat that cycle,
the more awareness we bring.

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And as we're falling asleep, we
become more aware, more aware,

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.240 align:middle line:90%
more aware.

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:25.220 align:middle line:84%
Then we hit the
Goldilocks conditions

00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:27.620 align:middle line:84%
where we're not too
awake, not too asleep.

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
sweet spot where we

00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:31.490 align:middle line:84%
can do a technique
to then springboard

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:32.720 align:middle line:90%
from the physical body.

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:37.925 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The evolutionary needs
for OBEs, what could they be?

00:30:37.925 --> 00:30:41.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Evolutionary needs
for out-of-body experiences.

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:44.720 align:middle line:84%
Personally, I
believe if everybody

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.220 align:middle line:84%
had an out-of-body
experience, there

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:48.320 align:middle line:90%
would be a collective awakening.

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:51.380 align:middle line:84%
The reason for that is we
would have better health.

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And there would be less
conflict in the world

00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:56.000 align:middle line:84%
through three
psychological reasons--

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.530 align:middle line:90%
the reduced fear of death.

00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:01.200 align:middle line:84%
Ernest Becker, who wrote the
book, "The denial of Death--

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.330 align:middle line:84%
and he's a Pulitzer
Prize winner--

00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:08.730 align:middle line:84%
says that Freud was wrong about
mankind's greatest suppression.

00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:10.050 align:middle line:90%
It's not sex, he says.

00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:11.040 align:middle line:90%
But it's death.

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:13.735 align:middle line:84%
We suppress the
idea of mortality.

00:31:13.735 --> 00:31:14.610 align:middle line:90%
We don't want to die.

00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:15.790 align:middle line:90%
We don't want to talk about it.

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:16.740 align:middle line:90%
We shove it under the rug.

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:17.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People
are afraid of it.

00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:19.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: They're afraid
of death naturally.

00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:22.150 align:middle line:84%
So when we reduce
our fear of death,

00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:23.670 align:middle line:84%
which is one of the
biggest benefits

00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:26.010 align:middle line:84%
of out-of-body experiences,
we release a lot

00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:28.470 align:middle line:84%
of fears that underpin
a lot of the things

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:29.710 align:middle line:90%
that we do in the world.

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:30.930 align:middle line:90%
So reduce fear of death.

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:33.180 align:middle line:84%
The second one is the
experience of awe.

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:35.670 align:middle line:84%
You know that some therapists
are prescribing this

00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:38.970 align:middle line:84%
now because we have the science
on how it can reduce diseases

00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:40.800 align:middle line:90%
that have inflammation.

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And it also makes you
open up your perception

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.940 align:middle line:84%
to different possibilities
you didn't know existed.

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:47.250 align:middle line:90%
So the experience of awe.

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:49.770 align:middle line:84%
And then the third one
is self-transcendence.

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:52.262 align:middle line:84%
So Maslow, who's a famous
psychologist, spoke about--

00:31:52.262 --> 00:31:54.345 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which might be
the most important aspect.

00:31:54.345 --> 00:31:59.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Yes, because when we
transcend our sense of self,

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:02.560 align:middle line:84%
we can step into
something that is not only

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:05.500 align:middle line:84%
an expansion of ourselves
and stepping into a greater

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.780 align:middle line:84%
potential and our
gifts and our talents,

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:11.350 align:middle line:84%
but we can connect to something
more, something, let's say,

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:14.860 align:middle line:84%
beyond a wider consciousness,
God, the divine the universe,

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:16.190 align:middle line:90%
whatever we call it.

00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:18.670 align:middle line:84%
And when we step
into that, it allows

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:21.370 align:middle line:84%
for a greater opening
for positivity,

00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:22.615 align:middle line:90%
health benefits in our life.

00:32:22.615 --> 00:32:26.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I haven't had an
OBE since I was 11 years old.

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:27.970 align:middle line:90%
I can't reproduce it.

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:29.995 align:middle line:90%
What am I doing wrong?

00:32:29.995 --> 00:32:31.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: So to practice these--

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:33.700 align:middle line:84%
well, the fact that
you had them as a child

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:35.930 align:middle line:84%
is a good sign that
you're probably a natural.

00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:38.142 align:middle line:84%
So if any viewers have
had these as a child,

00:32:38.142 --> 00:32:39.850 align:middle line:84%
they're more likely
of getting that back.

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:40.420 align:middle line:90%
It would be quite--

00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:42.503 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it was
spontaneous as you brought up.

00:32:42.503 --> 00:32:44.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Yeah, and
it was spontaneous.

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:46.150 align:middle line:84%
So if you were to put
a few things in place,

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:48.730 align:middle line:84%
you would definitely be
able to self-initiate some.

00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:51.250 align:middle line:84%
So the hypnagogic
and the hypnopompic

00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:53.020 align:middle line:84%
mindfulness, that
bit where you're

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:55.510 align:middle line:84%
being awake and aware as
you're drifting to sleep.

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:59.368 align:middle line:84%
And then you would want to apply
what we call an exit technique.

00:32:59.368 --> 00:33:00.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't like the
word exit because it

00:33:00.910 --> 00:33:02.170 align:middle line:90%
assumes something is leaving.

00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:03.160 align:middle line:90%
But for lack of a better--

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:04.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And not
coming back, right?

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:05.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Exactly.

00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:08.920 align:middle line:84%
And I want to make sure that
everybody knows we always will

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:11.040 align:middle line:90%
come back to our physical body.

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:15.070 align:middle line:84%
We can't get lost, so to speak,
we'll always be attached.

00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:17.587 align:middle line:84%
So the thing to do
if we want to try,

00:33:17.587 --> 00:33:20.170 align:middle line:84%
we want to hit that sweet spot
where we're in the best altered

00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:23.890 align:middle line:84%
state, very relaxed, the body
is asleep, the mind is aware,

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:27.460 align:middle line:84%
we want to be able to do
the roll-out technique.

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:29.150 align:middle line:90%
So I teach this quite a lot.

00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:30.430 align:middle line:90%
So we imagine.

00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And we tune in as though we're
rolling from side to side.

00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:35.480 align:middle line:90%
And we want to feel into this.

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:38.570 align:middle line:84%
This is called a kinesthetic
exit technique, a felt sense

00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:39.370 align:middle line:90%
one.

00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:41.935 align:middle line:84%
So we imagine that we're
rolling from side to side.

00:33:41.935 --> 00:33:43.060 align:middle line:90%
But we don't just think it.

00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:45.010 align:middle line:84%
We think, OK, this is
actually happening,

00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:46.720 align:middle line:90%
a bit like self-hypnosis.

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And then you go a
little bit further,

00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:51.070 align:middle line:84%
a little bit further
as though we're

00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:52.960 align:middle line:84%
imagining we're rocking
from side to side.

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:55.690 align:middle line:84%
But then when it feels
real, when you go,

00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:58.510 align:middle line:84%
oh my God, actually, I
can feel something moving,

00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:00.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually moving,
that's your astral body.

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:03.610 align:middle line:84%
When you feel that
happening, then you

00:34:03.610 --> 00:34:05.560 align:middle line:84%
take the decision to
roll all the way out.

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:06.360 align:middle line:90%
So full roll.

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:07.610 align:middle line:90%
So you're rolling over in bed.

00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:09.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And stay
conscious when you do it.

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:11.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Yes, staying conscious.

00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:12.250 align:middle line:90%
And that's tricky.

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:14.330 align:middle line:84%
Robert Monroe calls
this clicking out.

00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:15.288 align:middle line:90%
So you might start off.

00:34:15.288 --> 00:34:17.205 align:middle line:84%
And then you might go,
oh, I'm getting sleepy.

00:34:17.205 --> 00:34:18.250 align:middle line:90%
You might click out.

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:19.570 align:middle line:90%
But then you might come back.

00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:21.862 align:middle line:84%
And when you come back, go
straight into that technique

00:34:21.862 --> 00:34:23.560 align:middle line:84%
again because when
you come back,

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.870 align:middle line:84%
usually that's when most
people exit the body.

00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:27.639 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Generally,
the astral body

00:34:27.639 --> 00:34:31.090 align:middle line:84%
hovers over the physical body
in your sleep state, doesn't it?

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:33.159 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Yeah, this
is a strong theory.

00:34:33.159 --> 00:34:36.760 align:middle line:84%
And I must admit, I've
actually come out of my body,

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:40.750 align:middle line:84%
gone to other people's rooms,
and seen that them either

00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:43.967 align:middle line:84%
lying slightly-- it's
almost like overlapping

00:34:43.967 --> 00:34:45.550 align:middle line:84%
with their physical
a little hovering.

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:47.124 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've seen
the astral body?

00:34:47.124 --> 00:34:49.774 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Yes, I've seen others
and my own astral body.

00:34:49.774 --> 00:34:52.149 align:middle line:84%
When you see it for the first
time, George, it's amazing.

00:34:52.149 --> 00:34:53.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's it look like?

00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:55.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Oh my gosh, so
many different ones.

00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:59.200 align:middle line:84%
So there's the ones where
you're kind of transparent,

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:00.550 align:middle line:90%
almost ghost like.

00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
the other ones where

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:04.273 align:middle line:90%
you're almost like a hologram.

00:35:04.273 --> 00:35:06.190 align:middle line:84%
And then another one
where you're more energy.

00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:08.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it ever
look back at you?

00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:11.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Oh, that's a cool one.

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:12.050 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you why.

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:14.650 align:middle line:84%
So some people, yeah,
have had that experience

00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:18.580 align:middle line:84%
where they've had almost
like a double perception.

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:20.050 align:middle line:90%
So there's me here.

00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:21.460 align:middle line:90%
And I've come out of my body.

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:23.380 align:middle line:84%
But then they've had
another astral body

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:25.660 align:middle line:84%
of themselves
looking back at them,

00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:27.370 align:middle line:90%
like there's a duplicate or two.

00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:30.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's not dissimilar
to, let's say, bilocation.

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:33.640 align:middle line:84%
So when we get into this, we
get into the astral realms

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:36.115 align:middle line:84%
where time and space
is somewhat different.

00:35:36.115 --> 00:35:39.550 align:middle line:84%
You can access or
step into past lives.

00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:44.500 align:middle line:84%
But also they can overlap
in a quantum timeline.

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:46.240 align:middle line:90%
I love these experiences.

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:47.680 align:middle line:90%
I find them really adventurous.

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:49.255 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
scare you at all?

00:35:49.255 --> 00:35:51.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Because I've had so
many experiences, George, no.

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:52.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not anymore, I guess.

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:53.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Yeah, not anymore.

00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:54.553 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In the beginning?

00:35:54.553 --> 00:35:56.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: In the
beginning, for sure.

00:35:56.290 --> 00:35:58.897 align:middle line:84%
When I was a little girl and I
would come out of my body a bit

00:35:58.897 --> 00:36:00.480 align:middle line:84%
like you and you'd
float in your room,

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:03.060 align:middle line:84%
you'd be like, oh my
gosh, this is so scary.

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:05.800 align:middle line:84%
And there's something that I
teach to help people with this.

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:08.040 align:middle line:84%
So if there is a
lot of fear, one,

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:10.140 align:middle line:84%
it might slam you
back into your body,

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:12.930 align:middle line:84%
or two, if you can
remain calm, you

00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:15.360 align:middle line:84%
can take what's
called a meta moment.

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:19.110 align:middle line:84%
Meta is a certain type of
loving kindness meditation.

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:23.040 align:middle line:84%
A meta meditation is when
you drop into loving kindness

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:24.040 align:middle line:90%
very quickly.

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:25.410 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have to
do a full meditation.

00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:27.327 align:middle line:84%
Who's got time for that
when you're so scared?

00:36:27.327 --> 00:36:30.810 align:middle line:84%
But what you do is you drop your
awareness into the heart space.

00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And you allow yourself
to feel loving feelings.

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:36.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, that might be super
hard if you're petrified.

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:39.510 align:middle line:84%
So what you can do is bring
people to mind, pets to mind,

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:40.770 align:middle line:90%
anything you love or cherish.

00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:44.190 align:middle line:84%
It could be a place, a person,
a spirit guide, an angel.

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:45.490 align:middle line:90%
Bring them to mind.

00:36:45.490 --> 00:36:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And then allow yourself
to feel the feelings

00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:49.520 align:middle line:90%
that you feel for them.

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And as you allow yourself
to feel those feelings--

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:53.030 align:middle line:90%
I can already feel it already.

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:56.750 align:middle line:84%
My heart is getting a little
bit fuzzy, a little bit warm.

00:36:56.750 --> 00:37:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And you'll notice it shifts
the energy from fear to love.

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:03.180 align:middle line:90%
So you change channels.

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And when you change channels,
you become more calm.

00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:08.210 align:middle line:84%
You start to operate
on a frequency of love

00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:09.800 align:middle line:90%
in these different dimensions.

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:12.830 align:middle line:84%
And then you're able to
have more control and less

00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:14.210 align:middle line:90%
of an emotional reaction.

00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:17.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When people are
having their own OBEs,

00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:19.100 align:middle line:84%
when these things are
happening to them,

00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:21.990 align:middle line:84%
what does it do
for them mentally,

00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:25.066 align:middle line:90%
physically when they have them?

00:37:25.066 --> 00:37:27.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: It slightly
varies for each person.

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:29.520 align:middle line:84%
But what I can say
across the board

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:33.760 align:middle line:84%
is that they come back
feeling or knowing

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:35.990 align:middle line:84%
that they are more than
their physical bodies.

00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the
number one takeaway.

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:40.930 align:middle line:84%
They know with
absolute certainty.

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:43.900 align:middle line:84%
They have an inner gnosis,
a spiritual knowing that I

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:45.440 align:middle line:90%
am more than my physical body.

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And this is why the agnostics
and the atheists that

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:50.530 align:middle line:84%
I've studied, they
come back going,

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:53.560 align:middle line:84%
do you know what, I don't know
if it was my spirit or my soul.

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:57.580 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that somehow
when I die, I will not die,

00:37:57.580 --> 00:37:59.260 align:middle line:84%
something will
continue to go on.

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:01.090 align:middle line:90%
And I think that unhooks.

00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:03.610 align:middle line:84%
It unlocks something
within the person

00:38:03.610 --> 00:38:06.430 align:middle line:84%
and has a domino
effect into their life.

00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:09.790 align:middle line:84%
And it allows them to
step into their purpose

00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:12.040 align:middle line:84%
more because a lot of
the fears dissolve away.

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And they go, OK, I can move
into this new sense of self.

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And that opens a lot
of doorways for them.

00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:20.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jade, what's
the best training

00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:23.440 align:middle line:84%
mechanism to teach
somebody quickly

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:25.630 align:middle line:90%
how to do astral projection?

00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:28.420 align:middle line:10%
>>SHAW: Yeah, training
mechanism quickly

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:32.420 align:middle line:10%
is a method that I teach
called state stacking.

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:33.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: State stacking.

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:34.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: State stacking.

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:36.560 align:middle line:84%
So in order to have
an OBE, you have

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:38.330 align:middle line:84%
to go into an
altered state, right?

00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:40.460 align:middle line:84%
But going into an
altered state, there's

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:42.090 align:middle line:84%
several different
things you can do.

00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:43.560 align:middle line:90%
And I call this state stacking.

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:47.100 align:middle line:84%
So I teach yoga nidra, which
is hacking sleep states.

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:48.020 align:middle line:90%
That's one state.

00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:51.420 align:middle line:84%
Biohacking, so the kind
of things that we eat.

00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:52.790 align:middle line:90%
So we do biohacking.

00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:54.650 align:middle line:90%
Then we have mindfulness.

00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:56.660 align:middle line:84%
So my background's
in mindfulness.

00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:59.180 align:middle line:84%
So I teach them different
ways where they can not

00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:00.350 align:middle line:90%
overreact emotionally.

00:39:00.350 --> 00:39:03.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then I also
heard if you eat too much,

00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:04.520 align:middle line:90%
you can't have an OBE.

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:06.005 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:39:06.005 --> 00:39:07.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: You can still.

00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:08.667 align:middle line:90%
But you're right.

00:39:08.667 --> 00:39:11.000 align:middle line:84%
You're not likely to have one
because all your energy is

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.470 align:middle line:90%
going to digestion.

00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:15.500 align:middle line:84%
So we want that energy to
go towards the astral body.

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And we can send that
into the astral body.

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And that can help lift
the glue a little bit.

00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:22.835 align:middle line:84%
So then we can springboard
into the astral planes.

00:39:22.835 --> 00:39:25.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But once you start
practicing, do you get better?

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:26.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Yes.

00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:27.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Because I've tried.

00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:30.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I got the
book, Monroe's book,

00:39:30.350 --> 00:39:32.150 align:middle line:90%
"Journeys out of the Body."

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:35.060 align:middle line:90%
I've studied Robert Crookall.

00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:36.620 align:middle line:90%
There's a block somewhere.

00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:38.315 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it is.

00:39:38.315 --> 00:39:41.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: That block might be
an unconscious fear that maybe

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.310 align:middle line:90%
you're not aware of right now.

00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:44.270 align:middle line:90%
Many people have these.

00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:46.250 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we all have
them to some degree.

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:48.355 align:middle line:84%
And then limiting
beliefs as well.

00:39:48.355 --> 00:39:50.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Now I can remote view.

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:53.390 align:middle line:90%
I can do that pretty easily.

00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:55.595 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Well, if
you can remote view,

00:39:55.595 --> 00:39:58.370 align:middle line:84%
that tells me that you're
probably transluminal.

00:39:58.370 --> 00:40:01.715 align:middle line:84%
People who are transluminal
are able to shift.

00:40:01.715 --> 00:40:03.590 align:middle line:84%
It's called thin boundaries
of consciousness.

00:40:03.590 --> 00:40:06.000 align:middle line:84%
You can shift from one
state to the other.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.270 align:middle line:84%
So I reckon if you put
a few practices in place

00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:10.415 align:middle line:84%
you'd be able to have
out-of-body experiences quite

00:40:10.415 --> 00:40:11.215 align:middle line:90%
quickly.

00:40:11.215 --> 00:40:13.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if
you can't come back?

00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:16.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Yeah, personally,
I think this is a myth.

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:17.682 align:middle line:90%
You can always come back.

00:40:17.682 --> 00:40:18.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I hope you're right.

00:40:18.890 --> 00:40:19.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Yes.

00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:20.622 align:middle line:90%
Should I'll tell you why?

00:40:20.622 --> 00:40:24.320 align:middle line:90%
Because it's hard to stay out.

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:26.540 align:middle line:84%
I have a whole class for
advanced practitioners

00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:28.070 align:middle line:90%
who are like, I get out.

00:40:28.070 --> 00:40:29.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm there for 10 minutes.

00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:31.200 align:middle line:90%
And I come back very quickly.

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:33.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's hard to
actually stay out.

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:34.410 align:middle line:90%
So a couple of reasons.

00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:35.910 align:middle line:84%
One, you're just
going to need to go

00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:37.070 align:middle line:90%
to the toilet at some time.

00:40:37.070 --> 00:40:38.195 align:middle line:90%
So your physical body is--

00:40:38.195 --> 00:40:39.112 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're humans.

00:40:39.112 --> 00:40:40.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Yes.

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:42.500 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have to come
back to go to the toilet.

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:44.720 align:middle line:84%
So it snaps you
back to your body,

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:47.690 align:middle line:84%
or there might be a sound, or
something will bring you back.

00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:49.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, it might not
feel that way because

00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:52.190 align:middle line:84%
in some out-of-body
experiences, time is not

00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:54.060 align:middle line:90%
experienced in the same way.

00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:56.300 align:middle line:84%
So you might feel like I've
been here for a lifetime.

00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:57.992 align:middle line:84%
I've had these
other experiences.

00:40:57.992 --> 00:40:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And then you come
back to your body

00:40:59.450 --> 00:41:01.570 align:middle line:84%
and you think, wow,
I was out so long.

00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:03.680 align:middle line:84%
Actually it might have
only been 20 minutes.

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:06.660 align:middle line:84%
So we can feel like we might
not be able to come back.

00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:09.110 align:middle line:84%
But something will always
bring us back to the body.

00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And from a Buddhist
perspective, they

00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:14.690 align:middle line:84%
would say, unless it is
your time to go, your karma,

00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:16.130 align:middle line:90%
that will always pull you back.

00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:17.810 align:middle line:84%
What you're here to
do in this lifetime

00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:19.640 align:middle line:84%
will bring you back
to the physical body.

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And I argue that you're having
the experience in the OBE

00:41:23.330 --> 00:41:25.925 align:middle line:84%
because of what you're meant
to do in this lifetime anyway.

00:41:25.925 --> 00:41:28.760 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
come across demonic forces

00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:29.990 align:middle line:10%
on the astral plane?

00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:32.540 align:middle line:90%


00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Because of my
background in psychology,

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:39.710 align:middle line:84%
I tend to think we resonate
on certain frequencies,

00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:42.440 align:middle line:84%
certain dimensions, and let's
just say some of the more

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:45.170 align:middle line:84%
darker and demonic ones
because there is something

00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:49.610 align:middle line:84%
within ourselves we need
to heal that is entangled,

00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:51.210 align:middle line:90%
let's say, with that realm.

00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:54.260 align:middle line:84%
So often maybe our
own unresolved trauma

00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:58.130 align:middle line:84%
is being reflected or calling
on or bringing in something

00:41:58.130 --> 00:41:59.730 align:middle line:90%
related to that dimension.

00:41:59.730 --> 00:42:03.470 align:middle line:84%
So it's a good thing if we enter
into these, let's say, darker,

00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:07.155 align:middle line:84%
less illuminated places
because we can do immense--

00:42:07.155 --> 00:42:08.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they are there.

00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: You can have
experiences with entities

00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:13.220 align:middle line:90%
or what we call thought forms.

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:16.220 align:middle line:84%
So thought forms are something
that is of our own mind

00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:18.590 align:middle line:84%
but is personified
in a very real way.

00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:21.110 align:middle line:84%
Like it is something
that seems separate.

00:42:21.110 --> 00:42:24.230 align:middle line:84%
For example, I've had one
where I've come out of my body.

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:26.660 align:middle line:84%
I actually came out
in sleep paralysis.

00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:30.050 align:middle line:84%
And I said to the
thought form or let's

00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:34.050 align:middle line:84%
say entity or energy, whatever
it is, I said, who are you?

00:42:34.050 --> 00:42:34.983 align:middle line:90%
Why are you here?

00:42:34.983 --> 00:42:35.900 align:middle line:90%
What do you represent?

00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:37.172 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they answer you?

00:42:37.172 --> 00:42:38.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: They do answer.

00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And this is what advanced
astral projectors do.

00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:43.530 align:middle line:84%
They do shadow work in the
out-of-body experience.

00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:45.630 align:middle line:90%
And it answered back to me.

00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:47.400 align:middle line:84%
And it said it in
a very scary voice.

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:50.190 align:middle line:84%
It said, Jade, I am your
relationship with money,

00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:51.360 align:middle line:90%
with abundance.

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And I'm related to
your self-worth.

00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:55.530 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, whoa.

00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:56.910 align:middle line:90%
And I was so overwhelmed.

00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:58.500 align:middle line:90%
Puh, back to my body.

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, wow, that
was some part of myself

00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:06.480 align:middle line:84%
or connected with
that because I needed

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:10.350 align:middle line:84%
to heal my own self-worth that
was related to my relationship

00:43:10.350 --> 00:43:12.570 align:middle line:84%
with abundance, which
was ultimately related

00:43:12.570 --> 00:43:13.958 align:middle line:90%
to my relationship with money.

00:43:13.958 --> 00:43:16.500 align:middle line:84%
I would have never found that
out if I'd have been too scared

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:18.100 align:middle line:90%
and ran away.

00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:20.070 align:middle line:84%
So it was only because
I engaged with it.

00:43:20.070 --> 00:43:23.620 align:middle line:84%
So something that your viewers
can say is who are you?

00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:24.670 align:middle line:10%
Why are you here?

00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:25.890 align:middle line:10%
What do you represent?

00:43:25.890 --> 00:43:28.200 align:middle line:10%
Or what do you need from me?

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:31.095 align:middle line:84%
And then you get an insight into
how you can heal that aspect.

00:43:31.095 --> 00:43:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How can
people get information

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:34.800 align:middle line:90%
on the Astral Academy.

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:38.450 align:middle line:10%
>>SHAW: So you can come to
my website, www.jadeshaw.com.

00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:40.070 align:middle line:10%
You can visit my Instagram.

00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:40.955 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: S-H-A-W?

00:43:40.955 --> 00:43:44.450 align:middle line:10%
>>SHAW: S-H-A-W, yes, Shaw.

00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:45.800 align:middle line:90%
Or go to my Instagram.

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:46.700 align:middle line:90%
It's more updated.

00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:49.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm terrible with technology
I never update my website.

00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:53.930 align:middle line:84%
So usually Instagram is better,
which is Jade Shaw Official.

00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:56.643 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, there's free tips
and tools on there as well.

00:43:56.643 --> 00:43:58.310 align:middle line:84%
I actually have a
free handout with some

00:43:58.310 --> 00:43:59.240 align:middle line:90%
of the stuff I'm talking about.

00:43:59.240 --> 00:43:59.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Super.

00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:01.380 align:middle line:84%
Jade, thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:02.848 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Thank you for having me.

00:44:02.848 --> 00:44:04.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm going to
use these techniques.

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:07.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, like I said, it's
been a long, long time

00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:10.430 align:middle line:84%
since I had my last
astral projection.

00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:12.360 align:middle line:90%
And I kind of miss it.

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:13.350 align:middle line:90%
I'll give it a try.

00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:15.080 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
