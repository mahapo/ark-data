>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:21.450 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.330 align:middle line:10%
On this program,
we seek the truth.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.860 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're looking for.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.770 align:middle line:84%
We want answers to questions
about all kinds of things,

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.640 align:middle line:84%
including UFOs,
unidentified flying objects.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.440 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.760 align:middle line:90%
Where do they come from?

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.850 align:middle line:84%
Our special guest on "Beyond
Belief" is Nick Pope.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.400 align:middle line:84%
Nick used to work for
the Ministry of Defense

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.580 align:middle line:90%
in Great Britain.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.470 align:middle line:84%
He had the ability to
actually look at UFO files.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:47.849 align:middle line:84%
Nick, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:47.849 --> 00:00:49.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NICK POPE: Thank you, George.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.790 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be on the show.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you were
looking at these files

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.610 align:middle line:84%
when you were at the Ministry
of Defense, what did you see?

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my gosh, was
it a huge folder?

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.960 align:middle line:90%
What were they?

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.370 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Oh, lots of folders.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.890 align:middle line:10%
I mean literally
thousands of them.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.230 align:middle line:10%
The British government
is in the process

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.680 align:middle line:10%
of declassifying and releasing
some of this material.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.810 align:middle line:10%
And it's quite funny,
because for years, they

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.360 align:middle line:10%
said, oh, this subject is
of very little interest.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.850 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that
so far, over 60,000

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.782 align:middle line:90%
documents have been released.

00:01:22.782 --> 00:01:24.990 align:middle line:84%
So I think that gives you
a sense of the scale of it.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.649 align:middle line:90%
And this goes back decades.

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:28.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now when you
were looking at them,

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.180 align:middle line:84%
you weren't like
Edward Snowden, right?

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.210 align:middle line:84%
You had the capability
of peeking at them,

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.160 align:middle line:84%
doing whatever
you did with them?

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.800 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, I was,
of course, an employee

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.410 align:middle line:84%
of the British government,
the Ministry of Defense.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.970 align:middle line:84%
So I was working on
this quite legitimately.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.910 align:middle line:84%
This was my job, my
day-to-day business.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.170 align:middle line:84%
I investigated the newly
reported cases as they came in.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.060 align:middle line:84%
But I was able to access
the entire back archive

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.120 align:middle line:90%
of these files.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.050 align:middle line:84%
So as long as I
didn't inadvertently

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.760 align:middle line:84%
make anything public,
that was fine.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.920 align:middle line:84%
I had access all area
pass, so to speak.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or make copies
for yourself, maybe?

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:08.610 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: No.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Sadly not, though
it was very tempting

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.510 align:middle line:90%
given some of the material.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.110 align:middle line:84%
But, of course, now with the
British government themselves

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.650 align:middle line:84%
declassifying and releasing some
of this material, most of it

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.110 align:middle line:84%
maybe, it's like a blast from
the past for me seeing some

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.710 align:middle line:84%
of the case files that I
worked on, seeing documents

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.750 align:middle line:84%
that I wrote, which
I thought would never

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.250 align:middle line:90%
see the light of day.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Give me your
overview on just what

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.990 align:middle line:90%
you think this entire field is.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.560 align:middle line:84%
Based on the files, based
on where you are today.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.960 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Big question.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:51.350 align:middle line:84%
I think that it is 99%
noise, but 1% signal.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.420 align:middle line:90%
I think as to what that 1% is.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm not one of these people
who sits here and says,

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.220 align:middle line:84%
I've got an ultimate answer
to the entire mystery.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.149 align:middle line:90%
The odd thing perhaps--

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:05.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But this is a mystery.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.773 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: It is a genuine mystery.

00:03:06.773 --> 00:03:12.210 align:middle line:84%
It's not all aircraft lights,
weather balloons, hoaxes.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.430 align:middle line:90%
There is something going on.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.600 align:middle line:90%
There is a phenomenon.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.010 align:middle line:90%
Could it be extraterrestrial?

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.880 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.230 align:middle line:90%
Could it be something else?

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.340 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm one of these people who I'm
not afraid to say I don't know.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.310 align:middle line:90%
And that's the irony.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.860 align:middle line:84%
People say, but you're in
government, you should know.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.170 align:middle line:90%
Well, actually, government is--

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.730 align:middle line:84%
certainly the
British government,

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.430 align:middle line:84%
sure which is really of course
the only one I can talk about

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.490 align:middle line:84%
with any inside authority--
the British government

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:43.980 align:middle line:84%
is actually as mystified about
some of this as anyone else.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.680 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, we're getting
these declassified files now,

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.050 align:middle line:10%
as you said, and
Paul Hellyer, who

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.690 align:middle line:10%
was the former Canadian
Defense Minister,

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.390 align:middle line:10%
talks about unidentified
flying objects.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.940 align:middle line:84%
You, talking about
the British files,

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.490 align:middle line:84%
talk about unidentified
flying objects.

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.860 align:middle line:84%
Here at home, in
the United States,

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.650 align:middle line:84%
we're trying to get
disclosure as well.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And people are frustrated,
Nick, because we haven't been

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.930 align:middle line:90%
able to pierce that shell yet.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.990 align:middle line:84%
We haven't been able to get
government to come out freely

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.880 align:middle line:84%
and say this is
what is going on.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.250 align:middle line:90%
We know about this.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.630 align:middle line:90%
Here are the files.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.040 align:middle line:90%
They're not doing that.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.490 align:middle line:84%
Be that as it may, Hillary
Clinton, of course,

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.040 align:middle line:84%
during the presidential
campaign people

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.740 align:middle line:84%
thought that if she
had gotten elected,

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.780 align:middle line:90%
we would have had disclosure.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.340 align:middle line:84%
There was an initiative called
the Clinton-Podesta Disclosure

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.150 align:middle line:90%
Initiative.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.080 align:middle line:90%
You were part of that.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.070 align:middle line:90%
You looked into that.

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.700 align:middle line:90%
What did you find?

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.280 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well I met John
Podesta in June of 2011.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.610 align:middle line:10%
Podesta, of course, had
been President Obama's Chief

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:48.690 align:middle line:10%
of Staff.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.880 align:middle line:10%
He chaired the transition team.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.430 align:middle line:84%
And he was running
Hillary Clinton's

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.350 align:middle line:90%
presidential campaign.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, I met him at a private
briefing in Washington DC.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And I gave him an overview of
the British government's UFO

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.200 align:middle line:90%
project.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.080 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that he was
particularly interested in

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.930 align:middle line:84%
was the way in which we,
in the Ministry of Defense,

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.780 align:middle line:90%
had rebranded the phenomenon.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.660 align:middle line:90%
We had dropped the phrase UFO.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And we had replaced it with UAP,
unidentified aerial phenomena.

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.430 align:middle line:84%
Now the reason we
did that was that we

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.170 align:middle line:90%
felt there was too much--

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.720 align:middle line:90%
I call it pop culture baggage--

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.230 align:middle line:90%
associated with the term.

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah, from UFOs.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.510 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Absolutely.

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:35.130 align:middle line:84%
So now, Podesta was
extremely interested in this.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:40.440 align:middle line:10%
And clearly, though I lost sight
of you know exactly how this

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.610 align:middle line:10%
played out, I didn't take
part in subsequent meetings,

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.550 align:middle line:10%
but I was very interested to
see that when Hillary Clinton

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.090 align:middle line:10%
started talking about this--
which was quite extraordinary

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.470 align:middle line:10%
in and of itself, of course--

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.370 align:middle line:10%
in the presidential campaign,
she used the same phrase.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:57.980 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, hey, I did that.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You got
that in to it now.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.300 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: And she--

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:06.210 align:middle line:84%
I think it was the "Jimmy Kimmel
Show," a couple of others,

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.780 align:middle line:84%
but she actually stopped the
interviewer and said, you know,

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.260 align:middle line:90%
there's a new term for this.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.060 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.090 align:middle line:90%
- There's a new name.

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:17.550 align:middle line:84%
It's unexplained
aerial phenomenon.

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.330 align:middle line:84%
- Unexplained aerial
phenomenon, really?

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:20.130 align:middle line:90%
- Yep, UAP.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:21.700 align:middle line:90%
That's the latest nomenclature.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:22.590 align:middle line:90%
- I like the old one.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.320 align:middle line:90%
I like UFO, I don't know why.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.150 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: And as I
say, that's what

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.840 align:middle line:84%
I had briefed to
Podesta as being the way

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:38.610 align:middle line:84%
to get this subject viewed in a
more serious, less nuanced way.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:40.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People
were disappointed

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.140 align:middle line:84%
that in the debates between
Hillary Clinton and Donald

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:48.810 align:middle line:84%
Trump the issue of these
UFOs or UAPs did not come up.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.880 align:middle line:84%
And they really
wanted the candidates

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.500 align:middle line:90%
to be asked those questions.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.250 align:middle line:90%
That was disappointing.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:55.050 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: It was.

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And it was also
quite surprising.

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.720 align:middle line:84%
Hillary Clinton had
talked about this a lot.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.160 align:middle line:90%
And I was surprised.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.370 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was not a
particularly smart move,

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:09.630 align:middle line:84%
because I thought to a whole
bunch of people out there

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:11.520 align:middle line:90%
this might be quite attractive.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yes, I'm going to
open the UFO files.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to look into Area 51.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.300 align:middle line:84%
If there's something out there,
I'm going to disclose it.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.480 align:middle line:84%
But to a whole other
group of the population,

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:27.510 align:middle line:84%
I felt this ran the risk of
portraying her as a crazy.

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And people would
say, hey, look I'm

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.930 align:middle line:84%
interested in the jobs
situation, the economy,

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:33.730 align:middle line:90%
attacks.

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:35.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --the economy,
and wars, all this stuff.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.360 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: All that.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm not interested
in little green men.

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And I actually thought that
Donald Trump might raise it

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:46.230 align:middle line:84%
unilaterally even if a question
didn't come from the moderator,

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:48.870 align:middle line:84%
he might try and
portray Hillary Clinton

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:51.740 align:middle line:84%
as some kind of nut job
for talking about this.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.920 align:middle line:84%
Now in the end, yes, it was
surprising and disappointing

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.670 align:middle line:90%
that it didn't come up.

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:58.200 align:middle line:90%
There was a lot of lobbying.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And people said lobby
all the moderators.

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:04.860 align:middle line:84%
Tell them what
questions you want.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:08.155 align:middle line:84%
And it was a huge viral campaign
to get this question asked,

00:08:08.155 --> 00:08:09.030 align:middle line:90%
but it never came up.

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:10.155 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It never happened.

00:08:10.155 --> 00:08:12.030 align:middle line:84%
Now that Donald Trump
is the President,

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:15.460 align:middle line:84%
will we get disclosure
in your opinion?

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.090 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Well, I think--

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:21.600 align:middle line:84%
I hear people say all the
time, oh, this president

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.290 align:middle line:84%
is going to be the
disclosure president,

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:25.010 align:middle line:84%
that president's going to
be the disclosure president.

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:27.032 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we haven't
had that happen.

00:08:27.032 --> 00:08:27.990 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Absolutely not.

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:28.790 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:33.150 align:middle line:84%
Since the disclosure movement
really first started--

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:37.080 align:middle line:84%
and I guess you could debate
about how far that goes back--

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.870 align:middle line:84%
but we've cycled through
a number of presidents,

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:43.080 align:middle line:84%
and each time certain
people associated with this

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.390 align:middle line:84%
say this is the one
and it never happens.

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:48.480 align:middle line:90%


00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.320 align:middle line:84%
I think hopefully as an
impartial observer on this,

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.210 align:middle line:84%
that if ever that
was a president

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:59.160 align:middle line:84%
likely to let the cat out of the
bag, Donald Trump is the one.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:04.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean he has the advantage of
not being a career politician,

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.080 align:middle line:84%
not being hooked
into the system.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.580 align:middle line:84%
And I could just imagine that
if somebody briefs him and says,

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:15.030 align:middle line:84%
Mr. President, here's
the file on the aliens.

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:16.080 align:middle line:90%
He would just come out--

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:16.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He'll go public.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.170 align:middle line:90%
He'll tweet it.

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:18.170 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: He'll tweet it.

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:19.170 align:middle line:90%
He'll tweet it.

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:20.770 align:middle line:84%
Or he'll be at one
of his rallies.

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:21.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aliens exist.

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:22.010 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yeah.

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:23.430 align:middle line:90%
He'll be at one of his rallies.

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And when he needs to pull
out some big point to maybe--

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:31.770 align:middle line:84%
if he's dealing
with some scandal,

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:33.840 align:middle line:90%
as inevitably presidents do--

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.580 align:middle line:84%
to be able to pull
this out of the bag

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.280 align:middle line:90%
and say, by the way, aliens.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.780 align:middle line:90%
I mean that's just massive.

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:43.620 align:middle line:84%
So if ever there was a
president that might do it,

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:44.910 align:middle line:90%
this is the one.

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:46.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But will they know?

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.610 align:middle line:90%
Will these presidents know?

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:52.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean we assume John F. Kennedy
knew about extraterrestrials.

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:55.920 align:middle line:84%
We think Lyndon Johnson
might have been told.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.660 align:middle line:90%
What about Richard Nixon?

00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:00.000 align:middle line:84%
We think he might
have been told.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.680 align:middle line:90%
Reagan, I'm not sure.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:02.970 align:middle line:90%
Carter wanted answers.

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:04.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure they told him.

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:06.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure they
told Bill Clinton.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure they
told the two Bushes.

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:11.760 align:middle line:84%
So what about the
possibilities that they just

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:15.015 align:middle line:84%
won't tell Donald
Trump what's going on?

00:10:15.015 --> 00:10:16.890 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, there are
certainly, of course,

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:21.380 align:middle line:84%
tensions ready between the
intelligence community and--

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:22.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This President.

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:22.800 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: President Trump.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:23.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.170 align:middle line:84%
So, it is quite
possible that they

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:30.390 align:middle line:84%
would take a unilateral
decision not to brief him.

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:34.780 align:middle line:84%
However, I have to say that
in one sense I disagree.

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And I know you can
list presidents

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:42.040 align:middle line:84%
that you think new and
then some that didn't know.

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:47.800 align:middle line:84%
My own take is that if the US
government at official level

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.420 align:middle line:90%
is privy to this--

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:52.450 align:middle line:84%
and let's not forget the
possibility that this has all

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:56.300 align:middle line:84%
been taken outside of government
and put in the private sector

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:57.100 align:middle line:90%
to make--

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:57.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Possible.

00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:59.980 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, makes
congressional oversight

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:04.200 align:middle line:84%
more difficult. Takes it
outside the scope of FOI

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.440 align:middle line:90%
which is a big thing.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.900 align:middle line:84%
But let's assume it
is in government.

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean I think in
that circumstance,

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.600 align:middle line:84%
I believe every president
would have to be told.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.890 align:middle line:90%
And here's why.

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:16.930 align:middle line:84%
The president is the
Commander in Chief.

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And what if the whole
situation suddenly

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:26.620 align:middle line:84%
moves from being mysterious or
benign or neutral to serious.

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:28.480 align:middle line:84%
The president, as
Commander in Chief

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:32.500 align:middle line:84%
would have to take
instant command decisions

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.630 align:middle line:90%
on what the response could be.

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:37.396 align:middle line:84%
And no president could
make those decisions

00:11:37.396 --> 00:11:38.770 align:middle line:84%
if they were having
to be briefed

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:41.260 align:middle line:90%
from the very bottom upwards.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:47.020 align:middle line:84%
So I think it would be incumbent
on the whole apparatus of state

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:49.720 align:middle line:84%
to make sure the president
was prebriefed on this

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:52.810 align:middle line:84%
so that he could make
those decisions instantly

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:54.760 align:middle line:90%
and from an informed position.

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sounds like the movie
"Independence Day," doesn't it?

00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:58.380 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Well, yes.

00:11:58.380 --> 00:11:59.740 align:middle line:90%
I loved that movie.

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And I loved the bit, the
surprise on the president's

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:07.210 align:middle line:90%
face was he finds that out.

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:09.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But could we
really defend ourselves

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:13.840 align:middle line:84%
against a hostile
extraterrestrial presence?

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:14.850 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: I suspect not.

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:15.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I agree.

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:18.130 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: I think
it's one of these--

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:21.040 align:middle line:84%
we can only take an
anthropocentric view

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.110 align:middle line:90%
of this phenomenon.

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:24.190 align:middle line:84%
But there are one
or two assumptions

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:28.300 align:middle line:84%
which I think are so fundamental
that they are legitimate.

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And one of those assumptions
is that if they come down here,

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:37.150 align:middle line:84%
their technology,
self-evidently is

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:42.520 align:middle line:84%
going to be orders of magnitude
above and beyond anything

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:43.880 align:middle line:90%
we've got.

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:48.490 align:middle line:84%
You could say in human
history, what if--

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:51.160 align:middle line:84%
well, we see the examples of the
time, of course, looking back

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.860 align:middle line:84%
through history when
a less technologically

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:57.670 align:middle line:84%
advanced culture meets
a more technologically

00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:58.990 align:middle line:90%
advanced culture.

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:01.480 align:middle line:84%
Almost inevitably,
it ends badly.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And certainly there
would be no possibility

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.740 align:middle line:90%
in any kind of shooting war.

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:09.610 align:middle line:84%
Now you can get into a debate
about asymmetrical warfare.

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:11.620 align:middle line:84%
But I mean we
wouldn't be dealing--

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:16.240 align:middle line:84%
in any universe 14
billion years old,

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.780 align:middle line:84%
the statistical chances of our
coming across a civilization

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:24.220 align:middle line:84%
say 100 years ahead of
us are vanishingly small.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:28.960 align:middle line:84%
Far more likely we'll be
dealing with civilizations tens,

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.560 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of thousands,
millions of years ahead.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And what will their
technology look like?

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, as Arthur
C. Clarke said, it

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.420 align:middle line:84%
will be indistinguishable
from magic.

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:45.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Our CIA, Nick, has
released some UFO files,

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.460 align:middle line:84%
albeit some of them
are blacked out.

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:49.910 align:middle line:84%
But that's pretty
dramatic isn't it?

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:50.710 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Absolutely.

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:54.790 align:middle line:90%
13 million documents, I believe.

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And a classic
example, I suspect.

00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, I haven't had
a chance to read them all yet.

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:01.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, not all of them.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.100 align:middle line:90%
Knowing you, half of them.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.450 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Well, I've skimmed them.

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:06.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
are fascinating?

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:07.390 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: They are.

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:08.380 align:middle line:90%
It's a mixed bag.

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.410 align:middle line:84%
As with all government
files, there

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:14.260 align:middle line:84%
are a lot of little
more than letters

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.770 align:middle line:84%
from members of the public
and polite kind of three line

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:18.700 align:middle line:90%
responses.

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:21.400 align:middle line:84%
The really interesting
stuff is more the policy

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.850 align:middle line:84%
discussions about what
the phenomenon is,

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:28.990 align:middle line:84%
what the implications are from
an intelligence point of view.

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:31.630 align:middle line:84%
But you know, 13
million documents,

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:34.270 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a classic
example of the way

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:35.840 align:middle line:90%
that governments handle this.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:40.180 align:middle line:84%
They just dump industrial
quantities of this information

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:41.160 align:middle line:90%
in the public domain.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.816 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Good or
bad reports, right?

00:14:42.816 --> 00:14:43.690 align:middle line:90%
They're all in there?

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:44.898 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: They're all in there.

00:14:44.898 --> 00:14:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's a classic
case of the best place

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.690 align:middle line:84%
to hide a book is
in the library.

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:52.885 align:middle line:84%
No one can possibly
go through all that.

00:14:52.885 --> 00:14:54.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So, you just
put it right out there.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:58.070 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: They put it out there
so it's hidden in plain sight.

00:14:58.070 --> 00:14:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And what they do-- and
I've done this myself

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:02.710 align:middle line:84%
with the British
government's program.

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And even though I'm retired
from the Ministry of Defense,

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:09.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm still involved in
acting as a spokesperson

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:13.480 align:middle line:84%
for this campaign-- very often
I get to pick the cases that I

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:14.890 align:middle line:90%
talk about to the media.

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:19.260 align:middle line:84%
And the government, of course,
wants things highlighted.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And they want certain
things deemphasized.

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:25.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nick, we are in
an amazing time right now.

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And we are in the
70th anniversary

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:32.670 align:middle line:84%
of one of the greatest UFO
cases in the United States.

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And that was, of
course, Roswell.

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:38.220 align:middle line:90%
With the 70th anniversary.

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:40.195 align:middle line:84%
People are still
talking about this case.

00:15:40.195 --> 00:15:40.995 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:15:40.995 --> 00:15:44.640 align:middle line:84%
- Something happened near the
town of Roswell, New Mexico.

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:47.430 align:middle line:84%
That event, known as
the Roswell Incident,

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:50.940 align:middle line:84%
has become synonymous
with flying saucer crash,

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:53.865 align:middle line:84%
alien visitation,
government cover up,

00:15:53.865 --> 00:15:58.015 align:middle line:84%
or many say a jump to
conclusion and gross distortion

00:15:58.015 --> 00:15:58.815 align:middle line:90%
of the fact.

00:15:58.815 --> 00:15:59.615 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:15:59.615 --> 00:16:02.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What an amazing case,
Nick, absolutely amazing.

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:04.680 align:middle line:90%
So many witnesses.

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:07.330 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, a lot of
them have died by now.

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:09.510 align:middle line:84%
But what do you
think of that case?

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:12.180 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, there's no
dispute that something crashed.

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:15.330 align:middle line:84%
That's the incredible
thing about this.

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:19.170 align:middle line:84%
People that are not familiar
say, oh, well the military

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:20.575 align:middle line:90%
would deny that, wouldn't they?

00:16:20.575 --> 00:16:21.450 align:middle line:90%
But that's the point.

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:22.290 align:middle line:90%
They didn't.

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:24.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In the beginning, they
said it was a downed flying

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:25.810 align:middle line:90%
saucer, right?

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:26.670 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Absolutely.

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:31.530 align:middle line:84%
It was the military themselves
that put out, or caused

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:33.930 align:middle line:90%
to be put out, a press release.

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And they used the
phrase flying disk.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.920 align:middle line:90%
They said we have recovered--

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:44.040 align:middle line:84%
there had been these
so-called flying disk

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:47.840 align:middle line:84%
sightings in the US,
and indeed, worldwide.

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:48.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Foo Fighters.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:49.981 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: The Foo Fighters.

00:16:49.981 --> 00:16:55.620 align:middle line:10%
But particularly, then,
Kenneth Arnold's sighting of 9,

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:57.927 align:middle line:10%
I think, disk-shaped craft.

00:16:57.927 --> 00:16:59.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Prior to Roswell.

00:16:59.010 --> 00:16:59.940 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Absolutely.

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And so the military
said, well, you

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:06.420 align:middle line:84%
know this mystery, all
these flying disks,

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:08.430 align:middle line:90%
we have got one of them.

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:12.270 align:middle line:84%
So we, the US army,
as it was time

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:15.329 align:middle line:84%
had recovered one
of these craft.

00:17:15.329 --> 00:17:18.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was even on the
radio, local Roswell radio,

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:19.800 align:middle line:90%
from that press release.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.829 align:middle line:90%
But then the military recanted.

00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:24.060 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:26.970 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, within 24
hours, yes, absolutely.

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:30.420 align:middle line:90%
There was a 180 degree turn.

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And the military said we've
made a terrible mistake,

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:34.740 align:middle line:90%
it was just a weather balloon.

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:37.020 align:middle line:90%
Well, wait a minute.

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:41.220 align:middle line:10%
The 509th Bomb Group which
was based at Roswell,

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:44.460 align:middle line:10%
and it was the
intelligence officer there,

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:47.220 align:middle line:10%
Jesse Marcel, who was
involved in the recovery.

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:51.150 align:middle line:84%
The 509th bomb group was
the only atomic bomb capable

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:54.100 align:middle line:84%
squadron anywhere in
the world at the time.

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:57.660 align:middle line:84%
So it was the elite
military unit.

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.910 align:middle line:84%
These people were
the best of the best.

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And if ever there were a
bunch of people less likely

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:05.292 align:middle line:84%
to misidentify a
weather balloon--

00:18:05.292 --> 00:18:07.500 align:middle line:84%
which is something they were
perfectly familiar with,

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.290 align:middle line:84%
they were launched all
the time in the area--

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:11.580 align:middle line:90%
it was these people.

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:13.860 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: We both knew
the late Jesse Marcel,

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:18.360 align:middle line:10%
Jr, the son of Jesse Marcel
who carted this and flew

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:22.770 align:middle line:10%
this material, these
craft, to Wright-Patterson.

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And he would always tell us that
his father told him there was

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.010 align:middle line:90%
something very unusual here.

00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:30.810 align:middle line:90%
It was an amazing story.

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:34.710 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, I remember
him saying that--

00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:36.990 align:middle line:84%
I think he was nine years
old at the time, something

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:39.270 align:middle line:84%
like that-- and with
tears in his eyes

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:43.350 align:middle line:84%
as he retold the story, he
said that his father came back,

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:45.390 align:middle line:90%
woke the family up.

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And said I won't be
able to keep this,

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:52.770 align:middle line:84%
but I want you to see this,
because everything that I knew,

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:55.320 align:middle line:84%
everything that I
believed, has changed.

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And he pulls out this piece of--
it's now kind of cold memory

00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:00.630 align:middle line:90%
metal.

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:03.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You crunch it and it
goes right back to its form,

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.200 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.070 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And the family watched
with amazement.

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And the following day, of
course, Jesse Marcel Sr.

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:15.540 align:middle line:84%
had to take that
back to the military.

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:19.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think that particularly
if there was a crash

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:24.240 align:middle line:84%
and there's debris, which
people of course talk about,

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:29.100 align:middle line:84%
I think that someone somewhere
still has a piece of this.

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:30.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean I think
it's human nature.

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:32.340 align:middle line:90%
People like souvenirs.

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:33.900 align:middle line:84%
People want to hold
on to something,

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:36.780 align:middle line:84%
particularly if it it's
a paradigm shifting,

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:39.690 align:middle line:90%
world view changing thing.

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And I've teamed up with the
local newspaper, "The Roswell

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:47.310 align:middle line:84%
Daily Record," and
we have a campaign--

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:50.040 align:middle line:84%
not aimed at the UFO
community, but aimed

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:52.380 align:middle line:90%
at the citizens of Roswell.

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:54.274 align:middle line:90%
And my idea is this--

00:19:54.274 --> 00:19:56.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To get somebody to
come forward who may be alive?

00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:58.450 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: To get someone
to come forward.

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:01.500 align:middle line:84%
But even more than
that, going back

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:05.040 align:middle line:84%
to the idea that people
like souvenirs and mementos,

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:09.870 align:middle line:84%
I've said to people and I've
written an editorial which

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:12.990 align:middle line:84%
I was told was the most viewed
editorial in the history

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:14.410 align:middle line:90%
of the "Roswell Daily Record--"

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:15.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was.

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:19.650 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, and I
said search your houses.

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:22.097 align:middle line:84%
Local people, go
into your attics--

00:20:22.097 --> 00:20:23.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Somebody has something.

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:24.230 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yeah.

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:27.090 align:middle line:84%
Look at the little box of
trinkets on the mantel piece.

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:32.190 align:middle line:84%
Go up and open the chest of your
father's or your grandfather's

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:35.400 align:middle line:90%
military service records.

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.270 align:middle line:90%
Go through it.

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And if you find in there
a strange piece of metal,

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.050 align:middle line:90%
give us a call.

00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:43.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you changed
your views on Roswell

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:44.380 align:middle line:90%
over the years?

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, I think at first
I was quite skeptical of this.

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.010 align:middle line:84%
But I come back to
the point that there's

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:52.350 align:middle line:90%
no smoke without fire.

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:57.100 align:middle line:84%
And an awful lot of these
witnesses had nothing to gain,

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.084 align:middle line:84%
and arguably a heck
of a lot to lose.

00:20:59.084 --> 00:21:00.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They made no money.

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:01.051 align:middle line:90%
It was nothing.

00:21:01.051 --> 00:21:01.850 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: No.

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:04.030 align:middle line:84%
These people weren't
speaking out for money.

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:06.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't think any
of them ever got

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:09.640 align:middle line:84%
that paid more than a
taxi fare to a TV studio

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.180 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:15.610 align:middle line:84%
But, of course, the reputational
damage that sometimes people

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:19.420 align:middle line:84%
get from speaking out about
this subject where still there's

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:22.390 align:middle line:84%
this unfair perception
with large parts

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:26.290 align:middle line:84%
of the media and the public
that these are crazy people.

00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:28.750 align:middle line:84%
So these witnesses
put a lot on the line

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:30.130 align:middle line:90%
by telling their stories.

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:32.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
about the mortician

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:36.250 align:middle line:84%
who talked about they asked
him for small little caskets?

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:40.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my god, how do you
make something like that up?

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:40.960 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: It's bizarre.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.950 align:middle line:90%
I never met him.

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:43.360 align:middle line:10%
I think Glenn Dennis, wasn't it?

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:43.840 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Glenn Dennis.

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:45.190 align:middle line:10%
>>POPE: Yeah I never met him.

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:47.320 align:middle line:10%
But I heard that story.

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:51.220 align:middle line:10%
I mean again, why would you
want child-sized coffins?

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:54.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, again, if
there's the slightest

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:58.850 align:middle line:84%
chance that any of this is
true, it's no good saying,

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:00.550 align:middle line:90%
oh, but this is 70 years old.

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:02.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean I've changed
my mind on this, yes.

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:05.740 align:middle line:84%
I was criticized a few
years ago because I

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:11.620 align:middle line:84%
said Roswell's / I said 70
years on, time to move on.

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:12.670 align:middle line:90%
I was wrong.

00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:14.080 align:middle line:90%
Of course I was wrong.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:18.130 align:middle line:84%
Thinking about it now, the
point is that length of time

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:19.220 align:middle line:90%
doesn't matter.

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:22.435 align:middle line:84%
If there is some smoking gun
piece of evidence out there,

00:22:22.435 --> 00:22:26.920 align:middle line:84%
it that doesn't matter whether
it comes out 70 years or 69.

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:31.930 align:middle line:84%
So I freely admit that I was
wrong to say Roswell was dead.

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:38.950 align:middle line:84%
I think it is in many senses
almost ground zero for ufology.

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:43.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we realistically
go back and investigate

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:46.120 align:middle line:90%
a 70-year-old case?

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:48.610 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: There are some
things we can't do.

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:52.480 align:middle line:84%
I accept the point that--
like any cop will tell you.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:56.770 align:middle line:84%
If you don't crack a case maybe
within the first 48 hours,

00:22:56.770 --> 00:23:01.060 align:middle line:84%
your chances of doing
so decline rapidly.

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:02.920 align:middle line:84%
In the medical
community, you'll hear

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:07.060 align:middle line:84%
this phrase about the golden
hour, I think they use.

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And generally speaking
with the passage of time,

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:16.060 align:middle line:84%
memories fail, things,
recollections are lost.

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:18.970 align:middle line:90%
Evidence, it can't be secured.

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:21.580 align:middle line:84%
But I come back to the
point that if there

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:27.160 align:middle line:84%
is a piece of this memory
metal or some other smoking gun

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:31.720 align:middle line:84%
piece of evidence, a document,
a film, a photograph, whatever

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:32.900 align:middle line:90%
it may be.

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:37.150 align:middle line:84%
Then even though it's difficult
to investigate something 70

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:39.110 align:middle line:90%
years on, it's not impossible.

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:41.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean look,
historians all the time

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:44.170 align:middle line:84%
are uncovering new
records for example

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:46.540 align:middle line:84%
about the First and
the Second World War.

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:49.120 align:middle line:84%
We don't say to
those historians,

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:52.520 align:middle line:84%
oh the passage of time makes
this a pointless pursuit.

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:53.320 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.347 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely not.

00:23:54.347 --> 00:23:55.930 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: When I was
a young boy, Nick,

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:59.770 align:middle line:10%
my mother brought home a
magazine from "Look" magazine

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:03.730 align:middle line:10%
that had the story of the
Barney and Betty Hill case.

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:06.730 align:middle line:10%
John Fuller wrote the book
"The Interrupted Journey."

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:08.740 align:middle line:10%
But it had to do with
this New Hampshire

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:11.140 align:middle line:10%
couple that claimed
that they were

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:14.350 align:middle line:10%
abducted by extraterrestrials.

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:17.060 align:middle line:90%
It was an amazing story.

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:19.150 align:middle line:84%
I could not put
the magazine down.

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:21.010 align:middle line:90%
I was just a little kid.

00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:24.130 align:middle line:84%
I vowed at that
moment I wanted to go

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:28.570 align:middle line:84%
into broadcasting to investigate
these kinds of stories.

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:30.640 align:middle line:90%
I was just fascinated by it.

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.970 align:middle line:10%
Later on in life as a
21-year-old radio reporter

00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:36.580 align:middle line:10%
in Detroit, Michigan,
I had the opportunity

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:41.180 align:middle line:10%
to interview their psychologist
and psychiatrist Dr. Benjamin

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:41.980 align:middle line:10%
Simon.

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:43.030 align:middle line:90%
Called him up.

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:46.540 align:middle line:84%
And I said this is George
Noory, I work at WCAR radio

00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:47.800 align:middle line:90%
here in Detroit.

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:48.970 align:middle line:90%
Can we do this interview?

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:50.470 align:middle line:90%
And he said, absolutely.

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:51.370 align:middle line:90%
And I recorded it.

00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:54.160 align:middle line:84%
I can't find the tape,
Nick, it's too old.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:57.640 align:middle line:84%
It was 1971 when I did
the interview with him.

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:01.040 align:middle line:84%
But I asked him
specifically, I said,

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:05.860 align:middle line:84%
were they telling you the truth
about their abduction case?

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:08.540 align:middle line:84%
And we can get into that
case in a second with you.

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:11.570 align:middle line:90%
And he said I don't know.

00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:14.870 align:middle line:84%
But I'll tell you this,
they weren't lying.

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:17.320 align:middle line:90%
Whatever happened to them--

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:19.720 align:middle line:84%
and he hypnotized them
both separately and they

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:23.090 align:middle line:84%
both had the same story,
which was unusual--

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:25.480 align:middle line:84%
he said whatever
happened to them,

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:28.060 align:middle line:90%
they believe it to be true.

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:29.710 align:middle line:90%
And that was the major story.

00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:31.670 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing case.

00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:32.470 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yeah.

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:33.310 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:34.110 align:middle line:90%
Incredible.

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:39.360 align:middle line:84%
I never met Barney who died,
I think, many, many years ago.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:42.890 align:middle line:84%
But I did have the
opportunity in the '90s--

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:45.185 align:middle line:90%
and I think she's now past, too.

00:25:45.185 --> 00:25:46.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're both dead.

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:47.110 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:49.940 align:middle line:84%
But I had the opportunity
to meet Betty Hill.

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And my goodness, what a
down to earth, but still

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:56.810 align:middle line:90%
sort of a feisty character.

00:25:56.810 --> 00:26:00.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you met Betty,
we've got a clip of her

00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:02.030 align:middle line:90%
that you've got to see.

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:03.560 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll talk
more about her.

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.760 align:middle line:84%
Betty Hill was an
amazing person.

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:06.560 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Absolutely.

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:07.360 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:09.730 align:middle line:84%
- And at that point, it left
the top of the mountain,

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:14.120 align:middle line:84%
came up over the highway and
stopped in mid-air directly

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:18.230 align:middle line:84%
in front of us, maybe
about 50 feet in the sky.

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:22.310 align:middle line:84%
So, Barney got out with the
binoculars in an attempt

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:24.440 align:middle line:90%
to identify the craft.

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And when he looked up,
he saw a circular window

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:31.400 align:middle line:90%
with the white light behind it.

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And he saw these men standing
behind the window looking down

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:36.126 align:middle line:90%
at him.

00:26:36.126 --> 00:26:40.310 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, the
craft began to descend.

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:42.260 align:middle line:90%
And he became frightened.

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:44.390 align:middle line:84%
Ran back to the car,
saying he thought they

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:46.378 align:middle line:90%
were trying to capture him.

00:26:46.378 --> 00:26:48.690 align:middle line:84%
So we got in the car and
we went speeding down

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:51.410 align:middle line:90%
the highway to avoid capture.

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:54.530 align:middle line:84%
And as we're driving
along, there's

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:58.212 align:middle line:84%
beeping sounds that
sounds like something was

00:26:58.212 --> 00:26:59.420 align:middle line:90%
hitting the trunk of the car.

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:01.550 align:middle line:90%
And the car vibrated.

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:04.990 align:middle line:84%
And then we drove along
for about another 30 miles.

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And Barney turned
off onto a side road.

00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And here were there group of men
he'd seen on the craft standing

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:16.410 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of this
road blocking our way.

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:17.210 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:19.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Look at her face, Nick.

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:20.690 align:middle line:90%
That woman is not lying.

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:21.490 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: No.

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:22.290 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:24.260 align:middle line:10%
You can have a debate
about the extent

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:26.180 align:middle line:10%
to which her memory
might have been

00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:28.610 align:middle line:10%
skewed by regression hypnosis.

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:30.800 align:middle line:90%
And that's a whole other debate.

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:32.240 align:middle line:90%
But no.

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:36.410 align:middle line:84%
From that clip and from
having met her personally,

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:39.500 align:middle line:84%
sat down in a
restaurant with her,

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:41.570 align:middle line:84%
spent the whole
evening chatting,

00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:46.010 align:middle line:84%
I have no doubt, like you,
that she was telling the truth

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:47.082 align:middle line:90%
as she perceived it.

00:27:47.082 --> 00:27:48.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As she perceived it.

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:51.680 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what psychiatrist
Benjamin Simon said.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:55.040 align:middle line:84%
That she was telling the
truth based on what she thinks

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.150 align:middle line:90%
she saw.

00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:58.770 align:middle line:84%
Because I wanted him,
Nick, at that age

00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:01.230 align:middle line:84%
as I was interviewing him, I
wanted him to tell me they're

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:02.030 align:middle line:90%
lying.

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:05.720 align:middle line:84%
Or I found out in hypnosis that
they're making the story up.

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:06.762 align:middle line:90%
But he couldn't say that.

00:28:06.762 --> 00:28:07.561 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: No.

00:28:07.561 --> 00:28:09.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean that would have
been a big story for you.

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:13.130 align:middle line:84%
You would have uncovered
a long running fraud.

00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:14.630 align:middle line:90%
But you didn't.

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:19.070 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's a classic case.

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:23.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean one point about
it-- which I think is often

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:25.970 align:middle line:84%
overlooked, people kind of
nervous about talking about it

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:27.530 align:middle line:90%
for understandable reasons--

00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:29.510 align:middle line:90%
but Betty was white.

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:30.860 align:middle line:90%
Barney was black.

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:35.180 align:middle line:84%
Now for a mixed race
couple to put their heads

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:37.040 align:middle line:84%
above the parapet,
put themselves

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:42.382 align:middle line:84%
into the public eye in
1961 in New Hampshire.

00:28:42.382 --> 00:28:43.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was unheard of.

00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:44.390 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yeah.

00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:47.610 align:middle line:84%
That was not something
that you would want to do.

00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:49.730 align:middle line:84%
You would not want
the attention.

00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:51.530 align:middle line:84%
I think they were
putting themselves

00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:55.396 align:middle line:84%
in a difficult, possibly
even dangerous, situation.

00:28:55.396 --> 00:28:56.229 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:28:56.229 --> 00:28:57.937 align:middle line:84%
It could have been a
dangerous situation.

00:28:57.937 --> 00:29:00.800 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: This was, yeah,
very different days.

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think that is another
reason that, to me, why I say,

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:07.970 align:middle line:84%
these people were not
attention seekers.

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:10.570 align:middle line:84%
My goodness, they
would have been well

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:13.652 align:middle line:84%
advised I think to keep
quiet, keep their heads down.

00:29:13.652 --> 00:29:15.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I used to
think could this

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:18.380 align:middle line:84%
have been some kind
of military operation

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:22.310 align:middle line:84%
and that the people that
they saw standing by the road

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:25.970 align:middle line:84%
weren't extraterrestrials
but military people.

00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And I keep coming back
to no, something dramatic

00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:32.690 align:middle line:84%
happened to these
people in an era

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:38.540 align:middle line:84%
where extraterrestrials
abducted humans in huge numbers,

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:41.120 align:middle line:84%
not just bought
Barney and Betty Hill.

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:43.940 align:middle line:84%
That seems to have slowed
down a little bit now.

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:44.740 align:middle line:90%
Don't you think?

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:46.110 align:middle line:90%
The abductions like that?

00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:46.910 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: It does.

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's quite interesting
to speculate why.

00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:53.210 align:middle line:84%
I think there are three
different ideas that

00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:54.420 align:middle line:90%
come to my mind.

00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:57.260 align:middle line:84%
Firstly, some of
the true believers

00:29:57.260 --> 00:30:04.250 align:middle line:84%
would say, well, there
was a program of some sort

00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:06.345 align:middle line:84%
that the extraterrestrials
were carrying out

00:30:06.345 --> 00:30:10.092 align:middle line:84%
and now that program is
reaching its conclusion.

00:30:10.092 --> 00:30:11.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They've
got their results.

00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:12.170 align:middle line:90%
They're done.

00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:13.880 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: They've got
what they needed,

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:16.340 align:middle line:84%
which is kind of interesting
and a little bit scary

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:18.770 align:middle line:90%
and disconcerting itself.

00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:22.190 align:middle line:84%
Because it makes you wonder
well, when that stage finishes,

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:23.360 align:middle line:90%
what's coming next?

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:24.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:25.710 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:28.040 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: If I was a little
bit more skeptical though,

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:28.840 align:middle line:90%
I would say--

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:29.964 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like David Jacobs.

00:30:29.964 --> 00:30:33.040 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Well, yeah, I think yes.

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And that is some
deeply scary territory.

00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:38.080 align:middle line:10%
But if I was being
more skeptical,

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:41.980 align:middle line:10%
I would say that the
three big name abduction

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:45.070 align:middle line:10%
researchers in the
'80s and the '90s

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:47.830 align:middle line:10%
were Dave Jacobs, who
you've just mentioned,

00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:49.564 align:middle line:10%
Bud Hopkins, and John Mack.

00:30:49.564 --> 00:30:50.480 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.580 align:middle line:10%
And he's gone too.

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:52.870 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: And that's my point.

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:56.650 align:middle line:84%
I wonder, I wonder,
with my skeptical hat

00:30:56.650 --> 00:31:01.960 align:middle line:84%
on, whether the tragic
death of these two figures--

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:05.230 align:middle line:90%
of Bud Hopkins and John Mack--

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:10.440 align:middle line:84%
has meant that people don't
have really the outlet

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:11.760 align:middle line:90%
that they used to.

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:15.130 align:middle line:84%
They don't have
these prolific two

00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:17.140 align:middle line:90%
individuals as spokespeople.

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:20.500 align:middle line:84%
So I wonder if people are
still having these experiences

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:23.740 align:middle line:84%
in the same sorts of
numbers, but in the absence

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:28.040 align:middle line:84%
of Mack and Hopkins, they
don't really have the outlet

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:28.840 align:middle line:90%
that they used to.

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:30.814 align:middle line:90%
So that's my skeptical theory.

00:31:30.814 --> 00:31:32.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think
it's slowed down,

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:36.520 align:middle line:84%
because of vehicles like my
radio show "Coast to Coast."

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:38.950 align:middle line:84%
I think more people
would be calling, talking

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:40.690 align:middle line:90%
about their abduction cases.

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:43.180 align:middle line:84%
I've seen that over
the last 14 years,

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:45.982 align:middle line:84%
Nick, slow down
considerably, too.

00:31:45.982 --> 00:31:47.440 align:middle line:84%
There's another
case I want to talk

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:51.340 align:middle line:84%
with you about which was in your
neck of the woods in England.

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:53.470 align:middle line:90%
Of course, Rendlesham Forest.

00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:55.590 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:31:55.590 --> 00:32:01.160 align:middle line:84%
- As I started to get
up off the ground,

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:04.860 align:middle line:84%
what formed was the silhouette
of a triangular craft

00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:09.790 align:middle line:84%
that was probably about
20 feet in front of me.

00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:12.320 align:middle line:84%
I was just totally
perplexed by it.

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.960 align:middle line:90%


00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:19.010 align:middle line:84%
As I walked up
closer to it, I could

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:23.250 align:middle line:84%
feel electricity jumping,
like on my clothing and skin

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:24.050 align:middle line:90%
and hair.

00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:28.840 align:middle line:90%


00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:32.520 align:middle line:84%
They looked like black
glasses, very shiny.

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:37.580 align:middle line:84%
But in the actual skin of
this craft, running through it

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:40.660 align:middle line:90%
was different colors.

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:47.002 align:middle line:84%
There would be globs of
whatever, blue or orange.

00:32:47.002 --> 00:32:52.560 align:middle line:84%
I was looking for crew
compartments, intake, exhausts.

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:53.930 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't aerodynamic.

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:55.440 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it had no flaps.

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:58.140 align:middle line:84%
It didn't have anything that
normal aircraft would have.

00:32:58.140 --> 00:32:58.940 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:00.481 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's an
amazing story, Nick.

00:33:00.481 --> 00:33:04.110 align:middle line:84%
John Burroughs former
US military officer,

00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:05.660 align:middle line:84%
he was one of
those who was there

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:10.027 align:middle line:84%
who actually went up and touched
the craft, got sick, I think.

00:33:10.027 --> 00:33:11.360 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that story?

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:13.790 align:middle line:10%
>>POPE: Well, John
Burroughs and Jim Penniston

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:16.310 align:middle line:10%
were probably the
two that got closest.

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:20.780 align:middle line:84%
I think it was Jim who
touched the side of the thing.

00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:24.710 align:middle line:84%
John certainly believes
that some health

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:29.250 align:middle line:84%
issues that he had were
attributable to probably

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:30.770 align:middle line:90%
non-ionized radiation.

00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:32.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Radiation
probably, yea.

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:35.060 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: And you
know, again, skeptics

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:40.130 align:middle line:84%
find it easy to dismiss all
of this and scoff at it.

00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:44.960 align:middle line:10%
But a British
government document

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:49.970 align:middle line:10%
called Project
Condign Study Report--

00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:53.120 align:middle line:10%
it's one of the documents
that I mentioned that has

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:55.280 align:middle line:10%
been declassified and released.

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:57.980 align:middle line:84%
It was an intelligence
assessment

00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:02.960 align:middle line:84%
of the UFO phenomenon
classified Secret UK Eyes Only.

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:06.830 align:middle line:10%
And one of the
lines in that study

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:10.550 align:middle line:10%
said it might be postulated
that the Rendlesham Forest

00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:15.290 align:middle line:10%
incident was an example of
an occasion where witnesses

00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:23.900 align:middle line:10%
got too close to a UAP and
were exposed for longer time

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:27.710 align:middle line:10%
periods than normal
to the UAP radiation.

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:31.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, John Burroughs
had an attorney

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:36.590 align:middle line:84%
working on a pro-bono basis,
working with Jim, too.

00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:40.520 align:middle line:84%
And the they'd got
nowhere with the VA.

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:44.330 align:middle line:10%
But then, Pat
Frascogna, the lawyer

00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:47.449 align:middle line:10%
who had been doing this
work, went to the VA

00:34:47.449 --> 00:34:52.070 align:middle line:10%
with this document and said
you denied that my clients were

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:53.210 align:middle line:10%
irradiated.

00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:56.840 align:middle line:84%
Here is a Ministry of
Defense Intelligence Study

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:58.670 align:middle line:90%
that might suggest otherwise.

00:34:58.670 --> 00:35:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And guess what, they
settled instantly.

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:02.840 align:middle line:90%
Certainly with John.

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:07.040 align:middle line:84%
I think Jim has not
spoken in public

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:08.630 align:middle line:90%
about what his situation is.

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:10.370 align:middle line:90%
So I don't want to go there.

00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:13.740 align:middle line:84%
But with John, they
settled in full.

00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:15.740 align:middle line:84%

happened there, Nick?

clearly encountered

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:21.650 align:middle line:90%
something truly extraordinary.

>>NOORY: In the forest.

00:35:22.654 --> 00:35:23.570 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: In the forest.

00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:26.540 align:middle line:84%
In Rendlesham Forest
in December 1980.

00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:29.150 align:middle line:84%
Some people say
extraterrestrial.

00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:31.040 align:middle line:90%
Others say interdimensional.

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:35.570 align:middle line:84%
Some say time travelers
from the future.

00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:40.440 align:middle line:84%
Others say some kind of deep
black government or military.

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:42.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Secret operation.

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:43.860 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: We don't know.

00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:44.660 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:49.310 align:middle line:84%
What we do know is that even
those of us who looked at this

00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:54.020 align:middle line:84%
and accessed all the files from
within the Ministry of Defense,

00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:56.730 align:middle line:84%
found no conventional
explanation.

00:35:56.730 --> 00:35:59.720 align:middle line:84%
So if it was some
secret prototype,

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:05.540 align:middle line:84%
spy plane or drone, even us
with high security clearances

00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:07.760 align:middle line:84%
in the Ministry of Defense
couldn't get access

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:10.010 align:middle line:84%
to that explanation,
that information,

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:10.940 align:middle line:90%
if it was out there.

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:13.412 align:middle line:84%

it was something else.

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:12.710 align:middle line:84%
semi official sources
say they probably

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:15.460 align:middle line:90%
were the US Army's pursuit.

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:18.770 align:middle line:84%
Several observers say they saw
one or more planes spotlighted

00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:21.710 align:middle line:90%
by 20 or 30 search lights.

00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:25.730 align:middle line:84%
The object moved southward,
presumably over Huntington Park

00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:29.010 align:middle line:84%
at the western edge of Los
Angeles and on southward

00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:32.015 align:middle line:84%
to about Long
Beach on the coast.

00:37:32.015 --> 00:37:34.154 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:37:34.154 --> 00:37:35.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a story, Nick.

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And there was incredible
paranoia, people thinking

00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:39.970 align:middle line:90%
the Japanese were coming here.

00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:44.770 align:middle line:84%
They had sent balloons that
had little bombs on them.

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:47.260 align:middle line:84%
But if this were
a blimp, it would

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:49.720 align:middle line:84%
have been obliterated
by the 2,000 shells

00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:51.670 align:middle line:84%
that they shot there,
because some of them

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:53.110 align:middle line:90%
did hit the object.

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:54.880 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
happened there?

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:57.820 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, I can only
agree with your assessment.

00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, that
iconic photograph

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:03.910 align:middle line:90%
is almost the proof of all this.

00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:08.660 align:middle line:84%
The searchlights had this thing,
whatever it was, illuminated.

00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:13.600 align:middle line:84%
The AAA was going up and
was hitting this thing.

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:17.620 align:middle line:84%
So if it had been a blimp or
balloon, or even an aircraft

00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:21.400 align:middle line:84%
from a Japanese carrier,
which is, I think unlikely,

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:25.540 align:middle line:84%
but it would have been, as you
say, shot down, obliterated.

00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:28.360 align:middle line:84%
But whatever this was-- and
it's interesting that again

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:32.260 align:middle line:84%
in that clip, we heard
that there were references

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:36.070 align:middle line:90%
to aircraft in the plural seen.

00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And again, of
course, at the time,

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:41.710 align:middle line:84%
we didn't really
have the language

00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:45.850 align:middle line:84%
to talk about anything else
except aircraft and blimps.

00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:49.600 align:middle line:84%
But nowadays, or perhaps
shortly after that,

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:54.760 align:middle line:84%
we would have talked about
flying saucers or UFOs and now

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:58.930 align:middle line:84%
UAP, but at the time it was
just aircraft and blimps.

00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:03.970 align:middle line:84%
But people say often,
why don't you UFOs

00:39:03.970 --> 00:39:05.879 align:middle line:90%
land on the White House lawn?

00:39:05.879 --> 00:39:07.420 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's the
answer, because they

00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:09.753 align:middle line:84%
know that when they come down
we start shooting at them.

00:39:09.753 --> 00:39:13.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I suspect
though, Nick, that in this case

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:17.790 align:middle line:84%
we know something that hasn't
been revealed to us yet.

00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:21.760 align:middle line:84%
If they sent up craft to
find this, they shot at this,

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:23.350 align:middle line:90%
something happened.

00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:25.000 align:middle line:90%
I think they know what it is.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.620 align:middle line:90%
But they never told us.

00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:29.800 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Again, I think it
would require some smoking gun

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:33.370 align:middle line:84%
document to come out of
an archive somewhere.

00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's the great thing
about archival research.

00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, some little
piece of information

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:46.250 align:middle line:84%
comes out that totally
changes people's attitudes

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:47.050 align:middle line:90%
about things.

00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:50.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean fairly
recently, I was reading

00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:54.910 align:middle line:84%
that an old essay written by
former Prime Minister Winston

00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Churchill came out which nobody
knew about before in which he

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:02.950 align:middle line:84%
was speculating quite
openly about the possibility

00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:03.820 align:middle line:90%
of alien life.

00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:04.944 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was a believer.

00:40:04.944 --> 00:40:05.980 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes, he was.

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:09.760 align:middle line:84%
And there's a couple of
other later documents

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:14.200 align:middle line:84%
which I think pretty
much make that point.

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:16.000 align:middle line:84%
There's a famous
document in which

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.420 align:middle line:84%
he asks his scientific
adviser what is

00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:23.470 align:middle line:90%
the truth about flying saucers?

00:40:23.470 --> 00:40:24.760 align:middle line:90%
What is going on?

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:26.770 align:middle line:90%
Please let me have a report.

00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:29.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He believed
the universe was so vast

00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:32.170 align:middle line:84%
that the probability
was many that we

00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:34.370 align:middle line:84%
had extraterrestrial
life out there.

00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:35.170 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:40:35.170 --> 00:40:38.140 align:middle line:84%
And Churchill-- when
one looks back now--

00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:42.700 align:middle line:84%
I think Churchill
is clearly a man who

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:47.080 align:middle line:84%
stands with other iconic
figures as somebody ahead

00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:49.420 align:middle line:84%
of his time in
many ways in terms

00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:51.790 align:middle line:84%
of his thinking
and his world view.

00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:53.395 align:middle line:84%
I mean Churchill
knew a thing or two.

00:40:53.395 --> 00:40:54.195 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He knew.

00:40:54.195 --> 00:40:56.270 align:middle line:84%
There's one more case I want
to talk with you about, Nick.

00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:58.480 align:middle line:10%
And that had to do with
the late police officer

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:02.290 align:middle line:10%
Lonnie Zamora from
Socorro, New Mexico, where

00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:05.890 align:middle line:10%
he was in his police
cruiser and then saw

00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:10.420 align:middle line:10%
something in the desert which
changed his mind forever.

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:11.840 align:middle line:10%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:15.950 align:middle line:10%
- On April 24, 1964, an
American police officer

00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:18.830 align:middle line:10%
named Lonnie Zamora spotted
a strange object streak

00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:23.150 align:middle line:10%
through the sky over a highway
outside of Socorro, New Mexico.

00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:25.370 align:middle line:84%
The object was between
half a mile to a mile

00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:28.610 align:middle line:84%
away shooting off
towards the southwest.

00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:32.390 align:middle line:84%
It left a trail of bluish orange
flames and made a roaring noise

00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:34.430 align:middle line:90%
as it passed overhead.

00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:37.440 align:middle line:84%
Curious as to what it was,
Officer Zamora followed

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:40.610 align:middle line:84%
the object over a steep hill,
catching up with it as it lay

00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:42.500 align:middle line:90%
rested on the summit.

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:45.920 align:middle line:84%
What Zamora saw then has never
been adequately explained.

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.640 align:middle line:90%

00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:48.940 align:middle line:90%

00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:49.740 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Me, too.

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:53.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is-- and
unfortunately Lonnie has passed

00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:54.660 align:middle line:90%
on--

00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:58.500 align:middle line:84%
but he left with us an
incredible story, didn't he?

00:41:58.500 --> 00:41:59.300 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: He did.

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And again, about the
only place the skeptics

00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:06.450 align:middle line:84%
have to go with this is
well, maybe he made it up,

00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:12.030 align:middle line:84%
maybe it was to try and generate
some tourism for the town,

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:13.170 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:15.950 align:middle line:84%
But people that
knew Lonnie Zamora--

00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:17.010 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't--

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:18.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was a
straight shooter.

00:42:18.070 --> 00:42:18.450 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yeah.

00:42:18.450 --> 00:42:19.250 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:23.040 align:middle line:84%
Respected in his local community
and in his local church.

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And the last person who
would have ever told a lie

00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:30.840 align:middle line:84%
or played some sort
of practical joke

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:33.390 align:middle line:84%
that brought down people
from Washington-- which

00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:35.810 align:middle line:90%
is of course what happened.

00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:37.980 align:middle line:84%
There there's been
speculation well maybe

00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:40.920 align:middle line:84%
the craft was
something associated

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:44.310 align:middle line:84%
with the embryonic
Apollo program.

00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I thought maybe it
might have been a lunar module

00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:50.940 align:middle line:84%
lander with a couple astronauts
running around on the outside.

00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:53.289 align:middle line:90%
But I kind of pooed that away.

00:42:53.289 --> 00:42:54.580 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Well, I think so, yeah.

00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:59.520 align:middle line:84%
I think when you listen to
the story about the exhalation

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:03.930 align:middle line:84%
that this object was capable of,
plus the fact that if that had

00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:07.640 align:middle line:84%
been the explanation, now,
the records would be out

00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:10.350 align:middle line:84%
and we'd know because
there's nothing secret now

00:43:10.350 --> 00:43:13.050 align:middle line:84%
about the early days
of the Apollo program.

00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:16.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean we tested the
lunar module in the desert.

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:21.660 align:middle line:84%
But it didn't go up and
keep going like this did.

00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:22.960 align:middle line:90%
So it's an amazing story.

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:25.020 align:middle line:84%
There's another
one more last one.

00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:27.810 align:middle line:90%
1997 in Phoenix.

00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:30.570 align:middle line:84%
So many people,
thousands of people,

00:43:30.570 --> 00:43:34.510 align:middle line:84%
saw what they thought was a
huge triangular shaped object

00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:35.310 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:43:35.310 --> 00:43:37.140 align:middle line:84%
- The first thing that struck
me is that they were just

00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:38.215 align:middle line:90%
in a v-shaped formation.

00:43:38.215 --> 00:43:40.800 align:middle line:10%
Well, it's at night
and guys wouldn't

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:43.200 align:middle line:10%
have been flying in a
v-shape formation, in a Vic.

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:45.450 align:middle line:90%
We'd call it a Vic.

00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:47.910 align:middle line:84%
So they wouldn't be in a Vic
and then all of a sudden I

00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:50.880 align:middle line:84%
realized wow, I don't
see any navigation lights

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:52.770 align:middle line:90%
or anti-collision lights.

00:43:52.770 --> 00:43:58.730 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm looking at five
light passing overhead silently

00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:00.090 align:middle line:90%
at a very slow rate.

00:44:00.090 --> 00:44:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And it also occurred
to me that they

00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:06.040 align:middle line:84%
were flying too slow to stay in
the air if it was an aircraft.

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:06.840 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There were all
kinds of stories, Nick,

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:10.990 align:middle line:84%
about what might
have been up there.

00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:13.440 align:middle line:84%
But I still think
the most compelling

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:18.180 align:middle line:84%
is that there was an object
maybe about a mile long, huge,

00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:20.570 align:middle line:84%
that they saw over
the skies of Phoenix.

00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:21.370 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: I agree.

00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And certainly I've
spoken to many witnesses

00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:27.510 align:middle line:90%
who saw something that night.

00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:31.860 align:middle line:84%
Some of those people who I've
met when I've been to Phoenix,

00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:34.680 align:middle line:90%
and I've spoken in Phoenix.

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:38.289 align:middle line:84%
I now live in Tucson so it's
an area I'm very familiar with.

00:44:38.289 --> 00:44:39.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So you're close.

00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:40.130 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:44:40.130 --> 00:44:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And for the skeptics who say
well this was flares dropped

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:46.365 align:middle line:84%
from an aircraft that had come
from Davis-Monthan Air Force

00:44:46.365 --> 00:44:47.165 align:middle line:90%
Base land--

00:44:47.165 --> 00:44:48.665 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or Chinese
lanterns, right?

00:44:48.665 --> 00:44:50.940 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Yeah over the
Barry Goldwater range

00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:51.960 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:55.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the
witnesses was the governor

00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:56.715 align:middle line:90%
himself Fife Symington--

00:44:56.715 --> 00:44:58.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At the
time, yes, exactly.

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:01.680 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: You know if ever
there was someone less

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:04.770 align:middle line:84%
likely to misidentify
flares, it would

00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:07.509 align:middle line:84%
be a former military
pilot like Fife.

00:45:07.509 --> 00:45:09.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you know
he apologized, too.

00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:11.530 align:middle line:84%
I was on the "Larry
King Show" with him.

00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And he admitted
he made a mistake.

00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:15.790 align:middle line:84%
Because initially
when this happened,

00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:18.570 align:middle line:84%
he had held a news
conference and had

00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:22.180 align:middle line:84%
a person in an alien costume
standing next to him.

00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:23.440 align:middle line:90%
And he made fun of it.

00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:23.510 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:25.320 align:middle line:10%

that you guys are entirely

00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:26.370 align:middle line:10%
too serious.

00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:26.820 align:middle line:10%

[END PLAYBACK]

00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:30.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A couple of years
later, he kind of changed

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:33.930 align:middle line:84%
his tune, and said, I don't
know what this thing was,

00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:35.520 align:middle line:84%
but I shouldn't
have made fun of it.

00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:37.080 align:middle line:84%
And to me that was
pretty dramatic

00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:40.570 align:middle line:84%
for him to basically
apologize for what he did.

00:45:40.570 --> 00:45:41.370 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:45:41.370 --> 00:45:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of people
were very bitter at that.

00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:47.130 align:middle line:84%
Yes, as you say, he
got his Chief of Staff

00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:49.800 align:middle line:84%
to dress up in a
kind of alien suit

00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:53.130 align:middle line:90%
and said I can now tell people--

00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:54.450 align:middle line:90%
this was a press conference--

00:45:54.450 --> 00:45:57.960 align:middle line:84%
I can now tell people that
the culprit behind these UFO

00:45:57.960 --> 00:45:59.790 align:middle line:90%
sightings has been exposed.

00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And out came the Chief of
Staff dressed as an alien

00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:04.860 align:middle line:90%
and everyone laughed.

00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And he said-- and I've
discussed this with him--

00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:09.750 align:middle line:84%
he said the reason
he did that is

00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:14.580 align:middle line:84%
he felt he had to do so because
his perception as the governor

00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:17.730 align:middle line:84%
was that the local
community was descending

00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:21.660 align:middle line:84%
into a state of near
hysteria about this.

00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:24.840 align:middle line:84%
Which again just shows you
something about the scale

00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:25.890 align:middle line:90%
of these sightings.

00:46:25.890 --> 00:46:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And I tell you, for every
witness who's come forward

00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:32.370 align:middle line:84%
and given their story, there
are hundreds who haven't.

00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And I've spoken to people who
said, Nick, this was so close,

00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:39.130 align:middle line:84%
I tell you if I'd thrown
a rock up in the air,

00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:41.050 align:middle line:84%
I would have hit the
underside of this thing.

00:46:41.050 --> 00:46:41.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:46:41.850 --> 00:46:44.520 align:middle line:84%
Nick, you have
devoted your career

00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:47.570 align:middle line:84%
to investigating
this phenomenon.

00:46:47.570 --> 00:46:51.230 align:middle line:84%
In your opinion,
what are you chasing?

00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:55.070 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, we
like to label things.

00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:58.340 align:middle line:84%
I think it's one of the
things that we humans do.

00:46:58.340 --> 00:47:01.280 align:middle line:84%
So we kind of get a
phenomenon like this

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:04.670 align:middle line:84%
and we try and pigeon
hole it and say

00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:07.160 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial,
interdimensional,

00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:11.900 align:middle line:84%
intertemporal, whatever
theory we favor.

00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:16.530 align:middle line:84%
I can't help but wonder
whether this is just our own--

00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:19.250 align:middle line:84%
it's like if you see a
shadowy figure at the foot

00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:20.150 align:middle line:90%
of your bed--

00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:22.490 align:middle line:84%
if you're religious,
you might think

00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:25.820 align:middle line:84%
it was an angel or a
manifestation of the blessed

00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:27.020 align:middle line:90%
Virgin Mary.

00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:30.590 align:middle line:84%
If you are a paranormal
investigator,

00:47:30.590 --> 00:47:32.660 align:middle line:84%
you might think
of it as a ghost.

00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:36.110 align:middle line:84%
If you are a
ufologist, you might

00:47:36.110 --> 00:47:38.150 align:middle line:90%
think you were being abducted.

00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:41.540 align:middle line:84%
What I'm saying is
that we interpret this

00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:46.970 align:middle line:84%
through the lens of our
own cultural background

00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:49.010 align:middle line:90%
and our own belief system.

00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:51.140 align:middle line:84%
So we pigeonhole
all these things--

00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:54.500 align:middle line:90%
aliens, ghosts, angels, demons.

00:47:54.500 --> 00:48:00.320 align:middle line:84%
My theory is that these
labels are just very

00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:05.870 align:middle line:84%
anthropocentric attempts
to categorize and define

00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:09.682 align:middle line:84%
something that may be totally
beyond our comprehension.

00:48:09.682 --> 00:48:10.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That could be.

00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:14.720 align:middle line:84%
When the dust settles,
when the files are read,

00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:15.740 align:middle line:90%
what will we have?

00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:18.170 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well I
think we will have--

00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:23.840 align:middle line:84%
it's what I talk about
as sort of a reverse

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:25.040 align:middle line:90%
of the normal situation.

00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:29.310 align:middle line:84%
We'll be able to
say what UFO aren't.

00:48:29.310 --> 00:48:31.700 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we'll
be able to look at all

00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:33.770 align:middle line:90%
the material in this files.

00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:36.680 align:middle line:84%
And we'll say, look the
government itself, governments

00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:38.600 align:middle line:84%
all around the
world, have thrown

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:41.390 align:middle line:84%
a huge amount of
resources at this

00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:47.730 align:middle line:84%
and still haven't really, I
think, managed to define--

00:48:47.730 --> 00:48:48.530 align:middle line:90%
well as I say--

00:48:48.530 --> 00:48:49.552 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At least to us.

00:48:49.552 --> 00:48:50.510 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: At least to us.

00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:54.320 align:middle line:84%
What we might not be able
to do from all these files

00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:57.950 align:middle line:90%
is say, ah, that's the answer.

00:48:57.950 --> 00:49:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And indeed there may not
be a single, neat answer

00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:03.990 align:middle line:90%
to the whole phenomenon.

00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:06.840 align:middle line:84%
There may be lots of
different things going on.

00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:10.700 align:middle line:10%
But I think what we will be
able to say, without any doubt,

00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:13.940 align:middle line:10%
is that this is not
misidentifications,

00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:15.440 align:middle line:10%
this is not hoaxes.

00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:17.000 align:middle line:90%
This is not delusions.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.160 align:middle line:90%
Some of it is, of course.

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:22.010 align:middle line:10%
But as I always used to say
at the Ministry of Defense,

00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:25.250 align:middle line:10%
the skeptics have to be
right every single day,

00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:27.494 align:middle line:10%
but the believers only
have to be right once.

00:49:27.494 --> 00:49:28.660 align:middle line:90%

People like Nick
Pope will continue

00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:47.260 align:middle line:84%
to investigate to get that
answer, whatever it may be.
