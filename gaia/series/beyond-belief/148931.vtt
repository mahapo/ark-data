00:00:18.235 --> 00:00:20.860 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well, welcome to
this edition of Beyond Belief.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:21.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.080 align:middle line:10%
There are a handful
of UFO investigators

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.810 align:middle line:10%
that I truly can say I trust.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.090 align:middle line:84%
One of them, of course,
is with us now--

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.870 align:middle line:84%
Paola Harris, Italo-American
investigative reporter

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.780 align:middle line:84%
who has literally devoted
her life and career

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.370 align:middle line:90%
to investigating UFOs.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.894 align:middle line:84%
Paola, always a
pleasure to see you.

00:00:39.894 --> 00:00:41.310 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA HARRIS:
Thank you, George.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.165 align:middle line:90%
It's a pleasure to be with you.

00:00:43.165 --> 00:00:45.540 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You have written a
new book called conversations

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.430 align:middle line:10%
with Colonel Corso.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.427 align:middle line:84%
It's an amazing
story about someone

00:00:49.427 --> 00:00:51.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have you
describe for us in a second.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.030 align:middle line:10%
And, of course, Colonel
Corso was the co-author

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.070 align:middle line:10%
of the book "The
Day after Roswell"

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.587 align:middle line:10%
about his case and his episodes.

00:00:58.587 --> 00:01:00.420 align:middle line:10%
But tell me about your
involvement with him.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.500 align:middle line:90%
How did that all happen?

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.030 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: It's serendipitous.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.190 align:middle line:84%
There was a room
ready for three days,

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.240 align:middle line:84%
and it was a room
next to Philip Corso.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No!

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.350 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.390 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't know about--

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Serendipity
at its best.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Right next to him.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.680 align:middle line:84%
And do you know, George,
nobody could get to him

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.110 align:middle line:84%
because Simon and Schuster
kind of had him sequestered?

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.559 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So nobody
could get near him,

00:01:19.559 --> 00:01:21.600 align:middle line:84%
because everybody in the
world wanted interviews.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And here I am in the
room next to him.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.870 align:middle line:84%
So I jumped in the car,
went over to the UFO Museum.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm there.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.170 align:middle line:84%
And he's on the stage
doing a press conference.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.830 align:middle line:10%
And I'm trying to think,
how will I get to him?

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.460 align:middle line:10%
And this blond guy comes up to
me and says, you're from Italy.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.260 align:middle line:10%
And I said, yes.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.230 align:middle line:10%
He says, ask my father
a question in Italian.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.730 align:middle line:84%
I said, that's your
father up there?

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:45.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Love it.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:46.610 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: And he said, yeah.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:47.410 align:middle line:90%
Ask him.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.600 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.560 align:middle line:84%
You know, the cameras
are all pointed.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And he takes his hand, and
he pushes me into the crowd.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.530 align:middle line:90%
I have no choice.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.440 align:middle line:84%
So I asked him about the
Santilli autopsy footage.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.945 align:middle line:84%
You remember that
Santilli footage--

00:01:59.945 --> 00:02:01.111 align:middle line:90%
you know, the alien autopsy?

00:02:01.111 --> 00:02:02.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And I
asked it in Italian.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.380 align:middle line:90%
And he said to me, you know?

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.130 align:middle line:84%
He said, one of the artifacts
I had in the nut file--

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.130 align:middle line:84%
which he calls the file of
artifacts that were given

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.890 align:middle line:90%
to him from General Trudeau--

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.610 align:middle line:84%
was this black lens
that everybody thinks

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.270 align:middle line:90%
is the ET's eye.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.070 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.870 align:middle line:90%
It's a light collector.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I had this
black lens in that file.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And he said-- and he's
saying this on the stage--

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.510 align:middle line:84%
we used to put it up to our
eyes and walk up and down

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.330 align:middle line:90%
the halls of the Pentagon.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And we could see the
furniture in the dark.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And so I
said, oh, you know,

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.350 align:middle line:84%
he not only answered a question
about an artifact he had--

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.950 align:middle line:84%
and then, later, he told me that
they developed night-screening

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.960 align:middle line:90%
devices from that--

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.000 align:middle line:84%
but he answered a
question that I've

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.810 align:middle line:84%
had about the Santilli
footage because they peel off

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:55.850 align:middle line:90%
this lens.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:56.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So, you
know, my whole life

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.100 align:middle line:90%
is trying to connect these dots.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We thought it was
the membrane of the eye.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:01.290 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes!

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And everybody thinks that
the little Grey alien

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.400 align:middle line:90%
has these big huge black eyes.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's really a lens,
a light collector.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.270 align:middle line:84%
So, anyway, Colonel
Corso later on

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.820 align:middle line:84%
explained to me about the
extraterrestrial biological

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:15.620 align:middle line:90%
entity.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.809 align:middle line:84%
But he said to me, I
want to speak to you.

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:20.100 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know, when he
said I want to speak to you,

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.130 align:middle line:84%
that he'd be coming out of his
room right next door to me.

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I was
able to get an interview.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I was able
to invite him to Italy.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.160 align:middle line:90%
And he came to Italy.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And my relationship
with him was in Italy,

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.590 align:middle line:84%
because, George, I
don't know if you know,

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.322 align:middle line:84%
he didn't speak in the
United States very often.

00:03:37.322 --> 00:03:38.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, not a lot.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.113 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Not a lot.

00:03:39.113 --> 00:03:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And before he got a
chance to do very much,

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:47.280 align:middle line:84%
a lot of our own colleagues
went ahead and really

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.770 align:middle line:90%
attacked him for what he said.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't
understand the importance.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And, in my book, I have all his
records, his military records.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's priceless.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.480 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I have his
military records.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.750 align:middle line:84%
He was at Fort Riley,
Kansas, in 1947.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.670 align:middle line:84%
He was at White Sands as
a commander of a missile

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:07.470 align:middle line:90%
battalion.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:13.380 align:middle line:84%
He was the head of intelligence
in Rome for the CIC in 1945.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.010 align:middle line:84%
He was all the places
he said he was.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In 1998, Colonel
Philip Corso was in Rome, Paula,

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:24.314 align:middle line:90%
talking about extraterrestrials.

00:04:24.314 --> 00:04:26.730 align:middle line:84%
>>PHILIP CORSO: When I was
chief of the Foreign Technology

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.930 align:middle line:84%
Division, I went to
the general one day.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:38.010 align:middle line:10%
And it was agreed that we would
start no projects in the Army,

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.090 align:middle line:10%
in our division, our
area, with the money we

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.220 align:middle line:10%
had in the organization--

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:48.530 align:middle line:10%
on those three items,
crop circles, mutilations,

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.540 align:middle line:10%
and abductions.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.870 align:middle line:90%
But we would watch them.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.760 align:middle line:84%
We would keep
getting the reports

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.580 align:middle line:84%
and watch them but
start no projects

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.560 align:middle line:84%
because our main objective in
those days was weapons of war.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:09.260 align:middle line:84%
We called it "to advance the
competitive edge of the Army."

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.380 align:middle line:84%
Even the beings, it
didn't matter to us

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.457 align:middle line:90%
whether they were real or not.

00:05:14.457 --> 00:05:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't matter
if they came here

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.320 align:middle line:90%
by accident or design.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.040 align:middle line:84%
But our motto was, if they're
real, we're going to be ready.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.370 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to sit
here like stupid beings

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.010 align:middle line:90%
and say they aren't around.

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.609 align:middle line:84%
We have to work on assumptions
that they are there.

00:05:30.609 --> 00:05:32.150 align:middle line:84%
And we have to work
on the assumption

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.150 align:middle line:90%
that they might be enemies.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.840 align:middle line:90%
So we have to be ready.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Compelling individual.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.110 align:middle line:84%
I want you, Paola, to tell
our audience exactly who

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.297 align:middle line:90%
Colonel Philip Corso was.

00:05:44.297 --> 00:05:46.880 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, because we were
in Italy, we had an advantage.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.380 align:middle line:90%
We could look at his background.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And we realized the
importance of his role right

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.790 align:middle line:84%
after World War II
in 1945, that he

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:01.580 align:middle line:84%
was the head of the intelligence
in Rome for the CIC.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.620 align:middle line:84%
And when I had him
come to Rome, I

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.840 align:middle line:84%
dragged him all
over the streets,

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.260 align:middle line:84%
having him show me not
only where his office was.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:14.216 align:middle line:84%
I had him show me
where he stayed, which

00:06:14.216 --> 00:06:15.340 align:middle line:90%
was the Ambasciatori Hotel.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:16.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you want him to
authenticate these things?

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.955 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:06:16.955 --> 00:06:17.788 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's why?

00:06:17.788 --> 00:06:19.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well,
that's how I do it,

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.080 align:middle line:90%
because I'm a field researcher.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.570 align:middle line:84%
All the work I've ever
done I've done in person.

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.270 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and we walked into
the Ambasciatori Hotel.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:27.680 align:middle line:90%
And it was all different.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.180 align:middle line:84%
He said, no, the
elevator was here.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.170 align:middle line:90%
He said, the bar was here.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:33.530 align:middle line:90%
And I called somebody.

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.750 align:middle line:90%
And I said, who's here in 1945?

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:37.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To verify this stuff?

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.772 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: And they did.

00:06:38.772 --> 00:06:39.980 align:middle line:90%
And he was telling the truth.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And then this will
make you laugh.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:43.580 align:middle line:90%
We went to Via Veneto.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And he said he had had some
paranormal experiences near Via

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:47.810 align:middle line:90%
Cegilia.

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.860 align:middle line:84%
He said there was a
bar where a singer used

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.350 align:middle line:90%
to sing with a white piano.

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:54.630 align:middle line:90%
It's a restaurant now.

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:55.430 align:middle line:90%
And I walked in.

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And I said, were there
military men in 1950?

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.060 align:middle line:90%
Was there a white piano?

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.490 align:middle line:84%
And the man says,
go down four floors.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.332 align:middle line:84%
And we walked down
into the basement.

00:07:06.332 --> 00:07:07.415 align:middle line:90%
There was the white piano.

00:07:07.415 --> 00:07:08.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was
the piano stowed away.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And there's
pictures of all military men

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:10.780 align:middle line:90%
on the wall.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting chills as
I'm talking about this.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.910 align:middle line:84%
Then we walked down Via Cegilia
because Colonel Corso was also

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:21.380 align:middle line:84%
involved with finding out
information about communism,

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.550 align:middle line:84%
communists-- about, you
know, the subversive angle.

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:26.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that
was his mission.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.661 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: That was
what he was about.

00:07:27.661 --> 00:07:29.270 align:middle line:90%
He was an intelligence person.

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And he's not just
somebody off the street

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.370 align:middle line:90%
that comes up with a story.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:36.410 align:middle line:90%
And so we had that verification.

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And the book has his military
records of the times.

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:43.520 align:middle line:84%
What people have to remember,
he wasn't at Roswell.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.700 align:middle line:10%
So even though the book is
called "The Day after Roswell,"

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.730 align:middle line:10%
it's stupid to go after
him about Roswell,

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:52.430 align:middle line:10%
because Colonel Corso's
first exposure to this

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.380 align:middle line:10%
was at Fort Riley, Kansas.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.810 align:middle line:10%
We put him on The Tonight Show.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:01.730 align:middle line:10%
And I have some photos of
that with Maurizio Costanzo.

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:02.700 align:middle line:10%
And he told him.

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.280 align:middle line:84%
He said, I was at
Fort Riley, Kansas.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.830 align:middle line:84%
This sensitive cargo
was coming through.

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:09.230 align:middle line:84%
It went to the
veterinary quarters.

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:12.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, the beings go
to the veterinary quarters?

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:13.880 align:middle line:84%
It went to the
veterinary quarters.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.660 align:middle line:84%
One of the guards there said,
Colonel, come in and see this.

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:19.260 align:middle line:90%
You'll see this cargo.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And Colonel opened
up the casket.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.740 align:middle line:90%
He said it was a wooden box.

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:28.610 align:middle line:84%
He said he saw a being
lying in fluid there.

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:30.470 align:middle line:10%
And he describes the being.

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:33.000 align:middle line:10%
And, of course, I have that
description in the book.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:33.340 align:middle line:10%
And he said--

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:34.423 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: As an alien Grey?

00:08:34.423 --> 00:08:37.520 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: Yes-- big head,
looked like a child.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.370 align:middle line:84%
Every time he talked,
I audio taped him.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.539 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to make mistakes.

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:45.020 align:middle line:84%
So everything that's
in the book comes

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.390 align:middle line:90%
from audio tape, which I own.

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And he talked about
seeing this being.

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I knew I
wasn't supposed to be there.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:54.830 align:middle line:90%
So I put the tarpaulin back.

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:55.800 align:middle line:90%
I put the top back.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.790 align:middle line:84%
He said, and I told the guard
to get out because we weren't

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:00.050 align:middle line:90%
really supposed to be there.

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And he said that he was
told that the cargo came

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:03.950 align:middle line:90%
from Roswell.

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:07.580 align:middle line:84%
So he said he put it in the
back of his mind for later.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.650 align:middle line:84%
It's incredible,
because all of this--

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:12.170 align:middle line:90%
all of our lives, actually--

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:16.640 align:middle line:84%
have incidents that
we understand later.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.360 align:middle line:84%
So I'm convinced, though,
that it isn't necessarily

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.100 align:middle line:90%
a body from Roswell.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:25.010 align:middle line:10%
It could be that Roswell,
or around that time,

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:26.780 align:middle line:10%
there were several crashes.

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:28.430 align:middle line:10%
So, George, I'm going
to go on record--

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:33.800 align:middle line:10%
because I brought forth the 1945
San Antonio New Mexico Crash--

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.600 align:middle line:10%
that there was not one crash.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.510 align:middle line:90%
Roswell is not the only crash.

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:40.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But, at
this point, he hasn't

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:43.520 align:middle line:84%
been assigned to investigate
any of this, right?

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.830 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No, all coincidence.

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:46.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: When does that start?

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.690 align:middle line:90%
And how does that start for him?

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:50.750 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: That starts during
the Kennedy administration

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:52.910 align:middle line:10%
during the 1960s.

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:55.550 align:middle line:84%
He was at the Research
and Development Desk

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:56.380 align:middle line:90%
at the Pentagon.

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:56.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Now, we've got to
remember he's at the Pentagon.

00:09:58.670 --> 00:09:59.711 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I've been there!

00:09:59.711 --> 00:10:02.230 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: And he's working
with General Trudeau.

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:03.950 align:middle line:10%
And Trudeau comes
and says, well, I'm

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:06.020 align:middle line:10%
going to give you
some artifacts.

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:09.580 align:middle line:84%
What I want you to do, he
said, is go out into industry.

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:12.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, people are going to argue
all this stuff is already

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:13.130 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:14.480 align:middle line:90%
That's their main argument.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.730 align:middle line:90%
Well, this is the Army.

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And in 1947 and '48, it
was the Army Air Force.

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:22.980 align:middle line:84%
So you don't think the Air
Force started it before?

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:27.940 align:middle line:84%
So, in '60, the Army had
this tray of artifacts.

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:28.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of things.

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:29.818 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, things.

00:10:29.818 --> 00:10:31.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pieces of equipment.

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:32.530 align:middle line:90%
>>PAOLA HARRIS: Yeah.

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:35.240 align:middle line:84%
He talked about a pen
he had that he thought

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.240 align:middle line:90%
the batteries were dead.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And he took it to Fort Belvoir
and put long low waves on it.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.480 align:middle line:90%
And this laser came out.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was a laser pointer.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:47.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It was a laser
that cut and sutured.

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:50.310 align:middle line:10%
There's a letter in
my book to a doctor

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:54.300 align:middle line:10%
here in Durango, Colorado,
that wrote to him and said,

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.320 align:middle line:10%
what about that thing?

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.400 align:middle line:84%
And Colonel Corso said, that
thing cut and sutured, which

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.075 align:middle line:90%
meant it closed the wound.

00:11:01.075 --> 00:11:02.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Closed it,
sealed it right up.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: See, it
sealed it right up!

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:06.540 align:middle line:90%
And he said, we had that.

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:08.824 align:middle line:84%
We had two of those, he
explains to the doctor.

00:11:08.824 --> 00:11:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It sounds like
Star Trek, doesn't it?

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:12.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: This stuff is amazing.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.910 align:middle line:84%
But can you imagine the money
that could be made of it?

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:18.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So he has been
given this assignment.

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:21.390 align:middle line:84%
Take this material
out to industry,

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:22.634 align:middle line:90%
and try to get it duplicated.

00:11:22.634 --> 00:11:23.550 align:middle line:90%
>>PAOLA HARRIS: Right.

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:24.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And that's what he did.

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:25.906 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: He did that.

00:11:25.906 --> 00:11:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And, in my book, because
I could audio tape him,

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.250 align:middle line:84%
he names the German
scientists that came with him.

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:33.540 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know German
scientists came with him.

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:35.484 align:middle line:84%
They were working with
the Paperclip Guys.

00:11:35.484 --> 00:11:36.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, I'm sure.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And he talks
about Hermann Oberth a lot.

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:41.970 align:middle line:10%
And he says that they used
to be really afraid of him

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:43.610 align:middle line:10%
when they used to go to places.

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:45.270 align:middle line:90%
But he mentions Bell Labs.

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And he said, when
he'd walk in, he'd

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:49.960 align:middle line:90%
have to see what they completed.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And, if they completed it, he
had envelopes full of money.

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:54.690 align:middle line:90%
That is one--

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:56.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
how he paid them?

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:59.730 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: No paper
trail, no paper trail.

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And he talks about
these envelopes.

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And, later on, he tried
to get some verification

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.120 align:middle line:90%
of the payment.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:12.737 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, you know,
they're very careful.

00:12:12.737 --> 00:12:13.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No payment.

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:17.100 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: No payment--
never done, never happened.

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:22.230 align:middle line:84%
And, in the audio tape that
he gave me, he told me.

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:25.070 align:middle line:84%
He said, you know, if we didn't
do the night-screening devices,

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:29.160 align:middle line:84%
our soldiers couldn't have
seen the enemy in Vietnam.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he takes
credit for that.

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of people are
very upset about the credit he

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:36.540 align:middle line:90%
took for what the job was.

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:38.940 align:middle line:84%
But he thought he
was doing good.

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.600 align:middle line:90%
But it was for war purposes.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:41.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.499 align:middle line:84%
As he said in that clip,
that was the mission.

00:12:43.499 --> 00:12:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, it was for war.

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:47.040 align:middle line:10%
And that's the military
industrial complex

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:50.340 align:middle line:10%
that everybody talks about,
because the secret can't

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:54.600 align:middle line:10%
be or won't be released
as long as money

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.330 align:middle line:10%
is made from this stuff.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's probably
still going on.

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:04.260 align:middle line:84%
So people need to understand
the whole entire picture

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.560 align:middle line:84%
before they go after
Corso, because, yeah, he

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.710 align:middle line:84%
said he used to go back to those
companies, see at what point

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:11.700 align:middle line:90%
they were.

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.830 align:middle line:84%
Down deep in his heart,
he said, you know,

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:17.250 align:middle line:84%
when the Army would put that
out into the general public--

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:19.800 align:middle line:84%
and I think, just like NASA,
with all the spin offs from

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:20.790 align:middle line:90%
space--

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:22.950 align:middle line:84%
he said that the American
people could have it.

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did he give them a time
limit to try to perfect this?

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:27.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:30.030 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, it
had to be perfect,

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:31.470 align:middle line:84%
because he said
what would happen

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:34.035 align:middle line:84%
is they'd want to do a
second generation of it

00:13:34.035 --> 00:13:35.190 align:middle line:90%
and ask for more money.

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And he said that was
a way they do it.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:40.080 align:middle line:84%
He said they'd say, can we
do the state of the art?

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.080 align:middle line:84%
Or can we upgrade
it or whatever?

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And that was a way of
getting more money.

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:47.640 align:middle line:90%
And he was the money guy.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:52.020 align:middle line:84%
So he basically, you
know, controlled that.

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:55.530 align:middle line:84%
Everything in the book
are his own words.

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And there is a mandate in the
book where Colonel Corso said,

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.540 align:middle line:90%
look, I'm 83 years old, Paola.

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:02.540 align:middle line:84%
He said, unless you go
ahead and tell the world,

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:05.730 align:middle line:84%
he said, I'm going to
give you and Andriano

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:08.220 align:middle line:90%
some very important papers.

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:11.460 align:middle line:84%
He said, unless you go
on and tell the world,

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:14.547 align:middle line:90%
they will not know about this.

00:14:14.547 --> 00:14:15.880 align:middle line:90%
>>CORSO: I'm three 83 years old.

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:19.555 align:middle line:84%
So I have to get you younger
ones to carry the story--

00:14:19.555 --> 00:14:22.870 align:middle line:90%
yeah, Paola and Andriano.

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:24.450 align:middle line:90%
And I want you to do it.

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:26.580 align:middle line:84%
Like today, Maurizio
did a pretty good job.

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:30.570 align:middle line:84%
A couple times he
continued what I said.

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:33.120 align:middle line:10%
And that's what
I want him to do.

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.689 align:middle line:84%
Pick it up and
continue what I say.

00:14:35.689 --> 00:14:37.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And I said, but
I'm not one of your soldiers.

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:39.270 align:middle line:90%
And he said, yes, you are.

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And he said, not
only that, but you're

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:43.090 align:middle line:90%
going to learn how to do this.

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:44.771 align:middle line:90%
So I have an obligation, George.

00:14:44.771 --> 00:14:45.645 align:middle line:90%
I have an obligation.

00:14:45.645 --> 00:14:47.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when people tell me
to go ahead and do something--

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:48.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of course,
some responsibility.

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, you
know, for whatever backlash

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:54.270 align:middle line:84%
or whatever happens,
at least I did it.

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:55.180 align:middle line:90%
It's his words.

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.750 align:middle line:84%
There's no opinion
of mine there.

00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:00.120 align:middle line:90%
I spent two years with him.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.850 align:middle line:84%
We brought his
grandchildren over.

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And I've got to be clear
about this, George.

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:07.050 align:middle line:84%
The motivation was only
the grandchildren--

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:09.270 align:middle line:90%
for Nick, Philip, and Andrew.

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:12.150 align:middle line:84%
He said, I am telling
the truth to the world

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:15.375 align:middle line:84%
because they asked me,
Granddad, did you ever meet ET?

00:15:15.375 --> 00:15:17.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he wanted
them to know for sure.

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:18.999 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: He wanted
them to know for sure.

00:15:18.999 --> 00:15:20.540 align:middle line:10%
Plus, I mean, they
had made a deal--

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:24.240 align:middle line:10%
Trudeau and him-- that the last
one alive would tell the truth,

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.230 align:middle line:10%
would come forward with this.

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:29.520 align:middle line:10%
And, of course, he prepared
the book to come out.

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And it came out at
the 50th anniversary.

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:34.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he did a good
job telling the truth.

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:37.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: He felt that it
was time that the world knew.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was he haunted by
becoming a whistle blower?

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:41.782 align:middle line:90%
Did anything come back at him?

00:15:41.782 --> 00:15:42.990 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: All kinds of stuff.

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:43.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like what?

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:45.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: He had visitations
from the intelligence

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:46.580 align:middle line:90%
community.

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And he said, gentlemen,
you know that that's

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:50.250 align:middle line:90%
25 years down the line.

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.050 align:middle line:90%
25 years has passed.

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:55.080 align:middle line:84%
He had our own people
questioning him,

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:57.660 align:middle line:84%
because, you know, Colonel
Corso wasn't at Roswell.

00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:59.310 align:middle line:90%
He was at Fort Riley, Kansas.

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:01.386 align:middle line:84%
We have a whole slew
of Roswell researchers.

00:16:01.386 --> 00:16:02.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was
handed the goods.

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.637 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And there were some
discrepancies in the book

00:16:05.637 --> 00:16:06.720 align:middle line:90%
because it was co-written.

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:10.650 align:middle line:84%
So the thing is that Colonel
Corso's real manuscript

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:12.480 align:middle line:90%
is "The Dawn of a New Age."

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:16.410 align:middle line:10%
It has been printed in Italy
and has reprinted this year

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:17.700 align:middle line:10%
when I was there.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.600 align:middle line:10%
You can get it online.

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.540 align:middle line:10%
And those were his
handwritten notes.

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:24.870 align:middle line:84%
My book, by the way, has
been released in Italian.

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:26.930 align:middle line:84%
So when you have two
people putting it together,

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:29.660 align:middle line:90%
there's some discrepancies.

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And you just need one
little discrepancy

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:36.840 align:middle line:84%
to discount the whole, throw
the baby out with the bathwater.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:40.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He has talked about
the technologies in that box

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.120 align:middle line:90%
that he was given.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:43.827 align:middle line:90%


00:16:43.827 --> 00:16:45.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: According to
Lieutenant Colonel Philip

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:49.720 align:middle line:84%
Corso, he was responsible
for bringing alien technology

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:53.080 align:middle line:84%
to military labs and
civilian scientists.

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And they used it to make
lasers, fiber optics,

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:59.680 align:middle line:84%
integrated circuits,
night-vision image goggles,

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:00.775 align:middle line:90%
and bullet-proof vests.

00:17:00.775 --> 00:17:04.520 align:middle line:90%


00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:08.305 align:middle line:10%
A piece of super-strong
metallic cloth, Corso

00:17:08.305 --> 00:17:11.510 align:middle line:10%
contends it may have
protected the alien pilots

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:12.710 align:middle line:10%
in their spacecraft.

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:17.220 align:middle line:90%


00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:21.690 align:middle line:84%
A tube that appears to
shoot a searing red light,

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:24.480 align:middle line:84%
Corso thinks it might
be a surgical instrument

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:25.280 align:middle line:90%
or a weapon.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:28.050 align:middle line:90%


00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:30.750 align:middle line:84%
An alien-made headband
that, according

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:33.210 align:middle line:84%
to his military
reports, might have

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:37.350 align:middle line:84%
been used to transmit thoughts
or control the alien craft.

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:39.990 align:middle line:90%


00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:44.160 align:middle line:84%
An imprinted set of
miniaturized circuits, perhaps

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.260 align:middle line:90%
a prefabricated microcircuit.

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.244 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:48.244 --> 00:17:51.220 align:middle line:90%


00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:54.720 align:middle line:10%
A flexible wire that might
have transmitted light

00:17:54.720 --> 00:18:00.410 align:middle line:10%
through its interior, and a
lens that could allow anyone

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:03.260 align:middle line:10%
to see in the dark,
supposedly taken

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:06.471 align:middle line:10%
from the eye of an alien being.

00:18:06.471 --> 00:18:07.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How much
of that technology

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:10.130 align:middle line:90%
have we perfected today?

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:12.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, we have
high-tenacity fibers.

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:13.920 align:middle line:90%
We have the laser.

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure about the surgical.

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.140 align:middle line:84%
There's a story in the book
that might interest people

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:21.350 align:middle line:84%
about the Russians having the
same, you know, instrument.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And that you could
buy it in Russia.

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:25.597 align:middle line:84%
And American doctors went over
there and tried to buy it.

00:18:25.597 --> 00:18:26.930 align:middle line:90%
And then the Russians sued them.

00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:27.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They pulled it back.

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:28.880 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:30.860 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sure that
whatever happened

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:33.350 align:middle line:90%
here happened also in Russia.

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, of course people
will argue the integrated

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.110 align:middle line:84%
circuit was already
being worked on.

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:40.693 align:middle line:84%
All these things
were being worked on.

00:18:40.693 --> 00:18:44.420 align:middle line:84%
But remember that the Air
Force also has its labs.

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And when you have the Army,
the Air Force, and the Navy--

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:50.900 align:middle line:84%
you know, all in
competition for contracts--

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.090 align:middle line:84%
he says, the competitive
edge of the Army.

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:56.690 align:middle line:84%
So Colonel Corso was
always Army, Army, Army--

00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:58.160 align:middle line:90%
a lot of it, a lot of it.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:01.265 align:middle line:84%
And God knows what there is
that we don't know about.

00:19:01.265 --> 00:19:03.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where do you
think those artifacts--

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.020 align:middle line:84%
the original ones--
might be today?

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:10.100 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Well, I have no idea.

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:11.510 align:middle line:90%
I could never answer that.

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:16.160 align:middle line:84%
But I know that Trudeau and
Corso had a long conversation.

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And they agreed the last one
alive would tell the truth.

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:20.960 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know where
it went from there.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many years, Paola,
of advancement do you think

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:29.870 align:middle line:84%
Corso gave us with the
downed-craft technology--

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:30.740 align:middle line:90%
hundreds of years?

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, at what
point would we have

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.800 align:middle line:84%
had fiber optics, the
ability to, you know,

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:39.050 align:middle line:84%
see in the dark, the
surgical instrument?

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:41.425 align:middle line:84%
I wonder how many years in
advance he gave us technology.

00:19:41.425 --> 00:19:43.175 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, that
would be only a guess

00:19:43.175 --> 00:19:44.270 align:middle line:90%
if I gave you that.

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:47.450 align:middle line:84%
However, can you
imagine, if that's true,

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:50.880 align:middle line:84%
if beings or the
visitors haven't given us

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.330 align:middle line:90%
technology in the past?

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:54.980 align:middle line:84%
How we got to
where we got today,

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:56.510 align:middle line:90%
that's even a bigger question.

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:58.520 align:middle line:90%
Were we downloaded?

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:00.880 align:middle line:10%
And I have a lot of
questions about Tesla,

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.122 align:middle line:10%
and I have a lot of
questions about Einstein.

00:20:03.122 --> 00:20:04.830 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And Edison
and all these people.

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:06.050 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: All these guys.

00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:09.266 align:middle line:10%
You know, I'm wondering,
have we been helped?

00:20:09.266 --> 00:20:10.640 align:middle line:84%
That would be a
whole other show.

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:11.880 align:middle line:90%
I mean, have we been helped?

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:13.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and maybe
it helped indirectly.

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they were able
to send thoughts

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:18.770 align:middle line:90%
into these humans' heads.

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:21.830 align:middle line:84%
So maybe the Einsteins
and the Teslas

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:24.950 align:middle line:84%
weren't directly aware of
an extraterrestrial presence

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:27.450 align:middle line:84%
or intervention but
that it was in there.

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:28.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:29.970 align:middle line:90%
And they seem like geniuses.

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:33.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, one story I will tell
you because of the clip

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:35.540 align:middle line:84%
is when he talked
about that helmet.

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:38.030 align:middle line:90%
He said that was on the being.

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is they
found it on the being.

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:43.920 align:middle line:84%
And the being would
put its hands on the--

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:44.906 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The console.

00:20:44.906 --> 00:20:46.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: --the
console and could

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:48.835 align:middle line:90%
drive the ship with his mind.

00:20:48.835 --> 00:20:51.530 align:middle line:90%


00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And he said that they had
several of those bands.

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:54.764 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't just one.

00:20:54.764 --> 00:20:55.805 align:middle line:90%
He said they had several.

00:20:55.805 --> 00:20:58.600 align:middle line:90%


00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me, the being
and the craft were one.

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And he said, that's an
extraterrestrial biological

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:07.550 align:middle line:84%
entity so that
thing was a clone.

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:08.410 align:middle line:90%
It was a machine.

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:09.260 align:middle line:90%
It was a clone.

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:13.370 align:middle line:84%
He said, what we were worried
about was, who created them?

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:16.700 align:middle line:10%
And, if they look like
us, they could be walking

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:18.230 align:middle line:10%
in the halls of the Pentagon.

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:19.030 align:middle line:10%
And we couldn't--

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:19.560 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And you
wouldn't even know it.

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.090 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: We wouldn't
even know it.

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:22.890 align:middle line:84%
And he was so
concerned about it.

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:28.370 align:middle line:84%
So his vision of the alien
was more of a human, you know,

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:33.560 align:middle line:84%
Star Trekkie vision of beings
creating something to travel

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.540 align:middle line:90%
in space, like the clone.

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And his last words,
even, in the book are,

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.870 align:middle line:84%
we were looking at the
artifacts, the craft.

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:44.990 align:middle line:84%
He said, the biggest gift
they gave us was the being.

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:48.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We are told that there
are many different species

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:49.640 align:middle line:90%
of extraterrestrials.

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Did Colonel Corso ever get
into that, how many there were

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:55.010 align:middle line:90%
and what they were?

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:55.810 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'm glad you asked me that
question because he said 52.

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And then I've been working with
Clifford Stone, and he says 57.

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:05.180 align:middle line:84%
Colonel Corso said there
were 52 different species.

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:06.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Different species?

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:08.600 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: And I asked
Clifford Stone just recently.

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:10.300 align:middle line:10%
I said, why are you saying 57?

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:13.490 align:middle line:10%
And Stone answers me, well,
I had a manual, he said,

00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:14.740 align:middle line:10%
that showed 57.

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:16.790 align:middle line:10%
And when there was
a crash retrieval,

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:19.670 align:middle line:10%
I had to look up the
body of one of these

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:23.070 align:middle line:10%
to see that we didn't kill
them when we went to, you know,

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:23.870 align:middle line:10%
do first aid.

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:26.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, of the 52 or
57, we talk about Nordics,

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:29.360 align:middle line:90%
the Reptilians, the Greys.

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:30.620 align:middle line:90%
How many more could there be?

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:31.421 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:22:31.421 --> 00:22:32.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:34.310 align:middle line:84%
But, George, those are
the boxes we put them in.

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:36.080 align:middle line:90%
The Nordics aren't all Nordics.

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:39.080 align:middle line:84%
The people in South
America are seeing people

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.930 align:middle line:84%
with platinum blonde
hair and brown eyes.

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:43.700 align:middle line:90%
And they are 10 feet tall.

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:45.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's not like a
Nordic you might see,

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:48.780 align:middle line:84%
like a Pleiadian that
would be six feet tall.

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:51.629 align:middle line:84%
It's just like if they came
to this planet and they said,

00:22:51.629 --> 00:22:53.420 align:middle line:84%
there's white people,
there's black people,

00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:54.770 align:middle line:90%
and there's yellow people.

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:58.330 align:middle line:84%
But there are
variations of all these.

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And we tend to put three boxes
of three species, you know?

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:05.220 align:middle line:90%
And there's just all kinds.

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:06.810 align:middle line:90%
Look at the Varginha case.

00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:08.820 align:middle line:84%
Where do you put
that little guy?

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:11.220 align:middle line:90%
In Brazil, he had reddish skin.

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:12.330 align:middle line:90%
He had big eyes.

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:15.070 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, Roger
Leir worked on that case.

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:15.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It looked like
a leprechaun, actually.

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:16.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:21.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's all kinds
of life in the universe.

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.060 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You have had the
incredible ability to have

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:27.810 align:middle line:10%
known incredible people
in the UFO field--

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:32.130 align:middle line:10%
Budd Hopkins, the late Dr.
John Mack, and so many others.

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:37.010 align:middle line:84%
How would you put Philip
Corso in that group?

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:39.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: He's a
real whistle blower.

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:42.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You have no doubts?

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:45.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Whistle blowers are
people that risk their lives--

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:48.315 align:middle line:84%
you know, that
have repercussions

00:23:48.315 --> 00:23:49.115 align:middle line:90%
in their families.

00:23:49.115 --> 00:23:51.950 align:middle line:90%


00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:53.870 align:middle line:84%
Before he died-- and
I wrote about this--

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:57.540 align:middle line:84%
Colonel Corso was very sorry
he even wrote the book.

00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:58.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:23:58.340 --> 00:23:58.880 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:23:59.680 align:middle line:90%
He said, my God.

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.760 align:middle line:90%
He said, I've gotten more--

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was a bestseller.

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:04.186 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: It doesn't matter.

00:24:04.186 --> 00:24:05.660 align:middle line:84%
He said, I've gotten
more criticism

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:07.310 align:middle line:90%
from the UFO community.

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:10.460 align:middle line:84%
He said, I've had to defend
myself everywhere in the United

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:11.520 align:middle line:90%
States, not in Italy.

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:14.090 align:middle line:84%
Italy treated them like
a king because Italy--

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People
didn't believe him?

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: People questioned him.

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:19.100 align:middle line:90%
They didn't believe him.

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:22.640 align:middle line:84%
They went public with
lectures against him.

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:28.300 align:middle line:10%
And then, when Paul
Hellyer came out with--

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.710 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Former Defense
Minster of Canada.

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:34.280 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: 2005, when he
said the famous words

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:38.840 align:middle line:10%
"UFOs are as real as
airplanes over our head,"

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.480 align:middle line:10%
he had done this because he
had read the Corso books.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.580 align:middle line:90%
So people were angry at Paul.

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And Paul told me-- because he's
a very close friend of mine--

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:48.890 align:middle line:84%
you know, Paula, I
was Former Defense

00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:50.990 align:middle line:84%
Minister around the same
time, because McNamara

00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:53.780 align:middle line:84%
was Defense Minister during
the Kennedy administration,

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:55.860 align:middle line:90%
and Paul was during the Trudeau.

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:57.680 align:middle line:90%
And he said, you know, I called.

00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.650 align:middle line:84%
He said, actually,
one of his relatives

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:03.290 align:middle line:84%
had given him the name
of a general here.

00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And he called to ask, of
course, if his book was real.

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And the answer from the military
man was, it's not only real,

00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:11.247 align:middle line:90%
there's more.

00:25:11.247 --> 00:25:12.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:16.130 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And so Paul said,
when I heard that, that has--

00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:19.760 align:middle line:84%
and I agree with this,
this is my philosophy--

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.920 align:middle line:90%
monetary implications.

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:23.780 align:middle line:84%
It has psychological
implications.

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:27.260 align:middle line:84%
It has sociological
implications for Planet Earth.

00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And, actually,
that's my definition

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:33.290 align:middle line:84%
of exopolitics is basically
you can study UFOs.

00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:34.460 align:middle line:90%
But it's not entertainment.

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:38.850 align:middle line:84%
It's all the implications of
the disclosure for the planet--

00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:43.250 align:middle line:84%
the sociological, the
mental, the psychological.

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:45.470 align:middle line:84%
We have to rewrite our
whole entire history.

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:47.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was there any time
during these conversations

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:53.670 align:middle line:84%
with Colonel Corso that you
recorded, did you think,

00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:55.140 align:middle line:90%
I don't know about this guy?

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:58.040 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Never, never.

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:02.660 align:middle line:84%
The only thing, I felt bad for
him because he was very sorry.

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:04.960 align:middle line:90%
He did, you know--

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He regretted
doing what he did.

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:08.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah,
especially in Korea.

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:12.290 align:middle line:84%
He was he was a
military man in Korea.

00:26:12.290 --> 00:26:13.370 align:middle line:90%
He explained the war.

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:18.452 align:middle line:84%
He explained Douglas MacArthur's
decision to stop the war.

00:26:18.452 --> 00:26:20.660 align:middle line:84%
He said, they made a killer
and a predator out of me.

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:22.870 align:middle line:84%
He says, I was
basically a military man

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:25.830 align:middle line:90%
that thought I was doing right.

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:28.010 align:middle line:84%
But it was really interesting
because, at the end

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:33.320 align:middle line:84%
of the book, he gives four
possibilities for our planet.

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:35.167 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is
we destroy ourselves,

00:26:35.167 --> 00:26:36.500 align:middle line:90%
that we could destroy ourselves.

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:37.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that could
be high on the list.

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:38.380 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:40.520 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you
know, I never looked

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:43.220 align:middle line:84%
at the spiritual
implications of this.

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:45.200 align:middle line:84%
He didn't see them
as enemies, but he

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.120 align:middle line:84%
had to treat the
beings as enemies

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:48.260 align:middle line:90%
because that was his job.

00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:49.801 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you
had just described

00:26:49.801 --> 00:26:53.420 align:middle line:84%
what Corso was like when he
looked in that little casket

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:54.515 align:middle line:90%
and saw one of the beings.

00:26:54.515 --> 00:26:57.280 align:middle line:90%


00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:00.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CORSO: Well, the head
really wasn't that big.

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:02.360 align:middle line:84%
But in portion to the
body-- a small body--

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:05.100 align:middle line:90%
it looked big and the eyes.

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:07.075 align:middle line:84%
There was no nose or
anything like that.

00:27:07.075 --> 00:27:09.130 align:middle line:90%
It had spindly legs.

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:11.770 align:middle line:84%
So that was about it because
I didn't have any autopsies.

00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:14.200 align:middle line:10%
And I just put it off
because I figured, well,

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.690 align:middle line:10%
maybe some day I'll get
corroboration and be

00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:17.840 align:middle line:10%
able to evaluate.

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:21.370 align:middle line:10%
Later, I got my hands
on the autopsy reports--

00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:23.600 align:middle line:10%
in 1961 when I took charge
of the Foreign Technology

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.750 align:middle line:10%
Division--

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:28.240 align:middle line:10%
from Walter Reed Hospital,
our own laboratory.

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.680 align:middle line:84%
So there I started
putting it all together.

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:34.030 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERVIEWER: What did you
read in the autopsy reports?

00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:37.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CORSO: Well, the
nature of the body inside

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:39.967 align:middle line:84%
because, before
that, I never knew.

00:27:39.967 --> 00:27:40.800 align:middle line:90%
They did an autopsy.

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And they cut it open,
all the brain and all.

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And the brain was different,
and most of the body

00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:49.480 align:middle line:90%
was different--

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:55.410 align:middle line:84%
no nose, no mouth, no
ears, no vocal cords,

00:27:55.410 --> 00:28:01.186 align:middle line:84%
no digestive system,
no sex organs.

00:28:01.186 --> 00:28:02.560 align:middle line:84%
So then we came
to the conclusion

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.120 align:middle line:90%
that it was a humanoid clone.

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:08.090 align:middle line:90%


00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:11.887 align:middle line:84%
And, as I say,
when I saw the body

00:28:11.887 --> 00:28:13.220 align:middle line:90%
there was nothing else to go on.

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:14.780 align:middle line:84%
Later on, well,
I got the autopsy

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:19.280 align:middle line:90%
reports that experts had done.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's believable.

00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:23.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Why would he ever
make, at 83 years old--

00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:24.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who would make that up?

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:25.677 align:middle line:90%
Who would make that up?

00:28:25.677 --> 00:28:27.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I mean, people
aren't using logic.

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:32.160 align:middle line:84%
The biggest criticism I have is
a lot of this stuff is logical.

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:33.020 align:middle line:90%
It's not belief.

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:35.640 align:middle line:90%


00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:36.600 align:middle line:90%
UFOs are real.

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:39.570 align:middle line:90%
It's not a religion.

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:42.360 align:middle line:84%
If people would
use logic and they

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:46.966 align:middle line:84%
would look at the reasoning,
the intention of the people--

00:28:46.966 --> 00:28:47.766 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:28:47.766 --> 00:28:51.620 align:middle line:84%
You know, that was the time--
you asked me the importance--

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:53.370 align:middle line:84%
that I realized why
the secret was secret.

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:55.200 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was because
the Vatican didn't want it.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.370 align:middle line:90%
I thought it was religion.

00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:58.210 align:middle line:10%
I thought it was
they were so bad.

00:28:58.210 --> 00:29:00.630 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You since found out
the Vatican doesn't care.

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:01.165 align:middle line:90%
They don't want to hide it.

00:29:01.165 --> 00:29:01.965 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No!

00:29:01.965 --> 00:29:03.010 align:middle line:90%
It's about money.

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:03.810 align:middle line:90%
It's about--

00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:04.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Power?

00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:06.789 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: --power, free energy.

00:29:06.789 --> 00:29:08.580 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're talking
about a little pen.

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:11.970 align:middle line:84%
But I'm sure they figured
out that that craft doesn't

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:13.960 align:middle line:90%
use gas or oil.

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:14.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:17.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And, you know,
Doctor Steven Greer is my hero.

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:19.440 align:middle line:90%
And I will say this publicly.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:22.495 align:middle line:84%
And when he says we had the
technology in the 1950s--

00:29:22.495 --> 00:29:24.870 align:middle line:84%
we could solve all the world's
problems-- he's not lying.

00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:25.870 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:27.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you can't
make money with that.

00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:28.700 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No.

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:33.330 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, we have to
finish one era of fossil

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:36.150 align:middle line:90%
before this other era.

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:38.340 align:middle line:84%
But this other era
could come out too late.

00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:39.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they
have to figure out,

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:41.460 align:middle line:84%
how do you make
cash on free energy?

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:43.590 align:middle line:84%
How do you make
money on free energy?

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:45.570 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: You know,
that's what I always say.

00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:47.610 align:middle line:84%
Your free energy's
not going to be free.

00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:51.230 align:middle line:84%
But it might save
our ecological.

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:53.820 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm working with
Latin American contactees now.

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:56.580 align:middle line:90%
And I've been in Chile.

00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And I've been in,
you know, Argentina.

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And I've been all
over Latin America.

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:03.040 align:middle line:84%
And the message is
coming from the beings

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:06.300 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to have
an ecological disaster,

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:07.890 align:middle line:90%
and it's going to happen soon.

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going, OK,
well, that makes sense.

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:13.320 align:middle line:84%
Are people even paying
attention to the fact

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:17.210 align:middle line:90%
that this planet is changing?

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a lot
of stuff about that.

00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:22.730 align:middle line:84%
And Colonel Corso did have
a contact with a being

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:25.950 align:middle line:84%
when he was the head
of a missile battalion.

00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:27.740 align:middle line:84%
It's in the beginning
of the book.

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:31.190 align:middle line:84%
It is an interview he
gave me in Roswell.

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:33.290 align:middle line:84%
When he came into my
room, he sat down.

00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:34.940 align:middle line:90%
And he took a little napkin.

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I
had this encounter

00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:40.040 align:middle line:84%
with this being
in 1957, he said,

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:44.630 align:middle line:84%
who couldn't take off
because the radars were on.

00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:46.660 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I saw this craft.

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:47.690 align:middle line:90%
And I walked out to it.

00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:49.740 align:middle line:84%
I saw the being come
out of the cave.

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:51.110 align:middle line:90%
Colonel Corso was Italian.

00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:51.920 align:middle line:90%
He was Sicilian.

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:53.430 align:middle line:90%
He pulls out his gun.

00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:54.870 align:middle line:90%
He points it at the being.

00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:55.966 align:middle line:90%
He says, friend or foe?

00:30:55.966 --> 00:30:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And he says, Paola,
guess what he said?

00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:59.120 align:middle line:90%
And I said, he said neither.

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.495 align:middle line:84%
And he said, that's
what he said.

00:31:00.495 --> 00:31:01.295 align:middle line:90%
And he said--

00:31:01.295 --> 00:31:03.046 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would melt
the gun in his hand.

00:31:03.046 --> 00:31:04.378 align:middle line:90%
That's what he should have done.

00:31:04.378 --> 00:31:06.650 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: The being said,
please shut down your radars

00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:08.150 align:middle line:90%
so I could go.

00:31:08.150 --> 00:31:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And Colonel Corso
said they were ordered

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.530 align:middle line:84%
to shut down their
radars there anyway

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:15.101 align:middle line:84%
at certain parts of the
day, but he hadn't done it.

00:31:15.101 --> 00:31:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And he said, what do
you have to offer me?

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:18.099 align:middle line:90%
And you've heard this, George.

00:31:18.099 --> 00:31:20.880 align:middle line:84%
The being mentally said, "a
new world, if you can take it."

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right, "if
you can take it."

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:24.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So he
writes this down.

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And you want to know
what Paola Harris did?

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:29.750 align:middle line:84%
She wouldn't print that story,
even though he gave it to me--

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:31.970 align:middle line:84%
and I could almost
cry about this--

00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:35.660 align:middle line:84%
because I thought, if I printed
the story, that his credibility

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:37.340 align:middle line:90%
would be damaged.

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:39.616 align:middle line:84%
And he gave it to me, even
the napkin that he wrote.

00:31:39.616 --> 00:31:41.990 align:middle line:84%
Paola, do you know what "a
new world, if you can take it"

00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:43.070 align:middle line:90%
means?

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I have
no idea, Colonel.

00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:46.100 align:middle line:90%
But I don't want this story.

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:48.230 align:middle line:10%
I don't want contact
because, in those days,

00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:49.409 align:middle line:10%
I stayed away from that.

00:31:49.409 --> 00:31:51.200 align:middle line:84%
I said, give me the
back engineering story.

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.760 align:middle line:90%
That's all I want.

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:56.060 align:middle line:90%
And that shows my censorship.

00:31:56.060 --> 00:32:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And I will confess I was really
sad until after he died, which

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:03.890 align:middle line:84%
was two years later,
and we printed the story

00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:06.890 align:middle line:84%
with all the images,
which I have in my book.

00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:09.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you familiar with
the story of Valiant Thor?

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:10.070 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you think of that?

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:11.900 align:middle line:90%
Do you think it's real?

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:12.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:14.700 align:middle line:10%
And the only reason
I think it's a real--

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:19.340 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: This, by the way, is an
extraterrestrial from Venus who

00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:23.000 align:middle line:10%
came here during the
Eisenhower administration,

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.540 align:middle line:10%
wanted to meet and give
us vital information.

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And we decided we're not
going to talk to the guy.

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I have had to do
extensive research about this,

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:36.650 align:middle line:84%
because I started researching
all the human-type aliens

00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:40.580 align:middle line:84%
from the Giant Rock group,
from Menger, from Van Tassel,

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:42.050 align:middle line:90%
and Adamski and so forth.

00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:44.600 align:middle line:10%
As I'm doing that research and
I'm going to those places--

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:47.120 align:middle line:10%
you know, I went to Giant Rock,
I talked to the people that

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:51.060 align:middle line:10%
knew Van Tassel, I brought
people back out there

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:51.890 align:middle line:10%
and so forth--

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:53.210 align:middle line:10%
I studied Howard Menger.

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And a friend of mine has
photos of Howard Menger

00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:02.570 align:middle line:84%
with these beings that were in
the Wendelle Stevens collection

00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:03.770 align:middle line:90%
that he has.

00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And Val Thor is one of
the people sitting under

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:11.999 align:middle line:90%
the orchard in Howard Menger's--

00:33:11.999 --> 00:33:13.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He looks human, right?

00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:15.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: He's got
three of them with him.

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.910 align:middle line:90%
He's got Jill, the woman.

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:18.410 align:middle line:90%
And he's got Donn, his brother.

00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:20.330 align:middle line:84%
And he's sitting
there taking notes.

00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:24.590 align:middle line:84%
We were even able
to look at the notes

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:26.240 align:middle line:90%
to see what he was writing.

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:29.750 align:middle line:10%
And I have the audio tape
of August Roberts, who

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:31.760 align:middle line:10%
was the photographer,
who's talking

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:33.950 align:middle line:10%
to Wendelle Stevens,
who I consider the best

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:38.240 align:middle line:10%
researcher in the world because
he did the whole entire planet.

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:39.935 align:middle line:84%
He didn't do the
American situation.

00:33:39.935 --> 00:33:41.570 align:middle line:90%
He did South America.

00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And I have the audio tape where
the photographer's saying,

00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:47.570 align:middle line:84%
well, I'm walking
around this orchard.

00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And Menger tells me
there are three ETs,

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:52.970 align:middle line:84%
but I've got to guess who they
are because he won't tell me

00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:53.390 align:middle line:90%
who they are.

00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And he says, these
two were overdressed.

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:56.754 align:middle line:90%
These three were overdressed.

00:33:56.754 --> 00:33:57.920 align:middle line:90%
And they were sitting there.

00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:59.337 align:middle line:84%
And he took those
famous pictures.

00:33:59.337 --> 00:34:00.878 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
clearly look human.

00:34:00.878 --> 00:34:01.679 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:34:01.679 --> 00:34:03.511 align:middle line:84%
But they're not dressed
like everybody else,

00:34:03.511 --> 00:34:04.650 align:middle line:90%
because this is an orchard.

00:34:04.650 --> 00:34:07.118 align:middle line:84%
And everybody is very,
you know, casual.

00:34:07.118 --> 00:34:08.659 align:middle line:84%
And these guys,
they've got suits on.

00:34:08.659 --> 00:34:11.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why did we
refuse to meet with Thor?

00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:15.050 align:middle line:84%
Why did our government
not want to get involved--

00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:16.295 align:middle line:90%
publicly, at least?

00:34:16.295 --> 00:34:18.170 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, the only
thing I can tell you

00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:21.144 align:middle line:84%
is what Frank Stranges says, who
was "Stranger at the Pentagon."

00:34:21.144 --> 00:34:22.310 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: He wrote the story.

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:23.726 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: Yeah,
he told the story.

00:34:23.726 --> 00:34:29.239 align:middle line:10%
Frank Stranges said that,
when Valiant Thor approached

00:34:29.239 --> 00:34:32.449 align:middle line:10%
President Eisenhower
and told him

00:34:32.449 --> 00:34:35.429 align:middle line:10%
not only that we
could live longer,

00:34:35.429 --> 00:34:38.670 align:middle line:10%
that we should change the way
we think, Eisenhower said,

00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:40.020 align:middle line:10%
it's out of my hands.

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:44.460 align:middle line:84%
The whole entire idea
of changing, you know,

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:46.590 align:middle line:84%
the way we eat, the way
we live, and so forth is

00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:48.989 align:middle line:84%
in the hands of the
pharmaceutical industry.

00:34:48.989 --> 00:34:50.409 align:middle line:90%
And it would go down.

00:34:50.409 --> 00:34:54.270 align:middle line:84%
In other words, our
economy is built

00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:57.690 align:middle line:84%
on the pharmaceutical
industry, the war industry,

00:34:57.690 --> 00:34:58.740 align:middle line:90%
and different industry.

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:00.580 align:middle line:90%
It's about money.

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:02.460 align:middle line:84%
It's about that it's
already in place.

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And, to destroy that at a
time-- which was the 1950s--

00:35:06.210 --> 00:35:07.011 align:middle line:90%
it'd be impossible.

00:35:07.011 --> 00:35:07.810 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:09.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they rejected
him because of that.

00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:12.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: He
couldn't do anything.

00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:15.210 align:middle line:84%
Apart from anything, I'm
convinced the president really

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:17.704 align:middle line:84%
has no real power
to do a whole bunch.

00:35:17.704 --> 00:35:18.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't think so?

00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:19.670 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No.

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:21.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Eisenhower,
what could he do?

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:22.625 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember his last speech?

00:35:22.625 --> 00:35:24.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, about the
military industrial complex?

00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:26.825 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: He said, beware of
the military industrial complex.

00:35:26.825 --> 00:35:27.908 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He warned people.

00:35:27.908 --> 00:35:28.880 align:middle line:90%
He warned everybody.

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:34.050 align:middle line:84%
Jacques Vallée, the researcher,
claims that most of these ETs

00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:37.357 align:middle line:84%
are interdimensional,
not physical.

00:35:37.357 --> 00:35:38.440 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:40.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I think that
he's absolutely right.

00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And so is John Keel,
"Mothman Prophecies."

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:47.280 align:middle line:84%
You know, George, I'm
glad you bring this up,

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:49.410 align:middle line:84%
because people should
be reading this stuff.

00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:51.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, not everything
is on internet.

00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:55.200 align:middle line:84%
All Jacques Vallée's books,
he calls it a dimensionality

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.100 align:middle line:90%
or phenomenology.

00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:59.250 align:middle line:10%
And Grant Cameron
talks about this, too,

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:01.390 align:middle line:10%
because I have long
conversations with Grant.

00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:03.630 align:middle line:10%
I think he's amazing.

00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:05.970 align:middle line:10%
It is all connected.

00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:09.270 align:middle line:10%
Even Hynek said to me,
Paola, even though you're

00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:12.180 align:middle line:10%
studying nuts and bolts,
there's a lot connected

00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:13.680 align:middle line:10%
with the paranormal.

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:17.580 align:middle line:84%
Do not throw the baby
out with the bathwater.

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:18.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, he was right.

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:19.600 align:middle line:90%
He was right.

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:22.980 align:middle line:84%
But it took him a long
time to learn that

00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:25.740 align:middle line:84%
and to get to that point
because Hynek, of course,

00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:28.066 align:middle line:84%
was the skeptic with
Project Blue Book.

00:36:28.066 --> 00:36:29.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And he
was a scientist!

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:30.315 align:middle line:90%
He was an astronomer.

00:36:30.315 --> 00:36:32.580 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine an
astronomer looking up there

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:34.860 align:middle line:84%
going, well, you know,
those aren't all stars?

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:37.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But afterwards
he changed, didn't he?

00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:38.610 align:middle line:90%
He changed in a big way.

00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:39.960 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: We all did.

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:40.890 align:middle line:90%
We all did.

00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:42.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you started
investigating this

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:49.450 align:middle line:84%
as an investigator, was
there a wow moment for you

00:36:49.450 --> 00:36:53.140 align:middle line:84%
where something just hit
you like a burst of light

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:57.470 align:middle line:84%
and you went, oh my
god, this is real?

00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:59.090 align:middle line:90%
Did that ever hit you like that?

00:36:59.090 --> 00:37:00.090 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I'm a teacher.

00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And I have a master's
in education.

00:37:01.650 --> 00:37:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And being with Hynek, I knew
it was real because Hynek

00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:06.250 align:middle line:90%
was an astronomer.

00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:07.230 align:middle line:90%
He was a scientist.

00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:08.890 align:middle line:90%
And I used to travel with him.

00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:09.690 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:12.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: During his Project
Blue Book days or after?

00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:13.590 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: After,
when he did CUFOS--

00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:15.300 align:middle line:90%
Center for UFO Studies.

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:18.520 align:middle line:84%
Both Don Schmitt and
I were part of CUFOS.

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:21.960 align:middle line:84%
Hynek thought-- and I don't
know if I believe this anymore--

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:24.540 align:middle line:84%
that, if you could
prove it scientifically,

00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:26.270 align:middle line:90%
you could make people believe.

00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:28.245 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I
think he was right.

00:37:28.245 --> 00:37:29.120 align:middle line:90%
I think he was right.

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:31.830 align:middle line:90%
People tend to believe science.

00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:36.720 align:middle line:84%
They don't tend to believe
hearsay or speculation.

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:39.750 align:middle line:84%
What I like about you as
an investigator is you're

00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:41.190 align:middle line:90%
a no-nonsense person.

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:43.170 align:middle line:84%
You don't joke about
things like this.

00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:45.090 align:middle line:90%
You get to the nuts and bolts.

00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:46.680 align:middle line:90%
And you want answers.

00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And you don't stop
until you get them.

00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:52.060 align:middle line:84%
You're a female
bulldog, you know?

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, for
people in our field,

00:37:55.830 --> 00:38:00.410 align:middle line:84%
I appreciate that
because, if you say it,

00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:04.250 align:middle line:84%
that saves me from mounds and
mounds of work, and research

00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:05.810 align:middle line:90%
that I'd have to do.

00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:07.310 align:middle line:90%
You've already done it.

00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:10.490 align:middle line:84%
But there aren't a lot of people
like you Paola, unfortunately.

00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:12.080 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, you
know, I ask myself

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:14.490 align:middle line:84%
why I'm driven to do
this, because you ask me

00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:15.340 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:17.900 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
I have a choice.

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:19.160 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that weird?

00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:21.620 align:middle line:84%
I think that, at
some given point,

00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:23.720 align:middle line:90%
I was given an assignment.

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:29.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So let me ask you
this as we wrap this up.

00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:33.120 align:middle line:84%
We assume that Philip
Corso is telling the truth.

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:34.170 align:middle line:90%
You believe he is--

00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:34.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Oh, yeah.

00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:37.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --so I believe he is.

00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:39.560 align:middle line:84%
But what's the end
game here, Paola?

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:43.350 align:middle line:90%
Why is this all happening?

00:38:43.350 --> 00:38:45.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I don't have a
real answer for that, George.

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:48.840 align:middle line:84%
I think that what
has to happen here

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:50.880 align:middle line:90%
is that humanity has to change.

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And we can't have any
dialogue with any ET

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:56.130 align:middle line:90%
out there unless we grow up.

00:38:56.130 --> 00:39:01.170 align:middle line:84%
They basically want
us to realize we

00:39:01.170 --> 00:39:03.090 align:middle line:90%
are part of a greater universe.

00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And they can't
talk to us as long

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.730 align:middle line:84%
as we don't see
that consciousness

00:39:08.730 --> 00:39:10.259 align:middle line:90%
component we have.

00:39:10.259 --> 00:39:11.550 align:middle line:90%
We are not just skin and bones.

00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:14.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've done so
many shows on all of it.

00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:16.990 align:middle line:90%
We are divine beings.

00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:19.980 align:middle line:84%
Like Monsignor Balducci, used to
say, why would God just create

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:22.030 align:middle line:84%
a planet with a bunch
of people and that's it?

00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:24.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And, as William Henry
says, we're light beings.

00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:39:25.470 --> 00:39:26.580 align:middle line:90%
We are so much more.

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:29.160 align:middle line:90%
And when we can go up a notch--

00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:30.840 align:middle line:84%
and maybe that's
the mission that you

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:34.890 align:middle line:84%
say-- when we can go up a notch
in consciousness is once they

00:39:34.890 --> 00:39:36.065 align:middle line:90%
can come and talk to us.

00:39:36.065 --> 00:39:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And there's another
component-- and you're probably

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:40.800 align:middle line:84%
studying that-- when we
go out into the stars,

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:44.100 align:middle line:84%
because right now we're
stuck on this planet.

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And we can't do what Gene
Roddenberry wanted us to do,

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:50.790 align:middle line:84%
to go among the planets and meet
our cousins and do all that.

00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:55.500 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm doing is just
archiving the whistle blowers,

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:56.400 align:middle line:90%
the real people.

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:58.066 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed
everybody in the world.

00:39:58.066 --> 00:39:59.360 align:middle line:90%
I have five books.

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And, on all different levels,
I have the audio tapes

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:04.320 align:middle line:90%
of all these people.

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully this subject
will not be ridiculed.

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:09.930 align:middle line:84%
It will be in a
university some day.

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And they'll find my books and
the audiotapes of the people.

00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:15.180 align:middle line:90%
So where's the end game?

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:16.720 align:middle line:90%
It's about us.

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:17.730 align:middle line:90%
It's about us.

00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:19.689 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Will we get disclosure?

00:40:19.689 --> 00:40:21.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, I think
we already have it.

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:22.280 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:24.990 align:middle line:84%
For me, the president
doesn't need to say anything.

00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:26.820 align:middle line:84%
When I'm talking
to pilots in France

00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:28.500 align:middle line:84%
about what they
saw and I'm talking

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:30.750 align:middle line:84%
to all these people
in different countries

00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:34.294 align:middle line:84%
about what they experienced
and military people,

00:40:34.294 --> 00:40:35.460 align:middle line:90%
you know, that's disclosure.

00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:37.649 align:middle line:84%
What do you want, just
the president to say it?

00:40:37.649 --> 00:40:38.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What more do you need?

00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:40.800 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: I mean, if
the president says it,

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:43.200 align:middle line:10%
then everybody's going
to wonder why he said it.

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:46.110 align:middle line:10%
So, you know, maybe some day.

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:47.820 align:middle line:10%
But I don't think
that will happen, only

00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:51.030 align:middle line:10%
because of the vested
interest, again,

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:53.380 align:middle line:10%
in the technology that we have.

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:54.750 align:middle line:10%
There's a vested interest.

00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:57.780 align:middle line:10%
I mean, people will ask,
when you had these crashes,

00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:00.410 align:middle line:10%
did you throw everything away?

00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:02.180 align:middle line:90%
And the answer, you know, is no.

00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:04.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Paola, thanks for
being on Beyond Belief.

00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:05.819 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Thank you, George.

00:41:05.819 --> 00:41:07.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know,
there are many mysteries

00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:09.140 align:middle line:90%
in this universe.

00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And one big mystery
is, are we alone?

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:15.290 align:middle line:10%
Walter Sullivan, the late New
York Times science writer,

00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:18.260 align:middle line:10%
wrote a book called
that, "We Are Not Alone,"

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:22.340 align:middle line:10%
where he concluded that there
are many civilizations out

00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:26.150 align:middle line:10%
there in the cosmos
looking for the same thing,

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:31.260 align:middle line:10%
looking for that answer to
the question, why are we here?

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:32.127 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:41:32.127 --> 00:41:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And thanks for
watching Beyond Belief.

00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:36.160 align:middle line:90%
