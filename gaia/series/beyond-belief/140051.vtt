>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief," I'm

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:21.430 align:middle line:90%
George Noory.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.870 align:middle line:10%
Did you know that in
our entire lifetime,

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.990 align:middle line:10%
everything is recorded
into a book of records

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.320 align:middle line:10%
called the Akashic Records?

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.520 align:middle line:84%
Bill Foss is an
internationally renowned expert

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.110 align:middle line:90%
on the Akashic Records.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.240 align:middle line:10%
As a matter of fact,
his book, "Journey

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.260 align:middle line:10%
to the Akashic Records"
is a huge bestseller,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.550 align:middle line:10%
and it deals with us.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.810 align:middle line:90%
It deals with our lives.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.580 align:middle line:84%
Bill, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.290 align:middle line:10%
>>BILL FOSS: Great
to be here, George.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.210 align:middle line:10%
The Akashic Records
is basically,

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.760 align:middle line:10%
it's a storehouse
in the upper ethers

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.030 align:middle line:10%
of the planet that since
the beginnings of creation

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.110 align:middle line:10%
was put there, place there
by God for all of the souls

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.280 align:middle line:10%
that journey from other
star systems to the Earth

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.590 align:middle line:10%
to start having their
Earthly experiences,

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.550 align:middle line:10%
as well as a place where
when a soul comes down

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:13.130 align:middle line:10%
to reincarnate in physical form,
that they can journey back up

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.620 align:middle line:10%
and see what they
need to work on.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.000 align:middle line:84%
See what their
soul's purpose is,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.850 align:middle line:84%
their life's path,
and all the things

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.440 align:middle line:90%
that they want to experience.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And every individual
has these personal records

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.280 align:middle line:90%
there?

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.540 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Absolutely.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I visualize
a little old man

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.130 align:middle line:84%
up there with a fountain
pen or a quill feather,

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.030 align:middle line:84%
writing things in, like when
George was six, he did this.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.860 align:middle line:90%
When he was 10, he did this.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.010 align:middle line:90%
Is it that way?

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.920 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: Some people
see it that way,

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.140 align:middle line:84%
and other people will
see the archangels,

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.590 align:middle line:84%
some people will see family
members or ascended masters.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And it happens that way,
George, because our mind

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.760 align:middle line:84%
and our light body
or higher selves

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.320 align:middle line:90%
experience archetypal imagery.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.050 align:middle line:84%
The way that God can
connect psychically with us,

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.050 align:middle line:84%
and we have that experience,
that's the way it works.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bill, when people
have this information put

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.620 align:middle line:84%
into the records, when they
die, is there somebody there

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.130 align:middle line:84%
that just says, OK,
Bill, or George,

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.510 align:middle line:84%
these are the things
you did in your life.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.710 align:middle line:90%
These are the good things.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:23.510 align:middle line:90%
These are the bad.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.340 align:middle line:90%
Is it like that?

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.360 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: It is, George.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And even when we
start our transition

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.560 align:middle line:90%
or our passing while we're in--

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.200 align:middle line:84%
when we're leaving
the human experience,

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.260 align:middle line:90%
the veils start to move back.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And so you're in
that eternal moment

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.380 align:middle line:84%
where your past, present,
and future become one.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And you start to tap to your
greatest triumphs in life.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.290 align:middle line:90%
You realize these in the moment.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.770 align:middle line:90%
Your missed opportunities.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.350 align:middle line:84%
Things that--
unfinished business.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And then we're taken
up into the records,

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.859 align:middle line:90%
and it is a lot like childbirth.

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.650 align:middle line:84%
You know, it can be a
traumatic experience.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.690 align:middle line:84%
That's why there
are guides with us.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.240 align:middle line:84%
Even though it's a divinely
guided and spiritual part

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.414 align:middle line:84%
of our lives, these guides
will basically nurture you.

00:03:13.414 --> 00:03:15.830 align:middle line:84%
And they'll be right with you
and say, hey, you know what?

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.500 align:middle line:90%
This is your experience.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.130 align:middle line:90%
Everything's going to be OK.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.290 align:middle line:90%
We gotcha.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.420 align:middle line:84%
They're going to lead
you up, and they're going

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.860 align:middle line:90%
to start working with you.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do the
records ever change?

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.580 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: They can.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:29.570 align:middle line:90%
They can.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.620 align:middle line:84%
A lot of psychics will
read an individual

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.320 align:middle line:84%
based on where they're
at in their life,

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.600 align:middle line:84%
and they can project from
that point forward and say,

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.370 align:middle line:84%
well, this is probably
going to happen,

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:41.750 align:middle line:90%
and that's going to happen.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.550 align:middle line:84%
The records work the same
way, but they work more

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.610 align:middle line:90%
on a life lesson basis.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.220 align:middle line:84%
So if you want real
information that's

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.920 align:middle line:84%
long range, that affects
all of the small things that

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.507 align:middle line:84%
happen in life, then
go to the records.

00:03:54.507 --> 00:03:56.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
go to the records?

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.660 align:middle line:90%
How can we access these records?

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.090 align:middle line:90%
Do we have to die to do this?

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.630 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: No.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:00.450 align:middle line:90%
No, that's--

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.313 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Thank God.

00:04:01.313 --> 00:04:03.780 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: [LAUGHS] That's
a great question.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.620 align:middle line:84%
We're all-- we have a stream
of consciousness that's

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.370 align:middle line:84%
connected up through our
soul field into the records.

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.800 align:middle line:84%
Each and every one of
us, you and I right now,

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.140 align:middle line:84%
are connected into the
records, and this is being

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.390 align:middle line:90%
input into our books of life.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.600 align:middle line:90%
So we are always inputting.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.230 align:middle line:84%
When we learn to access
during our lifetime,

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.650 align:middle line:84%
this is of great
importance, because then we

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.390 align:middle line:90%
can do all sorts of work.

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.910 align:middle line:84%
We can do clearing,
we can do healing.

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.330 align:middle line:84%
We can manifest a better
future for ourselves.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who
develops the ability

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.770 align:middle line:90%
to put these into the record?

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.450 align:middle line:84%
Are we doing it as individuals,
or is there an assigned spirit

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:45.470 align:middle line:90%
that puts these in?

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.470 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: We are literally
doing it naturally

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.170 align:middle line:84%
in every moment with our
thoughts, words, and deeds.

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And our spirit guides
are the liaison.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.850 align:middle line:84%
Whoever the ambassadors to
your soul that you have,

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.850 align:middle line:90%
which is a whole other topic.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.870 align:middle line:84%
But the spirit guides,
they help you to input,

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.760 align:middle line:84%
and there are keepers
of the records that

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:08.900 align:middle line:90%
are overseeing this.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.570 align:middle line:84%
There are ancient
Elohim Master Angels

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.550 align:middle line:84%
that are placed in
the records that

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.550 align:middle line:84%
are quite different
than, let's say,

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.700 align:middle line:84%
the archangels or the other
angels in the angelic realm.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:26.790 align:middle line:84%
And their job is to oversee
and to work with your soul.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will Mother
Teresa's Akashic Records

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:35.580 align:middle line:84%
look different from, let's
say, a serial killer's Akashic

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.080 align:middle line:90%
Records?

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.080 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yes and no.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.080 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And I say that because
they could both be

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.710 align:middle line:90%
working on the aspect of love.

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.180 align:middle line:90%
They could both be--

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.330 align:middle line:84%
one would be world teacher,
the other soul-- we

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.370 align:middle line:90%
know that all souls are divine.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.990 align:middle line:84%
So now, those two souls may
not be at the same level.

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.657 align:middle line:84%
That one soul that's
the serial killer--

00:06:01.657 --> 00:06:03.239 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Obviously
they're not, right?

00:06:03.239 --> 00:06:04.250 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: [LAUGHS] Right.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.100 align:middle line:84%
The serial killer,
now, he could have also

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:12.550 align:middle line:84%
had very kind and very
loving or not so dramatic

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.830 align:middle line:84%
lifetimes prior to,
and there is something

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:22.460 align:middle line:84%
that he is learning about the
genuineness and the importance

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.950 align:middle line:90%
of human life, death, and love.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:30.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are the records made to
make us better in another life?

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:31.350 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yes.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:40.150 align:middle line:84%
We are always-- the soul, the
body and the senses, the mind,

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.000 align:middle line:84%
the physical reality
is our platform

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.550 align:middle line:90%
of observation for the soul.

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And every time we come down
and incarnate into human form,

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.530 align:middle line:84%
we are having
sensory experiences.

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:57.190 align:middle line:84%
We are taking this in, which
is accessible through our body

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:00.700 align:middle line:84%
soul, through the DNA, and
through our soul field, which

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.620 align:middle line:90%
has the celestial soul.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So as you
talk about souls,

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.260 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about body
souls for centuries

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.520 align:middle line:90%
and exactly what this means.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.600 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about this.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.710 align:middle line:84%
This looks like a
doorway to life.

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:13.510 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yes.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:15.890 align:middle line:84%
This represents like
a hidden doorway.

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:18.760 align:middle line:84%
So there you see the trees
and nature of reality.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.470 align:middle line:84%
Right in the middle,
there's a doorway.

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:24.010 align:middle line:84%
So there is a doorway
through the soul--

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:26.410 align:middle line:84%
the body soul, the
celestial soul--

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:29.050 align:middle line:90%
that moves up into the records.

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:31.260 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is a two-way doorway.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.810 align:middle line:84%
Information and energy
is moving upwards.

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:36.850 align:middle line:84%
There's an upload
and a download stream

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:38.130 align:middle line:90%
happening at the same time.

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:39.671 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
say two-way, to me,

00:07:39.671 --> 00:07:42.222 align:middle line:84%
that means there's some inner
communication back and forth.

00:07:42.222 --> 00:07:43.180 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: That's correct.

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:43.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that what that is?

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.130 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yes.

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And how can somebody
utilize something like this

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:51.430 align:middle line:84%
to go through that
doorway in the right way?

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.260 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: It's multispectral.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:59.710 align:middle line:84%
It's the type of study that
once you go through the practice

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.990 align:middle line:84%
that we talk about in
the international classes

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:05.530 align:middle line:84%
and the book, and you have
the experience of moving up

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:07.894 align:middle line:84%
into the records, once
you practice this,

00:08:07.894 --> 00:08:09.310 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
get-- you're going

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:12.760 align:middle line:84%
to get visionary experiences
of your past lifetimes.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.960 align:middle line:84%
You're going to start to
see parts of who you are.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.430 align:middle line:84%
And then from that
point, you're going

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:21.040 align:middle line:84%
to notice that
energy just starts

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.980 align:middle line:84%
moving through your
body, your energy fields.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.690 align:middle line:90%
You can have physical healings.

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:31.090 align:middle line:84%
You can have karmic clearings
or different situations.

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:34.600 align:middle line:84%
You can have family healings,
interpersonal relationships

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.440 align:middle line:90%
become healed.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.690 align:middle line:84%
All sorts of very
interesting dynamics

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:39.309 align:middle line:84%
start to happen
from this practice.

00:08:39.309 --> 00:08:41.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's almost like
walking into another dimension,

00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:41.789 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:42.669 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: It is.

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:46.120 align:middle line:84%
It really will change
a person's world.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk about
energetic light languages

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.610 align:middle line:84%
and the importance
of all of this.

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:52.630 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yes.

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:56.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, a lot of people, when you
go into the Akashic Records,

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:58.439 align:middle line:90%
a lot of people will see--

00:08:58.439 --> 00:09:00.355 align:middle line:84%
they're going to see
books laid out on tables.

00:09:00.355 --> 00:09:00.900 align:middle line:90%
Books--

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With our
life in the book?

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:02.680 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yes.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:03.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's that?

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:04.893 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: Now, that's
your Book of Life.

00:09:04.893 --> 00:09:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And this refers to opening
a person's individual Book

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:09.310 align:middle line:90%
of Life.

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:10.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
pages would mine be?

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:11.550 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.910 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: Well, it's probably
going to be quite extensive.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:14.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:15.210 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yeah.

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:16.810 align:middle line:90%
As many of us.

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:21.430 align:middle line:84%
So each soul has different
numbers of lifetimes.

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:24.610 align:middle line:84%
It only takes one lifetime
to become enlightened, which

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:28.150 align:middle line:84%
is why we're all
here, and yet we

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:30.730 align:middle line:84%
take many, many
lifetimes to come back.

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:32.690 align:middle line:90%
Why do we keep coming back?

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:37.430 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes because we love the
drama of an Earthly experience.

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:41.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, the light symbols that
you were referring to are--

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:46.330 align:middle line:84%
it's a universal and
informational lights language

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:51.280 align:middle line:84%
that is a lot like
the angelic symbols

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.730 align:middle line:84%
that people have reported
over history of seeing when

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:56.950 align:middle line:90%
they tap into higher awareness.

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:59.990 align:middle line:84%
These soul symbols
are the light language

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:04.570 align:middle line:84%
that all recorded languages
or all written languages

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:07.450 align:middle line:84%
on the planet have
been constructed from.

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:13.850 align:middle line:84%
So this is-- it really
has the building blocks,

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:18.670 align:middle line:84%
if you will, of energy,
substance, light, matter,

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:20.860 align:middle line:84%
material, that all things
are fashioned from.

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:24.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are so many
souls, not only on this planet,

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:25.930 align:middle line:90%
but in this universe.

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:28.840 align:middle line:84%
There must be what we
would call an enormity

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.350 align:middle line:90%
of the Akashic records.

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:32.150 align:middle line:90%
They have got to be huge.

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:38.900 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: It's literally more than
you can take in in a lifetime.

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:41.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we start with
a person's Book of Life.

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:45.940 align:middle line:84%
Once you get into
your own Book of Life,

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:48.220 align:middle line:84%
and you start looking
at past lifetimes,

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:51.610 align:middle line:84%
and you develop a knowing
of who you really are,

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:55.240 align:middle line:84%
and this brings moments
of enlightenment

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:58.780 align:middle line:84%
for an individual,
then we start being

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:01.450 align:middle line:84%
able to look at
historical data, what

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:04.600 align:middle line:84%
really happened in history,
history of the world.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.660 align:middle line:84%
A person may go through
the Akashic Records

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:11.080 align:middle line:84%
and go to other star
systems and look at where

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.081 align:middle line:90%
they're from originally.

00:11:12.081 --> 00:11:14.496 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they might be
from other star systems, right?

00:11:14.496 --> 00:11:15.850 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Many of us are.

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:17.830 align:middle line:90%
Many of us are.

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:20.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With the
Akashic Records, Bill,

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:24.270 align:middle line:84%
as you look at that graphic
of the universe and everything

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:28.150 align:middle line:90%
that's out there, it's immense.

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:33.330 align:middle line:84%
How many life forms can you
have that are in that book?

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:34.390 align:middle line:90%
I mean, countless?

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:35.680 align:middle line:90%
Endless?

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.560 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: As many as it takes
for your soul journey.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:43.000 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, your soul
was born from a star system

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.940 align:middle line:84%
or from a first moment Creator
God, like the universe is set--

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.970 align:middle line:84%
the super universes, coming
out across time and space.

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:56.590 align:middle line:84%
And that soul's instructions
from Creator God,

00:11:56.590 --> 00:12:01.090 align:middle line:84%
lovingly, has been
to know thyself,

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:03.220 align:middle line:84%
which is a spiritual
message that we

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.410 align:middle line:84%
hear in a lot of the
ancient teachings.

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:06.580 align:middle line:90%
It's an instruction.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:09.220 align:middle line:84%
It's an instruction to
observe, to come out

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:13.510 align:middle line:84%
across the universes, and to
incarnate and to know the self.

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:16.720 align:middle line:84%
To have the experiences and
report those back to God.

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.490 align:middle line:90%
All souls are different.

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:21.280 align:middle line:84%
Every single one of us
has a different function,

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.990 align:middle line:90%
a different creative function.

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And one soul could have 10
lifetimes here on planet Earth.

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Another soul could have
thousands, literally thousands.

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:32.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or two.

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:33.730 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Or two.

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:35.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
begin to study this?

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:36.670 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: 20--

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:38.378 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't
wake up in the morning

00:12:38.378 --> 00:12:40.600 align:middle line:84%
and say, I'm going to
study the Akashic Records.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:44.590 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: 20 Years ago, I said
a prayer to God, and I said,

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:47.380 align:middle line:84%
God, please show me the
way that all of this works.

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:49.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you need
to do this for yourself?

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.370 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: I was just
guided to do it.

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:52.840 align:middle line:90%
I just wanted to know.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And what happened
from that point

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.800 align:middle line:84%
is that I was literally
guided into the records

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.450 align:middle line:90%
the very next day.

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And from that point, I was
literally just very inspired,

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:10.810 align:middle line:84%
very excited about
spirituality in general,

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:12.610 align:middle line:84%
but most specifically
the records,

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:15.250 align:middle line:84%
because I knew that it
held the keys of knowledge

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:18.970 align:middle line:84%
from the past lifetimes
where I had not only

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:21.050 align:middle line:84%
accessed the records
in past lifetimes,

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:26.530 align:middle line:84%
but had been a healer, a
teacher, a spiritual student,

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:29.260 align:middle line:90%
if you will, among other things.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:33.520 align:middle line:84%
Artist, musician, scientist,
as many of us have.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These guided
meditations of the mind,

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:38.590 align:middle line:84%
how does that turn
into what we're looking

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:40.660 align:middle line:90%
at with the Akashic Records?

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:45.070 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: Well, when you practice
the guided meditations,

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:48.040 align:middle line:84%
for instance, the meditations
that are in the book,

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:51.220 align:middle line:84%
what you're going to do is
you're going to stream up

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:52.292 align:middle line:90%
into the records--

00:13:52.292 --> 00:13:53.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like that is, right?

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:54.300 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yes.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:57.500 align:middle line:84%
You're going to go
into the Book of Life.

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:00.100 align:middle line:84%
You're going to go into a
temple or a library setting

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:02.380 align:middle line:84%
with archetypal
imagery of the mind.

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:05.230 align:middle line:84%
You're going to access
your soul symbols.

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:08.380 align:middle line:90%
You're going to access visions.

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.230 align:middle line:84%
You're going to see
family members there

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:13.100 align:middle line:84%
that are going to
give you messages.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:14.860 align:middle line:84%
So it can be something
that's streaming

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:16.337 align:middle line:90%
for 30 minutes or an hour.

00:14:16.337 --> 00:14:17.920 align:middle line:84%
It can be in the
dream state at night.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.800 align:middle line:84%
It can be lucid
or regular dreams.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.130 align:middle line:90%
Or oftentimes you will have--

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:26.210 align:middle line:84%
and this happens
for a lot of us--

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:27.640 align:middle line:90%
you get a 30--

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:32.650 align:middle line:84%
you can get a vision or
a glimpse into the way

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:39.040 align:middle line:84%
that reality, the higher levels
of reality, what's actually

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:43.540 align:middle line:84%
happening there, you can glimpse
into this, and all of a sudden,

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:47.020 align:middle line:84%
it downloads energy
into your soul field.

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And it only takes a
fraction of a second for you

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:53.110 align:middle line:84%
to have an enlightening
experience.

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:56.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What determines exactly
what goes into that book?

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:59.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, surely you
can't put everything

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.600 align:middle line:84%
that you do in your

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:05.500 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: Well, you can, and
yet, it's not necessary.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:09.370 align:middle line:84%
So maybe there are
tendencies that

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:13.690 align:middle line:84%
are more robotic that you go
through over and over in life.

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:15.720 align:middle line:90%
The little stuff.

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:18.650 align:middle line:90%
It's not necessary.

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:22.060 align:middle line:84%
But what is there
is the reason why.

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:25.690 align:middle line:84%
So maybe if there's
a certain pattern,

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:33.337 align:middle line:84%
an eating pattern that
somebody has around different

00:15:33.337 --> 00:15:34.420 align:middle line:90%
denials that a person has.

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:37.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, if I give
money to a homeless person,

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:40.720 align:middle line:84%
and I have done this
a lot, does that go

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.040 align:middle line:90%
into the Book of Records?

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:43.520 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Of course.

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:48.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If I bypass that
homeless person, right?

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:49.197 align:middle line:90%
I walk right past him.

00:15:49.197 --> 00:15:50.863 align:middle line:84%
You know, please, can
I have some money,

00:15:50.863 --> 00:15:52.060 align:middle line:90%
and you walk right past him.

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:53.360 align:middle line:90%
Does that go into the book too?

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:54.160 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: It could.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.170 align:middle line:90%
It depends on what your--

00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:58.120 align:middle line:90%
it depends on where you're at.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:03.040 align:middle line:84%
So if you bypass that
person, and you're completely

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:06.940 align:middle line:84%
on your path and your purpose,
and you're going from point A

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:11.660 align:middle line:84%
to point B, and you have no
charge of energy around that,

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:13.179 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to
be in your book.

00:16:13.179 --> 00:16:15.470 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you're working on
is going to be in your book.

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:18.220 align:middle line:84%
However, if you're
passing that person,

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:20.380 align:middle line:84%
and you have a charge
of energy come up, like,

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:22.690 align:middle line:84%
oh my God, I just don't
have time for this.

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.640 align:middle line:84%
This is the hundredth time
that I've had to do this.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.410 align:middle line:90%
I just can't take it anymore.

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:29.210 align:middle line:90%
Then there's a lesson there.

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:31.520 align:middle line:84%
There's something that
will be in your book

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:32.660 align:middle line:90%
that you can work on.

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.118 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wrote
a book once called

00:16:34.118 --> 00:16:38.040 align:middle line:84%
"The Worker in the Light" about
our energy into the universe.

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:38.840 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Wonderful.

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:42.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And light
portals are a major factor

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:45.030 align:middle line:90%
of what we do in our life.

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:46.790 align:middle line:90%
What are these light portals?

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:47.830 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:52.160 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: Well, this picture
depicts the enormity

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.100 align:middle line:84%
of a person not only
going into the records,

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:57.170 align:middle line:84%
which we were talking
about earlier, the enormity

00:16:57.170 --> 00:17:00.200 align:middle line:84%
of the records, but
also the afterlife.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.620 align:middle line:84%
When you-- you really
are on your own journey.

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:06.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, God will say, and
the spiritual masters say,

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:09.380 align:middle line:84%
we're never alone, and that's
an important message for us

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:10.369 align:middle line:90%
to know.

00:17:10.369 --> 00:17:14.030 align:middle line:90%
And yet, in other ways, we are.

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:16.369 align:middle line:84%
It's our soul's
journey, and when

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:18.710 align:middle line:84%
we have that appointment
with eternity,

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:22.760 align:middle line:84%
we're going to move
to the other side.

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:27.467 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bill, are we on this
planet for a specific purpose?

00:17:27.467 --> 00:17:28.300 align:middle line:90%
I mean, here we are.

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.370 align:middle line:90%
We're doing "Beyond Belief."

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:33.010 align:middle line:84%
Other people are
doing other things.

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:35.230 align:middle line:90%
What's this all about?

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: Our main
reason for being here

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:43.600 align:middle line:84%
is to experience joy
and experience love.

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.130 align:middle line:90%
Those are the two main things.

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:46.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And move on.

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:49.300 align:middle line:10%
>>FOSS: And move on and
prepare for other worlds,

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:50.890 align:middle line:10%
other incarnations.

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:53.970 align:middle line:10%
And that's why when people
step to the other side,

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:55.960 align:middle line:10%
and they have a
near-death experience,

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:59.980 align:middle line:10%
or they go into the
records, and they come back,

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:02.050 align:middle line:10%
many people are changed.

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:03.100 align:middle line:90%
They get it right away.

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:04.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've always
told people, look.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:08.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm not afraid of dying, but
I'm in no rush to get there.

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:10.000 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: [CHUCKLES]

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to enjoy
this life as I can.

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And I've looked at lives
in different stages.

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:18.330 align:middle line:84%
I had a friend of mine whose
mother died a few weeks ago.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:23.010 align:middle line:84%
She was 95 years old, and
I'm trying to comfort him.

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:26.840 align:middle line:90%
And I said, she had a great run.

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:31.060 align:middle line:84%
95 years old for a
human being is amazing,

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:34.420 align:middle line:84%
when some people die
at 30 or 40 or 60.

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:36.810 align:middle line:84%
Look what happened to
Prince and Michael Jackson,

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:37.940 align:middle line:90%
people like that.

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:38.944 align:middle line:90%
Cut short.

00:18:38.944 --> 00:18:40.360 align:middle line:84%
So when you get
to a certain point

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:44.440 align:middle line:84%
in your physical life,
80, 90 years old,

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:47.800 align:middle line:84%
would you say that's
a pretty good run.

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:54.790 align:middle line:84%
Don't worry, because going
to the next side, it's time.

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:57.520 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: I would say so, George.

00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:01.690 align:middle line:84%
Also with that, when we get
to our later years in life,

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:07.120 align:middle line:84%
we get to a point where
we're ready to let things go.

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:09.640 align:middle line:84%
You know, let the little
things, that maybe we

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.140 align:middle line:84%
were on our way
to work, and we're

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.210 align:middle line:84%
going through our
mind and our lives,

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:16.720 align:middle line:84%
having all of these
stress-related thoughts

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:17.630 align:middle line:90%
come up.

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And when we get to, let's
say, 50, 60, 70, into our 80s,

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:26.740 align:middle line:84%
we realize that none of
that stuff really matters

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:28.720 align:middle line:84%
and that it never
really mattered.

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are
angels in our life.

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:34.170 align:middle line:84%
What is the special
Elohim angel?

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:35.450 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:37.780 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: Well, the
Elohim Angels--

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:39.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that
one, by the way?

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.020 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: --as well as
the ascended masters.

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And this would be a depiction
of an angelic figure

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:46.000 align:middle line:90%
or an ascended master.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.760 align:middle line:84%
The Elohim are special angels,
like the archangels that

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.710 align:middle line:90%
are associated with creation.

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:57.880 align:middle line:84%
Creation of the world,
creation of the universes,

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:01.570 align:middle line:84%
realities, different

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:02.710 align:middle line:90%
the ascended masters.

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And the ascended masters
are a special group

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:11.950 align:middle line:84%
because they are connected
with the natural, higher

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:13.630 align:middle line:90%
spiritual evolution of humanity.

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:15.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:33.664 align:middle line:90%
for several--

00:20:33.664 --> 00:20:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Incantations.

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:37.000 align:middle line:90%

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, but
to get to that level,

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:39.815 align:middle line:90%
can I get to that level?

00:20:39.815 --> 00:20:40.690 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yes, you can.

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:41.165 align:middle line:90%

>>FOSS: Well, in
some ways, George,

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:48.610 align:middle line:84%
you are already
experiencing enlightenment.

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:52.620 align:middle line:84%
So the ancient Tibetan
masters would say,

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.560 align:middle line:84%
we are already enlightened,
and we just don't know it yet.

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you say that the
mere fact that we're already

00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:01.900 align:middle line:84%
talking about this, that
we're exploring this,

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:06.160 align:middle line:84%
has put us on a different
level already than maybe we

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.180 align:middle line:90%
were in other lives?

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:10.060 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Absolutely.

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:13.720 align:middle line:84%
Could you imagine what

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:18.700 align:middle line:84%
with all of the work that

You know, where you may have

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:36.520 align:middle line:84%
spiritually on one or
two paths, but now you're

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:30.320 align:middle line:90%
and keep moving forward.

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.490 align:middle line:90%
And yes, that will work.

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:35.660 align:middle line:84%
I think the most important
thing that we can do

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:39.950 align:middle line:84%
is to consciously
focus on this instead

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:41.660 align:middle line:90%
of just being on autopilot.

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:46.100 align:middle line:84%
Once we get tapped into
it, you or I and the others

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:48.050 align:middle line:84%
out there in the
world, everybody--

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:50.720 align:middle line:84%
the more people
that get consciously

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.720 align:middle line:84%
focused on doing
work on this level,

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:56.240 align:middle line:84%
at least just shining
a light on it.

00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:01.490 align:middle line:84%
Once the conscious mind, once
this comes to the surface

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:05.990 align:middle line:84%
of an individual's
conscious reality,

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:09.380 align:middle line:84%
they cannot not look
at it from that point.

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:12.560 align:middle line:84%
From that point,
you are going to--

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:15.470 align:middle line:84%
you may have
conflicts around it.

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:19.460 align:middle line:84%
The fields in the mind may
expand and contract around it.

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:24.290 align:middle line:84%
But after a while, your fields,
your mind, your knowing,

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:28.790 align:middle line:84%
will either naturally or
from studying all of this,

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:32.480 align:middle line:84%
hopefully become more
rhythmic and have a pattern

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:33.800 align:middle line:90%
to it, a flow.

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:35.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were there
past civilizations,

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:38.660 align:middle line:84%
like the Egyptians
or the Atlanteans,

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:40.910 align:middle line:84%
who had access to
these records or who

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:43.910 align:middle line:84%
understood them maybe a little
better than we do today?

00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:44.780 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Absolutely.

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:49.370 align:middle line:84%
Both the Atlantis and
Egypt were connected

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:51.210 align:middle line:90%
to the Akashic Records.

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:55.880 align:middle line:84%
Let's say, if you and I
were in ancient Atlantis,

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:59.210 align:middle line:84%
our third eye, our mind,
we were all connected.

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:04.490 align:middle line:84%
So the energy, we were in the
grand cycle, the 26,000 year

00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:09.170 align:middle line:84%
rotation around the great
central sun of our solar system

00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:13.250 align:middle line:84%
and our cosmos that we
were in a state of unity.

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:16.730 align:middle line:84%
So-- and this is before
the fall of Atlantis--

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:21.020 align:middle line:84%
that the energy was so high
that literally, we would just

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:23.360 align:middle line:84%
come together in
groups, or you and I,

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.100 align:middle line:84%
we would just
manifest something.

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:27.530 align:middle line:84%
We would-- there
were no secrets.

00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:28.760 align:middle line:90%
Everybody knew everything.

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:32.000 align:middle line:84%
It was a highly
creative civilization.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did we
lose some of that?

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:36.050 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: The big
picture answer to that

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:43.610 align:middle line:84%
is that as we came around
through the grand cycle, 13,000

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:49.130 align:middle line:84%
years into that cycle, coming
out of the last cycle of unity,

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:56.360 align:middle line:84%
that our local universe, our
cosmos, our solar system,

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:59.010 align:middle line:90%
got to a place of separation.

00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:02.850 align:middle line:84%
There's a photon field that
runs through the universe,

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:04.970 align:middle line:84%
and this is like a
great pole of light.

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And as we're moving
back into it,

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:10.430 align:middle line:90%
everybody's energy is coming up.

00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:13.940 align:middle line:84%
The issues are coming up,
the conflicts are coming up.

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:15.440 align:middle line:84%
It's like God and
the Universe are

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:19.730 align:middle line:84%
shining a huge light or a
magnifying glass on the good

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:21.680 align:middle line:90%
and the light and the dark.

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:27.680 align:middle line:84%
So this is the great procession,
OK, that happens continually.

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:31.880 align:middle line:84%
Every 26,000 years,
we make a rotation.

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:35.900 align:middle line:84%
13,000 years into the
light, 13,000 years away

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:36.891 align:middle line:90%
from the light.

00:25:36.891 --> 00:25:38.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
you tell people,

00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:41.540 align:middle line:84%
the many who are watching
this program now, Bill.

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:44.750 align:middle line:84%
What would you tell them
about their own life

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:46.910 align:middle line:90%
and their own Akashic Records?

00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:48.940 align:middle line:84%
Somebody who might be
on the fence and says,

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:51.410 align:middle line:84%
eh, I don't care
about my records.

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:53.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to live my
life the way I want to.

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:55.370 align:middle line:90%
What would you tell that person?

00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:58.940 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: I would say the
most important thing,

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:03.810 align:middle line:84%
as far as conflict goes for
a person, even if they said,

00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:05.762 align:middle line:84%
I'm never going to believe
in that until I get

00:26:05.762 --> 00:26:07.220 align:middle line:84%
to the other side,
and then they'll

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:10.700 align:middle line:84%
see it's real anyway, for
that person, I would say,

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:12.110 align:middle line:90%
get off the fence.

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:13.400 align:middle line:90%
Commit.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.750 align:middle line:90%
Commit to something.

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:16.550 align:middle line:90%
That's important.

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:20.100 align:middle line:84%
Because when somebody
is on the fence,

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:23.210 align:middle line:84%
they're sort of separated
from their soul.

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:27.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've worked with
people around the globe.

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And when I sit with
somebody, and they're

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:33.072 align:middle line:84%
disconnected from
their own soul energy--

00:26:33.072 --> 00:26:34.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And many people are.

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.180 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: And many people are.

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:35.990 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:39.680 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the most
uncomfortable things

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.180 align:middle line:84%
that I've seen
people experience.

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:47.510 align:middle line:84%
Because the soul is relatively
invisible, if you will.

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:50.570 align:middle line:84%
But the more that we do work
like accessing the Akashic

00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:53.990 align:middle line:90%
Records, on almost a--

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:56.850 align:middle line:84%
I will say it's a lot
like shamanic work

00:26:56.850 --> 00:27:00.800 align:middle line:84%
in that you start to
feel your soul field.

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:03.980 align:middle line:84%
You start to experience
yourself as this fully spectral,

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:07.820 align:middle line:84%
all of the chakras,
your mind, your body.

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:09.110 align:middle line:90%
You become more sensitive.

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:11.690 align:middle line:84%
You become more
aware, more awake.

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And when people are
disconnected from their soul,

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:17.660 align:middle line:84%
and they're just trying
to make it through life,

00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:20.100 align:middle line:84%
it can be very,
very uncomfortable.

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:20.900 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:25.500 align:middle line:84%
They just don't know
what to say next.

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:28.490 align:middle line:84%
They don't know what to
think or feel a lot of times.

00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And when we bring
the soul back down

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:34.660 align:middle line:84%
and bring healing energy
into that soul field,

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:38.990 align:middle line:84%
I've had a lot of people
report, I feel better.

00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:40.006 align:middle line:90%
What did you do?

00:27:40.006 --> 00:27:40.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:45.110 align:middle line:84%
How could these records, Bill,
make us better as human beings?

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:48.090 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: In response to
what we just talked about,

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:50.780 align:middle line:84%
if somebody is accessing
their own records,

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:54.860 align:middle line:84%
they're going to be naturally
activating their soul field.

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:58.640 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going
up into the records,

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:01.850 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be naturally
activating your soul field.

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:04.730 align:middle line:84%
So you're stepping
into the soul.

00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:07.400 align:middle line:84%
The soul is around your
body or over your body,

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:10.280 align:middle line:84%
and it continually wants
to tend itself down

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:12.140 align:middle line:90%
through your physical form.

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:17.030 align:middle line:84%
The masters have brought
the soul completely down

00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:19.340 align:middle line:84%
into the body to
overtake the body.

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:23.480 align:middle line:84%
When this happens, this
is one of the hidden,

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:32.000 align:middle line:84%
if you will, aspects of the
human system that lends itself

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.140 align:middle line:84%
towards ascension
for human beings.

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:38.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're lying in bed.

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:40.050 align:middle line:90%
You're ready to die.

00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:42.540 align:middle line:84%
Do you think about
the Akashic Records?

00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:44.820 align:middle line:90%
Do you care at that point?

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:48.420 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: Well, if somebody
is aware of the records,

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:52.380 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be a very divinely
guided experience for them.

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:57.600 align:middle line:84%
Because oftentimes, when we're
at that level, when we're

00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:00.000 align:middle line:84%
at that place, we are
literally here and already

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.230 align:middle line:90%
on the other side.

00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:03.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We hear
things like when

00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:07.000 align:middle line:84%
you're at that moment
of death, your life

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.410 align:middle line:90%
begins to come before you.

00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:09.850 align:middle line:90%
All the things that you've done.

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:11.585 align:middle line:84%
Is that like going
through those records?

00:29:11.585 --> 00:29:12.850 align:middle line:90%
Is that what's happening?

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:13.750 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: It is.

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:17.560 align:middle line:84%
So that's literally
the point to where

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:20.350 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be taken
up into the records.

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:22.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you step
to the other side,

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:25.750 align:middle line:84%
your astral body
is still intact.

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:28.870 align:middle line:84%
So if you or I step to the
other side immediately,

00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:32.620 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be our light
body, our astral body.

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which we do
in astral projection.

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:35.560 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Right.

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be George
as George with all of George's

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:41.930 align:middle line:90%
thoughts and emotions.

00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:44.860 align:middle line:84%
So now the soul field is
also connected to that.

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:47.020 align:middle line:90%
So in essence, it's you.

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:53.740 align:middle line:84%
It's the complete you
without the physical density

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:54.800 align:middle line:90%
of the human body.

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.890 align:middle line:84%
So everything except
the physical density

00:29:56.890 --> 00:30:00.520 align:middle line:84%
of the human body steps to
the other side initially.

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:06.670 align:middle line:84%
That moves up into the records,
escorted by angels, archangels,

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:09.820 align:middle line:84%
or family members
or spirit guides,

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:12.280 align:middle line:84%
and then you start
to do your work.

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:14.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we get
up to the records,

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:17.110 align:middle line:84%
we know it like the
back of our hand.

00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:20.410 align:middle line:84%
But after a while,
let's say, after we've

00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:23.260 align:middle line:84%
got our next mission
report and everything,

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:27.370 align:middle line:84%
our astral body starts to become
absorbed into our soul field

00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:30.340 align:middle line:84%
because that's who we
really are, part of God.

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And then we get ready
to come back down.

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:37.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm thinking of the
records in terms of print

00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:39.700 align:middle line:84%
because that's how
I relate to things.

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:43.010 align:middle line:84%
But could it also be a
video record of your life?

00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:43.810 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Absolutely.

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:45.476 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where you
see all these things?

00:30:45.476 --> 00:30:46.870 align:middle line:84%
You see the little
George when he

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:48.550 align:middle line:90%
was a kid and things like that?

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:49.420 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Absolutely.

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Many, many people
report just seeing it

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:55.240 align:middle line:90%
on a visionary screen.

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And often, when you
go into the records,

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:02.410 align:middle line:84%
and you're stepping right
into the soul field, what

00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:05.350 align:middle line:84%
happens is your third
eye becomes very active,

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:06.310 align:middle line:90%
your crown chakra.

00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And you can go into
something that I

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:11.590 align:middle line:90%
will call the Akashic Vision.

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And when you have an
experience like this,

00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:19.840 align:middle line:84%
it's more bright and more
vivid than the brightest HDTV

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:23.560 align:middle line:84%
that you've ever seen, and
it's giving energy to you.

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:26.860 align:middle line:84%
So you're literally
watching a movie,

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:29.080 align:middle line:84%
you realize that you're
in the soul field,

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:32.680 align:middle line:84%
and it's correcting
things within your DNA,

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:34.780 align:middle line:84%
your physical body,
the mitochondria,

00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:38.207 align:middle line:84%
the cells of your body, your
mind, your karma, everything.

00:31:38.207 --> 00:31:39.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wouldn't
it be great one day,

00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:42.070 align:middle line:84%
where you don't
have a court system,

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:45.100 align:middle line:84%
but we merely tap into
your Akashic Records.

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:49.540 align:middle line:84%
So let's say somebody is accused
of robbing a bank, right?

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:52.960 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, he goes to
this place, and rather than

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:56.410 align:middle line:84%
have a trial and a
jury and witnesses,

00:31:56.410 --> 00:31:59.500 align:middle line:84%
they merely tap into
his Akashic Records,

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:02.970 align:middle line:84%
and there it is for
the world to see.

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:05.740 align:middle line:84%
How does he get away from
that and explain that, right?

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:06.830 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: It would be a
lot quicker, wouldn't it?

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:08.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He either did
or he didn't do it.

00:32:08.170 --> 00:32:08.970 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: [CHUCKLES]

00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:11.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will we ever get
that way technologically?

00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: We're on our
way there right now.

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:19.754 align:middle line:84%
The long-range answer to
that is 100 to 200 years.

00:32:19.754 --> 00:32:21.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not too long
in the scheme of things.

00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:22.470 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yeah.

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:24.400 align:middle line:84%
The short-range
answer is as we're

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:32.260 align:middle line:84%
moving into this photon field,
the solar flare activity is

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:35.324 align:middle line:84%
coming up, which
is also amplifying

00:32:35.324 --> 00:32:37.240 align:middle line:84%
the Schumann resonance
of the earth right now.

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:40.930 align:middle line:84%
So the Schumann resonance is
way up, as we know, right now.

00:32:40.930 --> 00:32:44.170 align:middle line:84%
All of these things
are elements of moving

00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:47.630 align:middle line:84%
through this photonic
band in the universe.

00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And this is literally
bringing us up to a point

00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:53.770 align:middle line:84%
where it's a
quickening, if you will.

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:56.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is amazing
at how this works.

00:32:56.440 --> 00:33:00.310 align:middle line:84%
How easy is it to access
the records today?

00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:03.230 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: It can come in
the twinkling of an eye.

00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:05.620 align:middle line:90%
It can come in between thoughts.

00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:08.190 align:middle line:90%
Or you can practice it.

00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:09.920 align:middle line:84%
You know, you can
practice it long-term.

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:11.086 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you practice it?

00:33:11.086 --> 00:33:12.650 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yes, absolutely.

00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:14.640 align:middle line:90%
And I'll do it both times.

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.930 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm working with
somebody individually,

00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:20.710 align:middle line:84%
I'll be accessing the records
while I'm working with them.

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:25.160 align:middle line:84%
So I'm literally here and
there at the same time.

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:28.720 align:middle line:84%
Other times, I like to
do it the traditional way

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:31.180 align:middle line:84%
that the ancient
mystics did it, which

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:35.020 align:middle line:84%
is go into a meditative
state, close my eyes,

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:39.280 align:middle line:84%
shut down my senses, connect
like the Egyptians did it.

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And connect up through the soul
and move up into the records.

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:48.580 align:middle line:84%
Have an experience, see
what I'm going to see.

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Bring that back
down into the body

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.280 align:middle line:90%
and come back into the senses.

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:56.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: "Journey into
the Akashic Records."

00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:57.460 align:middle line:90%
That's your book.

00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:58.390 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yes.

00:33:58.390 --> 00:33:59.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a great seller.

00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:03.040 align:middle line:84%
Will people learn how to
tap into the Akashic Records

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:03.850 align:middle line:90%
by reading it?

00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:04.960 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Absolutely.

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:08.650 align:middle line:84%
It's a blend of what's available
in the three-day workshop

00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:09.489 align:middle line:90%
internationally.

00:34:09.489 --> 00:34:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Half of the information
is channeled

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:13.659 align:middle line:90%
from the records themselves.

00:34:13.659 --> 00:34:14.889 align:middle line:90%
It's got two glossaries.

00:34:14.889 --> 00:34:18.280 align:middle line:84%
It's got eight different guided
meditations into the records.

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:21.340 align:middle line:90%
You can do karmic release.

00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:22.960 align:middle line:90%
You can do karmic clearing.

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:26.530 align:middle line:84%
I also will talk about
clearing negative energies

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:28.655 align:middle line:84%
and also working with
extraterrestrial energies.

00:34:28.655 --> 00:34:31.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you think of
the vastness of this universe,

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:33.870 align:middle line:84%
how many worlds do you
think are out there?

00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:36.800 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Innumerable.

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:37.989 align:middle line:90%
The universes--

00:34:37.989 --> 00:34:39.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As Sagan would say?

00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:40.040 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yeah.

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:41.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Billions and billions?

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:42.320 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Right.

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:47.719 align:middle line:84%
Some schools of thought
will say that every thought

00:34:47.719 --> 00:34:49.790 align:middle line:90%
is its own universe.

00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:50.600 align:middle line:90%
Think of that.

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:53.870 align:middle line:84%
6 billion people on
the planet, plus.

00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And every moment
is its own reality.

00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:03.600 align:middle line:84%
Every past life, every future
life is a parallel reality.

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:07.070 align:middle line:84%
So the universes are
constantly and continually

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:11.900 align:middle line:84%
expanding naturally, as well as
in all of these micro and macro

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:12.770 align:middle line:90%
ways.

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:14.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is
everything, including

00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:17.090 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial races
that are out there,

00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:19.280 align:middle line:84%
do they all have
Akashic Records?

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:21.080 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: Each planet
and planetary

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:26.450 align:middle line:84%
system or each solar system
has its own Akashic Records.

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:29.840 align:middle line:84%
So there are multiple levels
of the Akashic Records.

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:32.894 align:middle line:84%
So when somebody gets
into doing this work,

00:35:32.894 --> 00:35:34.310 align:middle line:84%
you'll hear every
once in a while,

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:38.000 align:middle line:84%
somebody say universal,
think more planetary.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.160 align:middle line:84%
Think more locally,
and then use it

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:43.190 align:middle line:84%
as a long-term directory
to other systems.

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:45.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you are speaking
before a group of people

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:48.870 align:middle line:84%
about the Akashic
Records, what's

00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:54.600 align:middle line:84%
the one thing you want them
to take away from that speech?

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:58.980 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: George, the one thing
that's important for each

00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:03.780 align:middle line:84%
and every one of us out there
is that when we get to the end

00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:06.220 align:middle line:84%
of our life, as we were
discussing earlier--

00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:07.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And we all will.

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:08.130 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Yes.

00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:11.010 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have that
experience with the Akashic

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:11.910 align:middle line:90%
Records.

00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:14.090 align:middle line:84%
We have an appointment
with eternity.

00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:15.870 align:middle line:84%
We are going to go
into our Book of Life.

00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:17.460 align:middle line:90%
We're going to go there.

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:20.010 align:middle line:84%
Here's the importance that
I've learned from working

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:21.600 align:middle line:90%
with the Akashic Records.

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:24.210 align:middle line:84%
If in the middle
of our lifetimes,

00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:26.130 align:middle line:84%
or while we're still
in physical form--

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:30.030 align:middle line:84%
because there's something that's
very special about being here

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:32.190 align:middle line:84%
in physical form-- there
is something very special

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:34.090 align:middle line:90%
about this reality.

00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:38.340 align:middle line:84%
If we start working with the
records, our own Book of Life,

00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:41.160 align:middle line:84%
and connecting in
now, we're starting

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.970 align:middle line:90%
to get ahead of the curve.

00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:45.210 align:middle line:84%
We're starting to be
able to clear things

00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:49.080 align:middle line:84%
from past lifetimes
consciously, quickly.

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:51.990 align:middle line:84%
We are starting to be
able to manifest a greater

00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:58.860 align:middle line:84%
reality for ourselves, so we're
literally here and there right

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:00.330 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:02.280 align:middle line:90%
We're literally here and there.

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's important because
when we step to the other side,

00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:07.860 align:middle line:90%
everything's going to begin.

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:09.120 align:middle line:90%
Everything's going to begin.

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:10.170 align:middle line:90%
We're going to know.

00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:11.670 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
a great knowing.

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:15.090 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be a lot
of knowledge and information

00:37:15.090 --> 00:37:19.650 align:middle line:84%
that we sort of fumble towards
trying to understand here

00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:21.250 align:middle line:90%
in the here and now.

00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:23.340 align:middle line:84%
But when we step
to the other side,

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:24.720 align:middle line:84%
we're going to
know it instantly.

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:30.280 align:middle line:84%
If we do our clearing and
access our past lifetimes, maybe

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.080 align:middle line:90%
some--

00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:33.510 align:middle line:84%
and in there, there's a
lot of ancient history

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:37.800 align:middle line:84%
that will come into contact with
the planet Earth and other star

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:38.670 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:40.710 align:middle line:84%
If we start to do
that now, we're

00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:42.690 align:middle line:84%
going to be way
ahead of the curve.

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:43.890 align:middle line:90%
It's going to help us now.

00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:45.840 align:middle line:84%
It's going to help the
rest of our lifetime,

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:49.060 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to make our
appointment with eternity

much easier.

>>NOORY: What is the gift
of tapping into the Akashic

00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:54.750 align:middle line:84%
Records while still
in the human form?

00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: George, that's
a great question,

00:37:56.730 --> 00:38:00.930 align:middle line:90%
and the gifts are multilevel.

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:07.410 align:middle line:84%
This will stimulate
and help to strengthen

00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:09.300 align:middle line:90%
your psychic abilities.

00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:11.850 align:middle line:84%
It's going to help
you clear karma.

00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:14.730 align:middle line:84%
It's going to help
you release traumas.

00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:17.340 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people have had
traumas from past lives

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:21.750 align:middle line:84%
that they're not aware of that
have invisible streams that

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:22.890 align:middle line:90%
sometimes connect.

00:38:22.890 --> 00:38:25.890 align:middle line:84%
There's an open stream
through the soul field,

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:29.040 align:middle line:84%
and it's impacting
the here and the now.

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And when you tap
into the records

00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:33.900 align:middle line:84%
and start doing the
work, you can consciously

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:35.640 align:middle line:90%
and by osmosis--

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:38.280 align:middle line:84%
a lot of this stuff is
going to be cleared out.

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:40.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it make
you a better person?

00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:41.730 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSS: Absolutely.

00:38:41.730 --> 00:38:44.890 align:middle line:84%
Paramahansa Yogananda,
a great yogi said,

00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:49.410 align:middle line:84%
no matter what we're doing in
life, we're all trying to be--

00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:55.260 align:middle line:84%
we're all trying to do the best
we can with our experience.

00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And if you are tapping
into the records,

00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:02.920 align:middle line:84%
it's our tendency to
evolve, to create.

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:08.430 align:middle line:10%
That's the one thing besides
experiencing joy and love,

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:10.770 align:middle line:10%
here in human form,
that's very important,

00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:14.730 align:middle line:10%
is the continuing of
a creative expression.

00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:16.740 align:middle line:84%
And when you're going
into the records,

00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:20.760 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be
able to access a more

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:22.966 align:middle line:90%
creative expression in life.

00:39:22.966 --> 00:39:25.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bill, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:26.310 align:middle line:90%
Really appreciate it.

00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:27.924 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSS: Yeah, thank
you too, George.

00:39:27.924 --> 00:39:28.840 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be here.

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:30.048 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Akashic Records.

00:39:30.048 --> 00:39:34.690 align:middle line:10%
We all have the ability to write
our own chapters for that book.

00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:38.320 align:middle line:84%
So you determine what you
want that book to say,

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:40.090 align:middle line:90%
because it's your life.

00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:43.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
