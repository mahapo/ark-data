00:00:05.604 --> 00:00:08.210 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And I
think many people today don't

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.770 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.638 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.638 --> 00:00:13.240 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>It felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.870 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:19.540 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:25.429 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:27.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.160 align:middle line:10%
In this edition,
we're going to be

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.540 align:middle line:10%
talking with an
independent researcher who

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.430 align:middle line:10%
is an expert on Egypt.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.010 align:middle line:10%
Larry Dean Hunter.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And I had an opportunity
a few months ago

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.100 align:middle line:84%
to meet Larry at a conference
in the Los Angeles area.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.217 align:middle line:84%
And he gave me a little
piece of the pyramid.

00:00:44.217 --> 00:00:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk about
that a little bit

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.140 align:middle line:90%
later on in the program.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.890 align:middle line:90%
Larry, welcome.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:48.820 align:middle line:90%
It's good to see you again.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LARRY HUNTER: Thank you
for having me, George.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in studying Egypt?

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.090 align:middle line:10%
>>HUNTER: In 1979,
or thereabouts,

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.630 align:middle line:10%
the country was
servicing shortage

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.607 align:middle line:10%
of energy-- gas, gas lines.

00:01:01.607 --> 00:01:03.440 align:middle line:10%
President Carter was
president at that time.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.370 align:middle line:10%
And he was looking for
a little black box idea.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.490 align:middle line:10%
Well, I was looking
at the Great Pyramid

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.770 align:middle line:10%
as possibly, at that
time, an alternative

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.640 align:middle line:10%
to the nuclear fossil
fuel-based energy systems.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.600 align:middle line:90%
And so I was studying it.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And so it started
out researching.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.930 align:middle line:84%
David Davidson from
1925, his books

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.610 align:middle line:84%
that describe the light
interacting with the pyramid,

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.920 align:middle line:84%
and how it would
interplay with the area.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And so basically
I went to Egypt,

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.120 align:middle line:84%
and then came back
and went to Mexico

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.420 align:middle line:90%
and studied the pyramids there.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And then I got my
celestial connection

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.530 align:middle line:90%
to a terrestrial motion.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.010 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I got
my math base down.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.820 align:middle line:84%
So I wrote a patent
on the Great Pyramid

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.510 align:middle line:84%
as a primary
controller of sunlight.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.802 align:middle line:90%
And that's what started it off.

00:01:47.802 --> 00:01:50.176 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know, I've been
fascinated with the pyramids

00:01:50.176 --> 00:01:51.320 align:middle line:90%
since I was a little kid.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.087 align:middle line:84%
My father was born in
Cairo-- God rest his soul.

00:01:55.087 --> 00:01:56.170 align:middle line:90%
But I've never been there.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.290 align:middle line:90%
And he had never been back.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.775 align:middle line:84%
But as a little boy,
I was fascinated

00:02:00.775 --> 00:02:04.810 align:middle line:84%
with the pyramids, trying to
figure out how they made them,

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.920 align:middle line:90%
what they were for.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.400 align:middle line:84%
Are you at a point
now in your career

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.812 align:middle line:84%
where you can answer
those questions?

00:02:11.812 --> 00:02:13.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: I'm sorry
you had to wait

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.420 align:middle line:90%
so long to find those answers.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.810 align:middle line:84%
But hopefully today
we will address

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.380 align:middle line:84%
those specific
interests that you had.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.760 align:middle line:84%
Because those are the same
things that I had also.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.790 align:middle line:84%
After I discovered
the high technologies

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.444 align:middle line:84%
of the gravitational astronomy,
the pyramid expressing

00:02:27.444 --> 00:02:29.360 align:middle line:84%
all the laws that govern
gravity as it relates

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.860 align:middle line:84%
to the Earth around the sun
over vast periods of time,

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.490 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't find a civilization
that made any sense.

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:36.580 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.820 align:middle line:84%
It's like the Egyptians
said they did this,

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.570 align:middle line:84%
but their sciences
didn't make sense.

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Didn't
match it, did it?

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: I needed
to go somewhere else.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And so then I started
to get into the geology.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And then you get
into astronomy also,

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.915 align:middle line:84%
because it is 10
years in the Navy.

00:02:52.915 --> 00:02:54.540 align:middle line:84%
I understand you were
in the Navy also.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nine years.

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.598 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: And mine was as
a navigator, quartermaster,

00:02:57.598 --> 00:02:59.040 align:middle line:90%
moving ships around the world.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.600 align:middle line:90%
And so I had a good background.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mine was
an officer, Larry.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.440 align:middle line:90%
And a gentleman.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: [LAUGHS]
Well, it led me

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.930 align:middle line:84%
to go outside the
box of the paradigm.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.790 align:middle line:90%
It required more study.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.950 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of the trips over
there, you see things.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's just like,
how does this merge?

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And so after about 36
trips and 40 years later,

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.770 align:middle line:84%
I think I have a
grasp on it now.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And when you say
how are they made,

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.900 align:middle line:84%
the philosophy,
or the Egyptology

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.740 align:middle line:84%
would say that they cut
them and dragged them.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.060 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't find
that in my photography.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.630 align:middle line:84%
I would photograph
everything that

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.640 align:middle line:84%
would argue with
that point, where

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.060 align:middle line:84%
if they say they
cut a block, well,

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.420 align:middle line:84%
on the causeway from the
Sphinx to the Great Pyramid,

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.310 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of
little white boxes

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.470 align:middle line:84%
that are like
concrete blocks today.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.810 align:middle line:84%
When we pour them,
we put the cement in

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.360 align:middle line:90%
to fill up the concrete.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, it wasn't any
different on the Giza Plateau

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.720 align:middle line:84%
from this area coming
up through here.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.470 align:middle line:84%
And so I started
photographing them.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And I could see the box
because the cement that was

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.920 align:middle line:90%
on the sides has come aside.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And you can see all
these little coins

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.230 align:middle line:84%
that we have here on the
table were just packed in.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.029 align:middle line:90%
And not one of them was cut.

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:17.820 align:middle line:84%
So there was no cutting
involved in this.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:18.579 align:middle line:90%
They were poured.

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:19.399 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everything was poured.

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:20.274 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Everything.

00:04:20.274 --> 00:04:22.100 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
get into "let's bake

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.290 align:middle line:84%
a cake" kind of
scenario, the smallest

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:27.780 align:middle line:84%
of the aggregate
that I could find

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.910 align:middle line:90%
was down at 1/64th of an inch.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.030 align:middle line:84%
And from there they would
be like seven groups

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.320 align:middle line:84%
of small, bigger, up to the
size of a silver dollar.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.900 align:middle line:84%
But all the silver
dollar sizes were not

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.010 align:middle line:84%
used in mastabas
and the plateau.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.929 align:middle line:84%
They were only in
the Great Pyramid.

00:04:44.929 --> 00:04:46.220 align:middle line:90%
Then you get into the mastabas.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.540 align:middle line:84%
You would never
find the large ones.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:49.930 align:middle line:90%
You would find them smaller.

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And then when you get down
into the hieroglyphics that are

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.060 align:middle line:90%
there, you see the wind blown.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And then you find
all the little ones.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.627 align:middle line:84%
So if you could find it in
nature where these things were

00:05:00.627 --> 00:05:02.710 align:middle line:84%
growing, where you could
just get just the babies,

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.250 align:middle line:84%
and get just this size,
and get just those,

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.690 align:middle line:90%
I would find that amazing.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:12.110 align:middle line:84%
But as you see, these
coins, when they decompose,

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.110 align:middle line:90%
they fall out on the ground.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.100 align:middle line:90%
There's billions of them.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.520 align:middle line:84%
But you don't really notice
them until you collect them

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.170 align:middle line:90%
and then put them in rows.

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.090 align:middle line:84%
Like you have whole
row just this size.

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do you
call them coins?

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: Well, because
one of my friends--

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.970 align:middle line:90%
the ancient teachers.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.280 align:middle line:90%
Not ancient-- they're dead now.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.210 align:middle line:10%
But Ahmed Shire and Ahmed
Mohammed Abdelhadi Fayed

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.860 align:middle line:10%
were my guides to understand.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.880 align:middle line:84%
The Fayed family, his
family was archaeologists.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.800 align:middle line:90%
They worked in the Saqqara.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.010 align:middle line:84%
But you can see they're
different sizes.

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:50.270 align:middle line:84%
Now what you don't notice is
that if you put them in a row,

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.920 align:middle line:84%
and then you get
the next one, there

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.620 align:middle line:84%
is a space in here
between these stones

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.170 align:middle line:84%
that you will not ever find one
that will come in between them.

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:02.071 align:middle line:84%
So there are different sizes
from like eight, seven, six,

00:06:02.071 --> 00:06:02.570 align:middle line:90%
four.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:03.945 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What were
they used for?

00:06:03.945 --> 00:06:07.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: That's what mixes
to make the blocks, everything

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:09.470 align:middle line:84%
that you see on
the Giza Plateau.

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.920 align:middle line:84%
This is a piece of
decomposing today.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.160 align:middle line:84%
But you'll see the
size of these coins

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.730 align:middle line:84%
go all the way to
the little ones.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And then this sort of
a glassy look about it,

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.380 align:middle line:90%
because it's silicon.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.160 align:middle line:90%
It's a glass.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Does this break down?

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.970 align:middle line:90%
Do these break down?

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:25.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: Over time,
when they're exposed.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.110 align:middle line:84%
Because it's like the
pulp on the tooth.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.190 align:middle line:84%
The enamel would
be the limestone

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.830 align:middle line:84%
that used to cover
the Great Pyramid.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.150 align:middle line:84%
And it was highly
reflective and polished.

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.560 align:middle line:84%
But it was used like a
quarry over the history.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How'd you get
those out of Egypt?

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:39.594 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Well, it's dirt.

00:06:39.594 --> 00:06:40.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You just took them?

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:41.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: It's dirt.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:41.780 align:middle line:90%
Rocks.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.397 align:middle line:84%
They don't recognize the
significance of them.

00:06:45.397 --> 00:06:47.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were they're scattered
all around the pyramids?

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: Around the
village, the pyramids.

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.400 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they're all over Egypt.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.740 align:middle line:90%
Not just in the Giza Plateau.

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:52.690 align:middle line:90%
When I go look--

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:53.862 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In this form?

00:06:53.862 --> 00:06:54.820 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: In this form.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And the existing
structures, if you look,

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.440 align:middle line:90%
you'll see those coins.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.190 align:middle line:84%
But then if you look
down on the ground,

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:02.580 align:middle line:84%
the ground is also
made of these coins.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And then underneath those,
you get into strata.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.140 align:middle line:90%
And it's like nothing--

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:13.559 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's-- let's--
These aren't naturally made?

00:07:13.559 --> 00:07:14.100 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: No.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:14.600 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.620 align:middle line:90%
They're manufactured.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:16.690 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: These are
all manufactured?

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:17.731 align:middle line:10%
>>HUNTER: It's the same--

00:07:17.731 --> 00:07:19.840 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They made them
in this round look.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: And if
you look, each one

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.430 align:middle line:84%
of those coins, if you break
them in half-- because there's

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:26.670 align:middle line:84%
two halves to this
coin-- you will

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:29.930 align:middle line:84%
see that there are little
range rings all inside.

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.470 align:middle line:84%
Now those range rings
go down to the center.

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
if it has something

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.830 align:middle line:84%
to do with the manufacturing
techniques of these,

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:37.610 align:middle line:90%
but they are--

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:39.443 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
supposed to fit like that?

00:07:39.443 --> 00:07:40.030 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Yes.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, now if you look at
the side of that coin,

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.890 align:middle line:84%
and you split them apart,
you will see both of them

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:46.410 align:middle line:90%
the rings.

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:46.542 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:07:46.542 --> 00:07:47.900 align:middle line:10%
But what's the purpose of this?

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:51.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: It's a strong stone.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.800 align:middle line:84%
It's like the
aggregate today, we

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.150 align:middle line:84%
use different size of rocks
for different structures.

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:57.210 align:middle line:90%
No different here.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:00.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So that was like mixed
into what we would call mortar

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:01.326 align:middle line:90%
these days?

00:08:01.326 --> 00:08:02.040 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Yes.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:02.540 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.710 align:middle line:84%
This is the aggregate
of the mortar.

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:05.620 align:middle line:90%
And then it's glass.

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.840 align:middle line:84%
That's why you can't date it
because there's no carbon in it

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:09.769 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:08:09.769 --> 00:08:12.310 align:middle line:84%
The only way we can sort of get
the idea of the age of things

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:16.150 align:middle line:84%
is to look at the mud bricks
that the Egyptians put on top

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:18.520 align:middle line:90%
of these kinds of stones.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And then if you really
want to get the timeline,

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:24.380 align:middle line:84%
you have to go all the way up
into Aswan, and up into Sudan,

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.180 align:middle line:90%
and watch the water come down.

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:29.640 align:middle line:84%
If you took the timeline,
like carbon dating,

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.850 align:middle line:84%
this up at the upper
where the water was high,

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:34.549 align:middle line:84%
civilization was not
here because the water

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:35.549 align:middle line:90%
was on top of it.

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:37.789 align:middle line:84%
As the water receded,
the mud will give you

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:40.909 align:middle line:84%
a timeline of carbon dating
because it has the sea

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:43.549 align:middle line:90%
shells, the straw and things.

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually tell now
how civilization re-encroached

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:50.192 align:middle line:84%
on what was underwater,
and now exposed--

00:08:50.192 --> 00:08:51.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How old is all this?

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:55.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: Well, what I
basically tried to come to was--

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.592 align:middle line:84%
because, I first
started it at 200 feet.

00:08:58.592 --> 00:09:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And I showed you some where
the water around the Giza

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.890 align:middle line:84%
Plateau at 200 feet is
growing sea shells on blocks.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:07.900 align:middle line:84%
In order to be a
true statement, that

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.430 align:middle line:84%
means the water
from the pyramids

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:12.070 align:middle line:84%
all the way across the
Mediterranean is level.

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:15.431 align:middle line:84%
And then all the way up almost
to Abydos is still sea water.

00:09:15.431 --> 00:09:17.680 align:middle line:84%
And then all the way over
the other side of the Nile--

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
all gone now, right?

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:20.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: Yeah,
The water's gone.

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:24.400 align:middle line:84%
But we can't see-- well,
we see the slosh marks

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.070 align:middle line:84%
on both sides of the Nile,
because you have those.

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:30.330 align:middle line:84%
And then you can see
as the water receded,

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:33.110 align:middle line:84%
it did it to the Sphinx up
on the hill, the temples,

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:34.350 align:middle line:90%
the second pyramid.

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:37.870 align:middle line:84%
Up in here you'll find a
lot of that tidal wear.

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll find
Gilgal, I think,

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:43.610 align:middle line:84%
was finding the
sea shells on top

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:48.027 align:middle line:84%
of the blocks of the structures
around the plateau, as well.

00:09:48.027 --> 00:09:49.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sea shells there?

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:50.350 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: All over the place.

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:53.410 align:middle line:84%
But now when you get into
the Sphinx area here,

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:54.910 align:middle line:84%
the temple in front
of it-- they've

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:59.280 align:middle line:84%
made it a good effort to break
as many of these sea shells

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.740 align:middle line:90%
so you don't see them.

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.240 align:middle line:90%
But me, I'm very clever.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.610 align:middle line:84%
I look underneath
the little lobs,

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:08.200 align:middle line:84%
and I see this part
of him is still there.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.160 align:middle line:84%
If you look carefully,
you can see it.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.870 align:middle line:84%
So the part of the
Spinx is under water.

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:16.080 align:middle line:84%
But up above, on the
Western side of the pyramid,

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.720 align:middle line:90%
this is higher than this area.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So this tells
me they built these.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.067 align:middle line:84%
There was no water
then, obviously.

00:10:23.067 --> 00:10:23.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Yes.

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:24.000 align:middle line:90%
Before.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.541 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then
the water came in--

00:10:25.541 --> 00:10:26.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Up flood.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:27.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then
it went away again.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:28.300 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: And then down.

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:29.530 align:middle line:90%
And then history come back.

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:31.420 align:middle line:90%
Now what is the age of all this?

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.870 align:middle line:84%
What I basically looked
at was the boat of Noah,

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:36.050 align:middle line:84%
if it's up at
6,000 feet, if it's

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:38.150 align:middle line:84%
in Turkey, as
they're saying today,

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:39.620 align:middle line:84%
I flooded everything
to that level.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.100 align:middle line:90%
All of Egypt's underwater.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.180 align:middle line:90%
Hands down.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:45.490 align:middle line:84%
But now when it came down, and
then we get to the 200 foot,

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:48.940 align:middle line:84%
we go out into the
Western deserts of Faiyum.

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And here we have a
sanctuary of whale bones.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:56.170 align:middle line:84%
Those are dating at 40
to 45 million years ago.

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:58.790 align:middle line:84%
Now when that water
locked the whales in,

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:01.244 align:middle line:84%
and then it went on down,
they then turned to fossils.

00:11:01.244 --> 00:11:03.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So how old are you
saying the pyramids are?

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:05.400 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: Well, I'm
more or less focused

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.220 align:middle line:90%
on the flood part of it.

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:08.804 align:middle line:84%
And that's about 65
million years ago.

00:11:08.804 --> 00:11:10.636 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're
saying the pyramids were

00:11:10.636 --> 00:11:12.140 align:middle line:90%
there prior to the flood.

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:13.227 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Absolutely.

00:11:13.227 --> 00:11:15.060 align:middle line:84%
Because this is the
stories of the Anunnaki.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:18.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So where you get the
years of 5,000 or 10,000 years

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:19.247 align:middle line:90%
old?

00:11:19.247 --> 00:11:20.330 align:middle line:90%
Where does that come from?

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:21.410 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: That's Egyptology.

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I take it to the
level of independent research,

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:27.330 align:middle line:84%
because I don't want to get
trapped under the paradigm of,

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:30.740 align:middle line:84%
if you disagree with
them, you're a heretic.

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:34.490 align:middle line:84%
I look at the geological,
astronomical, and social--

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:35.560 align:middle line:90%
all the evidences.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:36.960 align:middle line:90%
And then put them back.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.280 align:middle line:90%
And it all reads like a book.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And you need that zero Noah
flood, dinosaurs, destructions,

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:46.760 align:middle line:84%
iridium around the planet that
may have been the balloon that

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:47.705 align:middle line:90%
kept the firmament up.

00:11:47.705 --> 00:11:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And then when it
punched through,

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.920 align:middle line:84%
the extra atoms caused
the extra water.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And then going inside,
the Earth heated up

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.850 align:middle line:90%
and caused the waters to rise.

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:58.640 align:middle line:84%
Then you could see
this tremendous upswell

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.730 align:middle line:90%
of water added with the down.

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:03.330 align:middle line:84%
So then it took millions of
years for this to come down.

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:05.739 align:middle line:84%
Because if the whales
are dating at 45,

00:12:05.739 --> 00:12:07.530 align:middle line:84%
and you've got petrified
forest, and you've

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:10.850 align:middle line:90%
got a city that is incredible.

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:11.880 align:middle line:90%
This is an example.

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:15.390 align:middle line:84%
In this drawing here you
can see these old lines

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:17.980 align:middle line:84%
where they were digging
a hole and coming out.

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:19.890 align:middle line:84%
What is underneath
this hole that

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:25.627 align:middle line:84%
was bigger than the Sphinx in
1926 when Salim Hasan, the--

00:12:25.627 --> 00:12:27.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where's the
Sphinx in this picture?

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:28.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Sphinx is right here.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:29.513 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is it?

00:12:29.513 --> 00:12:30.190 align:middle line:90%
Right here?

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:32.590 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: And over here is
where they're digging now.

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:37.100 align:middle line:84%
But you can go down here
and underneath this directs

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.480 align:middle line:90%
tunnels to the pyramid.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And then they also would go
round over to the Sphinx.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.710 align:middle line:84%
In this particular area
here, some of the people

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:45.780 align:middle line:84%
that live here, they
follow the work's going on.

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:47.890 align:middle line:84%
Then after the doctors
leave, they go in.

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:49.420 align:middle line:84%
They go downstairs,
they go around.

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And they find a
25-foot basalt boat

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:55.180 align:middle line:84%
in a very large room
underneath the plateau.

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And they give me good
descriptions of all this.

00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:59.730 align:middle line:90%
But this is a very short show.

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And there's just
too much information

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:03.114 align:middle line:90%
to pump out very quickly.

00:13:03.114 --> 00:13:05.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've got a laser
pointer with you, right?

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:05.590 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Yeah.

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:07.290 align:middle line:84%
That's probably
better if I do this.

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:08.420 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:12.290 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at this,
there's just so many pieces.

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:15.200 align:middle line:84%
It's like handles
on a coffee cup.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.100 align:middle line:84%
You want to just
drink it comfortably.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:21.630 align:middle line:84%
But until you can find the
correct theory or analysis that

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:25.250 align:middle line:84%
explains all of it,
you're a blind man

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:26.680 align:middle line:90%
trying to describe an elephant.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.960 align:middle line:84%
For you, the parts you're
touching, that's what he is.

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.330 align:middle line:84%
But if five other people are
getting different pieces,

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:34.650 align:middle line:84%
then the reader, if he
reads, doesn't get it

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:35.941 align:middle line:90%
unless he reads all five books.

00:13:35.941 --> 00:13:38.492 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why don't you show
us with your laser pointer

00:13:38.492 --> 00:13:40.500 align:middle line:90%
the geography of all this?

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:41.910 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what we're looking at.

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:42.743 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: All right.

00:13:42.743 --> 00:13:46.369 align:middle line:84%
This is the Giza Plateau, right,
as photographed on Google Earth

00:13:46.369 --> 00:13:46.910 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:47.960 align:middle line:84%
But this has been
floating around

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.540 align:middle line:90%
on the internet for a long time.

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:51.800 align:middle line:84%
Over here is Aida,
the opera house.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.280 align:middle line:90%
This is no longer here.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:57.140 align:middle line:84%
But right now you see this
little area on the picture,

00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:01.990 align:middle line:84%
this is the Collins tomb
NC2 where he goes in.

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:03.890 align:middle line:90%
It was the tomb of the birds.

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And if you follow that line--
like this is north and south.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.920 align:middle line:84%
If you go straight here,
it will cross right

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.700 align:middle line:90%
in the center of Aida.

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And what most people
don't realize next

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:15.070 align:middle line:84%
is that if you took
an east/west line

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:17.860 align:middle line:84%
and you come straight across,
you will also hit this.

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:21.130 align:middle line:84%
So you have a north/south
and an east/west axes

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:23.401 align:middle line:84%
that is associated
with this opera house.

00:14:23.401 --> 00:14:25.776 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You think everything
was laid out mathematically

00:14:25.776 --> 00:14:26.510 align:middle line:90%
to be perfect?

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:29.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: I'm saying that
this structure today is

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:32.180 align:middle line:84%
a cover for something that
was going on that they

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:33.820 align:middle line:90%
didn't want us to know about.

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:37.450 align:middle line:84%
Because if you go in here, when
Collins first went in here,

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:39.620 align:middle line:90%
the sand was high in this tomb.

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:40.720 align:middle line:10%
I followed this one well.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.380 align:middle line:10%
I went there and documented
the history of it.

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:47.510 align:middle line:84%
But when Dr. Hawass
cleared the sand out,

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:52.030 align:middle line:84%
he exposed two
underground areas that

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:54.390 align:middle line:90%
would lead straight to here.

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:57.607 align:middle line:84%
And they were cut out--
or long corridors.

00:14:57.607 --> 00:14:59.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when
you say, they didn't

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:01.825 align:middle line:84%
want us to know-- what
was going on, who's they?

00:15:01.825 --> 00:15:02.700 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Dr. Hawass.

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:05.600 align:middle line:84%
It's suppression of all the
knowledge that's really here.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.986 align:middle line:84%
He will make it disappear,
or it didn't happen.

00:15:07.986 --> 00:15:09.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of course,
he's out of it now.

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:10.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Maybe.

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:12.030 align:middle line:84%
I've heard he may be coming
back as administrator.

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:12.520 align:middle line:90%
But that's--

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:13.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, we'll see.

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:14.330 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: I don't
want to badmouth him

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:15.330 align:middle line:90%
if I need to go back.

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:15.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He needs to go to jail.

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:16.830 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Yeah.

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:20.340 align:middle line:84%
But so basically, this whole
area, when you see-- you

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:22.367 align:middle line:90%
think it's tombs and tombs.

00:15:22.367 --> 00:15:24.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These are the
three great pyramids.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: This is Khufu,
Khafre, and Menkaure.

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:27.760 align:middle line:90%
And they also--

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Big, smaller, smallest.

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:31.660 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Right.

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:35.640 align:middle line:84%
Now when you take the Fibonacci,
and you take this spiral,

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:36.680 align:middle line:90%
and it goes around.

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll come out
into an area in the cemetery

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:42.200 align:middle line:84%
south of the pyramids,
because everything out here

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.530 align:middle line:90%
is mathematical like beyond.

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:45.571 align:middle line:84%
If you don't ask the
question and you don't look,

00:15:45.571 --> 00:15:46.430 align:middle line:90%
you'll never see it.

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:49.410 align:middle line:84%
But when you apply
sacred geometry,

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:51.100 align:middle line:84%
all these things,
then you start to see.

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Because there's people
that have been doing

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:53.790 align:middle line:90%
this research for a long time.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:55.080 align:middle line:90%
They're Rocky McClelland.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.705 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But what's
the purpose, Larry?

00:15:56.705 --> 00:15:57.690 align:middle line:90%
Why the geometry?

00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Why the precision
behind all of this?

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:04.480 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Blink your eye once.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:08.070 align:middle line:84%
Light just traveled around
the planet 7 and 1/2 times.

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:12.380 align:middle line:84%
This is the primary controller
of sunlight in the solar energy

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:14.000 align:middle line:90%
collection process system.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Explain that.

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:16.636 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: That's
what my patent is

00:16:16.636 --> 00:16:19.300 align:middle line:90%
all about-- US Patent 4509501.

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:21.910 align:middle line:84%
I have it duplicated in seven
countries around the world,

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:24.590 align:middle line:84%
because I wanted this
knowledge to come back up.

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:27.070 align:middle line:84%
It's like abandoned
lost technology

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:28.290 align:middle line:90%
from an ancient time.

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:29.810 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't see the Egyptians.

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:32.730 align:middle line:84%
So I had to come back and be
able to-- if someone asked

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:35.540 align:middle line:84%
me the question,
explain why I disagree

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:40.450 align:middle line:84%
with organized, orthodox
interpretations of all

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:41.800 align:middle line:90%
this stuff.

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.780 align:middle line:84%
But when I wrote the
patent-- and you'll

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:46.600 align:middle line:84%
see in some of the
pictures that I provided--

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:51.460 align:middle line:84%
there's a reflection pattern
that makes like a little cross.

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's a summer
solstice reflection that

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.820 align:middle line:90%
will interact on November 1.

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:58.670 align:middle line:84%
You will have the rays are
reflecting through here.

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And they will also
duplicate over to here.

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:03.790 align:middle line:84%
These two positions,
there's probably-- they're

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:05.530 align:middle line:90%
calling it the black pyramid.

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:09.810 align:middle line:84%
I think it's right here, because
that's what the math tells me.

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:11.099 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it underground?

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:12.230 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Well, it's level.

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:14.601 align:middle line:90%
And yes, this whole area.

00:17:14.601 --> 00:17:16.684 align:middle line:84%
When you say, underground,
let's take underground,

00:17:16.684 --> 00:17:18.690 align:middle line:90%
and let's go right here.

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:20.819 align:middle line:84%
JJ Hurtak-- and
the reason I know

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:22.589 align:middle line:84%
this is because the
watchman of the Sphinx

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:23.770 align:middle line:90%
is a dear friend of mine.

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:26.690 align:middle line:84%
And every time that Mr.
Hurtak would go to Egypt,

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:27.800 align:middle line:90%
he would use him.

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.860 align:middle line:84%
So he would tell me all the
things that was going on.

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:34.720 align:middle line:84%
These little holes here dug in
the '20s, Hurtak comes along

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.970 align:middle line:90%
and digs a hole and goes down.

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:39.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is where he made
this story of the river

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:43.890 align:middle line:84%
rafting, of which he had to
deny, but trust me, it's there.

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:45.790 align:middle line:84%
But he goes underground
river rafting.

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:48.240 align:middle line:84%
He says that the things
are so incredible,

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:52.230 align:middle line:84%
you could put the Sistine
Chapel underneath this plateau.

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:54.030 align:middle line:90%
And it's just awesome.

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:56.300 align:middle line:84%
But this is an
access point here.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:58.130 align:middle line:84%
And then you've
got one up in here.

00:17:58.130 --> 00:17:59.680 align:middle line:90%


00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:00.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.035 align:middle line:84%
But you're wandering
a little bit.

00:18:02.035 --> 00:18:04.160 align:middle line:84%
I want to know what the
mathematics of all this is.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: The mathematics
is that the Great Pyramid

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:08.316 align:middle line:84%
is an expression of all the
laws that govern gravity

00:18:08.316 --> 00:18:09.880 align:middle line:90%
as it relates to the Earth.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.720 align:middle line:84%
So they created a form that
would interact with the sun.

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.410 align:middle line:90%
Sunrise to sunset.

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:16.330 align:middle line:90%
Summer, spring, autumn, winter.

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And then for the
next 25,000 years

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.330 align:middle line:84%
until we come back to
a processional zero,

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:22.580 align:middle line:84%
and then the cycle would
start all over again.

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:23.940 align:middle line:90%
That's a processional circuit.

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:26.240 align:middle line:84%
But now when you look
at the Milky Way,

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.220 align:middle line:84%
where we go 250 million
or so years around

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:30.980 align:middle line:84%
to come back to
the same point, we

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:33.970 align:middle line:84%
have had a lot of processional
circuits through that time.

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:38.612 align:middle line:84%
So the processional was like
the second hands of the galaxy.

00:18:38.612 --> 00:18:39.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What does that mean?

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:41.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: It means that
in order to control light,

00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:43.784 align:middle line:84%
you have to have full-on
understanding of all

00:18:43.784 --> 00:18:46.890 align:middle line:84%
these elements, because
you're tracking things

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:48.040 align:middle line:90%
that are moving very fast.

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.330 align:middle line:90%
And you want to focalize it.

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And then you want to distribute
it around the planet.

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:55.510 align:middle line:84%
Not only pyramids in Egypt, but
they're all around the planet.

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And every one of them were
interacting in the 65 million

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:03.710 align:middle line:84%
year pre-flood together
as a global power system.

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:05.830 align:middle line:84%
When the flood came, it
wiped everything out.

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:08.680 align:middle line:84%
From Mexican, China,
all the pyramids

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:11.540 align:middle line:84%
that we're rediscovering
today around the world,

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:14.050 align:middle line:84%
no one has addressed
what is the stitching

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:15.734 align:middle line:90%
element that makes them all--

00:19:15.734 --> 00:19:17.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you saying
that these are power plants?

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:18.483 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Yes.

00:19:18.483 --> 00:19:19.580 align:middle line:90%
Light.

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:20.210 align:middle line:90%
Pure-on light.

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:23.422 align:middle line:84%
This is bringing mankind
back into the age of light.

00:19:23.422 --> 00:19:24.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they generators?

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:25.524 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:19:25.524 --> 00:19:26.440 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Beyond that.

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:29.060 align:middle line:84%
We have to kind of go into
Nicholas Tesla to understand

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:31.840 align:middle line:84%
how he could pull electricity
from the atmosphere,

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:34.460 align:middle line:84%
down, and then the water
underneath, and the polarities,

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:36.670 align:middle line:84%
and there's the
obelisk transmissions.

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many
things about this.

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:40.009 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If these
were power plants,

00:19:40.009 --> 00:19:42.410 align:middle line:84%
as Christopher Dunn has said,
in his-- Giza power plants,

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:43.410 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Yes, they are.

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:47.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did they
use the power for?

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:48.530 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Interstellar travel?

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:52.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you go and you
look on this-- let's play

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:54.000 align:middle line:90%
this scenario here.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.260 align:middle line:84%
This southern shafts
will point to Alnitak

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:02.020 align:middle line:84%
in the Orion constellation
belt. The Orion group is

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:04.580 align:middle line:90%
supposed to be Osiris in myth.

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:07.330 align:middle line:84%
Myth is kind of--
in the sequence

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:13.090 align:middle line:84%
here, the Earth before
Osiris was 360-day orbit.

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:15.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, something in
the curse of this

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:17.090 align:middle line:84%
said that these children
couldn't be born

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:20.530 align:middle line:90%
in the existing 360-day year.

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:23.160 align:middle line:84%
So Thoth took the difference
between a solar year

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:27.440 align:middle line:84%
and a lunar, and then
came up 144 days later

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:31.040 align:middle line:84%
with the accumulated time to
add five days to the calendar.

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:33.530 align:middle line:84%
So that made the
365-day calendar

00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:36.280 align:middle line:84%
that this building
is expressing.

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:41.210 align:middle line:84%
It is a 365-day square circuit,
which is basically the orbit,

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:43.440 align:middle line:90%
or circle orbit of the Earth.

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And then from that they
could control the sunlight,

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:50.710 align:middle line:84%
because it is an expression
working in the Earth

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:55.890 align:middle line:84%
turns every 24 hours, 360
degrees, 365 days, summer,

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:56.390 align:middle line:90%
spring.

00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:57.465 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I still don't
understand, Larry,

00:20:57.465 --> 00:20:58.664 align:middle line:90%
what they use this for.

00:20:58.664 --> 00:20:59.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Well--

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:02.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, is this just
a pretty design, or what?

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:05.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: Let's just say that
in the myth of Osiris, whenever

00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:09.100 align:middle line:84%
he died, he was on, like
the light switch on and off.

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.430 align:middle line:84%
They moved him to a
place called [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:12.820 align:middle line:90%
And he lay there for 70 days.

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:14.600 align:middle line:84%
Then he went to
the Great Pyramid.

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And from there he sent his soul
to the stars and Orion belt,

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:20.970 align:middle line:90%
or Alnitak-- his star.

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:21.470 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:22.900 align:middle line:90%
That's kind of-- what?

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:26.510 align:middle line:84%
But that's the ability of
the people in that time.

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:28.310 align:middle line:90%
They could do things like this.

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:30.650 align:middle line:84%
So now the myth says
that he's coming back.

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:33.360 align:middle line:84%
Now I know that if I take
a straw and I can look out

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.980 align:middle line:90%
and I can see there's a star.

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:35.700 align:middle line:90%
It's easy.

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.567 align:middle line:84%
But now imagine, after I've
shot myself out by the power

00:21:38.567 --> 00:21:40.650 align:middle line:84%
that these things can
generate, because you're not

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:42.890 align:middle line:84%
going to send your physical
material at those speeds,

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:44.480 align:middle line:90%
you're going to take your soul.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.770 align:middle line:90%
And off to another star system.

00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:48.830 align:middle line:90%
Not planets.

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:49.520 align:middle line:90%
Stars.

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you're saying
they were traveling

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:53.600 align:middle line:90%
through these pyramids?

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:54.183 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Yes.

00:21:54.183 --> 00:21:56.210 align:middle line:90%


00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:57.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like an astral
body would travel?

00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:58.918 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: More or less.

00:21:58.918 --> 00:22:02.080 align:middle line:84%
But now imagine in the myth
that Osiris is coming back.

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:04.256 align:middle line:84%
Osiris is the same
as Jesus and Moses.

00:22:04.256 --> 00:22:05.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you go
back and you'll

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:07.870 align:middle line:84%
find all these things
sort of track along.

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:09.050 align:middle line:90%
But now he's coming back.

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:11.090 align:middle line:84%
Now he's got to come
back to the Earth.

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:12.827 align:middle line:90%
And it's moving at its speed.

00:22:12.827 --> 00:22:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And light, if you
blink your eye once,

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:16.320 align:middle line:84%
he's gone seven times
around the planet.

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.030 align:middle line:84%
But imagine, he has
to come back and go

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:20.620 align:middle line:84%
in that little hole, four
inches by four inches,

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:23.560 align:middle line:84%
and go back in and
reanimate his body.

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:25.310 align:middle line:90%
That's what this was about.

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:26.380 align:middle line:90%
But that technology--

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:27.514 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did it work?

00:22:27.514 --> 00:22:29.305 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: Well, we
haven't seen Osiris yet.

00:22:29.305 --> 00:22:29.804 align:middle line:90%
Or have we?

00:22:29.804 --> 00:22:31.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, we haven't.

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:32.702 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: But now in
the village there's

00:22:32.702 --> 00:22:34.160 align:middle line:84%
a man who lives
right in this area.

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.190 align:middle line:90%
His name as Ahmed Shire.

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:37.280 align:middle line:90%
He told me a story years ago.

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.190 align:middle line:84%
He says, Larry,
the body of Osiris

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:40.482 align:middle line:90%
is in this pyramid to this day.

00:22:40.482 --> 00:22:41.273 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right now.

00:22:41.273 --> 00:22:42.300 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Right now.

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:46.120 align:middle line:84%
If Hawass hasn't removed
it or tampered with it.

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:49.600 align:middle line:84%
Now if it is, that's
interesting, because I always

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:50.930 align:middle line:90%
thought he was a myth.

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:53.800 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm getting it--
no, he is a physical body.

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.070 align:middle line:84%
And then the first
time he saw it.

00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And then they called
him back in 1997.

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:01.120 align:middle line:84%
The man's dead now,
so this is just me

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:03.270 align:middle line:90%
relating what he's told me.

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:05.870 align:middle line:84%
They brought him back to see
if anything had happened.

00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, because
I'm staying in his house,

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:09.710 align:middle line:84%
and I visit there,
and he's let me

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:12.200 align:middle line:84%
do films in the paws of
the Sphinx with the pyramid

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.490 align:middle line:90%
in sunlight over the years.

00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:17.410 align:middle line:84%
He told me, Larry, that
body looks just like you.

00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:19.880 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going, oh,
now this is personal.

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:20.520 align:middle line:90%
I know me.

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm a dancer and a
singer and in the Navy.

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:23.400 align:middle line:90%
And I know my life.

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:24.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm not Osiris.

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:26.270 align:middle line:90%
But he can look like me.

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:27.920 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any
problem with that.

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:29.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying I'm Osiris.

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.620 align:middle line:84%
But he's telling me that
body looks just like me.

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:34.100 align:middle line:90%
So then all this stuff.

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And you go back, and
you get your clocks.

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:38.401 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't think that's
too complimentary if you're all

00:23:38.401 --> 00:23:39.230 align:middle line:90%
mummified by now.

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:41.490 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: Well, maybe he
just got a new version.

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Because in ancient
myth, if somebody

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:45.750 align:middle line:84%
tampered with those
bodies, they would

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:47.940 align:middle line:90%
go into a statue-- the soul.

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And the idea of the
black magic of Egypt

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:52.790 align:middle line:84%
was to control that
soul when he came back.

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:56.730 align:middle line:84%
And me in 1979, I'm laying
on the bottom of the pyramid.

00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden some
energy field goes through me.

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:00.260 align:middle line:90%
And I sit up.

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:01.567 align:middle line:90%
And I have a conversation.

00:24:01.567 --> 00:24:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to get
into it in the show.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:06.560 align:middle line:84%
But it's on my website,
larryhunter.com.

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:07.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Simple as that.

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:08.300 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Yeah.

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:11.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you're saying--
and let's regroup here.

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:11.530 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: That we went into--

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:12.238 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hold on.

00:24:12.238 --> 00:24:13.350 align:middle line:90%
Hold on.

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:14.210 align:middle line:90%
Let's regroup.

00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:18.940 align:middle line:84%
You're saying the pyramids
are over 65 million years old.

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:20.070 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: By my research.

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:21.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: By your research.

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.700 align:middle line:90%
Who would have built that?

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:26.100 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: Well, I showed
you a picture of a little--

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:26.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And where
did those people go?

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:28.400 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: --a little
man with shoes.

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And there's a doorway in
the village of the pyramids.

00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:31.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We'll talk about
him in our next show.

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:34.960 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: But that's where you
say, where does it come from.

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:38.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, if this star goes
to Alnitak in the Orion

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:42.130 align:middle line:84%
constellation, and if Robert
Bauval's work is not quite

00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:43.322 align:middle line:90%
correct, because he shifts.

00:24:43.322 --> 00:24:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And he can't find
things because he's not

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:48.210 align:middle line:84%
running a north/south
axis to label Bellatrix

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:49.910 align:middle line:84%
in its right position
and Betelgeuse

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:50.840 align:middle line:90%
to the right pyramids.

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:52.320 align:middle line:90%
He's pulled it off.

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.100 align:middle line:84%
And he can't find
a couple of them.

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:57.700 align:middle line:84%
If he pulls it back and
labels the Betelgeuse

00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:00.600 align:middle line:84%
to the correct pyramid, and
then he'll go to Abu Rawash.

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.810 align:middle line:84%
The one he can't find,
he'll go to this area,

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:03.800 align:middle line:90%
and he will find it.

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:04.400 align:middle line:90%
I told him.

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.260 align:middle line:84%
He didn't want to
go and correct it.

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:09.010 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, so I went and
replotted-- I'm a navigator.

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:09.980 align:middle line:90%
It's easy for me to do.

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:12.680 align:middle line:84%
Latitude and longitude is
synonymous with declination

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:14.240 align:middle line:90%
and right ascension.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.360 align:middle line:90%
So I match the skies.

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:16.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You should
run for politics,

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:18.710 align:middle line:84%
because I can't get a
straight answer out of you.

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:19.959 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Well, it's all over.

00:25:19.959 --> 00:25:21.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who built these?

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:22.530 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: We did, as people.

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:26.390 align:middle line:84%
But it's a universal knowledge
that is here, expressed.

00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:29.720 align:middle line:84%
This knowledge will work
on any oblate spheroid

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:30.870 align:middle line:90%
orbiting a stellar body.

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:33.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you say,
we as people built this,

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.820 align:middle line:84%
are you saying
civilizations built this

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:37.630 align:middle line:90%
65 million years ago?

00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:39.384 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: Push it
back to maybe 125.

00:25:39.384 --> 00:25:40.950 align:middle line:90%
65 was when they went offline.

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:41.616 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Humans?

00:25:41.616 --> 00:25:42.620 align:middle line:90%
Or extraterrestrials?

00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:44.810 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: Well, you've
got this little guy,

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:47.130 align:middle line:90%
looks not quite like a human.

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:50.047 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you look at the
face, he looks a little bit odd.

00:25:50.047 --> 00:25:51.630 align:middle line:84%
But he doesn't look
like the Egyptians

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:55.714 align:middle line:84%
with their little sandals
or anything like that.

00:25:55.714 --> 00:25:56.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And then they left?

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:57.910 align:middle line:90%
Or they're gone?

00:25:57.910 --> 00:26:00.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: Well, the
civilization was destroyed.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And so there was nothing
here for such a long time.

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And when you get into
the Noah part of this,

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Noah was an unaltered DNA
that wasn't infiltrated

00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:13.539 align:middle line:84%
by the Nephilim
coming down and having

00:26:13.539 --> 00:26:15.330 align:middle line:84%
sex with the daughters
of men, so to speak,

00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:17.160 align:middle line:90%
and created the race of giants.

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:21.000 align:middle line:84%
So in the myth of history and
time, God destroyed-- I mean,

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:21.970 align:middle line:90%
I use the word God.

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:24.350 align:middle line:84%
He, she, I don't want
to go into there.

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:28.170 align:middle line:84%
But when that happened,
civilization got another jump

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:33.930 align:middle line:84%
start, but not until mankind--
6-, 7-, 8,000 years ago--

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:36.550 align:middle line:84%
started digging in the
ruins and coming up.

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:38.470 align:middle line:84%
But then you notice
globally, everybody

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:40.730 align:middle line:84%
has the same
celestial constants.

00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:44.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, things that how can
they know 365, 2, 4, 2, 4

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:45.080 align:middle line:90%
is the solar year.

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:48.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, even how could
people be so off in time?

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:53.390 align:middle line:84%
When you say this is
125 million years old,

00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:58.270 align:middle line:84%
and modern Egyptologists
are saying 5,000,

00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:02.927 align:middle line:84%
maybe 10,000 years old, we're
talking about a huge disparity.

00:27:02.927 --> 00:27:03.510 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Yes.

00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:04.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huge!

00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And how could they
be so off from you?

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:10.644 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: Well, in this
country, as an example--

00:27:10.644 --> 00:27:12.185 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm not
saying you're wrong.

00:27:12.185 --> 00:27:12.470 align:middle line:90%
But how could they be--

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:13.230 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: No, no.

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:14.030 align:middle line:90%
I can understand.

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:16.280 align:middle line:84%
Because we didn't rediscover
cement until the last

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:19.490 align:middle line:84%
maybe 200 years in the
culture of lost technology.

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:21.120 align:middle line:90%
And then we find it again.

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:22.940 align:middle line:90%
But Rome was using cement.

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And they have water cement
that they put under water,

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:25.940 align:middle line:90%
and it still--

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:27.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the Greeks
were using cement.

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:27.810 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Exactly.

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:29.480 align:middle line:84%
But they got all
that from Egypt.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:32.340 align:middle line:84%
But then not only
that, so to speak,

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:35.000 align:middle line:84%
because I've been
looking now in Italy,

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.980 align:middle line:84%
in the ruins that they're
digging underneath,

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:39.800 align:middle line:84%
and I'm finding these same
coins in the structures

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:42.870 align:middle line:84%
underneath what
would be before Rome.

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:46.100 align:middle line:84%
You know, the history is
on a global level here.

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's what confuses you
until you get that what caused

00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:51.460 align:middle line:84%
all of this, will you start
to when you see it understand,

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:52.060 align:middle line:90%
aha.

00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:52.890 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes, yes.

00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:55.480 align:middle line:84%
Now it all makes
chronological sense.

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:57.470 align:middle line:84%
But this is the
reason why I didn't

00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:59.350 align:middle line:84%
go for the degree in
Egyptology, because I

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:02.710 align:middle line:84%
had to learn everything, and
say Khufu, Khafre, Menkaure did

00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:06.520 align:middle line:84%
this, and so and so,
to get the degree.

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And then after I got the degree,
to tell you what I really know,

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:11.440 align:middle line:90%
that's all gone.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:12.510 align:middle line:90%
The paradigm shifted.

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:15.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any
reference base for what

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:18.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing in any of
the annals of history.

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:19.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you guessing?

00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:20.071 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: No.

00:28:20.071 --> 00:28:21.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm using scientific approaches.

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:23.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm using geology.

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.900 align:middle line:84%
As a navigator, I can
plot the Orion stars.

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:26.880 align:middle line:90%
I can pull them down.

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:30.550 align:middle line:84%
I can confirm this building is
an expression of all the laws

00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:32.030 align:middle line:84%
that govern gravity
as it relates.

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:33.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm a navigator.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.720 align:middle line:84%
The sciences that I used to
navigate ships around the world

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:38.460 align:middle line:84%
is the same science that's
implied in this building.

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:40.240 align:middle line:84%
So the universal
knowledge-- when

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:46.680 align:middle line:84%
you say universal-- we couldn't
think all this up and know all

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:49.900 align:middle line:84%
that gravity and express
that in that form

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:52.560 align:middle line:84%
if it wasn't some kind
of universal knowledge,

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:55.970 align:middle line:84%
because this is too awesome
for man to think it up,

00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:58.470 align:middle line:84%
figure out how to make
these coins, make everything

00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:02.390 align:middle line:84%
lay just like it is-- instead of
a father, a son, and a grandson

00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:03.446 align:middle line:90%
decided this one.

00:29:03.446 --> 00:29:04.320 align:middle line:90%
And then he's little.

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:06.017 align:middle line:84%
And then this one,
he's more rich.

00:29:06.017 --> 00:29:07.350 align:middle line:90%
But he builds a smaller pyramid.

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:09.850 align:middle line:84%
They use all kinds of
ways to describe stuff,

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:13.030 align:middle line:84%
just to fit their-- I call
it the romantic Egypt,

00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:17.600 align:middle line:84%
Cleopatra and Mark
Antony, and just history.

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:19.300 align:middle line:84%
But there was a
history before that.

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's we're
all this leads me.

00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:21.560 align:middle line:90%
It's a prehistory.

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:23.147 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is this lost knowledge?

00:29:23.147 --> 00:29:23.730 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Yes.

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:26.382 align:middle line:84%
That's what the patent that I
wrote, it's this abandonment.

00:29:26.382 --> 00:29:28.340 align:middle line:84%
Because I asked my attorney
this same question.

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:32.650 align:middle line:84%
I says, Charles, it's
not like I invented this.

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:35.040 align:middle line:90%
I just reverse engineered it.

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And this was already
in existence.

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.990 align:middle line:84%
He says, well,
Larry, we consider

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:41.300 align:middle line:90%
that an abandoned technology.

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:42.701 align:middle line:90%
So it was abandoned and lost.

00:29:42.701 --> 00:29:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote a patent
that brought it

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:48.174 align:middle line:84%
back up into a usable format
that people could understand.

00:29:48.174 --> 00:29:49.340 align:middle line:90%
And it's a little difficult.

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:51.548 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because you're really
a knowledgeable person.

00:29:51.548 --> 00:29:53.820 align:middle line:84%
I've watched you for
many years talking

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:56.110 align:middle line:84%
about the Nephilim
and the Anunnaki,

00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:59.737 align:middle line:90%
and 450,000 by Zecharia Sitchin.

00:29:59.737 --> 00:30:00.320 align:middle line:90%
And so and so.

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:01.460 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's all in here.

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:02.730 align:middle line:90%
Trust me.

00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:05.030 align:middle line:84%
But even you who
have this history

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:09.090 align:middle line:84%
to push you off that mark,
it's a little not so easy.

00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:11.150 align:middle line:84%
But hopefully through
this presentation,

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:14.347 align:middle line:84%
you will get an idea
of, maybe he's on it.

>>NOORY: Well, you
know, Michael Cremo

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:20.490 align:middle line:84%
says that civilizations could
be 100 billion years old.

00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:22.220 align:middle line:90%
And maybe that echoes this.

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:23.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Look at the Milky Way.

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:25.760 align:middle line:84%
Look at our sun
in the Milky Way.

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:27.392 align:middle line:90%
We're just one of billions.

00:30:27.392 --> 00:30:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And then when you go
down to see our sun,

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:31.780 align:middle line:84%
we've got nine or 10
planets orbiting it.

00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:35.370 align:middle line:10%
And the knowledge of an oblate
planet moving around the sun,

00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:37.660 align:middle line:10%
if you took how many days
it took to go around,

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:39.420 align:middle line:10%
then you set a
measurement system

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:42.020 align:middle line:10%
that's commensurate with
that motion for that planet,

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:46.220 align:middle line:10%
and then erect a geometry that
expresses the number of days

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:48.460 align:middle line:10%
of its orbit around
the sun to govern

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:51.660 align:middle line:10%
the uniquenesses of that
pyramid, that pyramid on that

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:53.810 align:middle line:10%
planet will do the same
thing that this one would

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:55.744 align:middle line:10%
do if it was rebuilt.

00:30:55.744 --> 00:30:57.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Larry, give out
your website one more time,

00:30:57.910 --> 00:30:58.420 align:middle line:90%
would you?

00:30:58.420 --> 00:30:59.180 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Larryhunter.com.

00:30:59.180 --> 00:30:59.971 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's it.

00:30:59.971 --> 00:31:00.700 align:middle line:10%
Simple as that.

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:02.430 align:middle line:10%
Larryhunter.com.

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:04.570 align:middle line:10%
In our next edition, we'll
talk a little bit more

00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:08.110 align:middle line:10%
about who built these pyramids.

00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:09.212 align:middle line:10%
It might shock you.

00:31:09.212 --> 00:31:09.920 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:12.760 align:middle line:10%
And thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
