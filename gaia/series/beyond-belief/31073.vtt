I think many people today

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.990 align:middle line:84%

How many of us

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.690 align:middle line:90%
And what the heck might they be?

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.070 align:middle line:90%
And what about angels?

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.700 align:middle line:84%
Have we ever had an
angelic intervention?

>> GUILEY: The

>> NOORY: Have a seat.

00:01:10.931 --> 00:01:11.430 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.860 align:middle line:90%
What's new?

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: I'm busy out
investigating all the time.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing hauntings,
entity contact experiences,

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.430 align:middle line:84%
UFO sightings, mysterious
creatures, angels, fairies.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.990 align:middle line:84%
As you know, George, I'm in
everything, light, dark, angels

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.825 align:middle line:84%
to zombies, and
everything in between.

00:01:28.825 --> 00:01:30.200 align:middle line:84%
So it keeps me on
the road a lot.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.560 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How did you get
interested in this unusual

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.420 align:middle line:90%
aspect of your career?

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.580 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: Like a lot of people,
I had childhood experiences,

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.220 align:middle line:90%
mostly with angels and fairies.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.370 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes kids see dead people.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.880 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see them until
I got to be a lot older.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.760 align:middle line:84%
But it whetted my
curiosity about the unseen.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.590 align:middle line:84%
Because when I got
older I discovered

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.740 align:middle line:84%
that not everybody has
the same experiences.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And there were people who told
me that it was all in my head,

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.200 align:middle line:84%
it was all in my imagination,
yet I knew it wasn't.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.260 align:middle line:84%
So that really was
the early beginnings

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.690 align:middle line:84%
that fueled my life-long
quest to understand

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.400 align:middle line:84%
the unseen, the paranormal, the
mystical, and the metaphysical.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.139 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I got to
know Rosemary, gosh,

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:12.510 align:middle line:84%
years ago when we did our very
first show on Coast to Coast

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.840 align:middle line:84%
called "The
Encyclopedia of Dreams."

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.040 align:middle line:84%
And I think we probably
even talked a little bit

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.930 align:middle line:90%
before that too.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.970 align:middle line:84%
I was rummaging
through a library,

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.780 align:middle line:84%
and I came across
her book, and I

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.020 align:middle line:90%
said, boy, this is fascinating.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.810 align:middle line:84%
So we'll talk about everything
today, ghosts, angels, fairies,

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:30.814 align:middle line:90%
dreams, you name it.

00:02:30.814 --> 00:02:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: You know
I like to mix it up.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.938 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You do
love to mix it up.

00:02:33.938 --> 00:02:38.020 align:middle line:84%
But doesn't that tell you
there's something truly unusual

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.220 align:middle line:90%
about this universe?

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.160 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: To me, the unseen
is present in our daily life.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.170 align:middle line:84%
We live in an
interdimensional Earth,

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.480 align:middle line:90%
a multi-dimensional reality.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And most of these things are
beyond our waking awareness,

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.450 align:middle line:84%
but they intrude on us
at appropriate moments.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.670 align:middle line:84%
When we need help, for example,
from divine intervention, when

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.040 align:middle line:84%
we get frightened by something
that we think should not be,

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.030 align:middle line:84%
like a mysterious
creature, these worlds

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.750 align:middle line:84%
are right next to
ours all the time.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe that
we're entering into an age

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.250 align:middle line:84%
where our consciousness is going
to expand to take it all in.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.060 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
interdimensional neighbors

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.802 align:middle line:84%
in the very near future that we
deal with on a regular basis.

00:03:18.802 --> 00:03:21.260 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: A little bit later
on, Rosemary's brought us some

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.440 align:middle line:84%
ghostly toys we're going to
look at and see how they work.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.490 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk a little bit
about ghosts, first of all.

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.920 align:middle line:84%
All of us, all of us wonder
about what's on the other side.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.320 align:middle line:84%
Does life exist beyond the
dying of the physical body?

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.480 align:middle line:84%
You're a staunch believer
that, of course, it exists.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.700 align:middle line:84%
There's something
else out there.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.000 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about ghosts.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.411 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:03:44.411 --> 00:03:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And tell me about
the people who try

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.286 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with them
through all kinds of means.

00:03:49.286 --> 00:03:51.910 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: I've actually revised
my thinking on ghosts a number

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.540 align:middle line:84%
times, since I've researched
over several decades now.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.470 align:middle line:84%
But most of the ghosts that we
experience in haunted places

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.550 align:middle line:84%
seem to be residues left
behind by the living.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.140 align:middle line:84%
They're like memories
or energy imprints,

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.090 align:middle line:84%
like you would look at a photo
album or listen to recordings.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.630 align:middle line:84%
They leave behind their
emotional imprints.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we pick
that up in sounds,

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.290 align:middle line:90%
like mysterious footsteps.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.240 align:middle line:90%
We see apparitions.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.970 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time these
are repetitive actions.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.150 align:middle line:84%
They happen over and over
again in the same place

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.402 align:middle line:90%
in the same way.

00:04:25.402 --> 00:04:26.860 align:middle line:84%
But then we get
into hauntings that

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.980 align:middle line:84%
are a little more active where
entities seem to be aware of us

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.730 align:middle line:84%
and deliberately
engage our attention.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.930 align:middle line:84%
Some of these may
be earthbound souls,

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.020 align:middle line:84%
people who, for a time,
which could stretch

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.470 align:middle line:84%
from months to even years,
don't make it to the afterlife.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.250 align:middle line:84%
They remain behind because
they don't want to let go.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.680 align:middle line:90%
They've got unfinished business.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.513 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they don't
even know they're dead.

00:04:49.513 --> 00:04:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
spirits haunting too,

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:53.880 align:middle line:90%
but that's another category.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.950 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And what
about demon hauntings?

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:58.070 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: Well, demon
hauntings are on the rise,

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.470 align:middle line:90%
at least reports of them are.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.820 align:middle line:84%
Some years ago I started
getting a lot of cases

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.640 align:middle line:84%
from people who were having
problematic hauntings,

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.640 align:middle line:84%
activity that troubled
them, nightmares,

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.560 align:middle line:90%
unpleasant phenomena.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And there seemed to be
very ugly entities present

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.180 align:middle line:84%
that they could
not make go away.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.130 align:middle line:84%
I began doing a lot
of research on this,

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.640 align:middle line:84%
and now it comprises a lot
of my field investigations,

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.180 align:middle line:84%
what I call negative
entity hauntings.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.880 align:middle line:84%
These can happen for
a variety of reasons.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.160 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes these dark
entities attach to people.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.070 align:middle line:84%
People have weaknesses
in their boundaries,

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.730 align:middle line:84%
or they've got a lot
of emotional turmoil

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:40.050 align:middle line:90%
that enables spirits to attach.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.880 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's because they
move on to the wrong piece

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.170 align:middle line:90%
of property.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And these entities aren't evil
per se, but they're hostile.

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:50.120 align:middle line:90%
They own the land, so to speak.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.210 align:middle line:84%
They have an interdimensional
gateway in a place.

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.044 align:middle line:84%
And human beings come
and plunk down a house

00:05:56.044 --> 00:05:57.710 align:middle line:84%
and start living in
it, and the entities

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:58.760 align:middle line:90%
say, hey, wait a minute.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.755 align:middle line:90%
This is my territory.

00:05:59.755 --> 00:06:00.570 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Get out.

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: And I'm going to
be very unhappy and make you

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.080 align:middle line:84%
pretty miserable
until you leave.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.310 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Take us through
the moment of death.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.040 align:middle line:90%
What happens on this crossover?

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.460 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: I believe that
we go to a between place,

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:16.610 align:middle line:90%
a transitional place.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.250 align:middle line:84%
Because even when
death is not violent,

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.540 align:middle line:84%
like it happens in
sleep or it's expected,

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:28.220 align:middle line:84%
like through a terminal illness,
we still need a time to adjust.

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.260 align:middle line:84%
So we go to a place that's
very familiar to us.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.700 align:middle line:84%
In all the literature
that's been channelled

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.170 align:middle line:84%
through mediums and through
spirit communications,

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:42.070 align:middle line:84%
this seems to be something
very much like Earth,

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:43.420 align:middle line:90%
like a park-like setting.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.050 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's often
called the park.

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.970 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are we
aware that we're dead?

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:49.640 align:middle line:90%
>> GUILEY: In many cases, yes.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.250 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes when we have
a violent transitions,

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:53.500 align:middle line:90%
unexpected through accidents--

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.083 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: A car
accident or something.

00:06:55.083 --> 00:06:58.930 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: --car accidents
or natural disasters or even

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.964 align:middle line:84%
an unexpected criminal assault,
we may not realize that

00:07:02.964 --> 00:07:03.880 align:middle line:90%
we're dead right away.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.110 align:middle line:84%
So we meet people
from the other side.

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And we're greeted by
family and friends,

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.360 align:middle line:84%
sometimes angels,
divine helpers,

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.340 align:middle line:84%
and we're kind of
shown the ropes.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:18.070 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people travel
through a tunnel of light.

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.930 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they just find
themselves in the park.

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:24.220 align:middle line:84%
Then we're allowed to
adjust to the afterlife.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:29.170 align:middle line:84%
I believe that it reflects
our thoughts and our feelings.

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:32.300 align:middle line:84%
And initially, people
may want a place

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.130 align:middle line:84%
very much like what
they left behind.

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:39.570 align:middle line:84%
What we're told by the dead is
that the afterlife transforms

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:42.080 align:middle line:84%
itself instantly
to our thoughts.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.940 align:middle line:84%
So we can have the
home we really wanted.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.790 align:middle line:84%
We can have the
body that we feel

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:50.940 align:middle line:84%
is ideal for us,
the state of age

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.600 align:middle line:84%
where we felt we
were at our best.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And then I believe
that we evolve.

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.890 align:middle line:84%
We get adjusted
to the afterlife,

00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:59.760 align:middle line:84%
and we discover that
there are other states

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.815 align:middle line:84%
of being, other things that
we as souls are called to do.

00:08:03.815 --> 00:08:04.940 align:middle line:90%
I believe in reincarnation.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:05.565 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:08:05.565 --> 00:08:08.690 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: So at some point, we
decide what we're going to do

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:10.299 align:middle line:90%
in our next incarnation.

00:08:10.299 --> 00:08:12.090 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is that our
choice, to come back?

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:14.815 align:middle line:84%
Or is there somebody up
there who says, time for you

00:08:14.815 --> 00:08:16.610 align:middle line:90%
to go back, Rosemary?

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:18.910 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: I believe
it's largely up to us.

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:23.820 align:middle line:84%
In fact, most of the channelled
literature and communications

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.660 align:middle line:84%
from the other side
indicate that we're

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:29.030 align:middle line:84%
the ones who assess our lives
and how well we've done.

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:31.470 align:middle line:84%
We have some sort
of spirit help.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:36.429 align:middle line:84%
I do believe in a unifying
divine presence, a God presence

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:42.230 align:middle line:84%
that holds everything together
and that we are very, very much

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:45.050 align:middle line:84%
a part of this
eternal wholeness,

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:48.790 align:middle line:84%
and it is our goal as
souls to unite with that.

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:53.440 align:middle line:84%
But we're often the
harshest judges we have,

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.580 align:middle line:90%
in terms of how well we do.

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And I believe in the
law of cause and effect

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.340 align:middle line:84%
and the law of karma, that
we have to compensate.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:05.570 align:middle line:84%
We're rewarded for
things for the way we've

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:08.620 align:middle line:84%
advanced our
enlightenment, and we

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.520 align:middle line:84%
have to compensate
for some of the things

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:16.216 align:middle line:90%
that we've done to hold us back.

00:09:16.216 --> 00:09:16.840 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.710 align:middle line:84%
I wrote a book with Rosemary
called "Talking to the Dead."

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And she did the lion's share
of the research for us on this.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.860 align:middle line:84%
When you were putting together
the structure of that book,

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:31.010 align:middle line:84%
did you come across
anything that

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:36.780 align:middle line:84%
wowed you, that marvelled
you, that shocked you?

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:40.240 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: I'm often surprised
by the research that I do.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And that book was such
a fabulous project

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.770 align:middle line:84%
to work on, because I've studied
spirit communications for so

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:47.780 align:middle line:84%
many years, and we've had so
many conversations about it.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:51.660 align:middle line:84%
But some of the communications
were quite startling to me

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:56.300 align:middle line:84%
about how we evolve in
the afterlife and some

00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:00.150 align:middle line:84%
of the things that are
possible for us, the alliances

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:02.010 align:middle line:84%
that we have with
spiritual helpers

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:05.530 align:middle line:84%
and how they assist us in
ways that we don't even

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:09.031 align:middle line:90%
realize while we're living.

00:10:09.031 --> 00:10:11.030 align:middle line:84%
The message that kept
coming back for me is it's

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:13.380 align:middle line:84%
so important to be
aware of that now.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.850 align:middle line:84%
Because we can
speed up our growth,

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:21.990 align:middle line:84%
our advancement and make things
better for us in the long run

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:24.300 align:middle line:84%
by becoming more
aware of that now.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.870 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that
astonished me were

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:27.630 align:middle line:84%
some of the images
that have been

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:29.970 align:middle line:90%
transmitted from the afterlife.

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:31.950 align:middle line:84%
And as you and I
know from looking

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:34.670 align:middle line:84%
at a lot of the evidence,
it's controversial.

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:38.230 align:middle line:84%
Some people say, oh,
well, this can't be.

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:42.380 align:middle line:84%
There's no way that you can
transmit photographs and even

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.010 align:middle line:90%
film from the afterlife.

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And yet researchers
around the world

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:49.530 align:middle line:84%
have accumulated
piles of evidence

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:51.090 align:middle line:90%
that's very hard to dismiss.

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:54.180 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And these figures
are showing up on digital

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:58.060 align:middle line:84%
photography scenes,
truly unbelievable.

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:01.340 align:middle line:84%
There was one case
where some people towed

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:05.680 align:middle line:84%
a car that was in an
accident into a tow lot,

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.950 align:middle line:84%
and then they had a
security camera on it.

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:11.310 align:middle line:84%
And the next day as they
looked at the picture,

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:14.660 align:middle line:84%
they saw a ghostly
figure running

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.870 align:middle line:84%
around that car that had
been pulled into the lot that

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:20.800 align:middle line:84%
had been just involved
in a fatal car accident

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.830 align:middle line:84%
all over the place,
as if it were

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:24.530 align:middle line:90%
the spirit of the dead person.

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:25.740 align:middle line:90%
Truly amazing.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.151 align:middle line:90%
You can't make that stuff up.

00:11:28.151 --> 00:11:30.150 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: We have, going
back to ancient times,

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:33.200 align:middle line:84%
traditions that we linger
around the body after death,

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.160 align:middle line:84%
no matter what kind of
transition we've had.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.900 align:middle line:84%
When people are involved
in accidents like that,

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:41.020 align:middle line:90%
there is this shock.

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And they do stay
around their body.

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:46.350 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they try to
get back in their bodies,

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:51.630 align:middle line:84%
and they realize that they can't
because the body is no longer

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:56.520 align:middle line:90%
a viable medium for the soul.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And this often shows up
in our photography now.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:00.920 align:middle line:84%
We've got more and
more sophisticated

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.770 align:middle line:84%
equipment that's capable
of picking it up.

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:04.710 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You can
see these images.

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:08.840 align:middle line:84%
When somebody dies, let's
say, in their sleep,

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.460 align:middle line:84%
might be the most peaceful
way to go, by the way,

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:15.360 align:middle line:84%
do they enter into
their spirit body?

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.440 align:middle line:84%
Do they get out of
their dead body?

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.180 align:middle line:84%
Do they see themselves in
bed going what's going on,

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:20.900 align:middle line:90%
what is this?

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:25.520 align:middle line:84%
Or do they just zoom off
into this other plane?

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:30.140 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: There are a
variety of ways we can exit.

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.270 align:middle line:84%
And these are according
to communications

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:36.560 align:middle line:84%
that we've gotten from
people in the afterlife.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.035 align:middle line:84%
Some say they go to
sleep and they wake up

00:12:39.035 --> 00:12:40.310 align:middle line:90%
in their new place.

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And at first they think
that they must be dreaming.

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:44.960 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.410 align:middle line:90%
>> GUILEY: But it seems so real.

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And it gradually
dawns on them or they

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:52.380 align:middle line:84%
are informed by those who
come to greet them and help

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:55.940 align:middle line:84%
the transition that they
have, in fact, left the body.

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:59.360 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they see
themselves departing the body

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.610 align:middle line:90%
or feel themselves.

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:04.200 align:middle line:84%
They can feel themselves drawn
up often through the head.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.870 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they go out
through the solar plexus.

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly they're
floating above the body.

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And then they see a
light, which a lot

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:15.710 align:middle line:84%
of near-death experiencers
have reported,

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:17.430 align:middle line:84%
a light that grows
bigger and brighter

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:21.630 align:middle line:84%
and starts pulling them in,
almost like a tractor beam.

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And they go very quickly
through this tunnel of light

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:27.294 align:middle line:84%
and emerge out into a
brand new existence.

00:13:27.294 --> 00:13:28.210 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Fascinating.

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:29.870 align:middle line:84%
Let's take some
questions for Rosemary

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:32.520 align:middle line:84%
here on "Beyond Belief"
as we talk about ghosts.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.470 align:middle line:90%
Who's got a question here?

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:36.080 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.080 align:middle line:90%
Right here.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:41.630 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Do you think
that the energy of the ghostly

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:46.550 align:middle line:84%
presence is a speeded up energy
and that's why people can't see

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:47.050 align:middle line:90%
them?

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:51.270 align:middle line:84%
Or is it only
people that believe

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:52.890 align:middle line:84%
that they could
see ghosts they'd

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:55.065 align:middle line:90%
be then able to see them?

00:13:55.065 --> 00:13:55.690 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:58.160 align:middle line:90%
Who sees these entities?

00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:59.870 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: Anybody
can see ghosts.

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:03.330 align:middle line:84%
But people who are born
with a more marked degree

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:07.610 align:middle line:84%
of psychic sensitivity have
an easier time seeing them.

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:10.760 align:middle line:84%
Almost everybody
I've met has had

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:14.240 align:middle line:84%
some kind of ghostly experience
at some times in their lives.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.470 align:middle line:84%
But ghosts are, they're
neither in this world

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:19.190 align:middle line:90%
nor in the other world.

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they often
appear filmy or semi-transparent

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:26.710 align:middle line:90%
and often semi-formed.

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:30.440 align:middle line:84%
It's very unusual, for
example, to see extremities

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:33.565 align:middle line:84%
like fingers, like the
lower limbs, like feet.

00:14:33.565 --> 00:14:34.674 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:14:34.674 --> 00:14:35.840 align:middle line:90%
>> GUILEY: They're sort of--

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:36.830 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: The legs are always--

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:37.000 align:middle line:90%
>> GUILEY: --floating.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:37.410 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: --blurred away.

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:38.430 align:middle line:90%
>> GUILEY: Blurry.

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes the
outlines are very blurry.

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:43.720 align:middle line:84%
There are times
when ghosts actually

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.790 align:middle line:84%
appear to be very
flesh and blood.

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's what really
startles people,

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:50.260 align:middle line:84%
because they think that they're
looking at a real person,

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.982 align:middle line:84%
and then, boom, it's
gone in an instant.

00:14:52.982 --> 00:14:55.440 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: The arm goes through
them or something like that.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.981 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: The arm
goes through them,

00:14:56.981 --> 00:14:59.590 align:middle line:84%
or they watch them walk through
a wall or drop down through

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:00.780 align:middle line:90%
the floor.

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:06.950 align:middle line:90%
These are liminal forms.

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:08.242 align:middle line:90%
They're neither here nor there.

00:15:08.242 --> 00:15:09.658 align:middle line:84%
They're sort of
caught in between.

00:15:09.658 --> 00:15:10.830 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They're in limbo.

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:12.910 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: They're literally
in a type of limbo.

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And when we get into the
right place in the right state

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.230 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness,
we can see these.

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:20.070 align:middle line:90%
They're around us all the time.

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:23.375 align:middle line:84%
We've probably got ghosts here
watching the broadcast now.

00:15:23.375 --> 00:15:25.250 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: We may have
ghosts in the audience.

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:27.870 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: I think we probably
have an invisible audience with

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:30.420 align:middle line:84%
us, because they like to
tune into this sort of thing.

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:32.296 align:middle line:84%
But most the time we're
just not aware of it.

00:15:32.296 --> 00:15:33.128 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

00:15:33.128 --> 00:15:34.650 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to our
"Beyond Belief" cam.

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:37.647 align:middle line:84%
We've got a question
for Rosemary.

00:15:37.647 --> 00:15:38.730 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Hi, Rosemary.

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:40.600 align:middle line:90%
My name is Eva from Los Angeles.

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.190 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know
what makes people

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:44.984 align:middle line:84%
scared of ghosts
and the afterlife.

00:15:44.984 --> 00:15:45.890 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Aha.

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:48.640 align:middle line:84%
So why are you scared of the
ghosts and the afterlife?

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.000 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: Well,
people startle us.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.164 align:middle line:84%
And ghosts startle us so when
they come upon us suddenly.

00:15:56.164 --> 00:15:58.080 align:middle line:84%
You know, someone creeps
up on you from behind

00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.770 align:middle line:84%
and you don't know
they're there,

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:02.170 align:middle line:84%
you're going to jump when
they make themselves present.

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's just the
way it is with ghosts.

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:07.950 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, we're aware of
something that should not be,

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:09.920 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't belong there.

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And for many people,
because we don't see them

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:14.120 align:middle line:84%
on a daily basis,
it's frightening.

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:17.180 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what they
are, where they came from.

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:19.940 align:middle line:84%
The media have
conditioned us to be

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:21.970 align:middle line:84%
scared that we're
going to be attacked

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:24.420 align:middle line:84%
or something creepy
is going to happen.

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.410 align:middle line:84%
Actually, most ghosts
are very benign.

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:28.260 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: The
little children EVP,

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.980 align:middle line:84%
Electronic Voice Phenomena,
sounds kind of creeps me out.

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:33.357 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:16:33.357 --> 00:16:35.440 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: Sometimes those
are spirit masquerades.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.390 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They're sad.

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:37.460 align:middle line:90%
>> GUILEY: They are sad.

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And children, they can get
stuck in transition too and get

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:47.680 align:middle line:84%
lost looking for
home, so to speak.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.700 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes it's spirits
masquerading as children.

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's because
we're automatically

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.380 align:middle line:90%
sympathetic to a child.

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:58.080 align:middle line:90%
We want to help a child in need.

00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.330 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They're tricking us.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:01.900 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: We're more
likely to open up.

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:02.740 align:middle line:90%
But it's both.

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:08.359 align:middle line:84%
We can get very poignant audio
recordings and even photographs

00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:12.085 align:middle line:84%
of children who have left
some piece of them behind.

00:17:12.085 --> 00:17:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Let's go to another
question for Rosemary Ellen

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:16.260 align:middle line:90%
Guiley here on "Beyond Belief."

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.604 align:middle line:90%
Yes, way in the back here.

00:17:18.604 --> 00:17:19.270 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:21.839 align:middle line:84%
For the past two
years, about once

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:27.420 align:middle line:84%
a week, I've been visited while
sleeping by something that

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:31.080 align:middle line:84%
feels just like a cat
jumping onto the bed

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:32.400 align:middle line:90%
and settling by my chest.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.120 align:middle line:90%


00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.410 align:middle line:90%
Is this common?

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:39.744 align:middle line:84%
And do you think
this may be a djinn?

00:17:39.744 --> 00:17:41.410 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, and
let's ask you first,

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:44.090 align:middle line:84%
have you ever had a
cat that passed on?

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:45.500 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes, I have.

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:46.720 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Rosemary.

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.220 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: There are a number
of explanations that could fit

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:50.140 align:middle line:90%
this scenario.

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And first of all, it's
very common for people

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:55.780 align:middle line:84%
to be visited by
entities, by dead people,

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.270 align:middle line:90%
and by animals at night.

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:00.870 align:middle line:90%
They often get up on the bed.

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:02.040 align:middle line:90%
Animals will jump up.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.565 align:middle line:84%
We'll fell the
pressure coming down.

00:18:03.565 --> 00:18:05.070 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You can see
the paw prints, right?

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:07.445 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: You might even see
something walking on a bed,

00:18:07.445 --> 00:18:10.350 align:middle line:84%
or you feel a depression and
even see the bed depress.

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:13.120 align:middle line:84%
You may not see anything
like the animal form,

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:15.430 align:middle line:84%
but you might have a
sense that it's a cat,

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:17.780 align:middle line:84%
or you might hear some
sound that a cat would

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:19.440 align:middle line:90%
be likely to make.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:22.990 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes people are
visited by their dead pets.

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:28.090 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes spirits do masquerade
in different forms too.

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And those spirits like
to play jokes on us.

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:32.400 align:middle line:90%
They like to upset us.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.780 align:middle line:84%
They'll visit us
suddenly in the middle

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:37.890 align:middle line:84%
of the night
attempting to scare us.

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:40.550 align:middle line:84%
It's difficult to know
sometimes exactly what it

00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:43.100 align:middle line:84%
is until you study the
behavior for a while.

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:45.390 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Could this
have been his dead cat?

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:47.100 align:middle line:90%
>> GUILEY: Quite possibly.

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:51.310 align:middle line:84%
When we have ghostly
presences, like dead people

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:53.740 align:middle line:84%
and dead animals,
it's often repetitive,

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:56.250 align:middle line:84%
the same thing will
happen in the same way

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:58.060 align:middle line:90%
at about the same time.

00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:00.400 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it depends
on the length of time

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.940 align:middle line:84%
that's passed since an
animal or a person died.

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:05.870 align:middle line:84%
The longer the
time that goes by,

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:07.910 align:middle line:84%
the less frequently
those sorts of things

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:11.730 align:middle line:84%
happen, because the energy
from this plane of existence

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:16.130 align:middle line:84%
starts to withdraw more and
more into the afterlife.

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:18.740 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Should he be scared?

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:21.961 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: A person should be
scared only if negative things

00:19:21.961 --> 00:19:22.460 align:middle line:90%
happen.

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:25.870 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the threshold of
what frightens a person varies.

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:27.860 align:middle line:90%
Some people scare very easily.

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:29.980 align:middle line:84%
And other people
are more curious.

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:31.990 align:middle line:84%
They want to know
what's going on.

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:35.940 align:middle line:84%
So I tell people that it depends
on where their threshold is.

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And if they ever start to
feel that something is hostile

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:45.080 align:middle line:84%
or that bad things happen to
them, like they're scratched

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.600 align:middle line:84%
or they feel suffocated
or pressed on,

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:51.160 align:middle line:84%
these are not good signs and
may indicate a spirit presence

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:52.637 align:middle line:90%
instead of a benign ghost.

00:19:52.637 --> 00:19:53.470 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:55.410 align:middle line:84%
Let's take one more
question for Rosemary.

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:56.740 align:middle line:90%
Who's got one?

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:57.962 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:57.962 --> 00:19:58.670 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:00.260 align:middle line:90%
My son is five years old.

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And since he was three, he
has an imaginary friend.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if it's a
friend or it's a ghost.

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:09.151 align:middle line:90%
He calls him Ghostie.

00:20:09.151 --> 00:20:12.800 align:middle line:84%
It just shows up when he's
scared or going to school.

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:16.920 align:middle line:84%
But lately his little cousin who
he hangs out with who's three

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:20.990 align:middle line:84%
has also been seeing Ghostie
and has been traveling with her.

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:23.350 align:middle line:84%
Is this a common
thing for two kids

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:27.100 align:middle line:84%
to be seeing the same
imaginary friend?

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:29.530 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: It is common for
children to see imaginary

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:31.490 align:middle line:90%
playmates and often in groups.

00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:34.570 align:middle line:84%
When I was a kid, I had these
kinds of experiences myself,

00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:37.530 align:middle line:84%
and I shared them with other
children that I played with.

00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:40.360 align:middle line:84%
We had invisible
playmates that came,

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:44.390 align:middle line:84%
and they brought their little
invisible pets along with them.

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:46.660 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times these
experiences start

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:48.940 align:middle line:84%
to diminish as
children get older,

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:53.325 align:middle line:84%
and eventually they usually
fade off altogether.

00:20:53.325 --> 00:20:55.450 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But are they
imaginary, or are they real?

00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:56.783 align:middle line:90%
>> GUILEY: I think they're real.

00:20:56.783 --> 00:20:58.790 align:middle line:84%
We call them imaginary
because children

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:02.000 align:middle line:84%
have vivid imaginations,
and adults frequently

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.100 align:middle line:90%
don't see them as well.

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.800 align:middle line:84%
In fact, parents will often say,
oh, it's just your imagination.

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.390 align:middle line:90%
There's no such thing.

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:09.660 align:middle line:84%
But it's the faculty
of imagination

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:12.610 align:middle line:84%
that enables us to penetrate
these invisible realms,

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:16.390 align:middle line:90%
and children are just wide open.

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:21.180 align:middle line:84%
The things to watch out for
are is something just playful?

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:22.484 align:middle line:90%
Is somebody entertained?

00:21:22.484 --> 00:21:23.150 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:24.650 align:middle line:84%
Or is it something
serious, right?

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:26.170 align:middle line:90%
>> GUILEY: Or something serious.

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to know
very quickly whether or not

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:32.470 align:middle line:84%
a child is frightened
or is scared

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:34.910 align:middle line:84%
of certain parts of a
house because that's

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:37.330 align:middle line:90%
where Ghostie is, for example.

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:39.330 align:middle line:84%
My own belief is that
they're often fairies.

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:42.320 align:middle line:90%


00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:45.260 align:middle line:84%
Fairies take a great interest
in children, and many of them

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:48.450 align:middle line:84%
show up as playmates when
we're at a young age.

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:52.054 align:middle line:84%
They eventually fade out of a
child's life as they get older.

00:21:52.054 --> 00:21:54.470 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, they've got
to be friendly if a little kid

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:56.040 align:middle line:90%
calls it Ghostie, right?

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.740 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: It
sounds very playful.

00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:59.010 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah, it does.

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And so as a parent, do you
continue to allow that?

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:06.380 align:middle line:84%
Or do you try to
strike that down?

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:10.090 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: I tell parents
to monitor the situation.

00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:13.700 align:middle line:84%
Most children will have some
sort of paranormal experiences,

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:16.330 align:middle line:84%
and some of them talk
about them quite a bit.

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:18.460 align:middle line:90%
Others are a little more quiet.

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:22.950 align:middle line:84%
So it's a good idea to be not
too encouraging but accepting,

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:25.100 align:middle line:84%
not to dismiss
things out of hand,

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:29.150 align:middle line:84%
and to ask the child
questions about who

00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:33.880 align:middle line:84%
is Ghostie or little
green boy, for example?

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.230 align:middle line:90%
And what do you do with them?

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:37.280 align:middle line:90%
And where do they show up?

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.100 align:middle line:90%
And how often you see them?

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And just to monitor
the behavior.

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:46.150 align:middle line:84%
You never want to see a child
start to get frightened by what

00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:48.230 align:middle line:90%
they can see and you can't.

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:51.280 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I've recommended
that parents involve

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:54.200 align:middle line:84%
clinical professionals
to come in and help

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.540 align:middle line:90%
evaluate the situation.

00:22:56.540 --> 00:23:02.020 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes a child's
paranormal and imaginary lives

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:05.170 align:middle line:84%
can get wrapped up in a lot
of things going on in the home

00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:05.710 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:07.960 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: One of my little
granddaughters when she was

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:12.470 align:middle line:84%
about five had an imaginary
friend called Shiboozi.

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And she forced my
daughter, her mother,

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:22.140 align:middle line:84%
to always have a dinner plate
and a chair for Shiboozi.

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:24.170 align:middle line:84%
And so they would
have their dinner,

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:26.820 align:middle line:84%
and there would be this
empty plate for Shiboozi.

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:30.240 align:middle line:84%
And one day my daughter
sat down in the chair

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:33.330 align:middle line:84%
where Shiboozi was, and
the little five-year-old

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:36.150 align:middle line:84%
went, mom, you're
sitting on Shiboozi!

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:37.850 align:middle line:90%
Get off her.

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:40.327 align:middle line:84%
But they really think
they see these creatures.

00:23:40.327 --> 00:23:41.410 align:middle line:90%
>> GUILEY: Oh, absolutely.

00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:45.430 align:middle line:84%
I served food to my
invisible friends.

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:47.190 align:middle line:90%
They were very real to me.

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly,
in fairy lore,

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:52.532 align:middle line:84%
fairies like to have
offerings of food.

00:23:52.532 --> 00:23:54.240 align:middle line:84%
That's a good way to
stay on good terms--

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:54.850 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Like Santa.

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:55.240 align:middle line:90%
>> GUILEY: --with them.

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:55.850 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:56.130 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I love it.

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:57.260 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: Give them
something sweet.

00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:59.218 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Let's talk a
little bit about angels,

00:23:59.218 --> 00:24:01.790 align:middle line:90%
angelic intervention.

00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:03.670 align:middle line:84%
Again, when we
consider that this

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:07.190 align:middle line:84%
is a vast universe or
maybe multi-verses,

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:10.880 align:middle line:84%
there's so many
things that go on.

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.690 align:middle line:84%
It's not difficult
to imagine that there

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:15.750 align:middle line:84%
was another plane of existence
before the physical realm,

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:18.360 align:middle line:84%
and that could have
been the angelic realm.

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:23.240 align:middle line:84%
Yet we hear stories
of angry angels,

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:28.520 align:middle line:84%
fallen angels, good
guardian angels.

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:30.890 align:middle line:90%
What's going on with them?

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: Angels
are a lot like us.

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:37.510 align:middle line:84%
They have mixed motives
and mixed dispositions

00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:38.540 align:middle line:90%
according to lore.

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:41.849 align:middle line:84%
Now today we think of angels
as all benevolent, all good.

00:24:41.849 --> 00:24:42.515 align:middle line:90%
They're helpful.

00:24:42.515 --> 00:24:45.870 align:middle line:84%
They're our guardians, our
guides, our protectors.

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:48.670 align:middle line:84%
They help us relate
to the divine

00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:51.720 align:middle line:84%
and access the
support of the divine.

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:55.300 align:middle line:84%
But in earlier times people had
much different views of angels.

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.940 align:middle line:90%
They were God's disciplinarians.

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:00.640 align:middle line:84%
They were the bouncers
who kept Adam and Eve out

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:03.600 align:middle line:84%
of paradise once
God expelled them.

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:05.610 align:middle line:84%
Some of them, in
very early lore,

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:08.880 align:middle line:84%
weren't even all that approving
of human beings to begin with.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.880 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They were jealous
of us, weren't they?

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: Jealous, and they
felt that humans were unworthy

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:15.410 align:middle line:90%
of a place in paradise.

00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:19.860 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in some early
Jewish stories about angels,

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:22.230 align:middle line:84%
when God decides to
create human beings

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:25.700 align:middle line:84%
he creates a group of angels
and wants their opinion on it.

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And they say, oh,
not a good idea.

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:28.970 align:middle line:90%
So that makes him mad.

00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:31.190 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You don't want
to make those humans.

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:33.690 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: He burns them up,
and he creates another group

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:35.630 align:middle line:84%
of angels and asks
them the same question.

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:37.170 align:middle line:84%
They say, oh, no,
not a good idea.

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And he does the
same thing to them.

00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:40.930 align:middle line:84%
So he gets a third
group of angels.

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:43.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, they know what happened
to the first two groups,

00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:45.530 align:middle line:84%
so they say, hey,
OK, great idea.

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:47.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, then, when Adam
and Eve fall and they're

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:50.590 align:middle line:84%
expelled from paradise, the
angels come back to God,

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:53.460 align:middle line:84%
and they say, well, weren't
the first guys right?

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:55.590 align:middle line:84%
It might not have
been such a good idea.

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:57.460 align:middle line:84%
But God says, no,
I pledged that I'm

00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:00.450 align:middle line:84%
going to support and
sustain humanity,

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:02.560 align:middle line:90%
and they have my covenant now.

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:08.684 align:middle line:84%
And so I expect
all of you to help.

00:26:08.684 --> 00:26:11.100 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I get so many calls
on Coast to Coast when we go

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:14.020 align:middle line:84%
into our angelic
stories from people.

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'll always remember
this one truck driver called

00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:20.430 align:middle line:84%
and said that he had
fallen asleep at the wheel,

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:25.600 align:middle line:84%
and when he woke up he was just
about ready to go over a cliff.

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And he really thought it
was curtain times for him.

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:32.030 align:middle line:84%
But he said, George, out of the
blue a hand came and grabbed

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:35.680 align:middle line:84%
my steering wheel, pulled
it back, and on the road

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:38.080 align:middle line:90%
I went, and I was saved.

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.670 align:middle line:84%
There was nobody
else in the cab.

00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:44.250 align:middle line:84%
He was alone, yet he
distinctly saw another hand

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:46.940 align:middle line:84%
grab that wheel and
pull him back on.

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:48.572 align:middle line:90%
That's intervention, isn't it?

00:26:48.572 --> 00:26:49.280 align:middle line:90%
>> GUILEY: It is.

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And it is the kind
of intervention

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:52.530 align:middle line:90%
that we ascribe to angels.

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:54.280 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed
many people who've

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:57.870 align:middle line:84%
had similar stories, saved
from the brink of disaster

00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:00.020 align:middle line:90%
by a heavenly hand.

00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:02.460 align:middle line:84%
Other times that angel
show up to rescue us

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:05.060 align:middle line:84%
are in the form of
mysterious stranger.

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:07.510 align:middle line:90%
You're in a crisis situation.

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:12.360 align:middle line:84%
And you have to realize
that something beaming down

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:15.450 align:middle line:84%
from the heavens might not
be a good idea at that point.

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:17.619 align:middle line:84%
So the angel shows up as
someone who's like us.

00:27:17.619 --> 00:27:18.660 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And disappears.

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:21.420 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: Looks like a human
being, solves the problem.

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:24.430 align:middle line:84%
There's always something
very unusual about them,

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:27.710 align:middle line:90%
and they mysteriously disappear.

00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:31.380 align:middle line:84%
If people try to make an effort
to find them, no such person.

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:34.920 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Perfect example, a
guy is swimming in the ocean.

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.620 align:middle line:90%
Why, I don't know.

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And he went out
a little too far.

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:39.400 align:middle line:90%
He got pulled away.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.050 align:middle line:90%
And he was going down.

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:44.070 align:middle line:90%
He was drowning.

00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:48.400 align:middle line:84%
He was 200 or 300 feet
offshore, nobody around him,

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.800 align:middle line:84%
and he said this
was curtain time.

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:55.052 align:middle line:84%
Yet he sees a hand break through
the water, and he sees it.

00:27:55.052 --> 00:27:55.760 align:middle line:90%
He's under water.

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.250 align:middle line:90%
He grabs the hand.

00:27:57.250 --> 00:27:59.170 align:middle line:90%
It pulls him back up to the top.

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:03.310 align:middle line:84%
He's coughing, he's
gagging, but he's OK.

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:05.595 align:middle line:84%
And he's starting to
swim back to shore,

00:28:05.595 --> 00:28:08.600 align:middle line:84%
and he turns to thank the
guy who came out to get him.

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.260 align:middle line:90%
There's nobody there.

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:11.990 align:middle line:90%
Nobody there.

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And his first thought was, oh my
god, the guy drowned saving me.

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:21.520 align:middle line:84%
But people on shore who were
looking at this situation

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:24.470 align:middle line:84%
said, no, you went
down by yourself,

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:29.960 align:middle line:84%
and we saw you pop back up,
and you seemed to be OK.

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:32.130 align:middle line:84%
But there was nobody
else out there.

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:34.030 align:middle line:90%
What did he see?

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:34.990 align:middle line:90%
What was there?

00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:37.540 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: Sometimes people
don't see anything but they

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:39.300 align:middle line:90%
feel a presence.

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's described as
light warmth, something

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:45.520 align:middle line:90%
that's divine.

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:49.480 align:middle line:84%
They recognize they're getting
some sort of divine help.

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.440 align:middle line:84%
They may see something
like the heavenly hand

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:54.120 align:middle line:84%
that grabs the
wheel, for example.

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:58.820 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed a lot of
people to recount step by step

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:01.350 align:middle line:90%
as best as they can the crisis.

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And in almost all cases, even
if they're not consciously

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:09.930 align:middle line:84%
praying at the last moment
for God please help me,

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:13.760 align:middle line:84%
an unconscious prayer
goes out for help.

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And there seems to be
this moment of connection

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:22.230 align:middle line:90%
with the help then that comes.

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:25.330 align:middle line:84%
People often ask, well, why
aren't these things more

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:26.560 align:middle line:90%
democratic?

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:29.032 align:middle line:84%
Why do some people get the
rescue and other people--

00:29:29.032 --> 00:29:29.990 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Others don't.

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:30.820 align:middle line:90%
>> GUILEY: --not?

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:33.190 align:middle line:84%
There aren't any
good answers to that.

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:36.430 align:middle line:84%
We have to accept, I
think, the divine workings

00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:40.700 align:middle line:84%
of a plan for everyone
and that we're

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:42.560 align:middle line:84%
meant to have the
experiences we do.

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:45.760 align:middle line:84%
Maybe for the people who
have the rescue that's part

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.930 align:middle line:84%
of their life learning,
their soul learning,

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:50.950 align:middle line:84%
that they need to have
that experience to...

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:55.420 align:middle line:84%
to recognize a greater
connection to the divine whole.

00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:59.370 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do you have to believe
in angels in order to summon

00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:01.790 align:middle line:84%
them up or to get
that kind of help?

00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:03.200 align:middle line:90%
>> GUILEY: Absolutely not.

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:07.540 align:middle line:84%
In fact, atheists have had
experiences with angels.

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:08.630 align:middle line:90%
Agnostics have.

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:12.330 align:middle line:84%
People of different faiths
have all kinds of experiences

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:13.720 align:middle line:90%
with helping beings.

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:16.090 align:middle line:84%
They may not call them
angels, but they're all

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:19.770 align:middle line:84%
the same, that is they're
an intermediary presence

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:27.070 align:middle line:84%
or force that acts on our behalf
or to intervene in our lives

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:32.370 align:middle line:84%
to have a miracle happen
or some dramatic change.

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:34.600 align:middle line:90%
But they can happen to anyone.

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:36.930 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they make
religious believers out

00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:38.110 align:middle line:90%
of the unbelieving.

00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:40.640 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Who were
the fallen angels?

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:44.660 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: The fallen angels
are now called demons.

00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And in Christianity it
started with a fall of pride.

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And Lucifer is the angel who
is a glorious angel in heaven

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:03.290 align:middle line:84%
but has a lot of pride
and ego and gets cast out

00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:05.730 align:middle line:90%
of heaven for that.

00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And some of the heavenly
host, about one third

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:10.990 align:middle line:84%
of the heavily host,
follow him down.

00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:11.480 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They go with him.

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:13.850 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: They go with him
because they have allegiance

00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:14.630 align:middle line:90%
to him.

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:16.660 align:middle line:84%
And so they all
fall to Earth, where

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:19.910 align:middle line:84%
they are condemned to
roam the netherworld.

00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And they become the demonic,
the tormentors of human beings.

00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:28.180 align:middle line:84%
There are similar stories in
other mythologies and faiths

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:31.480 align:middle line:84%
as well about beings
who fall from grace

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:35.990 align:middle line:84%
and become the
testers of humanity.

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:39.960 align:middle line:84%
So their role really
serves a purpose.

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:43.200 align:middle line:84%
It's the purpose of
making us understand

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:45.380 align:middle line:84%
the difference between
right and wrong

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:51.050 align:middle line:84%
and the choices that we make to
go in one direction or another.

00:31:51.050 --> 00:31:53.550 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, and that's one
of the things that fascinates

00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:57.710 align:middle line:84%
me, Rosemary, the fact that
other belief systems on this

00:31:57.710 --> 00:32:02.470 align:middle line:84%
planet have similar views,
similar stories about what had

00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:04.060 align:middle line:90%
happened a long time ago.

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:05.730 align:middle line:84%
How these stories
are passed down

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:08.270 align:middle line:84%
is absolutely
mind-boggling, yet they're

00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:11.610 align:middle line:84%
all very similar, about
fallen angels, about demons,

00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:14.700 align:middle line:84%
about evil, about
good, about bad.

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:17.790 align:middle line:84%
Something on this planet
happened a very, very long time

00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:18.710 align:middle line:90%
ago, don't you think?

00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:19.460 align:middle line:90%
>> GUILEY: Indeed.

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:23.380 align:middle line:84%
The common roots that all of
these stories and experiences

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:28.500 align:middle line:84%
share indicate that
there's truth to them all

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:36.130 align:middle line:84%
and that we human beings
have had the same experiences

00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:38.890 align:middle line:84%
with the light side
and the dark side that

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:43.190 align:middle line:84%
have shaped our destinies,
personal and collective.

00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:45.560 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Tell me
about guardian angels.

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:46.520 align:middle line:90%
Do we all have them?

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:48.800 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: I do believe that
we have guardian angels.

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:53.110 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I believe that
everyone has multiple angels

00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:55.760 align:middle line:84%
around them, that
there are angels

00:32:55.760 --> 00:33:00.040 align:middle line:84%
who are born with us who have
taken on the duty of following

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:04.650 align:middle line:84%
us through an incarnation
to be in the background.

00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And unless we develop a
relationship with angels,

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:12.074 align:middle line:84%
we're likely not to even
realize that they're there.

00:33:12.074 --> 00:33:13.490 align:middle line:84%
They're sort of
like the generator

00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:16.190 align:middle line:90%
humming in the background.

00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:19.010 align:middle line:84%
But as we go through life
and we meet challenges

00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:23.150 align:middle line:84%
and we take on new tasks in
relationships and in our jobs

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:27.300 align:middle line:84%
and in our personal growth, then
that calls in another angels

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:28.350 align:middle line:90%
to assist with that.

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:32.200 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of angels come and go
as we change throughout life.

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:36.920 align:middle line:84%
I believe we're never away
from divine help and support.

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:38.740 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do they
have free will?

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:40.524 align:middle line:84%
Can they do what
they want to do?

00:33:40.524 --> 00:33:42.940 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: There are different
stories about the free will

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:43.870 align:middle line:90%
of angels.

00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:46.530 align:middle line:84%
In most accounts, they
do not have free will.

00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:48.510 align:middle line:90%
They follow the will of God.

00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And yet the fall of
angels involves free will.

00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:53.350 align:middle line:90%
It's the choice.

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:57.170 align:middle line:84%
It's the choice
to have the pride.

00:33:57.170 --> 00:34:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And there are other stories
about angels making choices,

00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:03.990 align:middle line:84%
for example the early
stories that I mentioned

00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:07.695 align:middle line:84%
about should human
beings be created.

00:34:07.695 --> 00:34:11.409 align:middle line:84%
Well, the angels have
a choice to answer,

00:34:11.409 --> 00:34:14.719 align:middle line:90%
and they make that choice.

00:34:14.719 --> 00:34:19.360 align:middle line:84%
So my own feeling is I believe
that angels are the guardians

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:23.550 align:middle line:90%
and caretakers of divine order.

00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:28.929 align:middle line:84%
One of their chief jobs is to
maintain harmony and wholeness

00:34:28.929 --> 00:34:30.350 align:middle line:90%
throughout creation.

00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:33.739 align:middle line:84%
So that really is following
the will of the divine.

00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:34.989 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What about fairies?

00:34:34.989 --> 00:34:36.650 align:middle line:84%
When you think of
fairies, you think

00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:39.565 align:middle line:84%
of Tinkerbell floating
all over the place.

00:34:39.565 --> 00:34:41.940 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:44.840 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: Fairies belong
to another class of beings.

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:46.739 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people
think that they're

00:34:46.739 --> 00:34:49.370 align:middle line:84%
the same as angels because
they've been drawn with wings

00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:51.500 align:middle line:90%
or seen with wings.

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:53.139 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And they're
little, right?

00:34:53.139 --> 00:34:53.550 align:middle line:90%
>> GUILEY: Some of them are.

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:55.060 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
actually quite big.

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:56.469 align:middle line:90%
I have seen big fairies.

00:34:56.469 --> 00:35:00.440 align:middle line:84%
But they're a race of
supernatural entities

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:03.090 align:middle line:84%
who belong on this
interdimensional Earth.

00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And we find stories of
them all over the planet,

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:07.590 align:middle line:90%
going back to ancient times.

00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:11.680 align:middle line:84%
In almost all accounts they
were here first before us.

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And they lost out over
time as humanity advanced

00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:20.290 align:middle line:84%
and as humanity
populated the Earth.

00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:21.990 align:middle line:90%
There were conflicts.

00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And these fairies retreated
further and further

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:26.880 align:middle line:84%
into the background
until literally they

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:28.630 align:middle line:90%
were in another dimension.

00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And in folklore we
find that explained

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:33.960 align:middle line:84%
in fairies underground,
the fairyland that's

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:35.430 align:middle line:84%
down through the
root of the trees,

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:39.020 align:middle line:84%
for example, where they
live in another one

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:41.700 align:middle line:84%
of these liminal
worlds where they

00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:44.070 align:middle line:84%
have a different
reality than we do.

00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:46.110 align:middle line:84%
They have powers
that we don't have.

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:49.880 align:middle line:84%
But they have access to
our world, so we see them.

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:53.220 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: The Irish folklore,
as they talk about leprechauns,

00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:55.200 align:middle line:84%
might they be talking
about the fairies?

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.010 align:middle line:90%
Are they one in the same?

00:35:57.010 --> 00:35:59.750 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: Leprechauns
are a type of fairy.

00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:03.920 align:middle line:84%
They're solitary, and
they're a little apart

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:06.320 align:middle line:90%
from other groups of fairies.

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:10.700 align:middle line:84%
Fairies are often seen in
bands and small groups,

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:13.250 align:middle line:84%
but the leprechauns
are solitary.

00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:15.920 align:middle line:90%
And they are part of fairy lore.

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:19.140 align:middle line:84%
Some fairies don't have a
very pleasant disposition,

00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:21.840 align:middle line:90%
and they're likely to be tricky.

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:24.452 align:middle line:84%
Our ancestors knew that
they could be quite vengeful

00:36:24.452 --> 00:36:25.410 align:middle line:90%
when they were wronged.

00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And other fairies
are happy and merry.

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:29.366 align:middle line:84%
They like to
entertain themselves,

00:36:29.366 --> 00:36:30.990 align:middle line:84%
and they can even be
helpful to people.

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:33.448 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, Hollywood hasn't
made leprechauns look very

00:36:33.448 --> 00:36:34.530 align:middle line:90%
pleasant lately.

00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:36.660 align:middle line:84%
I'll always remember
the good one years ago

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:40.179 align:middle line:84%
when I was a kid, "Darby
O'Gill and the Little People."

00:36:40.179 --> 00:36:41.220 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember that one?

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:41.440 align:middle line:90%
>> GUILEY: I do.

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:42.960 align:middle line:84%
That was one of my
favorite movies.

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:43.026 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:36:43.026 --> 00:36:43.734 align:middle line:90%
It was a classic.

00:36:43.734 --> 00:36:44.480 align:middle line:90%
Now that was fun.

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:46.290 align:middle line:84%
But then all of a
sudden leprechauns

00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:51.150 align:middle line:84%
evolved into these very
mean, spiteful creatures.

00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:53.390 align:middle line:90%
Are there some like that?

00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:55.830 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: In lore, yes, if
you read the accounts from

00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:56.770 align:middle line:90%
our ancestors.

00:36:56.770 --> 00:36:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And what we know about
fairies here in our culture

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:04.040 align:middle line:84%
comes primarily from Celtic
lore, Ireland, Scotland,

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:08.780 align:middle line:84%
the United Kingdom, and even
parts of northern Europe.

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And these beings, they're
like human beings, the good,

00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:13.144 align:middle line:90%
the bad, and the ugly.

00:37:13.144 --> 00:37:14.060 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are nice.

00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:15.640 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are not so nice.

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:18.326 align:middle line:84%
Some of them, it depends on
literally what side of the bed

00:37:18.326 --> 00:37:18.950 align:middle line:90%
they got up on.

00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:22.399 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do they eat and sleep
and cry and things like that?

00:37:22.399 --> 00:37:23.190 align:middle line:90%
>> GUILEY: They do.

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:26.070 align:middle line:84%
They do have their own
food in their own realm.

00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:28.620 align:middle line:84%
Accounts of people who
have visited fairyland

00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:31.339 align:middle line:84%
and miraculously come
back-- because it's often--

00:37:31.339 --> 00:37:31.880 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Ah.

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:32.070 align:middle line:90%
You may--

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:32.670 align:middle line:90%
>> GUILEY: A one-way--

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:32.960 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: --not come back.

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:33.380 align:middle line:90%
>> GUILEY: --trip.

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:33.890 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Really?

00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:35.360 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: It's often
a one-way trip--

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:35.830 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's not good.

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:36.730 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: --once
you get down there.

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:36.800 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:37.960 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They keep you?

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:39.270 align:middle line:90%
>> GUILEY: They do.

00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:42.290 align:middle line:84%
You are trapped forever in
fairyland, by most accounts.

00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:44.120 align:middle line:84%
But some individuals
have escaped.

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:47.640 align:middle line:84%
And they say fairies live in
this beautiful enchanted world

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:50.530 align:middle line:84%
where it's like
perpetual twilight.

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:54.880 align:middle line:84%
The sky is just lit with
very nice soothing colors.

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:57.710 align:middle line:84%
They have their own food,
which is far more delicious

00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:59.830 align:middle line:90%
than anything we could imagine.

00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:03.820 align:middle line:84%
They have their own societies,
their families, their children,

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:06.140 align:middle line:90%
their own courts of law.

00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:10.992 align:middle line:84%
It's like a parallel world,
only they're different than us.

00:38:10.992 --> 00:38:13.450 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You know, 100,000
people disappear on this planet

00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:13.950 align:middle line:90%
every year.

00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:15.510 align:middle line:90%
They just simply vanish.

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And I've always wondered,
where the heck do they go?

00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:21.260 align:middle line:84%
Sure, maybe they're
abducted by ETs.

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:22.180 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:24.980 align:middle line:84%
But I wonder if they're
stuck in the fairyland.

00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:29.540 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: I'm convinced that an
unknown portion of our missing

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:32.630 align:middle line:84%
persons falls down
the rabbit hole.

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:33.682 align:middle line:90%
They go into fairyland.

00:38:33.682 --> 00:38:34.890 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's frightening.

00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:37.480 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: They go into one
of these other dimensions.

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:39.810 align:middle line:84%
They might be
kidnapped by entities.

00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:44.580 align:middle line:84%
They might stumble through
a multi-dimensional portal

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:46.259 align:middle line:84%
and not be able to
find their way back.

00:38:46.259 --> 00:38:48.300 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: We're going to
take your questions now.

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:49.894 align:middle line:90%
Yes, right here.

00:38:49.894 --> 00:38:50.560 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:53.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm wondering if you see
any angels around me.

00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And how would I be able
to communicate with them

00:38:56.770 --> 00:38:58.820 align:middle line:90%
or see them back?

00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:01.055 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: The best way to
communicate with angels is

00:39:01.055 --> 00:39:03.680 align:middle line:84%
through meditation,
simply by asking.

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:06.940 align:middle line:84%
If we spend time in
meditation every day

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:09.990 align:middle line:84%
and ask for the angels who are
around us to make themselves

00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:14.700 align:middle line:84%
known, we will begin to
have contact with them.

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:18.100 align:middle line:84%
And it often starts with
just a sense of a presence.

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:20.500 align:middle line:90%
We're likely not to see angels.

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:23.955 align:middle line:84%
We're more likely to feel their
presence and to hear them.

00:39:23.955 --> 00:39:25.830 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Could they be
around her right now?

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:27.080 align:middle line:90%
>> GUILEY: Oh, absolutely.

00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:27.740 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:30.890 align:middle line:84%
Our angels are always
with us, and sometimes we

00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:32.150 align:middle line:90%
can actually see them.

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:34.560 align:middle line:90%
We might see them around us.

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.140 align:middle line:90%
They tend to be very brilliant.

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:40.790 align:middle line:84%
When I have actually seen angels
present in the environment,

00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:43.770 align:middle line:84%
their light is so bright it's
hard to look at directly.

00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:43.870 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Interesting.

00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: You have
to avert your vision.

00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:49.430 align:middle line:84%
So the angels are going to
present themselves in ways

00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:53.680 align:middle line:84%
that we are able to comprehend
them, to perceive them,

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:56.220 align:middle line:84%
and to accommodate
their presence,

00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:59.340 align:middle line:84%
and that's going to differ
for every individual.

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:02.920 align:middle line:84%
But prayer and meditation,
also asking your dreams--

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:05.530 align:middle line:84%
from all of our
discussions on dreams,

00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:09.300 align:middle line:84%
we have many
spiritual experiences

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:12.090 align:middle line:84%
in the course of dreams,
and angels will often

00:40:12.090 --> 00:40:14.010 align:middle line:90%
show up in them as well.

00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:18.160 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's almost as if they
are that little voice you hear

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:23.080 align:middle line:84%
telling you right and wrong or
giving you some gut instincts.

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:26.580 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: The early
precursors of angels,

00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:32.150 align:middle line:84%
the Greeks had beliefs in
beings called the daemonus,

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:35.820 align:middle line:84%
and they weren't demons per
se, but they were intervening

00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:36.670 align:middle line:90%
entities.

00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:39.372 align:middle line:84%
And they literally
whispered in your ear.

00:40:39.372 --> 00:40:40.830 align:middle line:84%
Some of them believed
that they had

00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:43.535 align:middle line:84%
a good one in one ear and
a bad one in the other ear,

00:40:43.535 --> 00:40:44.160 align:middle line:90%
and they were--

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:44.870 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Tugging away at you.

00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:45.400 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: --vying
for attention.

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:46.140 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:47.200 align:middle line:90%
You never know.

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:50.480 align:middle line:84%
Let's use our technology and
go to our "Beyond Belief" cam

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:52.777 align:middle line:84%
here with Rosemary
for a question.

00:40:52.777 --> 00:40:53.860 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Hi, Rosemary.

00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:55.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm Michael from Studio
City, California.

00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And I'm wondering if you
remember the first time you

00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:00.640 align:middle line:84%
encountered someone
from the other side.

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:03.430 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: The first time that
I encountered someone from

00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:06.830 align:middle line:84%
the other side was actually
when I was an adult.

00:41:06.830 --> 00:41:11.320 align:middle line:84%
When I was younger, I had
more spirit experiences.

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:12.330 align:middle line:90%
I had the fairies.

00:41:12.330 --> 00:41:13.800 align:middle line:90%
I had angels.

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:16.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's always
been easier for me

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:19.010 align:middle line:90%
to tune in to the spirit world.

00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:21.730 align:middle line:84%
But as I got older and I
got deeper into my study

00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:24.810 align:middle line:84%
and developing my
psychic ability,

00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:29.110 align:middle line:84%
I encountered the
spirits of dead people.

00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And the first encounter
actually happened in a home

00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:36.190 align:middle line:84%
that I moved into
in New York state,

00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:37.890 align:middle line:84%
and we hadn't been
there very long.

00:41:37.890 --> 00:41:42.030 align:middle line:84%
I was reading one night, and
it was the proverbial dark

00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:43.000 align:middle line:90%
and stormy night.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.041 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right, exactly.

00:41:44.041 --> 00:41:44.870 align:middle line:90%
Perfect setting.

00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: I suddenly became
aware that there was a presence

00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:48.790 align:middle line:90%
in the room.

00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:50.590 align:middle line:90%
Now my husband was upstairs.

00:41:50.590 --> 00:41:53.060 align:middle line:84%
I was the only
person downstairs.

00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And I looked up, because I
thought someone had actually

00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:59.370 align:middle line:84%
entered the room, and
I didn't see anything.

00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:01.400 align:middle line:90%
But the feeling didn't go away.

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And then I looked
up again, and I

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:06.440 align:middle line:84%
saw an apparition of what
appeared to be a man.

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And all I could see was
the top part of him.

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:11.739 align:middle line:84%
And if he'd been
a real person, he

00:42:11.739 --> 00:42:13.280 align:middle line:84%
would have been over
seven feet tall,

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:16.140 align:middle line:84%
because he was
floating up in the air.

00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And I was so startled by it
that I threw the book in the air

00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:23.960 align:middle line:84%
and jumped up off the couch
and ran out of the room.

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And when I came back, of
course the apparition was gone.

00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:31.260 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that
it was a person who--

00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:33.910 align:middle line:84%
it was a very old house
that we had moved into--

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:36.650 align:middle line:84%
and that it might have been a
previous owner, a personality

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:38.400 align:middle line:84%
who'd been associated
by the house.

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:39.179 align:middle line:90%
Very benign.

00:42:39.179 --> 00:42:41.720 align:middle line:84%
It was just sort of like he was
checking in on me like, well,

00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:43.440 align:middle line:84%
who are you living
in my house now?

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:44.190 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Exactly.

00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:45.290 align:middle line:90%
I was here first, right?

00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:45.510 align:middle line:90%
>> GUILEY: Exactly.

00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:47.330 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How about another
question for Rosemary Ellen

00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:47.910 align:middle line:90%
Guiley?

00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:48.682 align:middle line:90%
Yes, ma'am.

00:42:48.682 --> 00:42:50.210 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Hi, Rosemary.

00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:54.300 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in a haunted house
where my sisters were called

00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:57.850 align:middle line:84%
by the piano in the
basement, and they

00:42:57.850 --> 00:42:59.480 align:middle line:90%
said it was Bloody Bones.

00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And every time they
came down the stairs,

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:05.570 align:middle line:84%
they were drawn from the
upstairs through the kitchen

00:43:05.570 --> 00:43:07.000 align:middle line:90%
down the stairs.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.470 align:middle line:84%
A lady in white would stop them
and take them back upstairs,

00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:13.520 align:middle line:90%
and so they never saw him.

00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:17.360 align:middle line:84%
Then when they were in their
adolescence, on Easter Sunday,

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:19.870 align:middle line:84%
they were in their bedroom
in the basement in the dark,

00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:23.600 align:middle line:84%
and a light appeared in the
mirror, and it grew large.

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And then the entity got
on top of my sister.

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And she had on a necklace with
the Virgin Mary on the string,

00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:37.100 align:middle line:84%
and it started to squeeze down
into that part of her neck

00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:37.880 align:middle line:90%
and choke her.

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:41.920 align:middle line:84%
And she finally was able
to ask Jesus to save her,

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:43.260 align:middle line:90%
and it went away.

00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:45.770 align:middle line:90%
And our house was blessed.

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And after the priest came, the
entity went around the room

00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:54.930 align:middle line:84%
where we all were watching TV
and up the stairs, outside up

00:43:54.930 --> 00:43:57.500 align:middle line:84%
to the patio on the roof,
and the next morning we

00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:59.130 align:middle line:90%
found dead birds up there.

00:43:59.130 --> 00:44:00.280 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Jeez.

00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: And when I was
17, I was sleeping down there,

00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:05.800 align:middle line:84%
and this entity
got on top of me.

00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And I was very glad I didn't
have that necklace on.

00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:12.110 align:middle line:84%
But I was able to finally
choke out the words for him

00:44:12.110 --> 00:44:15.840 align:middle line:84%
to be gone, and I never
slept there again.

00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:18.570 align:middle line:84%
Later I saw in the
corner of my eye

00:44:18.570 --> 00:44:21.440 align:middle line:84%
a lady in white who I
thought was my daughter.

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:24.360 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't my daughter.

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:26.040 align:middle line:84%
So I wonder what
you thought of that.

00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:28.110 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What are these things?

00:44:28.110 --> 00:44:30.440 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: They're
spirits, not human beings.

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:33.220 align:middle line:84%
I run into these cases
quite frequently now

00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:37.900 align:middle line:84%
in my investigations that have a
similar scenario, where there's

00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:41.470 align:middle line:84%
a variety of unpleasant
phenomena going on

00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:44.280 align:middle line:84%
in a home, multiple
manifestations,

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:47.089 align:middle line:84%
like the lady in white,
dark entities, shadows.

00:44:47.089 --> 00:44:48.380 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: The old hag syndrome.

00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:50.640 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: The old hag,
creepy-looking creatures

00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:51.520 align:middle line:90%
around.

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's one entity
taking all of those forms.

00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:58.370 align:middle line:84%
These entities are
negative presences

00:44:58.370 --> 00:45:00.140 align:middle line:90%
that have lodged in a place.

00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:04.100 align:middle line:84%
They don't attach to people
and follow them around

00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:08.050 align:middle line:84%
as much as they stay in place
and torment whoever is there.

00:45:08.050 --> 00:45:10.300 align:middle line:84%
They will do things
like suffocate,

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:14.670 align:middle line:84%
create horrible
smells and sounds,

00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:18.670 align:middle line:84%
disembodied voices, bad
dreams, and things like that.

00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:21.600 align:middle line:84%
A variety of remedies
can be effective.

00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:24.170 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people call
on religious help,

00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:28.150 align:middle line:84%
religious exorcisms
and cleansings, prayers

00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:30.580 align:middle line:90%
to religious figures.

00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And that will often push the
phenomena away, make it abate.

00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:37.300 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it will
diminish to the point

00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:39.010 align:middle line:84%
where it seems like
it's gone away,

00:45:39.010 --> 00:45:41.190 align:middle line:84%
but if those people leave
and new people come in,

00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:43.280 align:middle line:90%
it's likely to start up again.

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:45.180 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Why do they
try choking people?

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:48.240 align:middle line:90%
What are they trying to do here?

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:51.580 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: I believe
that they vampirize us,

00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:54.720 align:middle line:84%
and they do that in
a number of ways.

00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:56.700 align:middle line:90%
One is by choking.

00:45:56.700 --> 00:46:01.035 align:middle line:84%
It gets us to ratchet up
our fear tremendously.

00:46:01.035 --> 00:46:01.660 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: We're in
fear and in panic.

00:46:04.090 --> 00:46:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's a big adrenaline
rush through the system.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.210 align:middle line:84%
I believe that entities
vampirize that energy off

00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:11.770 align:middle line:90%
of us.

00:46:11.770 --> 00:46:14.430 align:middle line:90%
They prey on fear and on panic.

00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:18.810 align:middle line:84%
And the body's emotional
and physiological responses

00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:22.240 align:middle line:84%
that happened with that seems
to be energy food for them.

00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's what keeps them
viable in an environment.

00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:29.080 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well,
when this occurs,

00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:33.650 align:middle line:84%
where you invoke the name
of Jesus, for example,

00:46:33.650 --> 00:46:36.760 align:middle line:90%
why do they seem to run away?

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:40.290 align:middle line:84%
How does that name
scare them off?

00:46:40.290 --> 00:46:44.030 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: It's puzzling,
because there's no uniform

00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:45.260 align:middle line:90%
formula for this.

00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I have
many cases where

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.240 align:middle line:84%
people invoke the same prayers,
the same religious remedies,

00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:54.050 align:middle line:90%
and nothing happens.

00:46:54.050 --> 00:46:57.290 align:middle line:84%
It seems like the
entities resist that.

00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:59.004 align:middle line:90%
They're almost like viruses--

00:46:59.004 --> 00:47:00.920 align:middle line:84%

enough to fight that.

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:06.040 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: --that develop
a resistance to remedies.

00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:08.620 align:middle line:84%
So oftentimes we
have to experiment.

00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we have to bring
in folklore remedies that

00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:16.020 align:middle line:84%
have some religious
basis to them

of religious exorcisms.

00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:27.140 align:middle line:84%
It depends on the entity
itself, how strong it is,

00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:29.620 align:middle line:90%
and why it's acting out.

00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:34.170 align:middle line:84%
Is it just a malevolent
kind of demonic being?

00:47:34.170 --> 00:47:38.940 align:middle line:84%
Is it assailing people because
they're on its territory?

I was doing Coast to Coast
back a very long time ago,

00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:23.500 align:middle line:84%
I had a Ouija board in
my studio in St. Louis.

Everything went wrong.

I had never had any

I was having problems with that.

00:48:34.725 --> 00:48:36.950 align:middle line:90%
It was just a disaster.

00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:40.350 align:middle line:84%
I had my producer take
the Ouija board out.

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as it left the
room, the computers worked,

00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:27.050 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you just get
gibberish or nothing at all.

00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:31.090 align:middle line:84%
The ghost box is far more
efficient in that regard.

00:50:31.090 --> 00:50:34.020 align:middle line:84%
But many people are
fascinated by the Ouija board.

00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:37.340 align:middle line:84%
It's been around for a
little over 100 years now,

00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:39.541 align:middle line:84%
and it has an
incredible history--

00:50:39.541 --> 00:50:41.290 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Who in the
heck would invent it?

00:50:41.290 --> 00:50:42.248 align:middle line:90%
>> GUILEY: --of mayhem.

00:50:42.248 --> 00:50:44.020 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Who would
invent this thing?

00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:48.290 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: Actually, it evolved
out of a number of spirit

00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:50.190 align:middle line:90%
communication devices.

00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:53.640 align:middle line:84%
This little pointer
here on the board,

00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:55.930 align:middle line:84%
which is called the
planchette, actually

00:50:55.930 --> 00:50:58.510 align:middle line:84%
had a precursor in
spiritualism days

00:50:58.510 --> 00:51:00.910 align:middle line:84%
with a device called
the planchette, which

00:51:00.910 --> 00:51:03.210 align:middle line:84%
was shaped very
similarly, and it

00:51:03.210 --> 00:51:05.900 align:middle line:90%
had three very long legs on it.

00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:07.990 align:middle line:90%
This was a pencil.

00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:10.660 align:middle line:84%
And that you put your
hands on the device

00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:13.230 align:middle line:84%
on a blank piece of
paper and asked spirits

00:51:13.230 --> 00:51:16.340 align:middle line:84%
to answer questions, and
hopefully your movements

00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:18.650 align:middle line:84%
would literally
write out an answer.

00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:21.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is modified
now on the Ouija board.

00:51:21.530 --> 00:51:25.520 align:middle line:84%
We've had many pointing
devices throughout history

00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:29.270 align:middle line:84%
where we have asked the gods
to divine the future for us

00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:31.250 align:middle line:90%
by pointing to things.

00:51:31.250 --> 00:51:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And so the Ouija board
actually evolved out of that.

00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:38.360 align:middle line:84%
Some very smart businessmen
in the late 1800s

00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:41.300 align:middle line:84%
read about these pointing
devices that were literally

00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:44.230 align:middle line:84%
taking the country by
storm, especially in Ohio.

00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:49.230 align:middle line:84%
Ohio was a hotbed of
spiritualism in the 1800s.

00:51:49.230 --> 00:51:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And newspaper articles about
the pointing devices they used

00:51:53.110 --> 00:51:56.769 align:middle line:84%
caught the attention of some
toy manufacturers in Baltimore.

00:51:56.769 --> 00:51:57.310 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:51:57.310 --> 00:51:59.175 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: And they
saw a brilliant idea.

00:51:59.175 --> 00:52:00.591 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And they
made a fortune.

00:52:00.591 --> 00:52:03.920 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: Made a fortune,
but not without a very strange

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:05.540 align:middle line:90%
and tumultuous history.

00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:09.585 align:middle line:84%
Internally in the company,
there was lots of conflict.

00:52:09.585 --> 00:52:10.460 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Infighting?

00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:11.530 align:middle line:90%
>> GUILEY: Infighting.

00:52:11.530 --> 00:52:15.240 align:middle line:84%
The original patent holders
got out of the business.

00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:18.050 align:middle line:84%
A man who was a
painter and a varnisher

00:52:18.050 --> 00:52:20.300 align:middle line:84%
by trade-- and his name
is on the board today,

00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:25.140 align:middle line:84%
William Fuld-- took
over the toy company

00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:30.365 align:middle line:84%
and literally turned the Ouija
board into a global media hit.

00:52:30.365 --> 00:52:32.990 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I got to tell you, if
I was on a plane with you and I

00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:36.140 align:middle line:84%
had heard that you had brought
a Ouija board on that plane,

00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:37.650 align:middle line:90%
I would have gotten off.

00:52:37.650 --> 00:52:39.935 align:middle line:84%
I would have taken
a different flight.

00:52:39.935 --> 00:52:41.171 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:52:41.171 --> 00:52:41.670 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:44.620 align:middle line:84%
Let's grab a volunteer
from our audience.

00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:46.760 align:middle line:84%
Anybody out there that
wants to take a chance?

00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:47.930 align:middle line:90%
Yes, come on up.

00:52:47.930 --> 00:52:48.760 align:middle line:90%
What's your name?

00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:49.320 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Juan.

00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:50.590 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Juan, come on over.

00:52:50.590 --> 00:52:52.160 align:middle line:90%
Have a seat here.

00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And Rosemary, why don't we
just-- it may or may not work--

00:52:56.170 --> 00:52:57.000 align:middle line:90%
have a seat, Juan--

00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:57.958 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:52:57.958 --> 00:53:01.404 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: --but explain what
you and Juan have to do here.

00:53:01.404 --> 00:53:03.820 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: The board is best
worked by two or more people.

00:53:03.820 --> 00:53:04.897 align:middle line:90%
Two is really ideal.

00:53:04.897 --> 00:53:06.730 align:middle line:84%
You can have as many
as four, but you've all

00:53:06.730 --> 00:53:09.210 align:middle line:84%
got to put your fingers
on the planchette.

00:53:09.210 --> 00:53:14.760 align:middle line:84%
One person can work a board too,
but two blending their energy--

00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:17.240 align:middle line:84%
Juan, what you and I
will do is concentrate

00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:19.410 align:middle line:84%
on communicating with
the spirit world.

00:53:19.410 --> 00:53:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes a door
opens right away,

00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:25.550 align:middle line:84%
and the pointer
begins moving around

00:53:25.550 --> 00:53:31.227 align:middle line:84%
and stops on various
letters, and you

00:53:31.227 --> 00:53:32.560 align:middle line:90%
might get something spelled out.

00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:34.440 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times you
just get gibberish.

00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:37.300 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is to put
your fingers very lightly

00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:39.940 align:middle line:90%
on the planchette.

00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:42.370 align:middle line:84%
Critics have said, oh,
people move this around.

00:53:42.370 --> 00:53:43.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, I have worked
the Ouija board

00:53:43.970 --> 00:53:45.739 align:middle line:84%
at times where the
pointer is literally

00:53:45.739 --> 00:53:46.780 align:middle line:90%
sailing around the board.

00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:48.440 align:middle line:84%
You can hardly keep
your fingers on it.

00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:50.870 align:middle line:90%
So what is moving this pointer?

00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:52.636 align:middle line:90%
Well, it may be a spirit.

00:53:52.636 --> 00:53:54.010 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well,
let's try it out.

00:53:54.010 --> 00:53:54.070 align:middle line:90%
>> GUILEY: Let's give it a shot.

00:53:54.070 --> 00:53:55.590 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But
before we go, Juan,

00:53:55.590 --> 00:53:59.470 align:middle line:84%
raise your right hand and
promise not to be upset with me

00:53:59.470 --> 00:54:02.548 align:middle line:84%
if anything should happen to
you because of the Ouija board.

[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:54:06.852 --> 00:54:07.930 align:middle line:90%
Now take it away.

00:54:07.930 --> 00:54:10.020 align:middle line:84%
That's my little
disclaimer for the moment.

00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:12.061 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: Now I've used
these since I was a kid.

00:54:12.061 --> 00:54:15.800 align:middle line:84%
Not a whole lot, because I find
other things more effective.

00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:17.910 align:middle line:84%
And I've been cursed
out by spirits,

00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:19.710 align:middle line:84%
and I've gotten
a nasty messages,

00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:22.070 align:middle line:84%
but I've never
felt that anything

00:54:22.070 --> 00:54:24.030 align:middle line:90%
has followed me around.

00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:24.530 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:54:24.530 --> 00:54:30.260 align:middle line:84%
So Juan, I'm going to put the
planchette kind of like this

00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:31.670 align:middle line:90%
so we can get it pointing.

00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:32.390 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:33.870 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: Or could
we turn the board?

00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:34.200 align:middle line:90%
Would that be--

00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:34.330 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:54:34.330 --> 00:54:35.160 align:middle line:90%
>> GUILEY: --all right?

00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:35.540 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:37.290 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: Let's turn
the board like this.

00:54:37.290 --> 00:54:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And put your fingers
lightly on the planchette,

00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:44.900 align:middle line:90%
and just concentrate.

00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:46.840 align:middle line:84%
It's a good idea
to ask questions.

00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Now the Ouija board
will spell things out.

00:54:48.590 --> 00:54:51.780 align:middle line:84%
It's got numbers,
yes, no, goodbye,

00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:53.940 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes
it'll point to yes.

00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:56.685 align:middle line:84%
It's often a good idea to
ask yes or no questions.

00:54:56.685 --> 00:54:58.750 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's already moving.

00:54:58.750 --> 00:55:00.850 align:middle line:84%
And neither one of
you is pushing it.

00:55:00.850 --> 00:55:05.360 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: So what I did was
I asked for something to start

00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:08.850 align:middle line:84%
communicating, and
it's pointing to yes.

00:55:08.850 --> 00:55:12.910 align:middle line:84%
Yes, something is here who
wishes to make itself known.

00:55:12.910 --> 00:55:16.205 align:middle line:84%
And can you spell your
name out for us, please?

00:55:16.205 --> 00:55:18.740 align:middle line:90%


00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:23.490 align:middle line:84%
Now I've always used the
clear window in the pointer

00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:25.350 align:middle line:84%
as the indication
for the letter.

00:55:25.350 --> 00:55:31.550 align:middle line:84%
So it stopped on O. Spell
your name out, please.

And we'll see if we
get any-- sometimes

00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:43.670 align:middle line:84%
the planchette
will wander around,

00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:44.900 align:middle line:90%
and you have to tell them.

00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:48.140 align:middle line:84%
You have to discipline them and
say, look, speed it up a bit.

Give us something--
O-B-O. O-B-O 1.

in studying the Ouija--

00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:59.260 align:middle line:84%
and I actually did a book on
the Ouija with an investigator

00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:01.490 align:middle line:84%
friend of mine called
"Ouija Gone Wild,"

00:58:01.490 --> 00:58:05.380 align:middle line:84%
and we compiled weird stories
from the 100-year history

00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:07.280 align:middle line:90%
of the Ouija board.

00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are
kind of predictable,

because of messages

you, this is weird.

Well, it started to
spell E, and then I

00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:22.610 align:middle line:84%
think it got a little
distracted with me.

00:58:22.610 --> 00:58:24.480 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of going
around in circles.

00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:24.760 align:middle line:90%

00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:25.380 align:middle line:90%

I'm a bad guy, so be afraid.

00:58:45.940 --> 00:58:49.440 align:middle line:84%
But what I've often found
with Ouija board problems--

00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:51.990 align:middle line:84%
and many people have
no problems at all--

00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:56.580 align:middle line:84%
is that an entity will start
out being Mr. Nice Guy,

00:58:56.580 --> 00:58:59.210 align:middle line:84%
very friendly, jokey,
say things that

00:58:59.210 --> 00:59:03.350 align:middle line:84%
are true that can be validated,
so the person begins to trust,

00:59:03.350 --> 00:59:05.824 align:middle line:84%
and then all of a
sudden it gets bad.

00:59:05.824 --> 00:59:07.240 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Then it
gets mean, yeah.

00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:09.900 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: And the personality
gets darker and manipulative.

00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:11.620 align:middle line:90%
It makes threatening messages.

00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:13.084 align:middle line:90%

this communicates

00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:25.880 align:middle line:84%
This is one of my
favorite devices.

00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:29.700 align:middle line:84%
It's real time communication
with spirits and the dead.

00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:34.930 align:middle line:90%
And it's a radio scan device.

00:59:34.930 --> 00:59:36.320 align:middle line:90%
This is called a mini box.

00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And it runs on the
principle of a radio that

00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:43.590 align:middle line:84%
moves very fast up
and down the band,

00:59:43.590 --> 00:59:45.200 align:middle line:84%
like you would
take a manual tuner

00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:47.530 align:middle line:84%
and rip it up and down
the band very fast.

00:59:47.530 --> 00:59:49.900 align:middle line:84%
It creates a jumble
of noise that's

00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:53.270 align:middle line:84%
a background sound
that spirit voices have

00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:55.070 align:middle line:90%
the capability of manipulating.

00:59:55.070 --> 00:59:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And they speak on
top of that scan.

00:59:57.040 --> 00:59:57.940 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And it comes
right through here.

00:59:57.940 --> 01:00:00.106 align:middle line:84%
>> GUILEY: And unfortunately,
in a studio like this,

01:00:00.106 --> 01:00:02.610 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to get
the reception to be able

01:00:02.610 --> 01:00:03.770 align:middle line:90%
to demonstrate it.

But I take this out on
my field investigations,

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:10.220 align:middle line:84%
and I can have direct two-way
real time communication

01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:13.520 align:middle line:84%
with the dead and with beings
who identify themselves

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:14.645 align:middle line:90%
as non-human personalities.

01:00:14.645 --> 01:00:16.510 align:middle line:84%

will be undeniable,

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.400 align:middle line:84%
