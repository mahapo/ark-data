Jay, that's an exciting program.

>>JAY WEIDNER: Yeah, well, it
took a long time, three years,

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:10.084 align:middle line:90%
to make it.

00:02:10.084 --> 00:02:11.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's super.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.340 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.930 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Normally,
you do documentaries.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.552 align:middle line:84%
This is a drama based on Shasta,
which we're going to get into.

00:02:19.552 --> 00:02:20.760 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about the difference.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.395 align:middle line:90%
How did you decide to do a film?

00:02:22.395 --> 00:02:24.895 align:middle line:10%
>>WEIDNER: Well, actually, when
I first got into filmmaking,

00:02:24.895 --> 00:02:28.440 align:middle line:10%
I actually made a feature
film back in the '80s.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.990 align:middle line:10%
I wrote and directed one.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.030 align:middle line:10%
And it wasn't a very good film.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.840 align:middle line:10%
And I wrote a whole
bunch of horror films,

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.050 align:middle line:10%
also, in the '80s and '70s.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.310 align:middle line:10%
But then I went
into documentaries.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.150 align:middle line:10%
And now I'm back
making features.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.132 align:middle line:84%
And I think features
are actually easier

00:02:43.132 --> 00:02:44.840 align:middle line:84%
than documentaries,
because documentaries

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.002 align:middle line:90%
you have to be right.

00:02:46.002 --> 00:02:47.710 align:middle line:84%
You have to have all
your facts straight.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:48.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.690 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Here, you're
just kind of writing--

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:50.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's Hollywood, right?

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.980 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: It's Hollywood.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:51.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.200 align:middle line:84%
So actually, I really
enjoyed making it.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.670 align:middle line:84%
It was a relief from
having to do documentaries.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:56.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And where'd
you find the talent

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.110 align:middle line:84%
for it, the actors,
the actresses?

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.401 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Well, I was living
in Ashland, Oregon, which

00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:05.610 align:middle line:84%
has a Shakespeare theater, a
very famous Shakespeare theater

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:06.710 align:middle line:90%
thing going on.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And so I went there
and got actors.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And the lead, who plays
Kalki, he was from Hollywood.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.930 align:middle line:84%
I flew him up to
Oregon to shoot.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.629 align:middle line:90%
His name is Alexander Polinsky.

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:19.170 align:middle line:84%
He used to be on
"Charles in Charge,"

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.620 align:middle line:84%
the TV series from the
'80s, as a very good actor.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.570 align:middle line:90%
So it was a real experience.

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.550 align:middle line:90%
I re-shot the film all the way.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.042 align:middle line:84%
I shot it, and then I threw
everything out and re-shot it.

00:03:30.042 --> 00:03:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And I did that,
actually, a couple times.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.660 align:middle line:90%
So it was an amazing experience.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Shasta, Mount Shasta,
in northern California,

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.697 align:middle line:84%
is a very different
kind of place.

00:03:39.697 --> 00:03:40.780 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Very different.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You keyed in on that.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.860 align:middle line:84%
Tell me how you decided
to pick that spot.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.360 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah,
well, I was living,

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.940 align:middle line:84%
of course, an hour north of
there, in Ashland, Oregon.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And going down to Shasta--
because it's so beautiful.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's an amazingly huge
mountain, 14,000-foot mountain,

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:57.060 align:middle line:90%
on a plain.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.330 align:middle line:84%
So you drive, and it's
monstrous, whereas, like,

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.400 align:middle line:84%
in Colorado, you have
14,000-foot mountains,

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.030 align:middle line:84%
but you're at
6,000 feet already.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.310 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: So they're
not this big thing.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.150 align:middle line:84%
So I started getting into
the kind of the lore of Mount

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.960 align:middle line:84%
Shasta and talking
to people, locals,

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.519 align:middle line:84%
and finding out some strangest
stories of UFO sightings

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.040 align:middle line:90%
and Bigfoot and odd creatures.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.399 align:middle line:90%
And it was like, really?

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:23.090 align:middle line:84%
All this going on in
this little place?

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.940 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
looking into the history.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.148 align:middle line:84%
And the Indians, the Native
Americans who lived there

00:04:27.148 --> 00:04:28.806 align:middle line:84%
before the white
people got there,

00:04:28.806 --> 00:04:29.930 align:middle line:90%
they have the same stories.

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.830 align:middle line:84%
When the missionaries came,
they said, the white beings

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.360 align:middle line:84%
live up on Mount Shasta
and all this stuff.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And you're like,
what's going on?

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And stories of
tunnels and treasures.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And I myself have been in the
tunnel systems, the lava tubes

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.299 align:middle line:84%
that run all under the
entire plateau there.

00:04:48.299 --> 00:04:50.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For hundreds
and hundreds of feet?

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.886 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Miles.

00:04:50.886 --> 00:04:51.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Miles?

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.370 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Miles, with
ceilings as high as cathedrals,

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:55.110 align:middle line:90%
like in Europe.

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.480 align:middle line:84%
They're that big
of a tunnel system.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And they're perfectly
round, these lava tubes.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: These are natural?

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:02.848 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: These
are natural, yeah.

00:05:02.848 --> 00:05:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And Nassim Haramein,
the physicist,

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:13.970 align:middle line:84%
he has a theory that lava
tubes, because of the way that

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.060 align:middle line:84%
the metallic-- the minerals
have formed around them,

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.257 align:middle line:84%
that they could possibly be
like stargates or some kind of--

00:05:21.257 --> 00:05:22.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wormholes or something.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:23.910 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Wormhole, yeah.

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And that would actually explain
a lot of the high weirdness,

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.560 align:middle line:84%
because every time
you go to a place that

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.250 align:middle line:84%
has a lot of lava tubes, you
get these stories, like Hawaii.

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.795 align:middle line:84%
Or in southern France, Le
Puy, the area around Le Puy,

00:05:37.795 --> 00:05:38.670 align:middle line:90%
they have lava tubes.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.440 align:middle line:90%
And again, the same stories.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.850 align:middle line:84%
It could be crypto
zoological, though.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.870 align:middle line:84%
It could be animals
that are caught

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.020 align:middle line:84%
or live nocturnally inside the
tunnels and come out at night.

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.840 align:middle line:84%
And then people will
see an odd animal

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.650 align:middle line:84%
and not know what
it is and freak

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.556 align:middle line:84%
and think that it's
some being that--

00:05:53.556 --> 00:05:54.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sure,
which is possible.

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:55.690 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: It is possible.

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.064 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot
of possibilities

00:05:57.064 --> 00:06:00.030 align:middle line:84%
to explain what's going
on up in Mount Shasta.

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:05.470 align:middle line:84%
But I think that
there's something to it.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:06.440 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.500 align:middle line:84%
There's too much smoke
for there not to be fire.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.904 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I assume that
Shasta is a volcano, right?

00:06:11.904 --> 00:06:12.820 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yes, it is.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So god
forbid, if they erupt,

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:19.135 align:middle line:84%
those tubes-- lava flows
through those tubes.

00:06:19.135 --> 00:06:20.010 align:middle line:90%
Is that what happens?

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:21.510 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah,
that's what happens

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:23.630 align:middle line:84%
is that the lava goes
through the tube, it erupts,

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.850 align:middle line:84%
and then the lava cools
at that certain point.

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And then it kind of widens out
as it dilates when it cools,

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.860 align:middle line:90%
because cool will do that.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And then it's just waiting
for the next eruption,

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.550 align:middle line:90%
which could be any time.

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.950 align:middle line:84%
The whole area, the whole
ring of fire, as you know,

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.359 align:middle line:90%
is ready to go.

00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:43.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, any of those
volcanoes or Mount Rainier--

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.396 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, boy, and
if it goes, it goes.

00:06:45.396 --> 00:06:46.770 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: If
Mount Rainier went,

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:49.150 align:middle line:84%
it would destroy
Seattle and Tacoma.

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:50.025 align:middle line:90%
So it would be very--

00:06:50.025 --> 00:06:52.191 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we saw what
happened during Mount St.

00:06:52.191 --> 00:06:52.970 align:middle line:90%
Helens.

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:54.490 align:middle line:84%
57 people died
during that episode.

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:55.490 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was like the
entire top of the mountain

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.800 align:middle line:84%
just lifted off and just
spread out the dust all over.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.700 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, Shasta is
an amazing place.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.920 align:middle line:84%
I highly recommend people
go there and visit.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.750 align:middle line:84%
I think you'll be amazed
not just by the beauty,

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:09.840 align:middle line:90%
but by the weirdness.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.474 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there people who
live at the base of Shasta?

00:07:12.474 --> 00:07:13.140 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.520 align:middle line:84%
It's a little town
called Mount Shasta.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's probably the
strangest bunch of eccentrics

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:21.130 align:middle line:84%
I've ever seen in my life,
everywhere from mystics

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:25.790 align:middle line:84%
to mountain climbers,
Nepalese mountain climbers,

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:28.360 align:middle line:84%
to-- it's just an
amazing little place.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk
about the mysticism

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.080 align:middle line:84%
of Shasta for a moment and
what people have cited.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.540 align:middle line:84%
The fact that Native Americans
saw this hundreds of years ago

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.060 align:middle line:84%
and they're still
seeing things tells me

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.070 align:middle line:84%
that there's
something real there.

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:43.360 align:middle line:90%
We just don't know what it is.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.782 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:07:44.782 --> 00:07:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And these things, they
seem to come and go.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.950 align:middle line:84%
There's an amazing
article in 1938 LA Times.

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:54.540 align:middle line:84%
A travel writer
goes to Mount Shasta

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:58.240 align:middle line:84%
and reports seeing lights and
kind of UFO figures and things.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.860 align:middle line:84%
And then he goes into town
to interview the people.

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:05.060 align:middle line:84%
And they tell him that there's
these beings called Lemurians

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.870 align:middle line:84%
who live inside the
mountain in a city.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:09.240 align:middle line:90%
And they come out.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And they'll buy, like, shoe
strings with $50 worth of gold.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:18.650 align:middle line:84%
And these stories have
going on for a long time.

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And now we're looking
back at the stories

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.110 align:middle line:90%
that the Native Americans told.

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And we're thinking
that maybe there really

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:29.330 align:middle line:84%
are these tall beings that live
in Mount Shasta that come out

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:33.400 align:middle line:84%
that were actually remnants from
a previous civilization called

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.080 align:middle line:84%
Lemuria who live
inside the mountain now

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.490 align:middle line:84%
to escape from the world,
which is part of the movie,

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:39.100 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.559 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, are
there reports at all

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:43.667 align:middle line:84%
about people
disappearing out there?

00:08:43.667 --> 00:08:44.500 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Oh, yeah.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:45.840 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people disappear.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:51.320 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people will go
hiking and never come back.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:56.320 align:middle line:84%
Then there's stories of people
who go and come back, literally

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.830 align:middle line:84%
are gone for months,
and then reappear back--

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:00.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In a daze?

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:04.660 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: In a daze, saying
that they went into a cave

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.035 align:middle line:84%
and got lost inside
the mountain.

00:09:06.035 --> 00:09:06.868 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my god.

00:09:06.868 --> 00:09:07.850 align:middle line:90%
What do they eat?

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:09.920 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Well, they're
usually backpackers.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.836 align:middle line:84%
They'll bring food--
they have food with them,

00:09:11.836 --> 00:09:14.291 align:middle line:84%
and they get caught--
a storm comes,

00:09:14.291 --> 00:09:16.540 align:middle line:84%
and you walk into a cave,
and the next thing you know,

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:19.322 align:middle line:84%
you're traversing and
spelunking the cave.

00:09:19.322 --> 00:09:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And then, pretty
soon, you're lost.

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to
find your way back out.

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And it'd be a
hair-raising experience.

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:27.050 align:middle line:90%
I've been inside these tubes.

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:28.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they eerie?

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:28.883 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: They are.

00:09:28.883 --> 00:09:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And your flashlight
only goes about 15 feet.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.410 align:middle line:90%
And these tubes are miles long.

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:35.760 align:middle line:90%
And who knows what's in there?

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could
literally get a ship,

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:41.697 align:middle line:84%
a gigantic ship, into these
things-- a naval ship.

00:09:41.697 --> 00:09:43.030 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's how big they are.

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:46.860 align:middle line:84%
So if a craft flew into it,
it could go all the way down,

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:47.360 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:47.650 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:49.025 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know
how many layers

00:09:49.025 --> 00:09:51.020 align:middle line:84%
there are, how many
stories, you might say.

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:54.600 align:middle line:84%
So we're in the top layer, near
the surface of these tubes.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.585 align:middle line:90%
But how far down do they go?

00:09:56.585 --> 00:09:58.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, they obviously
go all the way down, right?

00:09:58.960 --> 00:09:59.650 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Well, yeah.

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:01.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To the pits
of where the lava is.

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:01.726 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:10:01.726 --> 00:10:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And no one really
has explored them.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.885 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have to a limited
degree, only for the film.

00:10:06.885 --> 00:10:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And we actually show one of
them in the film, by the way.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.990 align:middle line:84%
The star enters into
one of these lava tubes.

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:15.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's amazingly
huge when you look at it.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.920 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what to say
about it, except that there

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.210 align:middle line:90%
is something there.

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:20.090 align:middle line:90%
There really is.

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:21.949 align:middle line:90%
And it needs to be looked at.

00:10:21.949 --> 00:10:23.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the theme
of "Shasta," the movie?

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:26.970 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Well, it's about the
return of-- there's a prophecy

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:31.580 align:middle line:84%
from the Vedic tradition
that, at the end of this age,

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:33.520 align:middle line:90%
a man will come.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:34.990 align:middle line:90%
And his name is Kalki.

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And he will destroy
the purveyors of lies--

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:39.311 align:middle line:90%

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:43.050 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: --and
bring back the, you

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:44.890 align:middle line:90%
know, kind of a truthful age.

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:48.375 align:middle line:84%
And I've been waiting for
Kalki for, like, 30 years.

00:10:48.375 --> 00:10:50.750 align:middle line:84%
And so, finally, I gave up
and decided I'd just put him--

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:51.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You made him.

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:53.403 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, so now, he's
literally going back, only

00:10:53.403 --> 00:10:54.140 align:middle line:90%
in a movie.

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:55.370 align:middle line:90%
So it's kind of funny.

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:57.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it like the
second coming of Christ?

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:58.789 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: It is a little bit.

00:10:58.789 --> 00:11:02.990 align:middle line:84%
In fact, a lot of
people have postulated

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:06.020 align:middle line:84%
that the Christian
tradition is actually

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:09.130 align:middle line:84%
kind of an aspect of the
Vedic tradition in that Jesus

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:13.010 align:middle line:84%
is so much like Krishna--
not just his name, Christ

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:17.960 align:middle line:84%
and Krishna-- but Krishna
came here to redeem us.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus came
here to redeem us.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And Kalki is the
reincarnation of Krishna.

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.160 align:middle line:84%
So you wonder
where these stories

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.650 align:middle line:84%
come-- because Jesus is going
to come on a white horse,

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:29.500 align:middle line:84%
and Kalki comes
on a white horse.

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And so these myths
are all kind of,

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.340 align:middle line:84%
I think, intertwined
with each other.

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And now here we are,
2000 years later,

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:40.440 align:middle line:84%
and we don't really understand
where this myth comes from.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.870 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't really
matter, because it's

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:44.930 align:middle line:84%
the myth that is across
all these countries,

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:46.890 align:middle line:84%
that there's going to
be this redeemer that's

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:49.589 align:middle line:84%
going to come at the end of time
and get rid of the bad guys.

00:11:49.589 --> 00:11:51.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sounds
biblical, doesn't it?

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:52.160 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: It does
sound biblical.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.201 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's exciting.

00:11:53.201 --> 00:11:55.460 align:middle line:84%
If people want to watch
"Shasta," where do they go?

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:55.970 align:middle line:90%
What do they do?

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:56.480 align:middle line:90%
How do they see it?

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.720 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: It'll be
shown in theaters.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.100 align:middle line:90%
We're releasing it right now.

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.230 align:middle line:84%
We're releasing it
across the United States.

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:03.460 align:middle line:84%
We'll start probably on
the West Coast in movies,

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:07.030 align:middle line:84%
just because the West
Coast is where Shasta is.

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:09.015 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be
opening up in theaters

00:12:09.015 --> 00:12:09.890 align:middle line:90%
all over the country.

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:11.910 align:middle line:84%
It's going to get a
legitimate opening.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:12.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:13.488 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: It's
going to be on DVD.

00:12:13.488 --> 00:12:14.960 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
have it on iTunes.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:15.710 align:middle line:90%
Just watch for it.

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:16.320 align:middle line:90%
It'll be here.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.570 align:middle line:90%
It's coming to your town soon.

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:20.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jay, you have also
done a lot of work into what is

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.620 align:middle line:90%
called the Arcons--

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:22.620 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:23.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --rulers.

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:24.500 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: The rulers.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:25.417 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who are they?

00:12:25.417 --> 00:12:27.500 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Well, they're
the bad guys in my movie,

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:28.220 align:middle line:90%
for one thing.

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:31.490 align:middle line:84%
But the Arcons-- the
first time that we really

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:36.440 align:middle line:84%
hear about the Arcons in history
is in the Nag Hammadi texts,

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:40.360 align:middle line:84%
which were discovered in
1845 in Egypt in clay jars.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:43.200 align:middle line:84%
Little boy looking for his
sheep walks into a cave--

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.270 align:middle line:84%
here's a cave again-- and
finds these clay jars.

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:47.850 align:middle line:84%
They laid around
for a few years.

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And finally, some
scholars found them

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:52.620 align:middle line:84%
and started doing
interpretations of them.

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And so what's good
about the Nag Hammadi

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:57.970 align:middle line:84%
is that nobody's
messed with them--

00:12:57.970 --> 00:12:59.797 align:middle line:84%
no popes, no kings,
no politicians.

00:12:59.797 --> 00:13:01.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They haven't
been changed, altered.

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:03.171 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: They
haven't been changed.

00:13:03.171 --> 00:13:06.570 align:middle line:84%
So we can actually read what
the ancients 2,000 years ago

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:07.960 align:middle line:90%
thought of the world.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that they talk about

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:13.350 align:middle line:84%
is a chapter called "The
Hypostasis of the Arcons."

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:18.740 align:middle line:84%
And they say that there's a
group of off-planet entities

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:22.280 align:middle line:84%
that have actually come to
Earth and can get into people

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.540 align:middle line:90%
and change them.

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And these entities are attracted
by violence and depraved sex,

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:35.630 align:middle line:84%
and they kind of-- almost like
locusts in the fire, coming in.

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:39.540 align:middle line:84%
They swoop in on violent
situations-- war, conflict--

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:41.070 align:middle line:90%
and encourage it.

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.480 align:middle line:90%
They feed off of it like food.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And so the Gnostics, who
wrote the Nag Hammadi,

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:54.620 align:middle line:84%
they say that the Arcons are
fomenting all of this strife

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:58.630 align:middle line:84%
and war to create kind of
a psychic food for them.

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And so we need to
be aware of this,

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:06.280 align:middle line:84%
because they are kind of the
manipulators behind a lot

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.390 align:middle line:84%
of the things that are
going on these days.

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And once we become
aware of the Arcons,

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:13.890 align:middle line:84%
then we can make sure
that we understand

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:18.280 align:middle line:84%
that, when things
are happening--

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:22.400 align:middle line:84%
road rage for instance,
somebody gives you the finger,

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:26.280 align:middle line:84%
you don't react, because you're
falling into the Arcon trap.

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.461 align:middle line:90%
So the person is angry.

00:14:27.461 --> 00:14:28.710 align:middle line:90%
They're trying to get to work.

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:30.251 align:middle line:84%
They give you the
finger because they

00:14:30.251 --> 00:14:31.920 align:middle line:90%
think you're slowing them down.

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.190 align:middle line:84%
And then you give the finger,
and a big fight ensues.

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:35.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You could get
killed if somebody--

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:35.965 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: You could get killed.

00:14:35.965 --> 00:14:37.210 align:middle line:90%
It happens all the time.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to
understand this and then

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.620 align:middle line:84%
not fall into the
Arcon trap and say no.

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think, again,
Jesus was trying

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:49.220 align:middle line:84%
to teach us how not to
fall into the Arcon trap.

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:52.520 align:middle line:10%
Forgive your enemies
and love each other.

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.720 align:middle line:10%
And these are things
that Arcons don't like.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.017 align:middle line:90%
They don't like love.

00:14:56.017 --> 00:14:57.350 align:middle line:90%
They don't really like children.

00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:58.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they humans?

00:14:58.560 --> 00:14:59.950 align:middle line:10%
>>WEIDNER: Well, human-like.

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:02.210 align:middle line:10%
You interviewed Mac
Tonnies on your show.

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:05.940 align:middle line:10%
He died right after he wrote
the book "Cryptoterrestrials,"

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:08.680 align:middle line:10%
which is about
kind of the Arcons.

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:12.830 align:middle line:10%
Here's the cover of his
book, this haunting painting.

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:17.420 align:middle line:10%
Now, I think this is a Tall
White-- Charles Hall's Tall

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:18.070 align:middle line:10%
Whites.

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:19.590 align:middle line:10%
I think this might
be a Tall White,

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:21.480 align:middle line:10%
but I think it's also an Arcon.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:26.050 align:middle line:10%
In other words, they're
off-planet humanoid beings

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:29.270 align:middle line:10%
who come here and
can infiltrate--

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:31.400 align:middle line:10%
use their psychic
abilities to infiltrate

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.960 align:middle line:10%
into human-- the
councils of humanity.

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:37.244 align:middle line:84%
They've taken over the
top levels of humanity.

00:15:37.244 --> 00:15:39.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they what
we call the Illuminati?

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:39.993 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: They are.

00:15:39.993 --> 00:15:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And Arcon means
"ruler" in Greek.

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And so if you take the word
like "anarchist" or "anarchy,"

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:51.370 align:middle line:84%
it translates perfectly
as "against the Arcons."

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:54.940 align:middle line:84%
So the Arcons, according
to the lore, they invaded,

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:58.980 align:middle line:84%
they kind of took over
the leadership positions

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:03.350 align:middle line:84%
around the world
2,500, 3,000 years ago.

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And they've been in
charge ever since.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, they have
the ability to switch bodies.

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:09.900 align:middle line:84%
So they can die
and switch bodies.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:11.617 align:middle line:90%
Or they just possess people.

00:16:11.617 --> 00:16:12.950 align:middle line:90%
We don't know enough about this.

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:14.770 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's so
important to get it out.

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:18.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you saw them walking
down the street, though, Jay,

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:21.329 align:middle line:84%
you would say, clearly,
they look different.

00:16:21.329 --> 00:16:22.120 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: They do.

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, this
looks like-- but I've

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.171 align:middle line:90%
seen people who look like this.

00:16:26.171 --> 00:16:26.796 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yep.

00:16:26.796 --> 00:16:27.295 align:middle line:90%
I have, too.

00:16:27.295 --> 00:16:29.954 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when I'm waiting
at the airport, when

00:16:29.954 --> 00:16:31.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm waiting to
take a flight, I'll

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:34.090 align:middle line:84%
frequently go to where people
are walking by on the moving

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:34.750 align:middle line:90%
sidewalks.

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:35.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that a real
picture of somebody?

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:36.570 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: That
is a real picture.

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:37.630 align:middle line:90%
She's a supermodel.

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And again, our idea of beauty
is based on these people.

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:47.110 align:middle line:84%
If you look at models, they
frequently have the thin chin.

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:49.760 align:middle line:84%
I think she's probably used
collagen on her lips, because--

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Look, if
she didn't have hair,

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:54.006 align:middle line:84%
she would look identical
to that picture.

00:16:54.006 --> 00:16:55.630 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yep, if
she shaved her head,

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:57.170 align:middle line:90%
she would look just like that.

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:58.630 align:middle line:90%
Here's one.

00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:00.130 align:middle line:84%
They'll frequently
use their hair

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:02.285 align:middle line:90%
to hide the back of their head.

00:17:02.285 --> 00:17:03.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's back there?

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:04.826 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Well,
I think they have

00:17:04.826 --> 00:17:06.619 align:middle line:84%
an extended, elongated
skull a little bit.

00:17:06.619 --> 00:17:09.354 align:middle line:84%
And they use their hair
to try to cover it up.

00:17:09.354 --> 00:17:11.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, that looks
like anybody's grandmother.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.089 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: It does, except
imagine with her head shaved.

00:17:14.089 --> 00:17:17.319 align:middle line:84%
Again, she would look
like that picture, right?

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:18.690 align:middle line:90%
If you shaved her head.

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very famous
person, by the way.

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:22.200 align:middle line:90%
This is Lady Barbara Judge.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:25.040 align:middle line:84%
She runs a high
technology company

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:29.340 align:middle line:84%
in Los Alamos, New
Mexico, and in Denver,

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:30.430 align:middle line:90%
and New York and London.

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:31.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She dresses this way?

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.013 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: She dresses this way.

00:17:33.013 --> 00:17:36.357 align:middle line:84%
And the company
transfers technology.

00:17:36.357 --> 00:17:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people think that
they're transferring technology

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:43.270 align:middle line:84%
from off-planet sources and
bringing it into corporations,

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:45.800 align:middle line:84%
which is what this company
does that she does.

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.070 align:middle line:90%
So she's possibly a hybrid.

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:51.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And so she's
involved in an industry where

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.362 align:middle line:84%
she could alter and
change a lot of things.

00:17:54.362 --> 00:17:55.320 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: And she has.

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.110 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Lady Barbara Judge
is in Japan right now,

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:01.090 align:middle line:84%
trying to encourage them to
build more nuclear reactors,

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:02.419 align:middle line:90%
which I find odd.

00:18:02.419 --> 00:18:02.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:03.626 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:18:03.626 --> 00:18:06.040 align:middle line:84%
So again, you can see
that they have a look.

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:07.520 align:middle line:84%
This is the look
of the bloodline,

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:11.070 align:middle line:84%
by the way, the so-called
David Icke's bloodline.

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:16.060 align:middle line:84%
The bloodline, I believe, is how
close they are to these Arcons.

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:17.630 align:middle line:90%
They have Arcon blood.

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And the more Arcon blood they
have, the higher up the echelon

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:21.450 align:middle line:90%
they are.

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And they try to hide this,
but they have this look.

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:26.030 align:middle line:90%
And you can see this look.

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And Charles Hall,
he says that they

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:31.580 align:middle line:84%
like to come into town
and down to Vegas.

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:32.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: [LAUGHS].

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:33.710 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, they like to
dress up and come and do Vegas.

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:34.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They like to gamble?

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:35.276 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:18:35.276 --> 00:18:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And so whenever I'm
in Vegas, I like

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:39.170 align:middle line:84%
to go around, walk
around the tables,

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:40.254 align:middle line:90%
and see if I see anybody--

00:18:40.254 --> 00:18:41.919 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you ever
see one like that?

00:18:41.919 --> 00:18:43.170 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: I have, actually.

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:45.930 align:middle line:84%
I saw this one at
Denver Airport one time.

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:47.400 align:middle line:90%
I had a five-hour layover.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And I just sat watching people
walking by on the moving

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:51.350 align:middle line:90%
sidewalks.

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And I looked, and I saw this
woman coming down the sidewalk.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:56.390 align:middle line:90%
And she had the look.

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:59.210 align:middle line:84%
For one thing, their skin is
very white, almost paper white.

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:00.264 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Misty.

00:19:00.264 --> 00:19:00.930 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at her,
and I actually visibly

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:05.040 align:middle line:90%
was shocked by her appearance.

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think I stood
up or something.

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:09.370 align:middle line:84%
I was going for my cell
camera-- my cell phone

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:10.980 align:middle line:90%
camera to get a shot of her.

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And as she was coming
down the sidewalk,

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:15.587 align:middle line:84%
she started turning
away from me, like this.

00:19:15.587 --> 00:19:16.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like she knew you knew.

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:17.870 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Exactly.

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:19.540 align:middle line:84%
And I never got
a picture of her.

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't want to make a
scene, because in an airport,

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:23.730 align:middle line:90%
you'd get in trouble.

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:26.219 align:middle line:90%
So I do watch for people.

00:19:26.219 --> 00:19:27.510 align:middle line:90%
And I look for it all the time.

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:28.180 align:middle line:90%
And I see people.

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:29.290 align:middle line:84%
Frequently, I'll
take them aside, say,

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:30.720 align:middle line:90%
can I take a picture of you?

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:33.750 align:middle line:84%
I got a waitress serving
me a few weeks ago.

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:35.050 align:middle line:90%
And she looked just like that.

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, wow, I've got
to take a picture of this.

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they out
to manipulate the world?

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:40.700 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yes.

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:41.979 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they want wars?

00:19:41.979 --> 00:19:43.270 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yes, they want wars.

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:44.725 align:middle line:90%
They encourage wars, corruption.

00:19:44.725 --> 00:19:46.999 align:middle line:90%


00:19:46.999 --> 00:19:48.790 align:middle line:84%
This is what the
"Hypostasis of the Arcons"

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:50.330 align:middle line:90%
said 2,100 years ago.

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:51.720 align:middle line:90%
So I'm not making this up.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:54.490 align:middle line:84%
They don't understand us, so
they create a fake culture,

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:54.990 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:56.560 align:middle line:90%
This is very important.

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.090 align:middle line:84%
Since they rule
Hollywood and the media,

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:05.790 align:middle line:84%
too, if you watch the
stuff that they make,

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:08.810 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like they
don't quite understand us.

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And so they give us, like, fake
things that they think we'll

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:13.230 align:middle line:90%
like.

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:14.920 align:middle line:84%
So that's why movies
are frequently

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:19.270 align:middle line:84%
so vapid and superficial,
because nothing really

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:23.100 align:middle line:84%
feels real in a bad movie, and
that's why you don't like it.

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.399 align:middle line:84%
And so it takes a
movie like "Avatar"

00:20:25.399 --> 00:20:27.440 align:middle line:84%
to come along, where you
actually feel something,

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.273 align:middle line:84%
because the guy that
made it, James Cameron,

00:20:29.273 --> 00:20:31.460 align:middle line:90%
we're pretty sure is a human.

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:33.800 align:middle line:90%
And so you can see it.

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And everything they
offer is so superficial,

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:38.140 align:middle line:90%
and there's nothing deep to it.

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:40.240 align:middle line:84%
There's just this
superficial culture

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:43.720 align:middle line:84%
that we live in-- if it even
is a culture at this point.

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:48.190 align:middle line:84%
The architecture that they
encourage is usually very ugly.

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:51.620 align:middle line:84%
Modern art is encouraged,
I believe, by the Arcons.

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:52.870 align:middle line:90%
They seem to like ugliness.

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:57.370 align:middle line:84%
They seem to not understand
us, or they're jealous of us,

00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:00.500 align:middle line:84%
because, according to "The
Hypostasis of the Arcons,"

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:02.740 align:middle line:90%
we have a soul and they don't.

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And so they're kind
of jealous of us.

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And they're trying to
keep us down on the farm,

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:12.940 align:middle line:84%
because if we ever
realize who we really are,

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:16.575 align:middle line:84%
we will be stronger than they
are, and we will defeat them.

00:21:16.575 --> 00:21:17.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And go after them.

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:18.491 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Exactly.

00:21:18.491 --> 00:21:19.410 align:middle line:90%
And so they know this.

00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:20.868 align:middle line:84%
And so they do
everything they can.

00:21:20.868 --> 00:21:22.820 align:middle line:90%
They put fluoride in the water.

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And they give the kids
prescription drugs.

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And they're doing everything
they can to flatten us out

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:29.940 align:middle line:84%
as a species so
that we never have

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:33.970 align:middle line:84%
enough knowledge and spiritual
power to rise up and tell them,

00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:36.279 align:middle line:84%
you know, we've had
enough of your stuff.

00:21:36.279 --> 00:21:37.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did they get here?

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And how long have
they been here?

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:41.640 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: That's a
really good question.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.450 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how they got here.

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:45.780 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're the fallen
angels that they talk about

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:47.560 align:middle line:90%
in the Bible.

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
they got here, but I

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:52.660 align:middle line:84%
know they've been here for
probably at least 6,000 years.

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:54.150 align:middle line:90%
They've been ruling things.

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:59.210 align:middle line:84%
I believe that they're the
ones who literally created

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:02.500 align:middle line:84%
the original cultures
of Mesopotamia--

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:03.257 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Samaria.

00:22:03.257 --> 00:22:04.340 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Mm-hm, Samaria.

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And they put humans on,
like, the grain-based diet.

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And we've stopped
eating the foods

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:12.520 align:middle line:90%
that hunter gatherers eat.

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:13.740 align:middle line:84%
And we started eating
foods that actually

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:14.781 align:middle line:90%
weren't very good for us.

00:22:14.781 --> 00:22:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And what do these foods
do, these high-grain diets?

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:23.020 align:middle line:84%
They keep us kind of
sleepy and passive.

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:26.240 align:middle line:84%
One time, I went
to Alcatraz to do

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.747 align:middle line:84%
a tour of Alcatraz, the prison
on a little island on the San

00:22:28.747 --> 00:22:29.330 align:middle line:90%
Francisco Bay.

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:30.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Weird place.

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:31.290 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: It is a weird place.

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:33.100 align:middle line:84%
And the person that
was leading the tour

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:35.800 align:middle line:84%
said, well, every night, the
final thing that we would

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.160 align:middle line:84%
do before we've sent the
prisoners into the cells

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.897 align:middle line:84%
is we'd feed them a big,
huge pile of mashed potatoes

00:22:40.897 --> 00:22:41.480 align:middle line:90%
or spaghetti--

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:42.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or pasta.

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:42.800 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Or pasta.

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:43.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, exactly.

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And I raised
my hand, and I said, well,

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:46.020 align:middle line:90%
why do you do that?

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:46.580 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And he
says, well, we've

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:48.530 align:middle line:90%
found that it pacifies them.

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:50.660 align:middle line:90%
And I went, bingo, there we go.

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:53.110 align:middle line:84%
This is why the
grain diet is here

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:54.390 align:middle line:90%
is because it's pacifying us.

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:55.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Heavy
starches and sugars.

00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:57.031 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Heavy
starches and sugars,

00:22:57.031 --> 00:22:59.584 align:middle line:84%
which really we're not
meant to eat at all.

00:22:59.584 --> 00:23:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And if you've ever
looked-- and I'm sure

00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:04.130 align:middle line:84%
you have-- looked into
what those foods do

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:07.010 align:middle line:84%
to the physique of the
human body-- cavities

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:12.240 align:middle line:84%
and plaque in the
arterial walls.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:14.032 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, it's just
really bad for you.

00:23:14.032 --> 00:23:15.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you
know, I've never

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:17.950 align:middle line:84%
seen anybody energetic after
eating a big plate of pasta,

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:18.450 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:19.540 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: No, you
just want to go to bed.

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:20.256 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You want to go to bed.

00:23:20.256 --> 00:23:20.960 align:middle line:90%
You're sleepy.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:21.410 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Exactly.

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the Arcons
did that on purpose, just

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:24.920 align:middle line:90%
like Alcatraz.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:25.600 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.224 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of
the things that we

00:23:27.224 --> 00:23:29.800 align:middle line:84%
have are done on
purpose by the Arcons.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they here
to control, to take over?

00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:34.900 align:middle line:90%
What's their mission?

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:38.130 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Their mission is
to keep us on life support,

00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:43.030 align:middle line:84%
just on life support, never cure
us, never help us get better,

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:47.330 align:middle line:84%
keep us down on the farm,
weak, so that they can feed off

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:48.646 align:middle line:90%
our spiritual energy.

00:23:48.646 --> 00:23:49.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they do.

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.210 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: And they do.

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:53.670 align:middle line:84%
Look what's going on
right now in Ukraine.

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:56.175 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you talk about
a nasty situation.

00:23:56.175 --> 00:23:59.590 align:middle line:84%
It could have-- if someone had
just-- a politician had just

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:03.740 align:middle line:84%
risen up to the chance to solve
that situation when it started,

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:05.810 align:middle line:84%
then we wouldn't be in
the mess we're in now.

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:08.919 align:middle line:84%
But instead, all of our
politicians, both sides,

00:24:08.919 --> 00:24:09.710 align:middle line:90%
they're all guilty.

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:10.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
all feeding this.

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:12.071 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: They are feeding it.

00:24:12.071 --> 00:24:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And we're putting
secret agents in there,

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.630 align:middle line:84%
and Putin's putting
secret agents.

00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:16.820 align:middle line:84%
And they're all
fighting each other,

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:18.120 align:middle line:90%
and they're killing each other.

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:20.040 align:middle line:90%
And none of it has to happen.

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.840 align:middle line:90%
And we don't know what to do.

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:25.220 align:middle line:84%
We're so lost as a species that
we're watching this go down.

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And nobody says,
can't we go over there

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:28.870 align:middle line:90%
and help those people?

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:30.430 align:middle line:90%
Same with Fukushima.

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:32.840 align:middle line:84%
How come we aren't sending
the greatest scientists

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:35.540 align:middle line:84%
over to Japan and
solving that problem?

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:36.130 align:middle line:90%
But we're not.

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:36.600 align:middle line:90%
We're passive.

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:36.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're not.

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:37.530 align:middle line:90%
We've left it alone.

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:38.321 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: We have.

00:24:38.321 --> 00:24:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And this is, I believe, is
all the results of the Arcons.

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:45.630 align:middle line:84%
We're no longer acting
like a responsible species.

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:49.870 align:middle line:84%
Were acting like little
children and waiting for mommy

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:51.770 align:middle line:84%
and daddy to come clean
up everything for us.

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:54.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How does the
other shoe that drops, Jay?

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:59.949 align:middle line:84%
What happens with these Arcons,
assuming we don't stop them?

00:24:59.949 --> 00:25:01.740 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Well, then
they will continue on

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:04.590 align:middle line:84%
with their plan, which
is to keep us-- to reduce

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:06.450 align:middle line:84%
the population to
a manageable level

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:09.620 align:middle line:84%
so that they can then just
use whatever they want

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:14.910 align:middle line:84%
to completely, in a way, take
our children from us, which

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:17.470 align:middle line:84%
is what I think they're doing
right now with pop culture.

00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:20.600 align:middle line:84%
I think that they're
literally creating artifices

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:23.860 align:middle line:84%
in pop culture that are
removing our children away

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:26.240 align:middle line:84%
from us, alienating
our children from us.

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:26.900 align:middle line:90%
That's really--

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:28.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Social
networking, everything.

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:28.950 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Mm-hm.

00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think they're
really trying

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:33.330 align:middle line:84%
to get the younger
generation in their camp

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:34.767 align:middle line:90%
right now so that they are--

00:25:34.767 --> 00:25:36.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's an
interesting theory.

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:37.220 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: It is.

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the
music and the culture

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:43.360 align:middle line:84%
that they're fomenting onto
the young people right now,

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.135 align:middle line:90%
it is downright evil.

00:25:45.135 --> 00:25:46.010 align:middle line:90%
That's all I can say.

00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:48.320 align:middle line:84%
I've really investigated
it and looked into it.

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.094 align:middle line:84%
And I would not want my
children-- fortunately,

00:25:51.094 --> 00:25:53.010 align:middle line:84%
mine are older now, and
I don't have to worry.

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:55.050 align:middle line:84%
But I would not want
my young children

00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:56.640 align:middle line:90%
to be watching almost anything--

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.652 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you know,
I've got grandchildren.

00:25:58.652 --> 00:26:00.110 align:middle line:84%
My children, like
yours, are older.

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:03.250 align:middle line:84%
But the grandchildren,
they're kids.

00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:04.890 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And
their minds are just

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:08.090 align:middle line:90%
ready to soak up the stuff.

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And we should be
giving our children

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.150 align:middle line:90%
nothing but positive images.

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:15.710 align:middle line:84%
But instead, they're getting
nothing but negative images.

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:19.090 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how many murders
a child watches before they're

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:22.080 align:middle line:84%
12 years old on television,
but it's in the thousands.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And they shouldn't
even see one murder

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:25.850 align:middle line:90%
before they're 12 years old.

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And we have to get
a hold on this,

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:30.560 align:middle line:84%
because we're not in control
of what's going on here.

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And art is supposed to
rise the human race up

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:38.710 align:middle line:84%
into higher levels of being,
not drag us down into the dirt.

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And right now, all
of the art that's

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:43.114 align:middle line:84%
going on, from entertainment
to paintings to music,

00:26:43.114 --> 00:26:45.530 align:middle line:84%
seems like it's trying to just
drag us down into the dirt,

00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:48.700 align:middle line:84%
like we're a filthy, rotten
species that deserves

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:51.490 align:middle line:84%
everything we get, when, in
fact, we're not that at all.

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:52.840 align:middle line:90%
We're an incredible species.

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:55.680 align:middle line:84%
And we need to wake up
to who we are and then

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:58.450 align:middle line:84%
rise up and stop
what's going on.

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It seems to
be happening, though,

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.919 align:middle line:90%
at an incredibly fast clip.

00:27:01.919 --> 00:27:03.710 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: That's right,
because the Arcons

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:04.920 align:middle line:90%
know we're waking up.

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:09.140 align:middle line:84%
Shows like yours, internet,
it's waking everybody up.

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:11.450 align:middle line:84%
The Nag Hammadi-- I
mean, is it an accident

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:15.026 align:middle line:84%
that we found this right
after World War II ended?

00:27:15.026 --> 00:27:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And if you believe in
a divine will, like me,

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:19.980 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the Nag
Hammadi was left for us

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:22.980 align:middle line:84%
to find so that we would
now have the warning

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:28.660 align:middle line:84%
and be able to act on it--
divine will, if you must.

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that that is
our largest responsibility

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:35.570 align:middle line:90%
now, is to become adults.

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:38.160 align:middle line:84%
The Arcons treat
us like children.

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:40.357 align:middle line:84%
And we need to say, we're
done being children--

00:27:40.357 --> 00:27:41.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Enough is enough.

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.356 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, we're
going to become adults.

00:27:43.356 --> 00:27:46.550 align:middle line:84%
Adults don't drop depleted
uranium on people.

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:48.660 align:middle line:84%
Adults don't build
nuclear power plants

00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:50.550 align:middle line:84%
where tsunamis that
are going to hit.

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:51.890 align:middle line:90%
Adults--

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:54.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Don't kidnap
hordes of little girls--

00:27:54.010 --> 00:27:55.010 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:55.650 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE NOORY: --and sell them.

00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:58.820 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Exactly like what's
going on in Nigeria right now,

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:02.460 align:middle line:90%
which is a classic Arcon thing.

00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:05.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think once we take
responsibility for our actions,

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:07.996 align:middle line:90%
they will just wither away.

00:28:07.996 --> 00:28:09.870 align:middle line:84%
But first, we have to
understand the problem.

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the biggest
thing that we can do right now.

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just me
that's announcing this.

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:16.790 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are
talking about the Arcons.

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:19.130 align:middle line:84%
David Icke is talking
about it, John Lash.

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:20.960 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people talk
about the Arcons now.

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:22.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And really,
it's in the Bible.

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:24.030 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: It is in the Bible.

00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:25.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've just
got to look for it.

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:25.888 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: It is.

00:28:25.888 --> 00:28:27.360 align:middle line:10%
In fact, all you
have to do is just

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.300 align:middle line:10%
change the references
to demons and Satan

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:31.270 align:middle line:10%
and just change that to Arcons.

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:34.650 align:middle line:10%
And now you have the
Bible warning you.

00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:39.500 align:middle line:10%
And it could even be said
that the story of Jesus

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:41.570 align:middle line:10%
at the end there,
where he's killed,

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:44.970 align:middle line:10%
is actually a rebellion, Jesus
and his followers rebelling

00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:46.170 align:middle line:10%
against the Arcons.

00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:47.830 align:middle line:84%
They go into the
holy temple, where

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:52.530 align:middle line:84%
they're exchanging money,
which is classic Arcon, right,

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:54.540 align:middle line:90%
to turn a temple into a bank.

00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And then Jesus
throws all the money

00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:58.920 align:middle line:84%
and the bankers out, says
this is a holy place.

00:28:58.920 --> 00:28:59.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He knew better.

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.550 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And
they went, oh yeah?

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And I believe, at that
point, when he threw them out

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:07.940 align:middle line:84%
of the temple, that his days
were numbered from then on.

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:10.390 align:middle line:84%

So the next time you go
walking along the street

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:19.970 align:middle line:10%
and you see someone with
huge eyes, a larger head,

00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:23.910 align:middle line:10%
they just might be
an Arcon, and you

00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:25.670 align:middle line:10%
may want to walk the other way.

00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:28.868 align:middle line:84%
