>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.300 align:middle line:10%
Astrologer Mercedes
Arnús is with us,

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.880 align:middle line:10%
has been a student of
the stars since age 15.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.660 align:middle line:84%
At 27, she created the
Astral Method Academy.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.730 align:middle line:84%
Now that combines astrology,
meditation, and channeling

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.060 align:middle line:90%
to guide others.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.680 align:middle line:84%
She has a new Oracle deck to
make learning astrology fun

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.890 align:middle line:90%
and accessible.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.685 align:middle line:84%
Mercedes, welcome
to Beyond Belief.

00:00:43.685 --> 00:00:45.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MERCEDES ARNÚS ARRAUT:
Thank you so much, George.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.240 align:middle line:90%
It's a pleasure being here.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.448 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: By the way you
have a wonderful first name.

00:00:49.448 --> 00:00:50.930 align:middle line:90%
How did you get that?

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.040 align:middle line:10%
>>ARRAUT: It's the
name of my aunt,

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.740 align:middle line:10%
my grandmother, great,
great grandmother.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.660 align:middle line:90%
So it means gratitude.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.150 align:middle line:84%
So gratitude runs in
the family for sure.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Now, at
the age of 15, you

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.590 align:middle line:90%
got into astrology by accident?

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.750 align:middle line:10%
>>ARRAUT: Maybe you
could say by accident,

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.250 align:middle line:10%
but I was obsessed, George,
obsessed with the stars.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.215 align:middle line:10%
I was so excited about
asking people their star sign

00:01:15.215 --> 00:01:17.990 align:middle line:10%
when they were born,
and almost like I

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.790 align:middle line:10%
was feeling like that I
was predicting for them,

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.040 align:middle line:10%
even without having
studied astrology.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.640 align:middle line:84%
So when I decided at age 15
to sign up for an academy,

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.250 align:middle line:84%
it was weird, but I felt like
I already knew everything

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.760 align:middle line:90%
that they were teaching me.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.430 align:middle line:84%
So I knew that I was
in the right spot

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.430 align:middle line:90%
even though I was the youngest.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.972 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You even
got involved in it

00:01:36.972 --> 00:01:39.000 align:middle line:90%
even before 15, didn't you?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: Well,
my parents taught

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.120 align:middle line:84%
me meditation, how
to read the stars,

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.540 align:middle line:84%
how to connect to the stars
through meditation as well.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.860 align:middle line:84%
And I was brought up in a pretty
spiritually awakened family,

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.360 align:middle line:90%
fortunately for me.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Was it easy
for you to study?

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.880 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: I think
it was, I genuinely

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.470 align:middle line:84%
think it was because it was
a world that I was already

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.890 align:middle line:84%
prepared for by my parents,
and being brought up

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.440 align:middle line:84%
with the guidance of meditation
and channeling already.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.980 align:middle line:84%
It was easy to connect
to that wisdom.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And Mercedes, what
point in your life or career

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.770 align:middle line:84%
did you know this is what
I want to do for a living?

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: Well,
that's a little tricky

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.410 align:middle line:84%
because even though my
parents were very spiritual,

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.350 align:middle line:90%
my upbringing was very Catholic.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.430 align:middle line:84%
I went to a Catholic
school, grandparents

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.820 align:middle line:84%
and great grandparents
were super, super Catholic.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.740 align:middle line:84%
So my parents were
already the ones

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.840 align:middle line:84%
rebelling against
it, I'd say, or even

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.330 align:middle line:84%
like going through a much more
spiritually awakened path.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:47.890 align:middle line:84%
So I'd say that it wasn't until
I was around the age of 27

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.800 align:middle line:84%
that I had already gone
through so many paths trying

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.870 align:middle line:84%
to find that calling that I
was like, I'm not finding it.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And I never thought
astrology was a way

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.890 align:middle line:84%
that I could make a living,
because back then astrology

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.470 align:middle line:84%
was for weirdos were for people
that were like, I don't know,

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.790 align:middle line:84%
definitely not for people
that were brought up

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.300 align:middle line:84%
in a very Catholic ambience,
very Catholic upbringing.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.430 align:middle line:84%
So I never thought that
would be a path that

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.020 align:middle line:84%
would be safe enough,
professionally at least.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.820 align:middle line:84%
But when I was 27, something
changed because I had no option.

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:33.780 align:middle line:84%
I started receiving so many
messages, so many callings,

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.850 align:middle line:90%
I could hear so many voices.

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.350 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: From where?

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: Channels, I
was like an open channel

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.660 align:middle line:84%
and I was just receiving
so much information,

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.210 align:middle line:84%
so much knowledge at all times
that I started feeling books.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.510 align:middle line:84%
In one of those books,
in one of those writings,

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.840 align:middle line:84%
they told me what
I was going to do.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And this was right around
before I turned 27.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.737 align:middle line:90%
I was 26 and something.

00:04:01.737 --> 00:04:04.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Now there are a lot
of different types of astrology.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.380 align:middle line:84%
Do you specialize in
any one particular kind?

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ARRAUT: Yes.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.200 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, I respect
Hellenistic astrology, which

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.040 align:middle line:84%
is the traditional form of
astrology, the first use that we

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.339 align:middle line:90%
have of astrology.

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And I merge it with the modern
techniques because I feel that

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.460 align:middle line:84%
even though they've been
like newly developed,

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.600 align:middle line:84%
we could say it since the 1700s
where Uranus was discovered

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.410 align:middle line:90%
and then Neptune and Pluto.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.290 align:middle line:84%
So I incorporate those planets
as well in my teaching.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.665 align:middle line:84%
So we could say it's a mix
of Hellenistic and modern

00:04:36.665 --> 00:04:36.980 align:middle line:90%
astrology.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What's really the
difference between the two?

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: So
traditional astrology

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:48.330 align:middle line:84%
works a lot more with the basic
planets that were first found.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And modern astrology
incorporates the outer planets

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.150 align:middle line:84%
and incorporates
asteroids as well,

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.080 align:middle line:84%
and it has developed more
modern techniques, such as,

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.190 align:middle line:84%
for example, studying the
compatibility in between two

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.990 align:middle line:90%
charts.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.570 align:middle line:84%
For example, love
synastry, which

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.710 align:middle line:84%
is something that's
very common nowadays,

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.140 align:middle line:84%
but that is
something that didn't

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.130 align:middle line:90%
exist in Hellenistic astrology.

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You formed the Astral
Method Academy, what is that?

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.590 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: So I was
a little bit afraid

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.240 align:middle line:84%
of all the power that
we were able to have,

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.240 align:middle line:84%
astrologers or people
that make predictions.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And the power that we hold
or that people give us

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.600 align:middle line:84%
when we're doing readings
because they come to us

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.280 align:middle line:84%
and they expect us to decide
what's going to happen to them

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.680 align:middle line:84%
or predict their
future, which is one

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.070 align:middle line:90%
of the first uses of astrology.

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.410 align:middle line:84%
But when people come to us, they
give us all of this attention

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.830 align:middle line:84%
and all of this power and
it was very overwhelming,

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.690 align:middle line:84%
because at the end
of the day we are

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.940 align:middle line:84%
creators of our own life,
creators of our own reality.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And I did not want
the responsibility

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.750 align:middle line:84%
of making predictions
for someone that

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.190 align:middle line:84%
would make them
obsessed with them,

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.620 align:middle line:84%
because I did not want
to harm them in that way.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.920 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that making
such strong predictions

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.720 align:middle line:84%
sometimes could be
harmful for people.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.570 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to open an academy
because that way people could

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:17.380 align:middle line:84%
decide their own fate
by understanding where

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.920 align:middle line:90%
their fate is coming from.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.460 align:middle line:84%
The fate or the
patterns that they

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.030 align:middle line:84%
come to develop in their lives,
and how to escape those patterns

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:31.630 align:middle line:84%
through astrology so
that it's not their fate.

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.360 align:middle line:90%


00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.920 align:middle line:84%
Or less liked
predictions, let's say,

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.860 align:middle line:84%
so that they don't
have to become true.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.160 align:middle line:10%
They can avoid
them or escape them

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.380 align:middle line:10%
if they know about
them in advance.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.430 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's very
important for each one

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.820 align:middle line:84%
to read their own future,
because your consciousness is

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.290 align:middle line:84%
here to guide you
in this lifetime.

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Did they decide
this themselves or did you

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.185 align:middle line:90%
decide that for them?

00:06:59.185 --> 00:07:03.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: I was instructed by
my higher self and other beings

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:08.860 align:middle line:84%
to open this academy
so that we wouldn't

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.420 align:middle line:90%
have so much power over people.

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And I say we as
in me and whoever

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:20.250 align:middle line:84%
else teaches astrology or any
powerful predicting methods

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:21.050 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:22.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Have you
rejected students?

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:24.410 align:middle line:90%
>>ARRAUT: I have, yes.

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:26.920 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What causes
that rejection?

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.840 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: To me, people
that work with me closely,

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.840 align:middle line:84%
like my students, need to be
very careful with the way they

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.470 align:middle line:90%
handle information.

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:39.370 align:middle line:84%
Because what I
teach is something

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:41.450 align:middle line:84%
that is going to change
your entire life,

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:43.900 align:middle line:84%
the way you're going
to see life, the way

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:49.520 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see your family,
your career, your finances,

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:54.030 align:middle line:84%
it's going to change the entire
perspective of your life.

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:56.910 align:middle line:84%
So if you come to
these teachings,

00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:01.130 align:middle line:84%
if you come to me
to learn my method,

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:06.140 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be a new you that
emerges and a lot of people

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.290 align:middle line:90%
are not ready for that.

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:10.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Can you tell by
just talking to somebody,

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:14.460 align:middle line:84%
that person is going to
be a great astrologer?

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:15.300 align:middle line:90%
>>ARRAUT: Yes.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.675 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You've got that
instinct within you, don't you?

00:08:17.675 --> 00:08:18.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ARRAUT: Yes, for sure.

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:22.890 align:middle line:84%
And also because it's their
soul talking through their eyes

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:26.930 align:middle line:84%
and I can see when someone
is so fascinated by knowledge

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:30.470 align:middle line:84%
and so fascinated by the
mysteries that have been hidden

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:35.220 align:middle line:84%
and covered up in astrology in
the last thousands of years.

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Mercedes,
they say that astrology

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:41.823 align:middle line:84%
is like a mirror of our lives
on Earth, you agree with that?

00:08:41.823 --> 00:08:43.615 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: Absolutely,
and that's literally,

00:08:43.615 --> 00:08:47.380 align:middle line:84%
George, how I describe astrology
to be because people think

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.940 align:middle line:84%
that astrology
happened to us like,

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.460 align:middle line:84%
oh, this full moon is
so difficult to handle.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.970 align:middle line:84%
It's like, no,
it's actually just

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:58.455 align:middle line:84%
whatever is happening in
the solar system, whatever

00:08:58.455 --> 00:09:01.460 align:middle line:84%
is happening with the planets,
any alignment, new moon,

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:05.000 align:middle line:84%
full moon is just a mirror
to our current reality.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.280 align:middle line:84%
So every month we
go through cycles.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.060 align:middle line:84%
Same as the moon,
same as the planets,

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.950 align:middle line:84%
every day we're
evolving, we're growing.

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And so is the solar system
constantly in evolution.

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:23.080 align:middle line:84%
So what I explain in
my academy as well

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.870 align:middle line:84%
is how the solar
system is a mirror,

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:29.120 align:middle line:84%
it's a macrocosmos
to our microcosmos.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:32.900 align:middle line:84%
So whatever is happening outside
is happening inside as well.

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:39.220 align:middle line:84%
So astrology is just a way to
learn how to look at the mirror

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:42.370 align:middle line:84%
and integrate that image that
the mirror is showing you

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:44.330 align:middle line:90%
into your own existence.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:49.760 align:middle line:84%
So that's why predictions,
they're influences,

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:56.270 align:middle line:84%
but predictions can be easily
changed, they're malleable.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:10:00.310 align:middle line:84%
They can change if you
change because your future is

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:02.450 align:middle line:90%
conditioned by your present.

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:05.320 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I
founded, going back

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.870 align:middle line:84%
to that question, that's why
I founded the Astral Method

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:08.810 align:middle line:90%
Academy.

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And I teach exactly
this, that astrology

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:15.830 align:middle line:84%
is a mirror to our own life,
and we know how to read it,

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:17.360 align:middle line:84%
we know how to
look at ourselves.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.333 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How far back
does astrology go?

00:10:19.333 --> 00:10:20.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: That's
a great question.

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:28.030 align:middle line:84%
So we have the first origins
of astrology at 3000 BCE.

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:29.892 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Wow.

00:10:29.892 --> 00:10:31.100 align:middle line:90%
>>ARRAUT: I know, it's crazy.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.230 align:middle line:84%
Even when I say it out
loud, I'm like, oh, wow,

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:37.900 align:middle line:84%
because that's when we have
the first written cuneiform

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:41.020 align:middle line:90%
text back in Sumeria.

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
first uses of astrology

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:47.940 align:middle line:84%
that we found where we see,
for example, that they already

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:53.640 align:middle line:84%
had super analyzed the cycles of
the planet Venus that was used

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:57.540 align:middle line:84%
to predict crops, abundance,
fertility, the birth

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:03.960 align:middle line:84%
of important kings or queens,
and also the moments of war,

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:07.710 align:middle line:90%
war was going to be coming up.

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:09.480 align:middle line:84%
They based all of
that information

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.090 align:middle line:84%
just off the cycles
of the planet Venus

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:15.390 align:middle line:84%
that they had super, super
well-noted down as well

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:17.290 align:middle line:90%
as eclipses, for example.

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:20.280 align:middle line:84%
That was also something that
they used back in the day

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:25.590 align:middle line:84%
to make important predictions,
especially of unexpected deaths

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:30.660 align:middle line:84%
of kings or when kings
were going to "fall ill."

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:34.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You mentioned Sumeria,
the late Zecharia Sitchin talked

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:38.160 align:middle line:84%
about the Anunnaki who
came from another planet

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:42.880 align:middle line:84%
and came here to search for
gold for their atmosphere.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.050 align:middle line:84%
But they talk about
all kinds of things

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:47.530 align:middle line:90%
that they did in those days.

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:51.840 align:middle line:84%
May they have been the
originators of astrology?

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: It's funny that
you mentioned this, George,

00:11:54.070 --> 00:12:04.830 align:middle line:84%
because in my academy I
actually teach how the origins

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:11.650 align:middle line:84%
of astrology scientifically
proved back to 3000 BCE--

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:17.700 align:middle line:84%
I genuinely feel that it's a
science or a study that has been

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:19.287 align:middle line:90%
brought upon us from other--

00:12:19.287 --> 00:12:20.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: And given to us.

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:25.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: --systems given to us
and taught to us by other race.

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: So he may
have been right.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.193 align:middle line:90%
>>ARRAUT: I do believe so.

00:12:28.193 --> 00:12:29.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What
about world leaders

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:32.100 align:middle line:90%
today, do they use astrology?

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:32.940 align:middle line:90%
>>ARRAUT: Yes.

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.565 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Do they
tell people about it?

00:12:34.565 --> 00:12:36.620 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: No, that's
the funny thing.

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:37.857 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: What do we know?

00:12:37.857 --> 00:12:40.850 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: So as an
astrologer and someone who's

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:45.470 align:middle line:84%
been giving consultations
probably since I was 15,

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:48.420 align:middle line:84%
we keep our clients
extremely private.

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:52.080 align:middle line:84%
We cannot say who our client
is because the client--

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.692 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Oh, come on.

00:12:53.692 --> 00:12:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: --it's something
that we keep really,

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:58.610 align:middle line:84%
really private because
it's almost like someone

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:03.170 align:middle line:84%
who comes to you and
trusts you with all

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:05.730 align:middle line:84%
of their sacred
hidden knowledge.

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:08.150 align:middle line:84%
Because when someone
shows you, especially

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:10.250 align:middle line:84%
if you know how to read
a chart, if someone

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:13.130 align:middle line:84%
comes to you with
their chart, they're

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:16.010 align:middle line:84%
like going completely
naked in front of you

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:18.090 align:middle line:84%
because we know
how to read that.

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:23.250 align:middle line:84%
So as someone who gives
also private consultations,

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:26.640 align:middle line:84%
I need to keep the information
of the client very privately.

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.910 align:middle line:84%
So with world leaders,
I know for a fact,

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:32.780 align:middle line:84%
people and people that
have come to me or people

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:35.410 align:middle line:84%
that I know that
have gone to maybe

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:38.290 align:middle line:84%
not astrologers, but
other consultations

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:44.870 align:middle line:84%
in a similar field, they
keep it extremely silent.

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:47.200 align:middle line:84%
But I feel it's
really wise to go

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:51.290 align:middle line:84%
get a consultation, especially
following or reading the stars,

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:54.040 align:middle line:84%
just because the stars
and how the stars are

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:59.680 align:middle line:84%
the planetary movements and
the stars position and even

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.780 align:middle line:84%
the fixed stars and how
everything's aligned

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:06.190 align:middle line:84%
from our perspective on Earth
is a mirror on how currently

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:09.410 align:middle line:84%
our planet is: as
above, so below.

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:15.490 align:middle line:84%
So that's why world leaders
would do so much better

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:20.450 align:middle line:84%
if they actually accepted
astrology as something to share,

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:22.025 align:middle line:84%
and not something
to keep hidden.

00:14:22.025 --> 00:14:24.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Maybe the world
would be a little more peaceful

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.210 align:middle line:90%
if they studied that.

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:27.850 align:middle line:90%
>>ARRAUT: Absolutely.

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Astrology, how
does it work in your day

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.742 align:middle line:90%
to day maneuvers?

00:14:32.742 --> 00:14:34.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: I love that question
because it's something

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:36.520 align:middle line:90%
that I get asked a lot.

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:40.570 align:middle line:84%
So when I work personally
with astrology,

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:42.600 align:middle line:90%
I follow eclipse cycles.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.470 align:middle line:84%
Eclipse cycles are also
connected to our life purpose

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:51.400 align:middle line:84%
as humans that we are working
on throughout 18.5 months.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:56.310 align:middle line:84%
So every 18.5 months, there's
a shift in the energy field,

00:14:56.310 --> 00:15:02.160 align:middle line:84%
and we can feel it shifting
especially like 2 and 1/2 months

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:05.110 align:middle line:84%
before it shifts
into the next sign.

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:09.730 align:middle line:84%
So every 18.5 months, we shift
into a new constellation.

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:14.250 align:middle line:84%
So our focus of attention, which
is said by eclipse as an eclipse

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:18.000 align:middle line:84%
cycles, go towards
a certain energy.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is because
astronomically speaking,

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:27.270 align:middle line:84%
these eclipse cycles
are found or are

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:32.420 align:middle line:84%
said by the crossing of the
orbit of the moon around Earth

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:34.710 align:middle line:84%
and the crossing of the
Earth around the sun.

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:37.880 align:middle line:84%
When these two orbits
cross, it creates an axis,

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.760 align:middle line:84%
and this axis is also
used in Vedic astrology

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.940 align:middle line:84%
and it's associated to
the head of the dragon

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:46.580 align:middle line:84%
and the tail of the dragon,
this specific axis that

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:48.150 align:middle line:90%
has a North and a South.

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:50.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You're almost
like an astronomer.

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:51.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: When you
study astrology,

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:54.840 align:middle line:90%
astronomy is like a twin sister.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:57.740 align:middle line:84%
You need to know a
lot about astronomy

00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:59.163 align:middle line:90%
when you learn astrology.

00:15:59.163 --> 00:16:00.080 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Fascinating.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: So with
the eclipse cycles,

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:06.260 align:middle line:84%
you understand where
the world is headed.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:10.290 align:middle line:84%
In this specific point, which
is this North of this axis,

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:15.600 align:middle line:84%
it tilts every 18.5 months
into a different sign.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.570 align:middle line:84%
So this is what I take
the most into account

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:19.700 align:middle line:84%
when studying astrology,
because that way I

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:24.140 align:middle line:84%
can prepare where
human's attention is

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:25.770 align:middle line:90%
going to be focused at.

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:29.580 align:middle line:84%
For example, when this
point is in Aries,

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:33.990 align:middle line:84%
we know that there's going to
be wars, so it's a time for war.

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:35.990 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You just
don't know where.

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:37.427 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: We could
predict where.

00:16:37.427 --> 00:16:38.510 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: You can, really?

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:41.100 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: We could, yes,
that's how crazy it gets.

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:42.800 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we can.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.590 align:middle line:84%
But for example,
when this point is

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:47.120 align:middle line:84%
in Taurus and all
of our focus is

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.720 align:middle line:84%
going to be in new investments
and finances and new ways

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:53.010 align:middle line:90%
of making money, new resources.

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:56.660 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I take
into account the most when

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:59.190 align:middle line:90%
I work with astrology myself.

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:02.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Mercedes, how does
astrology tie into dreams?

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:05.293 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: My favorite
topic here, George.

00:17:05.293 --> 00:17:06.210 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Love dreams.

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:07.595 align:middle line:90%
>>ARRAUT: Love, love, love.

00:17:07.595 --> 00:17:10.911 align:middle line:84%
I'm a crazy dreamer since
1992 when I was born.

00:17:10.911 --> 00:17:12.869 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And you remember
them all, don't you?

00:17:12.869 --> 00:17:14.849 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: All of them,
and it's a practice.

00:17:14.849 --> 00:17:17.119 align:middle line:84%
And this is actually
why I'm very

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:20.060 align:middle line:90%
happy you brought this topic.

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:25.220 align:middle line:84%
So astrology, we
study the most basic

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:27.800 align:middle line:84%
from our perspective
on Earth, the cycles

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.870 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth around the sun
and the moon around the Earth.

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:34.470 align:middle line:84%
Because every month we have
a new moon and a full moon,

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:37.560 align:middle line:84%
and every month we work
in a different energy,

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:42.530 align:middle line:84%
and the moon crosses for 29.5
days over all of the signs

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:44.160 align:middle line:90%
from our perspective on Earth.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.870 align:middle line:84%
So astrology is
almost like a map

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:50.720 align:middle line:84%
for you to read your
dreams because the moon

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:57.780 align:middle line:84%
rules over our sleep cycles,
our bodies, our subconscious,

00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:59.960 align:middle line:84%
our memories,
everything that has

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:03.720 align:middle line:84%
to do with how we feel
and process emotions.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And that is what
corresponds or correlates

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:12.270 align:middle line:84%
to our subconscious world or our
dream world, our oneiric world.

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:15.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What dreams are
affected by astrology?

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:19.110 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: Literally all of them
because at the end of the day--

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:21.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Clairvoyance,
all kinds.

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:22.350 align:middle line:90%
>>ARRAUT: All kinds.

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And it depends honestly on
a certain planetary transit,

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.470 align:middle line:90%
or where the moon is navigating.

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:36.390 align:middle line:84%
For example, for 2 and 1/2 days,
the moon crosses over a certain

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:41.200 align:middle line:84%
constellation, and especially
when the moon is in water signs,

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:45.270 align:middle line:84%
we tend to have those lucid
dreams or dreams that are more

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:49.600 align:middle line:84%
connected to psychic
visions or future visions,

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:54.640 align:middle line:84%
because it's when the moon
is in its water element.

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:57.160 align:middle line:84%
So that's when we
are like, oh, wow,

00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:01.900 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm going to prepare for
when the moon is in water signs

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:03.300 align:middle line:84%
and this is actually
what I guide

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:07.660 align:middle line:84%
and what I teach as well, so
that I can, when I wake up,

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:10.110 align:middle line:84%
have a planner or
like a journal for me

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:12.690 align:middle line:84%
to write down what I dreamed
because I know when the moon is

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:16.890 align:middle line:84%
in water signs, I'm going to
have more lucid or more vivid

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:17.775 align:middle line:90%
dreams.

00:19:17.775 --> 00:19:18.900 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Interesting take.

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:22.180 align:middle line:84%
Meditation, how does
that tie into astrology?

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:24.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: So this is a
little trick that I do,

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:28.810 align:middle line:84%
every night before going to
bed, I meditate because when you

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:29.610 align:middle line:90%
meditate--

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:31.780 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: How do you do that?

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:33.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: I have so
many meditations.

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:36.190 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You lie in bed
meditating like that or what?

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:39.990 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: So I guide meditations
also as a part of my living

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:42.880 align:middle line:84%
and a part of my
giving to my community.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:47.710 align:middle line:84%
So with the planetary movements
and the lunar movements,

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:50.460 align:middle line:84%
new moons, full moons, I
guide specific meditations

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:54.390 align:middle line:84%
and many of them are to prepare
to go to bed, to prepare

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:55.480 align:middle line:90%
to fall asleep.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:56.280 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Really?

00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:00.220 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: So what I do
is I prepare the body,

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:03.970 align:middle line:84%
prepare the system to go into
another plane of existence.

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I feel,
I know a lot of people

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.650 align:middle line:84%
love meditating in the
morning and that's great too,

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:11.667 align:middle line:84%
but my trick is to meditate
at night before I go to bed.

00:20:11.667 --> 00:20:13.000 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: How long does it take?

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.860 align:middle line:90%
>>ARRAUT: I do like 20 minutes.

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:16.350 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That's not bad.

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:18.010 align:middle line:90%
>>ARRAUT: 20 minutes, not more.

00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:19.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: It makes you
fall asleep easier too.

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:21.513 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: Makes you
fall asleep easier

00:20:21.513 --> 00:20:25.190 align:middle line:84%
and it makes you gain awareness
of this moment where you cross

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:32.610 align:middle line:84%
over in between, being aware
and awakened and being asleep

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:34.380 align:middle line:90%
or in this dream state.

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:39.410 align:middle line:84%
So I prepare my consciousness
to do that crossing over

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:42.693 align:middle line:84%
into the oneiric world
or fourth dimension.

00:20:42.693 --> 00:20:43.860 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: I should try that.

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:47.460 align:middle line:84%
I do a late night radio
show, and when it's over,

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:50.420 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to slow
down and shut down.

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:53.360 align:middle line:84%
Meditation probably
would help there.

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:57.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: That would be perfect
because what you want is to not

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.910 align:middle line:90%
go to bed in--

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:01.710 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Hyped up.

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:03.690 align:middle line:90%
>>ARRAUT: --hyped up system.

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:08.310 align:middle line:84%
You want to take your system
down into a very relaxed state

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:12.400 align:middle line:84%
so that you can prepare your
body to do that crossover very

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.200 align:middle line:90%
gently.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And you
definitely don't

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:16.310 align:middle line:84%
want to bring your day's
events to bed with you

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:19.220 align:middle line:84%
because your brain keeps
going, click, click, click,

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:20.380 align:middle line:90%
click, click.

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:21.080 align:middle line:90%
You'll never get to sleep.

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:22.370 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: And at the end of
the day you'll dream about it.

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:23.410 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Absolutely.

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:28.330 align:middle line:84%
You predicted the date and time
of your friend's child's birth.

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:29.800 align:middle line:90%
How did you do that?

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:34.990 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: So as I said, I've
been a crazy dreamer since 1992.

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:38.740 align:middle line:84%
And the way dreams talk to
me and it's actually also

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:43.240 align:middle line:84%
why I linked it to astrology is
dreams talk to me by bringing

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:45.920 align:middle line:90%
in images of planets.

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:48.560 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like planets
talk to me in dreams.

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And then I see the
celestial sphere

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:56.030 align:middle line:84%
and the planetary placements
and the lunar placement,

00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:58.910 align:middle line:90%
for example, in specific charts.

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:02.620 align:middle line:84%
I know it sounds a little
weird, but the way my dream

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:07.280 align:middle line:84%
shows me is as a natal chart
or as a planetary position.

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:09.620 align:middle line:84%
I work with planets
and the stars all day,

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:11.930 align:middle line:84%
so it's not weird for me
to dream about planets,

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:19.570 align:middle line:84%
but the way this experience
worked is that I saw--

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:24.270 align:middle line:84%
a friend of mine
was pregnant and she

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:27.610 align:middle line:84%
was very stressed out,
like a first mother,

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:30.720 align:middle line:84%
like one of those first
experiences for a woman.

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:34.185 align:middle line:90%
She was going nuts.

00:22:34.185 --> 00:22:39.210 align:middle line:10%
She was so desperate, I think
that my subconscious gave me

00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:41.940 align:middle line:10%
that to give to
her because she was

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:45.160 align:middle line:10%
very nervous about the birth,
about the sex of the baby,

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.570 align:middle line:10%
about everything.

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:51.480 align:middle line:84%
So in my dream, I saw
the planetary placements

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:56.560 align:middle line:84%
on how the date of the
birth was going to be.

00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:00.450 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like
I saw the screenshot

00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:03.220 align:middle line:84%
of the cosmos or
the solar system

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:06.540 align:middle line:84%
from the moment of
that child's birth.

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:09.225 align:middle line:90%
I saw it was going to be a girl.

00:23:09.225 --> 00:23:14.040 align:middle line:84%
I saw that she was going to
be born that specific date,

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.820 align:middle line:90%
it was October 17.

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:17.620 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: You were spot on.

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:19.080 align:middle line:90%
>>ARRAUT: Spot on, George.

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And I told her, I'm
going to calculate

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:25.200 align:middle line:84%
exactly when these
planetary positions

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.690 align:middle line:84%
that my dream showed
me for you and I'm

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:29.200 align:middle line:90%
going to tell you the date.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And I told her
exactly the date, I

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:33.848 align:middle line:84%
told her it was going to
be a baby girl because she

00:23:33.848 --> 00:23:34.890 align:middle line:90%
didn't know at that time.

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:37.925 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You probably
gave her the time too.

00:23:37.925 --> 00:23:42.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: I told her everything
because the dream showed me.

00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And it was also fun for
me to see if that actually

00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:48.700 align:middle line:90%
was going to be so accurate.

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:49.920 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: And you were.

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:50.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ARRAUT: And it was.

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:52.230 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Did it surprise you?

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:53.200 align:middle line:90%
>>ARRAUT: A little bit.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.350 align:middle line:84%
It always surprises
me, even though I've

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:57.700 align:middle line:84%
been doing it since I
was 15, pretty much,

00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:00.660 align:middle line:84%
and dreaming about planets
my entire life it still

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:02.490 align:middle line:90%
surprises me to the date.

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:06.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You mentioned earlier
the full moons, the new moons,

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:09.400 align:middle line:84%
how do they affect
the dreams we have?

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: Great question,
because this is a very practical

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:17.480 align:middle line:84%
technique, and I love giving
practical things for people

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.170 align:middle line:90%
to use in astrology.

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:21.260 align:middle line:84%
For example, when
we have full moons

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:24.180 align:middle line:84%
is when people have the
most trouble sleeping.

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:28.200 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to have shorter
and more intermittent dreams,

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.358 align:middle line:90%
like shorter dreams.

00:24:29.358 --> 00:24:31.400 align:middle line:84%
We're going to wake up in
the middle of the night

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.890 align:middle line:84%
throughout the night,
so we might not remember

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:35.450 align:middle line:90%
everything we've dreamed.

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:38.517 align:middle line:84%
So we got to pick up
or even if we wake up,

00:24:38.517 --> 00:24:40.100 align:middle line:84%
write it down quickly
and then go back

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:42.120 align:middle line:84%
to bed because when
we have a full moon,

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:44.120 align:middle line:84%
our bodies tend
to be more bloated

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:46.140 align:middle line:84%
and we tend to be a
little more anxious.

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:49.550 align:middle line:84%
So we wake up during the
night, however, in a new moon,

00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:52.020 align:middle line:84%
is when we start a
new sleeping cycle.

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:54.710 align:middle line:84%
So in a new moon, we
want to be more relaxed

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:57.500 align:middle line:84%
and understand that we're
starting a new subconscious

00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:00.390 align:middle line:84%
cycle to work on
something specific,

00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:03.050 align:middle line:84%
depending on where
that new moon would

00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:06.270 align:middle line:84%
fall for you and your
relationship to that new moon.

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:10.770 align:middle line:84%
But usually when we start
a new cycle, lunar cycle,

00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:14.520 align:middle line:84%
we tend to have
more smooth dreams,

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.920 align:middle line:84%
we tend to sleep
more full nights

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:20.730 align:middle line:84%
and dreams usually are
all about beginnings.

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:23.400 align:middle line:84%
For example, dreaming
of getting pregnant,

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:25.400 align:middle line:84%
dreaming of having
a new job and we get

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.480 align:middle line:90%
the excitement of the newness.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How does the
moon determine that?

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:32.610 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: Because the moon
rules over our waters,

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:36.540 align:middle line:84%
our memories, our bodies since
we are made mostly of water

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:39.290 align:middle line:84%
and it rules over our
subconscious patterns

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:41.480 align:middle line:84%
because it connects
us to memories

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:45.270 align:middle line:84%
and it connects and
rules over all emotions.

00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:48.260 align:middle line:84%
So at the end of the day,
the moon and its cycles

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:51.600 align:middle line:84%
rule over a lot
of our existence.

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.930 align:middle line:84%
And of course, because it's
the satellite closest to Earth.

00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:57.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Funny you say that I
interviewed some police officers

00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:00.620 align:middle line:84%
a long time ago
on my radio show,

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:04.860 align:middle line:84%
and they said during a
new moon and a full moon,

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:10.900 align:middle line:84%
they had more calls of crazy
things happening than ever.

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:13.630 align:middle line:84%
In between, things
were normal, but if it

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:17.685 align:middle line:84%
was a full moon or a new moon,
wackos came out of the woodwork.

00:26:17.685 --> 00:26:19.810 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: And imagine if
that new moon or full moon

00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:24.010 align:middle line:84%
is an eclipse that gets
triggered to the max.

00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:26.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What is
4D dream state?

00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:31.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: So 4D dream state,
the 4D or fourth dimension is

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:34.880 align:middle line:84%
the oneiric world, or what
we call the astral plane,

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:37.690 align:middle line:84%
where we go when we sleep
and where we go when we die.

00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:39.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And your
astral projections.

00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:41.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: And where you
are in astral projections,

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:42.740 align:middle line:90%
correct, yes.

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:46.810 align:middle line:84%
So every time we
go to bed, we enter

00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:49.600 align:middle line:90%
into this fourth dimension.

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And every time we go to bed is
a preparation for when we die.

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.690 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like a training
for death, let's say.

00:26:56.690 --> 00:27:00.610 align:middle line:84%
So that's why astrology
is also a great use for us

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:05.080 align:middle line:84%
to understand how to make the
most out of our dream practice

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:07.150 align:middle line:90%
and what to expect every night.

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:10.210 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like be
one with your dreams

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:13.410 align:middle line:84%
because mostly we dream
and most people don't even

00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:14.980 align:middle line:90%
remember their dreams.

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:17.580 align:middle line:84%
So by having this
practice of entering

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:19.590 align:middle line:84%
the fourth D, the
fourth dimension

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:22.350 align:middle line:84%
with this little
meditation every night

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:27.060 align:middle line:84%
and training to when you get out
of that dream, when you wake up

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:31.410 align:middle line:84%
of that fourth dimension, that
you remember where you were just

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:35.100 align:middle line:84%
at, that you make this little
effort just by remembering

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:36.910 align:middle line:90%
the emotion.

00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:39.255 align:middle line:90%
What was I feeling?

00:27:39.255 --> 00:27:40.870 align:middle line:90%
What did I just felt?

00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:43.840 align:middle line:84%
Because the emotion will
help you remember the dream.

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.750 align:middle line:84%
Also symbols, what
did I just see?

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:49.180 align:middle line:90%
What image did just come to me?

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:51.900 align:middle line:84%
Because it's pretty
much impossible for us

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:53.830 align:middle line:90%
to remember the entire dream.

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:58.840 align:middle line:84%
But we can remember symbols,
codes, numbers and emotions,

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:02.080 align:middle line:84%
so that will help us
remember the dreams

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:03.590 align:middle line:90%
and that's one of my techniques.

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I'm told
that if you could

00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:08.840 align:middle line:84%
take a picture of
the human body asleep

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.510 align:middle line:84%
and it would capture whatever
you take a picture of,

00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:14.450 align:middle line:84%
you would see your
astral body floating

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:18.680 align:middle line:84%
above your physical body in
the dream state connected

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:22.260 align:middle line:84%
by a cord just
hovering over you.

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:23.220 align:middle line:90%
You agree with that?

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:26.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: Yes, I've seen
that and I've actually

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:27.540 align:middle line:90%
experienced it myself.

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:31.650 align:middle line:84%
And I know you've had so many
astral experiences as well,

00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:33.780 align:middle line:84%
like astral projection
experiences.

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's something
that feels like it.

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:41.480 align:middle line:84%
I haven't seen it per se,
but it just feels like it

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:45.740 align:middle line:84%
that you get pulled back
by something into your body

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:48.770 align:middle line:84%
and wake up in it
as in something just

00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:50.940 align:middle line:84%
connect you or pulled
you back into it.

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:53.915 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You adored your
grandmother, didn't you?

00:28:53.915 --> 00:28:54.780 align:middle line:90%
>>ARRAUT: Big time.

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:57.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You helped
her in your dream state,

00:28:57.930 --> 00:29:00.050 align:middle line:90%
tell me what happened.

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:06.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: I love how we
connected this past question

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:10.160 align:middle line:84%
of the 4D and the astral
projection onto my grandmother

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:15.340 align:middle line:84%
because it's literally
the gift that she made me.

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And I want to
explain this clearly

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:21.082 align:middle line:84%
because I feel this is something
that happened to many people,

00:29:21.082 --> 00:29:22.540 align:middle line:84%
but we just don't
have the guidance

00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:24.460 align:middle line:90%
because nobody teaches us this.

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:28.660 align:middle line:84%
So when someone that we care
about or that we are connected

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:36.770 align:middle line:84%
to or that we know passes away,
when they are in the other side,

00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:38.720 align:middle line:84%
which what I call
the fourth dimension,

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:41.440 align:middle line:84%
when they are over that side
where they have no physical

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:45.230 align:middle line:84%
body, they look for a
way back onto matter,

00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:49.010 align:middle line:84%
onto connect back to the 3D,
to a three dimensional state.

00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:52.790 align:middle line:84%
So they look for energies
that they resonate to

00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:55.820 align:middle line:84%
and what chooses that
connection is emotion.

00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:57.820 align:middle line:84%
So they're going
to look for someone

00:29:57.820 --> 00:29:59.890 align:middle line:84%
that they can connect
emotionally to

00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:05.740 align:middle line:84%
or that they can
feel a light, they

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:07.600 align:middle line:84%
feel like a magnet
toward that energy

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:11.100 align:middle line:84%
because it's an open portal or
an open channel or open energy,

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:11.900 align:middle line:90%
let's say.

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:17.420 align:middle line:84%
So when my grandmother died,
immediately after her death--

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:19.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Was that
unexpected, by the way?

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:20.560 align:middle line:90%
>>ARRAUT: No, not really.

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:22.135 align:middle line:90%
She was old.

00:30:22.135 --> 00:30:26.000 align:middle line:84%
She had a great life and I
think she was ready for death.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.900 align:middle line:84%
I think it was a pretty
good death, honestly.

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:32.360 align:middle line:84%
So she had time to
prepare for her death

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:33.910 align:middle line:90%
and she was telling me.

00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:37.310 align:middle line:84%
Before she was going to die, she
was like, they're coming for me.

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And she would say this
to me, they're coming,

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:40.550 align:middle line:90%
they're very close.

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:41.425 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Who's they?

00:30:41.425 --> 00:30:43.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: That's what I
was asking her, who's they?

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:47.200 align:middle line:84%
She said a group, a group
of souls, a group of people

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.203 align:middle line:90%
that she doesn't know.

00:30:48.203 --> 00:30:49.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: She wasn't scared.

00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:51.078 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: She was not
scared, not at all.

00:30:51.078 --> 00:30:55.070 align:middle line:84%
She said that they seem nice,
but she just didn't know.

00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:58.340 align:middle line:84%
She was not very spiritual,
she was very, very Catholic,

00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:00.460 align:middle line:84%
so she just didn't
see that relationship.

00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:02.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I think our
loved ones are there too.

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:04.290 align:middle line:84%
They're probably
part of that group.

00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:06.090 align:middle line:90%
>>ARRAUT: 100%.

00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:07.620 align:middle line:84%
Because at the end
of the day, when

00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:11.110 align:middle line:84%
you are connected to the
other world, there's no time.

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:14.700 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, she could
have been connecting to me

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:19.660 align:middle line:84%
that I would guide her in
the future once she passes.

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:22.060 align:middle line:84%
Because what happened
is that once she passed,

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:25.540 align:middle line:84%
she came to see me
as I was sleeping,

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:28.650 align:middle line:84%
and she would come visit
me almost every month.

00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:29.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: And tell you what?

00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:32.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: At the beginning,
nothing, George, nothing.

00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:33.802 align:middle line:84%
At the beginning, she
would just look at me

00:31:33.802 --> 00:31:36.591 align:middle line:84%
and she was almost
like, petrified.

00:31:36.591 --> 00:31:37.530 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:38.680 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And at the beginning, there was
no talking, no communication.

00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:46.690 align:middle line:84%
I would see her, OK, and I would
always see her in her house.

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:50.220 align:middle line:84%
So I knew that she was very
connected at the beginning

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:52.750 align:middle line:84%
to her physical space
to where she lived.

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:58.080 align:middle line:84%
So after a few months,
she started talking to me,

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:02.450 align:middle line:84%
and she started seeming
almost more of a soul

00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:03.960 align:middle line:90%
and less of a body.

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.570 align:middle line:84%
So I could see
that she was going

00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:10.910 align:middle line:84%
through a process of elevation
of some sort, of enlightenment

00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:16.910 align:middle line:84%
or some process of detaching
of her physical form.

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:20.820 align:middle line:84%
So after a while, we
started having conversations

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:23.580 align:middle line:84%
and she would come see me and
she would come tell me stuff,

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:26.483 align:middle line:84%
and she would come tell
me what she's doing.

00:32:26.483 --> 00:32:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And I would see her going
through an entire process,

00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:32.910 align:middle line:84%
almost like what in Christianism
they would say like a purgatory,

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:35.180 align:middle line:84%
when they go through an
entire process of what's

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:36.125 align:middle line:90%
happened in life.

00:32:36.125 --> 00:32:37.500 align:middle line:84%
That's what she
was going through

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:39.800 align:middle line:84%
and I could see it just
from the dream world.

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:41.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Like life review?

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:42.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ARRAUT: Yes, exactly.

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:44.580 align:middle line:84%
And as I was guiding
my grandmother,

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:47.900 align:middle line:84%
I was also guiding two
of my cousins and friends

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:51.488 align:middle line:84%
of friends and people that would
just come see me in my sleep.

00:32:51.488 --> 00:32:53.280 align:middle line:84%
That's why I would wake
up and I'd be like,

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:55.720 align:middle line:84%
oh, my God, I did more
work while I was sleeping.

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:56.900 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: I'm exhausted.

00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:58.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ARRAUT: I'm exhausted.

00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:03.500 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, I know
that when I cross over,

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.300 align:middle line:90%
I'll also have a lot of help.

00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:08.780 align:middle line:84%
Because when we die, and I
saw this in my grandmother,

00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:12.580 align:middle line:84%
but in many, many other cases,
just my grandmother who's

00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:13.910 align:middle line:90%
closest to me.

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:19.880 align:middle line:84%
But I see this a lot where
people, when they cross over,

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:22.333 align:middle line:84%
they don't remember
anything that's happened.

00:33:22.333 --> 00:33:23.750 align:middle line:84%
They don't even
know who they are.

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:28.090 align:middle line:84%
They lose a complete sense of
realization of where they are

00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:30.350 align:middle line:84%
and what they're doing,
where they come from.

00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:33.940 align:middle line:84%
So that's why unconsciously,
they seek for guidance--

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:35.060 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: From us?

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:37.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: --from us because
that's where they come from.

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:38.860 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Are they lost?

00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:39.940 align:middle line:90%
>>ARRAUT: A little bit.

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:41.930 align:middle line:84%
At the beginning,
always, and it's normal.

00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:44.955 align:middle line:84%
It's like when you come to Earth
and you're a baby, you're like,

00:33:44.955 --> 00:33:45.830 align:middle line:90%
where am I?

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:47.780 align:middle line:84%
Just take me back
where I come from.

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:50.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: So your grandmother
was lost on the other side?

00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:50.960 align:middle line:90%
>>ARRAUT: A little bit, yeah.

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.168 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: And you helped her?

00:33:52.168 --> 00:33:55.340 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: So I helped
her cross over crossover.

00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:56.540 align:middle line:90%
It was a long process.

00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:58.630 align:middle line:84%
It was a very, very
long process, overall,

00:33:58.630 --> 00:34:00.230 align:middle line:90%
it took like three years.

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:01.610 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Three years.

00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:06.290 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: After three years,
I saw her in a different form,

00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:09.770 align:middle line:84%
and now I think it's
been seven years.

00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:14.449 align:middle line:84%
And recently I saw her being
ready to come back here,

00:34:14.449 --> 00:34:17.413 align:middle line:84%
and she told me, I'm
getting ready to come back.

00:34:17.413 --> 00:34:18.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: To
reincarnate you mean?

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:20.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: I'm getting
ready to reincarnate.

00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:21.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting ready to come back.

00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:22.778 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Interesting.

00:34:22.778 --> 00:34:24.320 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: I don't
know in which form,

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:25.487 align:middle line:90%
but I'm sure she'll tell me.

00:34:25.487 --> 00:34:30.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure she'll let us know
because that's what I really

00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:33.670 align:middle line:84%
like this process
that's made me learn

00:34:33.670 --> 00:34:36.489 align:middle line:84%
so much about death and about
what happens after we die

00:34:36.489 --> 00:34:39.010 align:middle line:84%
and how we can use
our dreams, which

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:44.860 align:middle line:84%
is our access to the other
world to prepare for our death.

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:46.790 align:middle line:84%
It's going to
school, every night

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:48.860 align:middle line:84%
we go to school to
prepare for death.

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:51.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How do you
practice dream recall?

00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:52.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ARRAUT: Training.

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:53.880 align:middle line:90%
I'd say training.

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:55.150 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Can you teach that?

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:56.830 align:middle line:90%
>>ARRAUT: Yes, for sure.

00:34:56.830 --> 00:34:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's something that
you have to teach yourself

00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:01.750 align:middle line:84%
because your own consciousness
is here to guide you,

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:03.070 align:middle line:90%
is your master.

00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:06.960 align:middle line:84%
So when you wake
up, your willpower

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:12.100 align:middle line:84%
has to guide you to remember
where you were just at.

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And with time and practice, you
remember everything, or almost

00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:19.360 align:middle line:84%
everything, and you
can write it down,

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:23.250 align:middle line:84%
especially important
experiences or important dreams,

00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:26.940 align:middle line:84%
or experiences that you
have in the four dimension

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:28.570 align:middle line:90%
in the oneiric world.

00:35:28.570 --> 00:35:34.350 align:middle line:84%
So mostly the dreams
are a guide for you

00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:36.400 align:middle line:90%
to navigate in this life.

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:40.470 align:middle line:84%
That's why I love syncing it
with astrology because astrology

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:42.880 align:middle line:90%
is a map to navigate this life.

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:46.420 align:middle line:84%
But as we sleep, we're also
connected to this life.

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:48.810 align:middle line:84%
So we have influences
of our emotions

00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:53.280 align:middle line:84%
and our programs, our daily
lives into our subconscious.

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:56.570 align:middle line:84%
So by understanding our dreams
and understanding the lunar

00:35:56.570 --> 00:35:59.150 align:middle line:84%
cycles or planetary
cycles, we understand

00:35:59.150 --> 00:36:01.020 align:middle line:90%
what our dreams are telling us.

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:03.780 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like they're
preparing us for our future.

00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:09.750 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I love preparing
for predictive dreams,

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:12.390 align:middle line:84%
for example, or dreams that
tell me about the future.

00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:14.280 align:middle line:84%
Like the case of
my friend's baby

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:17.210 align:middle line:84%
because once I told her the date
and I told her everything was

00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:19.220 align:middle line:84%
going to be fine
and everything was

00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:21.780 align:middle line:84%
going to be great in
this specific date,

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:24.360 align:middle line:90%
she was so at peace, George.

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:28.080 align:middle line:84%
She was like, so
calm, so grateful.

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:29.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Reincarnation,
you just mentioned

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:31.400 align:middle line:90%
that with your grandmother.

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:34.280 align:middle line:84%
What does life's purpose
show us about astrology

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:36.575 align:middle line:90%
and reincarnation?

00:36:36.575 --> 00:36:39.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: This is
such a good question.

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:43.040 align:middle line:84%
So remember I was talking
about that axis that

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:46.460 align:middle line:84%
is found with a North and a
South and in Vedic astrology

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:49.920 align:middle line:84%
they corresponded to head of the
dragon and tail of the dragon.

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:53.520 align:middle line:84%
This is something that we
all have in our natal charts,

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:58.280 align:middle line:84%
in our astral charts, which
corresponds to the eclipse

00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:00.600 align:middle line:90%
cycle in which we are born.

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And that eclipse cycle
in which we are born

00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:08.940 align:middle line:84%
is almost what we call our
life purpose or our future

00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:10.560 align:middle line:90%
or our soul's calling.

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And that point of the
South, or tail of the dragon

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:16.100 align:middle line:84%
is what in astrology
we interpret

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:18.210 align:middle line:90%
as our point of past lives.

00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:21.530 align:middle line:84%
So we could say that,
that is what pushed us

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:27.400 align:middle line:84%
into incarnating again, so our
soul's calling can be fulfilled.

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:30.150 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Are they like
timelines in your career?

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:32.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: We can see
timelines, correct, yes.

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And in some cases
more than others,

00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:37.280 align:middle line:84%
there are some people
that come so connected

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:41.720 align:middle line:84%
and so grounded to
this lifetime or when

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:43.740 align:middle line:84%
we work with this
specific people,

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:46.820 align:middle line:84%
we have a lot more difficulty
accessing other timelines

00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:48.770 align:middle line:84%
or other planes
of their existence

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:52.310 align:middle line:84%
because they're so glued
and anchored to this one

00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:54.020 align:middle line:84%
that it makes it
more difficult for us

00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:56.000 align:middle line:84%
to access other planes
because they're also

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.810 align:middle line:90%
very close to that idea.

00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:02.480 align:middle line:84%
But usually, we can
connect to other timelines

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.130 align:middle line:84%
and understand
what the person is

00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:06.470 align:middle line:84%
doing in other
realms of existence

00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:09.360 align:middle line:84%
and what they come
to do in this one,

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:12.840 align:middle line:84%
in this present life
that we're working on.

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:16.316 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Can people
develop their own intuition?

00:38:16.316 --> 00:38:17.116 align:middle line:90%
>>ARRAUT: 100%.

00:38:17.116 --> 00:38:17.510 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted--

00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:20.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And gets better and
better and better, doesn't it?

00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:21.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ARRAUT: That's what I do.

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:25.730 align:middle line:84%
I invite people to
develop their intuition

00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:28.370 align:middle line:84%
or their psychic abilities,
and that's actually something

00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:30.475 align:middle line:90%
I teach in my academy as well.

00:38:30.475 --> 00:38:33.660 align:middle line:84%
I guide them into them
being their own guru,

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:36.120 align:middle line:84%
their own psychic, their
own medium, their own guide,

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:38.100 align:middle line:84%
their own astrologer,
their own everything

00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:40.050 align:middle line:90%
because they are everything.

00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:43.080 align:middle line:84%
And we can all
master our abilities.

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:44.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What is
it about intuition

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:50.370 align:middle line:84%
that allows us to really
have that gut instinct?

00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:52.930 align:middle line:90%
>>ARRAUT: I'd say consciousness.

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:56.830 align:middle line:84%
When you tap into your own
source, source is everything.

00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:59.280 align:middle line:84%
Source is everything
we see, everything we

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:00.940 align:middle line:90%
touch, everything we feel.

00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:02.500 align:middle line:90%
You are source.

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:03.607 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Is source God?

00:39:03.607 --> 00:39:04.690 align:middle line:90%
>>ARRAUT: We could say it.

00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:07.510 align:middle line:84%
We could call it
God, absolutely.

00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:13.600 align:middle line:84%
So when we connect to God, God
is everywhere and everything.

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:17.670 align:middle line:84%
Even you right now, you're
a projection of that God

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:19.480 align:middle line:90%
that's inside me and vice versa.

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:22.170 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: I'm far from godly.

00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:27.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: So I'd say
that intuition is just

00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:32.550 align:middle line:84%
consciousness acting
through your human voice

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:34.500 align:middle line:90%
and your human form.

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:38.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Since you've been
doing this all these years, what

00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:42.560 align:middle line:84%
has been the most startling
thing you've done and shocked

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:44.340 align:middle line:90%
even you?

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:46.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: I love when
people ask me this question.

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:50.630 align:middle line:84%
But it depends on the
time, because sometimes I

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:57.800 align:middle line:84%
love, for example, just
feeling the power a hug has

00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:00.980 align:middle line:90%
to change your entire body.

00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:04.050 align:middle line:84%
But something else that
I do love, of course,

00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:05.610 align:middle line:90%
is working with the other side.

00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:09.530 align:middle line:84%
I love working with people
that have crossed over

00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:15.750 align:middle line:84%
and understanding their natal
charts and what made them die,

00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:19.970 align:middle line:84%
what pushed them or
energetically opened the door

00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:22.220 align:middle line:90%
for them to cross over.

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:25.200 align:middle line:84%
This is, I think, to the date,
what fascinates me the most,

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:28.890 align:middle line:84%
or what has astonished
me the most in my career,

00:40:28.890 --> 00:40:32.820 align:middle line:84%
working with the fourth
dimension and other dimensions.

00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:36.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: In astrology, what
does it mean the elements?

00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:40.190 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: So
something also that I

00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:43.430 align:middle line:84%
teach is for people to
use this tool that I'm

00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:46.340 align:middle line:84%
going to share with you, George,
because I'm sure you'll find it

00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:48.090 align:middle line:90%
very, very useful as well.

00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:50.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I'll run out
and use it immediately.

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:52.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: Immediately,
even right now.

00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:55.700 align:middle line:84%
But I think you and I are the
same element, so it's good.

00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:59.480 align:middle line:84%
So when we navigate
our life, we need

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:03.380 align:middle line:84%
to also know that we
have our own relationship

00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:07.860 align:middle line:84%
to the elements, elements
meaning air, water, fire,

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:11.220 align:middle line:84%
and earth and ether, ether
is our consciousness.

00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:15.200 align:middle line:84%
So we come to understand how
to navigate and play around

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:18.000 align:middle line:84%
with the elements that
we're given here on earth.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.320 align:middle line:84%
So each one, when
we're born, we're

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:23.940 align:middle line:84%
given this map which is
called the natal chart,

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:25.140 align:middle line:90%
the astral chart.

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And in this chart, we can read
the percentage of each energy

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:33.650 align:middle line:90%
that you come to embody.

00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:38.240 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people come
more connected to earth,

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:42.020 align:middle line:84%
some other people come connected
to fire, water, or air.

00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
embody most of the energy

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:48.340 align:middle line:90%
that your sun sign is.

00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:53.440 align:middle line:84%
So let's say, for example, that
you're feeling a little bit more

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:56.810 align:middle line:84%
like ungrounded,
uncertain, unsettled.

00:41:56.810 --> 00:41:58.670 align:middle line:84%
You're needing to
manifest something,

00:41:58.670 --> 00:42:01.310 align:middle line:84%
but you're feeling like a little
bit loopy or up in the air.

00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:02.222 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Not me.

00:42:02.222 --> 00:42:04.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: Not you, I'm
just saying, in general.

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:06.550 align:middle line:84%
If people feel that way,
it happens to me a lot

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:10.000 align:middle line:84%
that I feel like too
much up in a channel.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I like
that word loopy.

00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:12.830 align:middle line:90%
>>ARRAUT: Loopy.

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:18.850 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd say is
go connect to people

00:42:18.850 --> 00:42:23.090 align:middle line:84%
that have a lot of Earth energy,
like Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn,

00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:25.880 align:middle line:84%
because that earth
energy grounds you.

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And if you're feeling
ungrounded, connecting

00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:31.450 align:middle line:84%
to people that are
born on those sun

00:42:31.450 --> 00:42:35.530 align:middle line:84%
signs will just help
you ground and manifest

00:42:35.530 --> 00:42:38.320 align:middle line:84%
and be more connected
to matter and to earth.

00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:40.890 align:middle line:84%
But for example,
let's say that you

00:42:40.890 --> 00:42:43.450 align:middle line:84%
feel that you have an
emotional blockage, like, oh, I

00:42:43.450 --> 00:42:46.270 align:middle line:84%
haven't cried in a long time
and there's something weird.

00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:49.500 align:middle line:84%
I just feel like I need to
feel or there's something

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:50.720 align:middle line:90%
that I'm not feeling correct.

00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:51.970 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: I need to let loose.

00:42:51.970 --> 00:42:53.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ARRAUT: I need to let loose.

00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:55.080 align:middle line:84%
So then you're going
to want to connect

00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:58.860 align:middle line:84%
to people born in Scorpio,
Pisces, or Cancer seasons

00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:00.690 align:middle line:84%
because they're water
energy, and they

00:43:00.690 --> 00:43:04.890 align:middle line:84%
will make you flow
into something else

00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:08.460 align:middle line:84%
or allow you to flow
into your own emotions.

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:11.970 align:middle line:84%
But for example, let's say that
you want to prepare for a speech

00:43:11.970 --> 00:43:14.460 align:middle line:84%
or you need mental
clarity for something

00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:17.952 align:middle line:84%
or you just need to have
a good conversation,

00:43:17.952 --> 00:43:20.160 align:middle line:84%
then you're going to want
to connect with people that

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:24.630 align:middle line:84%
are born in air sign seasons
Aquarius, Libra, and Gemini

00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:29.710 align:middle line:84%
because they will help you
gain much more a clearer mind

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:32.990 align:middle line:84%
or have a mind that's a lot
more organized, let's say.

00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Do they know
what they're doing,

00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:36.290 align:middle line:90%
the Geminis, for example?

00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:38.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: And they
don't even have to know.

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:39.780 align:middle line:90%
I know you're a Gemini.

00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:41.030 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: I'm a Gemini.

00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:43.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: I know and
I'm an air sign too,

00:43:43.770 --> 00:43:46.750 align:middle line:84%
so that's why we're
in this together.

00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:48.000 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Clicking along here.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.850 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: Yes, of course, of
course we're the same element.

00:43:50.850 --> 00:43:55.860 align:middle line:84%
So let's say the one that I
was missing is the fire energy,

00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:58.440 align:middle line:84%
what would you go
to fire signs for?

00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:01.170 align:middle line:90%
Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius.

00:44:01.170 --> 00:44:04.050 align:middle line:84%
You would go for
them for energy.

00:44:04.050 --> 00:44:07.710 align:middle line:10%
When you're low,
you're like low energy,

00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:09.620 align:middle line:10%
even those moments
in time when you're

00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:12.540 align:middle line:10%
a little depressed or a
little tired or you're just

00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:14.480 align:middle line:10%
need an energy
boost, you're going

00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:16.400 align:middle line:10%
to go contact those fire signs.

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:20.250 align:middle line:84%
For example, my sister has
everything fire in her chart.

00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And I have a lot of water,
so I flow very well,

00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:26.430 align:middle line:90%
but I tend to be very sensitive.

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:29.210 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm feeling a little
low, I give her a call

00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:32.730 align:middle line:84%
and then within seconds, I
give her a call on purpose,

00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:34.650 align:middle line:84%
of course, because I'm
like, I need your fire,

00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:35.820 align:middle line:90%
give me some fire.

00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And within seconds she puts
me in such a good mood,

00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:41.750 align:middle line:84%
gives me such a
boost, and that's

00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:43.350 align:middle line:90%
what fire energy does to you.

00:44:43.350 --> 00:44:44.150 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Magical.

00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>>ARRAUT: Magical.

00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:47.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How do people
get a hold of you Mercedes?

00:44:47.450 --> 00:44:50.960 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: So they can literally
Google me, Mercedes Arnús.

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:56.100 align:middle line:10%
And you can find me on
academy.theastralmethod.com

00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:59.937 align:middle line:10%
or you can reach me at

>>GEORGE: Thanks for
being on Beyond Belief.

00:45:01.770 --> 00:45:03.228 align:middle line:84%
>>ARRAUT: Thank
you so much George.

00:45:03.228 --> 00:45:04.110 align:middle line:90%
It's been an honor.

00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:05.580 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:07.163 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I got to
tell you, years ago

00:45:07.163 --> 00:45:09.420 align:middle line:84%
when I first started
hearing about astrology,

00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:12.870 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was
wacky, different.

00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:15.680 align:middle line:84%
But the more I got into it,
the more I interviewed people

00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:19.220 align:middle line:84%
like Mercedes Arnús,
the more I realized

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:21.650 align:middle line:84%
there's something
to this and it's

00:45:21.650 --> 00:45:24.090 align:middle line:90%
very important to our future.

00:45:24.090 --> 00:45:26.270 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
Beyond Belief.
