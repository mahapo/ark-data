[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.690 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: In 2013,
an incredible event

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.820 align:middle line:10%
occurred over northern Russia.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.430 align:middle line:10%
A meteor exploded, taking
everybody by surprise.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.450 align:middle line:10%
1,400 people were injured
just by the concussion

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.940 align:middle line:10%
of that meteor.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.990 align:middle line:10%
It could have been worse.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.300 align:middle line:10%
But how often does this happen?

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.040 align:middle line:10%
In a moment on
"Beyond Belief," you

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.670 align:middle line:10%
will hear from an individual
who will tell us what

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.384 align:middle line:10%
we can expect in the future.

00:00:47.384 --> 00:00:49.300 align:middle line:10%
>>ANNOUNCER: Millions
of people eventually saw

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.840 align:middle line:10%
the 2013 Chelyabinsk
meteor explosion

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.790 align:middle line:10%
that Russian citizens
caught on film.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.770 align:middle line:84%
Author and commentator
Marshall Masters

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.840 align:middle line:84%
believes we should expect
much more fire in the sky

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.410 align:middle line:84%
and we should prepare
for life afterward.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.940 align:middle line:10%
In his new book, "Surviving
the Planet X Tribulation,"

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.100 align:middle line:10%
Marshall finds the silver lining
in the dark cloud of the coming

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.910 align:middle line:10%
destruction.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.700 align:middle line:10%
He says it's an
opportunity for the freedom

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.970 align:middle line:10%
and spiritual
evolution of mankind.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.830 align:middle line:10%
Marshall explains
why this will require

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.270 align:middle line:10%
letting go of our things and
holding onto each other today

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.836 align:middle line:10%
on "Beyond Belief."

00:01:21.836 --> 00:01:23.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And welcome
back to "Beyond Belief."

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.710 align:middle line:10%
We've got Marshall
Masters with us,

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.000 align:middle line:10%
who is our expert on a
harbinger of things to come.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.030 align:middle line:10%
Marshall, welcome back.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.230 align:middle line:10%
Always good to see you.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL MASTERS:
Good to see you, George.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.010 align:middle line:90%
Glad to be back.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we're still
here from the last time

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.780 align:middle line:90%
you were with me.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Yes, thankfully.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy about that too.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had mentioned,
back around early part of 2015,

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.830 align:middle line:84%
that things were happening,
that Planet X was rolling around

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.770 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of us kind of
got a little concerned

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.030 align:middle line:90%
that, oh, my god, is this it?

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.900 align:middle line:90%
Is it time?

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.766 align:middle line:84%
Where do we stand
right now on that?

00:01:57.766 --> 00:01:59.140 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: Well,
right now, we're

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.840 align:middle line:10%
seeing a lot more observation
reports on YouTube.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.570 align:middle line:10%
I've never seen-- the trickle
has turned into a flood.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.070 align:middle line:10%
There's a consistent
pattern of seeing an object

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.870 align:middle line:10%
to the right of the sun
at the three o'clock

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.550 align:middle line:10%
relative to the horizon.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.210 align:middle line:84%
In space, it would be more
around the sun's 1:30 to two

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:20.090 align:middle line:90%
o'clock position.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Naked eye or telescope?

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:22.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Naked eye.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.510 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
I have one that

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.830 align:middle line:84%
just came in from a farmer in
Spain and he and his farmhand

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.430 align:middle line:84%
were returning home
and it was at sunset.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.090 align:middle line:84%
That's when you're going to see
this is at sunrise or sunset

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.640 align:middle line:84%
because it's an object
close to the sun.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.520 align:middle line:84%
And it was a sequence
of 10 iPhone pics.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.530 align:middle line:10%
But it was the 10th one
that really grabbed me

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.320 align:middle line:10%
because he had his
farmhand in the picture.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.110 align:middle line:10%
And the farmhand was holding
up his hand like this

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.220 align:middle line:10%
to shield his eyes
from the sun but he was

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.260 align:middle line:10%
looking at the second object.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And that was the first time
I've gotten an eyewitness report

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.070 align:middle line:84%
where I actually have an
image of the eyewitness

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.137 align:middle line:90%
as it's happening.

00:03:05.137 --> 00:03:06.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are we looking at?

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:07.907 align:middle line:90%
What's up there?

00:03:07.907 --> 00:03:09.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: What we're
seeing right now

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.870 align:middle line:84%
is one of the planets
that's in this system,

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.170 align:middle line:90%
we call Planet X system.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.950 align:middle line:10%
At the core is a brown
dwarf called Nemesis.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.840 align:middle line:10%
Brown dwarfs are small suns.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.750 align:middle line:10%
They're small, dirty,
difficult to see.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:24.777 align:middle line:10%
Matter of fact--

00:03:24.777 --> 00:03:26.610 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Is it a binary
star system with us.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.130 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: We're in
a binary star system.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly enough,
some of the astronomers

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.200 align:middle line:84%
that are coming out
with their findings

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.200 align:middle line:84%
suggest we could be in a
trinary system, for that matter.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's almost
unheard of for us.

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: For us, yes.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.110 align:middle line:84%
For the rest of-- 90% of the
solar systems in our galaxy

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.860 align:middle line:90%
have multiple suns.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.010 align:middle line:84%
So if we're one sun, we're
the oddball but we're not.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And so there were Chilean
astronomers who came out

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.870 align:middle line:84%
and they had found
that they believed

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.540 align:middle line:84%
that they had discovered a
dead or dying brown dwarf

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.590 align:middle line:84%
at the edge of our solar
system out by the Kuiper

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.320 align:middle line:84%
Belt, along with a super
planet, several times

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.850 align:middle line:90%
the size of Earth.

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And they were attacked very
viciously by the "Washington

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:26.420 align:middle line:84%
Post" and so they had to
backtrack and pull back

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.680 align:middle line:84%
their papers because of
the political suppression.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:30.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Yeah.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why is it that way?

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Well,
because they really

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.130 align:middle line:84%
hit the third rail by suggesting
that were in a binary star

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.880 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.450 align:middle line:84%
Literally, think about
it, going back to the days

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.480 align:middle line:84%
when we're not-- what
do you mean we're not

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.430 align:middle line:90%
the center of the universe?

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.180 align:middle line:90%
That we're orbiting a sun.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.010 align:middle line:10%
And look how that played out.

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.250 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, that's true.

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, in this particular
case, Marshall,

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.200 align:middle line:84%
why is there suppression
over the possibility

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.500 align:middle line:84%
that there could be
another planet out there,

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.060 align:middle line:84%
that things happen,
and we'll get

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.130 align:middle line:84%
into some of the
possibilities of what

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.210 align:middle line:84%
could happen when this planet
comes around, which is,

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.040 align:middle line:84%
according to the late Zecharia
Sitchin, every 3,600 years.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.570 align:middle line:90%
But why the suppression?

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.450 align:middle line:84%
Why not come out
and just tell us,

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.020 align:middle line:84%
hey folks we're
in another system?

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.880 align:middle line:84%
There's another
planet or a series

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.170 align:middle line:84%
of planets that come
around and be ready for it.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: That would be the
humane thing but that's really

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.890 align:middle line:90%
not the agenda.

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.610 align:middle line:10%
And I really have started
calling it the Luciferian

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.670 align:middle line:10%
agenda, not for religious
reasons but because--

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:38.940 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's scary.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.430 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: But it is.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.770 align:middle line:10%
The people that are
pulling the strings

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:49.200 align:middle line:10%
on this, the global elites,
tend to go in that manner.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.900 align:middle line:84%
And their goal is quite
simple, keep us in the dark.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.180 align:middle line:84%
If people do not
believe what they

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.520 align:middle line:84%
are seeing with their own eyes
is a clear and present danger,

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.350 align:middle line:84%
they're not going
to take action.

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:07.080 align:middle line:84%
The vast majority of Americans
live along a coastline.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.500 align:middle line:84%
The coastlines are going
to be a bone that's chewed.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And so what will happen is that
there's a massive death toll.

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:17.910 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
Georgia Guidestones,

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.070 align:middle line:84%
the first one of
the 10 commandments

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.540 align:middle line:84%
for the 21st century,
as some call it,

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.306 align:middle line:84%
is to keep the population of
Earth under half a billion.

00:06:27.306 --> 00:06:31.290 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't say how we get
there but that is the goal.

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:33.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's from
our seven billion now,

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.556 align:middle line:90%
down to 500 million.

00:06:35.556 --> 00:06:37.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: That's right,
so we're talking about one

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.400 align:middle line:90%
in 10 surviving.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
thin out the herd,

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.780 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, by keeping
them in the dark

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.100 align:middle line:84%
so they're not going
to be able to relocate,

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:52.600 align:middle line:84%
to prepare, to organize,
and to deal with things.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, in other countries, I
find that there is a much more

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:58.890 align:middle line:90%
proactive and humane program.

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:02.180 align:middle line:10%
The Russians are
doing a brilliant job

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.052 align:middle line:10%
of building shelters,
the Swedes the Israelis.

00:07:05.052 --> 00:07:06.260 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The Chinese are too.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.060 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: Yes, the Chinese are.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:09.910 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: We aren't

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:10.720 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: We're not, no.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.860 align:middle line:10%
We're buying bullets and--

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:13.290 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: We're not for us.

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:15.100 align:middle line:90%
We might be for the elitists.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:16.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: That's right.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:21.130 align:middle line:84%
So coming here to the
interview, you fly into Denver.

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
know dying time is near

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:29.040 align:middle line:84%
when we see the tarmac at
Denver International littered

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.700 align:middle line:84%
with corporate jets
and private jets,

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.300 align:middle line:90%
like a bad case of the measles.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:34.530 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: This is the
hub for all that.

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:35.446 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: This is it.

00:07:35.446 --> 00:07:36.690 align:middle line:10%
This is where they board.

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:39.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want folks to get a
better perspective, Marshall,

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:43.468 align:middle line:84%
on Planet X. Take
a look at this.

00:07:43.468 --> 00:07:46.160 align:middle line:10%
>>ALI VELSHI: There's a
huge, hidden heavenly body

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.080 align:middle line:10%
right here in our solar system.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.500 align:middle line:84%
Evidence is mounting that either
a brown dwarf star or a gas

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.210 align:middle line:84%
giant planet is lurking
at the outermost reaches

00:07:56.210 --> 00:08:00.070 align:middle line:84%
of our solar system, far
beyond the planet Pluto.

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:01.610 align:middle line:84%
According to the
British newspaper,

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:05.320 align:middle line:84%
"The Independent," the object is
four times the size of Jupiter.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.870 align:middle line:10%
Experts say the presence
of such a massive object

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.990 align:middle line:10%
could explain why
a barrage of comets

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:14.390 align:middle line:10%
has been coming
from that direction.

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:17.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, that commentator
might be spot on, Marshall.

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:18.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: I think he was.

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.010 align:middle line:84%
I think it was a
slip up, something

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:27.050 align:middle line:84%
that got through because he
did that and it was too late.

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:28.800 align:middle line:84%
There's no point--
once the horse is free,

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.860 align:middle line:84%
there's no point in
closing the barn.

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:35.610 align:middle line:84%
But Ali Velshi really
did drop the dime,

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:39.280 align:middle line:84%
and there was a huge cover-up
immediately after that

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.030 align:middle line:90%
and the topic was kiboshed.

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:43.630 align:middle line:84%
But we see this time and
time again in the work

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:44.560 align:middle line:90%
that we're doing.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:49.470 align:middle line:84%
For example, there
was a meteor impact

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:52.220 align:middle line:90%
just off the coast of Australia.

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:57.020 align:middle line:84%
People heard the explosion and
it shook the ground violently.

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:58.450 align:middle line:90%
They felt it.

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:01.500 align:middle line:84%
You know, it was on Drudge
for about 23 seconds,

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.390 align:middle line:90%
then it got sponged.

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And so we found absolutely
no mention of it anywhere.

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:10.510 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing
that we're finding,

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:14.680 align:middle line:84%
George, is that there
are houses that are

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.810 align:middle line:90%
blowing up all over the world.

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:18.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now what do you mean
blowing up all over the world?

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: They're blowing up.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:19.800 align:middle line:90%
They're exploding.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, they're saying
it's meth labs.

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:25.250 align:middle line:90%
They're saying it's gas mains.

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:28.310 align:middle line:84%
But this is at a very,
very high number.

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:29.550 align:middle line:90%
People are dying.

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And people who are there--
when you go to the local news

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.890 align:middle line:84%
accounts, you get a
lot more information.

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:37.550 align:middle line:84%
The mainstream media
here in the United States

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:42.070 align:middle line:84%
is really more Pravda
style, you know, propaganda.

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:44.940 align:middle line:10%
So they trivialize,
localize, and dismiss.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.500 align:middle line:10%
That's their tactic.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.630 align:middle line:10%
But if you go to
local media, you're

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.160 align:middle line:10%
going to get good reporting.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:54.580 align:middle line:10%
And people are saying, look
we heard something hit.

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden, this
home or this building blew up

00:09:57.610 --> 00:09:59.190 align:middle line:90%
and people died.

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:02.040 align:middle line:84%
So what we're having
right now, we're

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:06.910 align:middle line:84%
seeing this steady acceleration
in the number of meteor

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:08.740 align:middle line:90%
and fireball sightings.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:13.204 align:middle line:84%
Now, this really started
after December 21, 2012.

00:10:13.204 --> 00:10:15.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, the Mayans might
have been on to something.

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: They
were spot on George.

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:20.390 align:middle line:84%
What they were looking for
was not the end of life

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:21.190 align:middle line:90%
as we know it.

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:23.600 align:middle line:84%
They were looking
for a harbinger sign,

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.320 align:middle line:84%
a specific celestial
alignment that

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:31.250 align:middle line:84%
told them that difficult times,
a tribulation, would be coming.

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:38.040 align:middle line:84%
And so when you look at it
as a tribulation harbinger,

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.020 align:middle line:84%
the Mayans were
absolutely correct.

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:44.330 align:middle line:84%
People have been
misled into believing

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.810 align:middle line:90%
that it was a nonevent.

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:47.720 align:middle line:90%
It was foolish.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.320 align:middle line:90%
It was stupid.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, they were sold an
event, not a harbinger.

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:55.760 align:middle line:84%
They should have been--
if it had been correct,

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.340 align:middle line:84%
it would have been December
21, 2012 as a harbinger.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And we know because
we have gone back

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:05.640 align:middle line:84%
and we have looked at the
empirical data, all right?

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:10.710 align:middle line:84%
Before December 21, 2012,
nothing was really happening.

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:14.820 align:middle line:84%
But after that, we looked at
two data sets specifically.

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.965 align:middle line:84%
We were looking at
meteors and earthquakes.

00:11:17.965 --> 00:11:22.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, with earthquakes, we have
to be careful because USGS

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.380 align:middle line:90%
is lying to the public.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:27.570 align:middle line:84%
You know time and time
again-- you very seldom

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:31.650 align:middle line:84%
have an earthquake happens
and they do not downgrade it.

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:36.670 align:middle line:90%
So a 5.1 becomes a 4.8.

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:40.910 align:middle line:90%
A 6.2 becomes a 5.9.

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:42.491 align:middle line:10%
And they're cooking the books.

00:11:42.491 --> 00:11:44.490 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It should be
going up sometimes, right?

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:46.550 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: It
should be going up.

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:49.220 align:middle line:84%
Once in a blue moon-- I
think in the last two years

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.210 align:middle line:90%
I've seen it go up once.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And so they're
cooking the books.

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:56.920 align:middle line:84%
So what we did
was we said, fine.

00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:01.630 align:middle line:84%
Let's just take all forms of
earthquakes, all magnitudes,

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:03.080 align:middle line:90%
lump them together.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:06.370 align:middle line:84%
Let's take all forms of
meteorite and fireball

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:09.370 align:middle line:90%
sightings, lump them together.

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:13.170 align:middle line:10%
After December 21,
2012, it reminds me

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:17.010 align:middle line:10%
of the old cartoons I liked
as a kid, coyote, road runner.

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:21.270 align:middle line:10%
Coyote would get the
Acme rocket, like that.

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:24.770 align:middle line:10%
Well, right after
December 21, 2012,

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:28.580 align:middle line:10%
meteors and earthquakes,
the coyote's

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:32.410 align:middle line:10%
riding the rocket straight
up and it hasn't come down.

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:36.720 align:middle line:84%
The trend keeps continuing,
continuing, and continuing

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And so for us, it's
only a matter of time

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.880 align:middle line:84%
before there's an
impact event that's

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:47.292 align:middle line:84%
going to be large enough that
the media can't wash it away.

00:12:47.292 --> 00:12:49.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to look
at a series of graphics

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:51.280 align:middle line:84%
and have you explain to
us some of the things that

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.080 align:middle line:90%
are happening.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.790 align:middle line:84%
Some time ago, I had a chance
to talk to physicist Michio

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:58.250 align:middle line:84%
Kaku about the Mayan calendar
and about what you just

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:01.710 align:middle line:84%
said are the harbingers
of things to come.

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:06.520 align:middle line:84%
Zecharia Sitchin, of course,
with his 12th planet theory.

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.350 align:middle line:84%
Most of these
people are spot on,

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:11.440 align:middle line:84%
aren't they, about
what's going to happen?

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:14.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Yes, and I
remember your interview

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:19.090 align:middle line:90%
with the physicist.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:20.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Michio Kaku.

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:23.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Michio Kaku,
I like him very much

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:26.420 align:middle line:84%
and he does a wonderful
job of public education.

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:29.220 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't really certain
about the Mayan calendar.

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:30.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was on the fence.

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:31.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Yeah,
he was on the fence

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:35.700 align:middle line:84%
and I think might have been
playing it safe a little bit.

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:39.910 align:middle line:84%
But we went back and
we looked at the data.

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And so there's no question
about it, the meteor sightings

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:50.690 align:middle line:84%
and particularly with the
large ones, the fireballs,

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:56.800 align:middle line:84%
the bolides, these
things are-- we're

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.010 align:middle line:84%
seeing more of the
big ones and more

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:01.780 align:middle line:84%
of them that are
multistate or they'll

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:04.710 align:middle line:90%
cross a national boundary.

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:07.170 align:middle line:84%
They'll start seeing
it the United States

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:09.160 align:middle line:84%
and then they start
seeing it in Canada.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.060 align:middle line:90%
Same object, that large.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:15.396 align:middle line:10%
And we're seeing more and
more of these, George.

00:14:15.396 --> 00:14:16.770 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What does
that tell you?

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:20.870 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: It tells me
that the Planet X system

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:23.340 align:middle line:10%
is pushing stuff ahead of it.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:25.200 align:middle line:90%
That there is going to be--

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That it's
trailing along with it.

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:28.446 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Trailing
along with it.

00:14:28.446 --> 00:14:33.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's-- coming and going,
it's going to be painful.

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.810 align:middle line:84%
But I think what it's
doing is that there's

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:40.430 align:middle line:84%
a lot of asteroids out there
that are in benign orbits.

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:42.280 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't
bother us normally.

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.040 align:middle line:84%
But this thing is coming
through our solar system,

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:48.500 align:middle line:84%
the core of our solar
system, like a cue ball.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:51.706 align:middle line:84%
And stuff is getting
dislodged and put

00:14:51.706 --> 00:14:52.830 align:middle line:90%
into Earth-crossing orbits.

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:54.740 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: We've been
lucky so far, haven't we?

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:55.370 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: Yeah.

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:56.370 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: We really have.

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:59.040 align:middle line:84%
So even someone like Ed Dames
is beginning to come around,

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.150 align:middle line:90%
isn't he.

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:04.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Well, in August
of 2016, in Las Vegas,

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.890 align:middle line:90%
he flat out said, it's real.

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:08.530 align:middle line:90%
Planet X is real.

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And he said we would
see it about the size

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:16.970 align:middle line:90%
of the moon in December 2017.

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:19.210 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't there
personally but folks

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:22.210 align:middle line:84%
that work with me were
there and I was debriefed

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:27.800 align:middle line:84%
by several attendees and
interestingly enough, Ed

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.040 align:middle line:84%
corroborated about
80% of my work.

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
December of 2017 really

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:34.190 align:middle line:90%
isn't that far off anymore.

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:35.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: No, it's
not that far off,

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:40.780 align:middle line:84%
and what Ed is talking
about with his killshot

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:45.520 align:middle line:84%
is a solar sprite
or what you might

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.140 align:middle line:90%
think of as cosmic lightning.

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And the thing about
a solar sprite

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:55.630 align:middle line:84%
is that this can
reach out from the sun

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:58.170 align:middle line:90%
and connect and hit a planet.

00:15:58.170 --> 00:15:59.262 align:middle line:90%
That's what he is seeing.

00:15:59.262 --> 00:16:00.470 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's his killshot.

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:01.761 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: That's his killshot.

00:16:01.761 --> 00:16:04.700 align:middle line:10%
Now, we look at the
Grand Canyon and we're

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:09.096 align:middle line:10%
told that it was water erosion
created it, which to me--

00:16:09.096 --> 00:16:11.220 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You think it was
a thunderbolt, don't you?

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:13.136 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Yeah, I think
it was a thunder bolt

00:16:13.136 --> 00:16:16.260 align:middle line:84%
but rather than debate
that, let's talk

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.770 align:middle line:90%
about Valles Marineris on Mars.

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:21.920 align:middle line:10%
That's the largest canyon
in our solar system

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:25.550 align:middle line:10%
and that thing was gouged
out, clearly, by a sprite.

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:27.280 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Something
split that planet.

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:28.900 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: Absolutely, hit it.

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:29.832 align:middle line:10%
and so that is what--

00:16:29.832 --> 00:16:31.540 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And it's
instant too, wasn't it?

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:33.390 align:middle line:10%
Must be a massive explosion.

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:36.330 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: Massive,
massive explosion.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:40.140 align:middle line:84%
And it depends on
where you're at.

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:43.490 align:middle line:84%
The one thing with
his killshot is

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:48.190 align:middle line:84%
that he is seeing a
large planet moving

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:54.780 align:middle line:84%
between the Earth and the sun
when this killshot happens.

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:57.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this
Sitchin's Nibiru.

00:16:57.130 --> 00:17:01.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Yes, and it's exactly
as I describe it in my last two

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:03.900 align:middle line:84%
books, "Being in
it for the Species"

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.990 align:middle line:84%
and "Surviving the
Planet X Tribulation"

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:07.869 align:middle line:84%
that that is actually
the moment when

00:17:07.869 --> 00:17:10.560 align:middle line:84%
we have the days of
darkness and that we're

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.450 align:middle line:90%
going to have the pole shift.

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:16.390 align:middle line:84%
Ed is not sure if we will or
will not have the pole shift.

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:18.730 align:middle line:84%
If we do have it,
he's really unsure

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:21.930 align:middle line:84%
as to exactly what
Earth is going

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:25.079 align:middle line:84%
to be-- the Earth's orientation
is going to be afterwards

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:27.390 align:middle line:90%
and neither am I.

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:30.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't see it something
where we flip head over heels.

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:33.540 align:middle line:84%
That would reduce the planet
to single-cell animals.

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you
look at the Bible

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:39.740 align:middle line:84%
and you look at Revelation
and interpret things

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:42.660 align:middle line:84%
based on what you
read, Wormwood is

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.620 align:middle line:84%
coming close to
the planet, which

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:48.330 align:middle line:84%
could be Planet X. There's
a lot of similarities there.

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:49.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Absolutely.

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:53.150 align:middle line:84%
The more I see what's
happening and I

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:56.800 align:middle line:84%
look at what is in
the Bible, I really--

00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:00.720 align:middle line:84%
and I'm talking about
from a standpoint of not

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:04.120 align:middle line:84%
religious belief but
just by saying, OK,

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:06.820 align:middle line:84%
the Bible is a wisdom
text and that there

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:10.690 align:middle line:84%
are other wisdom texts that
speak about this as well.

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:13.860 align:middle line:84%
But over the years, I've come
to have a much greater respect

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.050 align:middle line:84%
for the Bible as a
preparatory for what's

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:18.872 align:middle line:90%
going to happen with Planet X.

00:18:18.872 --> 00:18:20.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Making the
assumption, Marshall,

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:24.570 align:middle line:84%
that all this is happening,
that it's going to occur,

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:27.540 align:middle line:90%
what can we do to survive this?

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:30.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: That's what I'm
really working on right now.

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:32.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my latest book,
"Surviving the Planet X

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:37.091 align:middle line:84%
Tribulation-- A Faith-Based
Leadership Guide,"

00:18:37.091 --> 00:18:39.340 align:middle line:84%
is a substantial-- it's the
biggest book I've written.

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:44.030 align:middle line:84%
It's 432 pages,
142 color graphics.

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And I have been listening
to people on awareness

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:52.940 align:middle line:84%
over the years and I've
heard their laments.

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:56.990 align:middle line:10%
These are people who have come
to awareness through dreams,

00:18:56.990 --> 00:19:00.380 align:middle line:10%
visions, and premonitions, long
before they started digging

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:03.050 align:middle line:10%
into the science of it.

00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:05.835 align:middle line:90%
And they're good people.

00:19:05.835 --> 00:19:07.210 align:middle line:84%
They're
salt-of-the-Earth people.

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:10.060 align:middle line:84%
They've got big
hearts, little wallets.

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And they keep asking me, what's
the point of my awareness

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:18.800 align:middle line:84%
if I can't afford bullets,
beans, and bunkers?

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And what I really
came to look at

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:26.660 align:middle line:84%
was that there are a lot
of people who are prepared.

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:29.430 align:middle line:84%
Wealthy people are
incredibly well prepared.

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:31.377 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
building bunkers.

00:19:31.377 --> 00:19:32.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: And very
expensive bunkers.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.097 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Underground bunkers.

00:19:35.097 --> 00:19:36.930 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: And I've
done a lot of consulting

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:38.075 align:middle line:10%
work with these folks.

00:19:38.075 --> 00:19:41.370 align:middle line:90%


00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:43.980 align:middle line:84%
If they've done it,
they've done it, all right?

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:45.950 align:middle line:90%
They're ready to go.

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:49.700 align:middle line:84%
But for a lot of the people
that are in awareness,

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:50.900 align:middle line:90%
they're in a stranglehold.

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:54.940 align:middle line:84%
They have families that
think they're crazy.

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:58.440 align:middle line:84%
The ones I really feel
sorry for are grandparents

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:02.670 align:middle line:84%
who have grandchildren
but their children

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:06.160 align:middle line:84%
live in a ground zero
place and will not

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.790 align:middle line:90%
move or even consider anything.

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:10.222 align:middle line:90%
And so there's a lot of torment.

00:20:10.222 --> 00:20:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at it
and I said, all right,

00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:14.250 align:middle line:90%
let's project into the future.

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:18.070 align:middle line:84%
Because the me and mine
prepping model, which is really

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:23.010 align:middle line:84%
based out of Cold War,
1950s, "Twilight Zone"

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:24.842 align:middle line:90%
bunker mentality, OK?

00:20:24.842 --> 00:20:27.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we saw what
happened in that "Twilight

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:27.240 align:middle line:90%
Zone."

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.406 align:middle line:90%
It was called "The Shelter."

00:20:28.406 --> 00:20:31.020 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: Yeah, it
was a great episode

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:34.060 align:middle line:10%
and people get really crazy.

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:36.350 align:middle line:84%
But even the ones,
the guys that have

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:41.930 align:middle line:84%
got the billion-dollar
underground condominiums,

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:43.092 align:middle line:90%
they're in small numbers.

00:20:43.092 --> 00:20:45.300 align:middle line:84%
At some point, they've got
to come up to the surface.

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:46.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:48.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: And when
they do, they're

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:51.060 align:middle line:84%
going to be strangers
in a strange land.

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And there is going
to be, for a while,

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.880 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be
the Mad Max element.

00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:00.820 align:middle line:84%
Warlords, cannibals, and so
forth, that is going to happen.

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And so when these people
come out from underground,

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:05.820 align:middle line:84%
they're going to have healthy
bodies and someone's going

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:07.820 align:middle line:84%
to smell them up to a
mile away and then they're

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:09.120 align:middle line:90%
going to die badly.

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:13.770 align:middle line:84%
So my thinking is-- because
what I'm really about

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:18.270 align:middle line:84%
is I want to help people survive
but also towards an enlightened

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:20.670 align:middle line:90%
future for the species.

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
reason why I believe

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:26.270 align:middle line:84%
that our last window of
opportunity, where we're

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:28.910 align:middle line:84%
faced with a clear
and present danger,

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:31.340 align:middle line:84%
not that everyone will
accept it is that.

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.580 align:middle line:84%
Because they're going to
be told, ah, don't worry.

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:37.140 align:middle line:84%
It's just an interesting
celestial phenomena.

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:39.160 align:middle line:84%
But there are going
to be people who take

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.500 align:middle line:90%
their own counsel, all right?

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that survival
communities of 100 or more

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:49.470 align:middle line:84%
are going to have the
greatest chance of getting

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:52.720 align:middle line:84%
through this and in a
constructive and positive way

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:55.740 align:middle line:84%
without losing their
noble human virtues.

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:59.280 align:middle line:84%
So faith-based
organizations, to me,

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:02.860 align:middle line:84%
have the greatest
possibility of success.

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:06.880 align:middle line:84%
It's because they already have
an existing chain of command.

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:11.070 align:middle line:84%
I've seen a lot of survival
communities organize.

00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:13.630 align:middle line:90%
They're along a secular model.

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:15.860 align:middle line:90%
They have the money to build.

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:17.430 align:middle line:84%
They have the
money to stockpile.

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:21.500 align:middle line:84%
They do these things but
they fracture and fall apart

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:26.350 align:middle line:84%
because the leadership
splits into ego camps

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:27.610 align:middle line:90%
and then that's the end of it.

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:28.711 align:middle line:90%
Everybody disappears.

00:22:28.711 --> 00:22:31.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Marshall, there was a
film called "The Road," which

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:33.980 align:middle line:84%
really depicts many of the
things you've been talking

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:35.770 align:middle line:90%
with me about today.

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:39.210 align:middle line:90%
Got to take a look at that.

00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:42.690 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:46.072 align:middle line:90%


00:22:46.072 --> 00:22:52.696 align:middle line:10%
>>I think it's October
but I can't be sure.

00:22:52.696 --> 00:22:54.305 align:middle line:84%
I haven't kept a
calendar for years.

00:22:54.305 --> 00:23:00.396 align:middle line:90%


00:23:00.396 --> 00:23:03.777 align:middle line:84%
Each day is more gray
than the one before.

00:23:03.777 --> 00:23:10.083 align:middle line:84%
It is cold and growing colder
as the world slowly dies.

00:23:10.083 --> 00:23:14.568 align:middle line:84%
No animals have survived and
all the crops are long gone.

00:23:14.568 --> 00:23:17.816 align:middle line:90%


00:23:17.816 --> 00:23:20.860 align:middle line:84%
Soon all the trees in
the world will fall.

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:24.970 align:middle line:90%


00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:28.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I got to
tell you, that's sad.

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:31.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: It is but it's not
really technically accurate

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:35.770 align:middle line:84%
and it's not describing the
future that we're going to see.

00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:38.610 align:middle line:84%
George, we're going to
go through a tribulation

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:41.240 align:middle line:84%
period of approximately
10 years, where

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:43.070 align:middle line:84%
the first three
to four years are

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:44.880 align:middle line:90%
going to be the worst of it.

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.700 align:middle line:84%
After that, it will
start settling down.

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:51.220 align:middle line:84%
But after all is said
and done, there's

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:54.460 align:middle line:84%
going to be what I call
the backside, sweet water

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:55.450 align:middle line:90%
and blue skies.

00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:56.820 align:middle line:90%
We're going to see that again.

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:58.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And will we rebuild?

00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:01.710 align:middle line:84%
Will we have that
ability to do that?

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:04.150 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: Well, we're
going to survive.

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:05.250 align:middle line:10%
Take that to the bank.

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:06.760 align:middle line:10%
We're going to rebuild.

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:08.410 align:middle line:10%
Take that to the bank.

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:10.430 align:middle line:10%
And we're going to go to space.

00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:12.260 align:middle line:10%
Take that to the bank as well.

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:15.410 align:middle line:10%
The question is, how
do we go to space?

00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:19.255 align:middle line:10%
Do we have a Star Trek future
or do we go like Anunnaki storm

00:24:19.255 --> 00:24:20.860 align:middle line:10%
troopers?

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:22.255 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Who knows?

00:24:22.255 --> 00:24:23.880 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: Yeah,
well, I think, there's

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:28.470 align:middle line:10%
a lot of other races
out in our galaxy

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:30.270 align:middle line:10%
and they're asking
the same question.

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:33.240 align:middle line:10%
They're wondering, which
way are we going to break?

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:34.900 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to come
out bad and evil?

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:38.220 align:middle line:84%
You know, like "Avatar,"
that movie really presents us

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:41.370 align:middle line:84%
as Anunnaki storm troopers
where we just go out

00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:45.800 align:middle line:84%
and it's just colonialism
all over again.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm not
sure I would want

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:52.070 align:middle line:84%
to live on Mars in the
condition it's in right now

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:56.320 align:middle line:84%
in a bubble house and that
would be one's existence.

00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:01.580 align:middle line:84%
I actually would miss walking
outside, breathing the air,

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:03.720 align:middle line:90%
seeing the trees.

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:06.119 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure that's the
kind of life I'd want.

00:25:06.119 --> 00:25:07.285 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: I agree with you.

00:25:07.285 --> 00:25:10.320 align:middle line:90%


00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And I sure wouldn't want to--
I believe in reincarnation

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:16.920 align:middle line:84%
and I wouldn't want to
reincarnate as a slave on Earth

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.010 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:24.370 align:middle line:84%
And so I think we really have
this opportunity as a species

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:27.020 align:middle line:90%
to break free of the shackles.

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:29.210 align:middle line:90%
We're a slave species.

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:32.110 align:middle line:84%
We think we're not but
that's how you maintained us,

00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:32.910 align:middle line:90%
all right?

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:34.650 align:middle line:90%
It's like boiling a frog.

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:36.842 align:middle line:84%
You just keep it real low
and slowly build it up.

00:25:36.842 --> 00:25:38.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, but
Marshall, I got to tell you,

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:44.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm amazed that in the years
I've been on this planet

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:49.700 align:middle line:84%
that we really haven't been hit
in a big way by an asteroid.

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:50.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: I agree.

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:51.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm amazed by that.

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:54.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Well, we have
been very fortunate.

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And they can prognosticate
about the odds

00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:04.800 align:middle line:84%
but there are times when--
well, it's catastrophism.

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:11.590 align:middle line:84%
And this is what science
believed in prior to Darwinism

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:14.070 align:middle line:90%
or uniformitarianism.

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And catastrophism says we go
through these long periods

00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:21.980 align:middle line:84%
of relative quiescence
and then these

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:25.970 align:middle line:84%
are punctuated by brief
moments of extreme violence

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:28.800 align:middle line:90%
that reorder life on the planet.

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:31.970 align:middle line:84%
So I hold to the
catastrophism model.

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And what we're
looking at is an event

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:40.510 align:middle line:84%
that is going to happen that
will reorder life on the planet

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:43.800 align:middle line:84%
but it's not going
to be the end of us.

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:48.100 align:middle line:84%
It's our opportunity to
have a Star Trek future

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:52.582 align:middle line:84%
or to throw it away and to
have a future that we wouldn't

00:26:52.582 --> 00:26:53.790 align:middle line:90%
want to give to our children.

00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:57.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, Sitchin believed
that Planet X, Niburu, was

00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:02.170 align:middle line:84%
inhabited by the Anunnaki, who
came to this planet 400,000

00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:05.220 align:middle line:84%
years ago, genetically
altered whatever creatures

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:09.060 align:middle line:84%
are on the planet and
voila, here we are today.

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:13.970 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe that that
civilization still exists

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:16.310 align:middle line:90%
on this so-called Planet X?

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:17.902 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: I believe it does.

00:27:17.902 --> 00:27:19.360 align:middle line:84%
I've written about
that in my book,

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:23.020 align:middle line:84%
"Being in it for the
Species," that when they come,

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:24.490 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
want two things.

00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:26.100 align:middle line:90%
They're going to want gold.

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:26.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Again.

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:27.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Again.

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:30.510 align:middle line:84%
Because the atmosphere
of their planet

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:36.340 align:middle line:84%
is really smashed hard by
these flybys like ours.

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And so they need the gold
to repair their atmosphere.

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:41.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They must be-- are
they self-contained as a planet,

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:45.015 align:middle line:84%
in terms of its energy
and its heating system?

00:27:45.015 --> 00:27:47.655 align:middle line:90%


00:27:47.655 --> 00:27:49.440 align:middle line:84%
Or are they close,
like you said,

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:51.660 align:middle line:84%
they're next to a
brown dwarf but isn't

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:54.600 align:middle line:90%
that an extinguished star?

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:58.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Well,
a brown dwarf is

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:01.320 align:middle line:84%
different from our star
in that it has the mass

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:04.070 align:middle line:84%
to ignite but not
to, so to speak,

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:06.550 align:middle line:84%
maintain the nuclear
furnace that we see.

00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:09.310 align:middle line:84%
So it's more like a
charcoal briquette.

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:11.370 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Is it still
heating that planet?

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:13.020 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: Yes,
it's still heating.

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:16.950 align:middle line:10%
And astronomers have
determined that a brown dwarf

00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:20.010 align:middle line:10%
can sustain life in one of
the planets orbiting it.

00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:22.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They must be in
darkness, though, all the time,

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:23.990 align:middle line:90%
those inhabitants.

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:28.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: They do but
they actually-- the system

00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:31.620 align:middle line:84%
has Nemesis, which
is the brown dwarf.

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:34.350 align:middle line:84%
Then its innermost
planet is Helion,

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:37.196 align:middle line:84%
which is several times
the size of Earth.

00:28:37.196 --> 00:28:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And then Arboda and
then finally, Nibiru.

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:43.780 align:middle line:84%
Helion is a bright,
gaseous planet.

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:46.670 align:middle line:84%
So for them, in their
system, it actually

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:49.900 align:middle line:84%
looks like they have two
stars in the night sky.

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:51.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right, but they don't

00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:52.233 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: But they don't.

00:28:52.233 --> 00:28:56.870 align:middle line:84%
But it also is something where,
yes, they have a lot of mass.

00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:59.770 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
Jupiter, some people

00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:03.980 align:middle line:84%
say that we should
name Jupiter as a sun

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:07.276 align:middle line:84%
because it generates more energy
than it receives from the sun.

00:29:07.276 --> 00:29:08.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:13.180 align:middle line:84%
Is this a different solar
system that comes around or are

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:15.730 align:middle line:90%
they within our solar system?

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:19.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: They're a, what
we call a mini constellation.

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And you could think of it as
a solar system nested inside

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:24.800 align:middle line:90%
of a solar system.

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:25.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Within us.

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.400 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Yeah, within us.

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:31.040 align:middle line:84%
It's not where-- it doesn't
follow the typical model where

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:35.070 align:middle line:84%
you have two large stars
orbiting each other,

00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:36.770 align:middle line:90%
doing a dance.

00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:42.030 align:middle line:84%
This is one where Nemesis
is orbiting around

00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:46.600 align:middle line:84%
our sun in a long period
orbit, very much comet-like

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:47.860 align:middle line:90%
and it's clockwise.

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have any
doubts of this existence,

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:52.030 align:middle line:90%
of this extra body out there?

00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:52.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: No.

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:53.750 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Or bodies?

00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:54.230 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: None.

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:54.730 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: None.

00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:55.560 align:middle line:10%
Not anymore.

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:56.310 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: Not anymore.

00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:57.934 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: In the
beginning of your work?

00:29:57.934 --> 00:30:02.730 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: In the beginning, I
had to be open-minded about it.

00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:06.000 align:middle line:84%
You have to pursue the
truth wherever you find it.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And so it was explaining
things that we saw.

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:15.260 align:middle line:84%
We were really--
what brought me to it

00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:18.100 align:middle line:84%
was we were trying
to figure out weather

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:20.620 align:middle line:84%
weirding, global warming,
whatever you want to call it,

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:24.730 align:middle line:84%
because I had been doing
business in the '90s in Russia

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:27.980 align:middle line:84%
and was taking the polar
route between San Francisco

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:29.940 align:middle line:90%
and Moscow.

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:32.380 align:middle line:84%
I'd go over in December,
come back in January.

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:33.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a long flight.

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:35.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: It Is a long flight.

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:41.635 align:middle line:84%
And I was flying Aeroflot,
actually very comfortable jets.

00:30:41.635 --> 00:30:44.260 align:middle line:90%


00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:49.250 align:middle line:84%
During the day, coming
back was continually light

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:51.430 align:middle line:84%
and I remember the
first time for me

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:53.880 align:middle line:90%
it was just breathtaking.

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:58.770 align:middle line:84%
Just as far as I can
see in any direction

00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:01.480 align:middle line:84%
and it was this unbroken
beautiful expanse

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:03.380 align:middle line:90%
of snow and ice.

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:07.570 align:middle line:84%
And my last trip--
over a period of years,

00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:10.850 align:middle line:84%
I've watched it
steadily degrading.

00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And in the last
flight, it looked

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:16.330 align:middle line:84%
like the busted windshield
of a car in a wrecking yard.

00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And I said to
myself, I don't care

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:21.090 align:middle line:84%
what the spinmeisters for
the oil and energy companies

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:23.080 align:middle line:90%
are saying.

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.070 align:middle line:90%
Something here is not right.

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:25.970 align:middle line:90%
This is wrong.

00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:27.220 align:middle line:90%
I shouldn't be seeing this.

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:31.910 align:middle line:84%
I could understand natural
variability, hills and valleys,

00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:33.890 align:middle line:90%
one year good, one year bad.

00:31:33.890 --> 00:31:36.920 align:middle line:84%
No, it was a steady
decline over a series

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:39.220 align:middle line:90%
of about six or seven years.

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And that got me to
studying things.

00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And we were looking at,
well, are the weather changes

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:48.120 align:middle line:90%
on the planet really man-made?

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And what we found was
that it was more solar

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:54.940 align:middle line:90%
driven than man-made.

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:58.150 align:middle line:84%
Man-made causes
are making it worse

00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:00.470 align:middle line:84%
but it's principally
solar and the reason

00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:02.920 align:middle line:84%
why we learned
that was we started

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:06.750 align:middle line:84%
looking at the other
planets in our solar system

00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:11.330 align:middle line:84%
and their atmospheres were
being perturbed like ours.

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:13.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Marshall, there's
an incredible controversy

00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:16.990 align:middle line:84%
over fracking these
days, the ability

00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:21.790 align:middle line:84%
to extract oil by pumping
in water in the shale

00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:23.830 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:25.450 align:middle line:84%
I want to take a
look at a commercial

00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:28.900 align:middle line:84%
by part of the
fracking group and then

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:31.900 align:middle line:84%
get your reaction to whether
it's helping or hurting

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:34.571 align:middle line:90%
the planet.

00:32:34.571 --> 00:32:36.320 align:middle line:84%
BARBARA PICKUP: I'm
not a big city person.

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:37.660 align:middle line:90%
I grew up here.

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:39.280 align:middle line:90%
These are my streets.

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:41.490 align:middle line:90%
These are my skyscrapers.

00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:43.470 align:middle line:10%
As a geologist, I chose
to work in the energy

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:45.140 align:middle line:10%
industry for a reason.

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:47.591 align:middle line:84%
Fracking will help us secure
America's energy future

00:32:47.591 --> 00:32:49.840 align:middle line:84%
and I want to make sure that
we're protecting the land

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:51.120 align:middle line:90%
and water too.

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:53.460 align:middle line:90%
There has to be a balance.

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:57.250 align:middle line:84%
Fact is, they've been fracking
safely for over 65 years.

00:32:57.250 --> 00:33:00.522 align:middle line:84%
In the end, progress depends
on all of us doing our part.

00:33:00.522 --> 00:33:02.480 align:middle line:84%
>>ANNOUNCER: Learn more

00:33:05.951 --> 00:33:07.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, that was
geologist Barbara Pickup.

00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:11.240 align:middle line:84%
That's who her name
is and obviously,

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:15.147 align:middle line:84%
paid by the fracking
industry to support that.

00:33:15.147 --> 00:33:17.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't hear a lot of great
things about fracking.

00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:19.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Oklahoma
has more earthquakes

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:21.850 align:middle line:84%
than they've ever had
before and they're

00:33:21.850 --> 00:33:23.740 align:middle line:90%
fracking all over that state.

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:24.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: That's right.

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And when I first started doing
location analysis for people,

00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:33.520 align:middle line:84%
I remember one of
my favorite states

00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:37.630 align:middle line:84%
was Pennsylvania as a
good place to relocate to.

00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:39.940 align:middle line:84%
Not anymore because of
all the heavy fracking.

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:43.556 align:middle line:90%


00:33:43.556 --> 00:33:47.000 align:middle line:84%
These wells, the
casings, are designed

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.910 align:middle line:84%
for a 30-year lifespan,
assuming normal conditions.

00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:57.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, some of them fail
on day one, all right?

00:33:57.090 --> 00:34:00.292 align:middle line:84%
What's going to happen with
all of these well casings

00:34:00.292 --> 00:34:02.000 align:middle line:84%
when, all of a sudden,
you have something

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.440 align:middle line:90%
like the New Madrid goes pop?

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:05.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it did once.

00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:06.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: That's right.

00:34:06.170 --> 00:34:07.294 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It'll do it again.

00:34:07.294 --> 00:34:09.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: And so
what'll happen is,

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:12.920 align:middle line:84%
earthquakes are going to
fracture these well casings

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:15.330 align:middle line:84%
and then this witch's
brew of chemicals

00:34:15.330 --> 00:34:19.469 align:middle line:84%
that they have used for the
fracking process will ooze up.

00:34:19.469 --> 00:34:23.230 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have dead
land and poisoned water.

00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:26.949 align:middle line:84%
So there are going
to be vast areas that

00:34:26.949 --> 00:34:29.010 align:middle line:84%
are going to become
uninhabitable

00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:33.850 align:middle line:84%
that would otherwise have been
superb tribulation shelter

00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:34.650 align:middle line:90%
areas.

00:34:34.650 --> 00:34:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
fracking has probably

00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:45.230 align:middle line:84%
cut by 40% to 50%
the number of places

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:49.340 align:middle line:84%
where people can go during
the tribulation to start over.

00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:51.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that's just
what we need then, right?

00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:56.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Yeah, between
that-- on top of that,

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.190 align:middle line:90%
we could have 100 Fukushimas.

00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:04.100 align:middle line:84%
These nuclear reactors,
yeah, they can scram them

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:06.600 align:middle line:84%
but they gotta
keep the core cool.

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.090 align:middle line:90%
And if they don't keep the core

00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:11.070 align:middle line:84%
cool, then you're going
to have Fukushimas.

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:14.510 align:middle line:84%
Right now, with Fukushima, the
corium have left the building.

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:16.420 align:middle line:84%
You've got three cores
that are going down

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:20.300 align:middle line:84%
into an underground river
that's pumping straight out

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:21.170 align:middle line:90%
into the Pacific.

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:22.920 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's going
all over the planet.

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:24.670 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: It's going
all over the planet.

00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:27.190 align:middle line:10%
The Pacific is dying.

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:32.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For those who remain,
after this Planet X situation,

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:34.450 align:middle line:90%
hope for them?

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:36.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: I believe
there's hope for them.

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we're going
to go through a period of time

00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:44.440 align:middle line:84%
when people are going to
be under extreme stress.

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:46.720 align:middle line:84%
It is going to cut the
wheat from the chaff,

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:48.970 align:middle line:90%
in terms of humanity.

00:35:48.970 --> 00:35:53.340 align:middle line:84%
But also, you're going to have
a lot of people experiencing

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:56.780 align:middle line:84%
near death, shared
death experiences,

00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:59.440 align:middle line:90%
major out-of-body experiences.

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:01.980 align:middle line:84%
The term major, when
you use it, means

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:04.870 align:middle line:84%
that you have an
event so significant

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:08.020 align:middle line:84%
that you actually see
yourself as an eternal being.

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:10.270 align:middle line:84%
When that happens,
whether it's shared death,

00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:13.590 align:middle line:84%
near death, or major
out-of-body experience,

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:14.930 align:middle line:90%
you come back changed.

00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:16.860 align:middle line:90%
You lose your fear of death.

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:20.049 align:middle line:84%
You lose your passion
for materialism.

00:36:20.049 --> 00:36:22.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So we may be
better off in the long run.

00:36:22.090 --> 00:36:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Yes, those who do
survive are going to be tested.

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:30.900 align:middle line:84%
The tribulation is going to be
like making a samurai sword.

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:34.560 align:middle line:84%
It's going to pound out the
impurities and full distill

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:36.040 align:middle line:90%
and make it stronger by layers.

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:40.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your opinion, when
does all this really happen?

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:42.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: All of this
is going to really happen

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:46.550 align:middle line:84%
once the Nemesis system reaches
its point of perihelion.

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:48.260 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Which would be?

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:50.090 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: That is
going to be sometime

00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:51.890 align:middle line:10%
within the next 18 months.

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:52.724 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That close?

00:36:52.724 --> 00:36:53.523 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: Yes.

00:36:53.523 --> 00:36:54.370 align:middle line:10%
