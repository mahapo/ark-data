>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.950 align:middle line:84%
Alyson Charles
Storey is with us.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.010 align:middle line:84%
A shaman, bestselling
author of the "Animal Power"

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.390 align:middle line:84%
book and deck, and she leads
global talks, courses, events,

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.450 align:middle line:84%
and hosts the internationally
acclaimed "Ceremony Circle"

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.060 align:middle line:84%
podcast, which will tell
you how you can hear it.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.665 align:middle line:90%
Alyson, welcome to the program.

00:00:36.665 --> 00:00:37.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ALYSON CHARLES STOREY:
Thank you so much, George.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.830 align:middle line:84%
It's an honor to sit and
share space with you.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did all
this happen to you?

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.930 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: That is the
trillion dollar question.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.217 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we have enough
time to explain all?

00:00:47.217 --> 00:00:49.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: We would need to
have a whole series to cover it,

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.675 align:middle line:84%
but I will do my best to
whittle it down because yes.

00:00:52.675 --> 00:00:54.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Give us
the Cliff Notes.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: The
Cliff Note version

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.210 align:middle line:84%
is, I had a background
that was not

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.120 align:middle line:84%
who I am in this moment
sitting with you today.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.140 align:middle line:84%
My background was
intense, elite athletics.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.030 align:middle line:90%
My father was my coach.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.340 align:middle line:84%
He put me in my first
running road race

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.710 align:middle line:84%
before I was even
three years old.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:13.658 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:01:13.658 --> 00:01:15.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: Yes,
and then that set

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.230 align:middle line:84%
the course for my first
really entrenched identity.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.860 align:middle line:84%
Being known as the best, and
this athlete, and this runner

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.920 align:middle line:84%
girl, and I was an athlete
for the University of Alabama.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.580 align:middle line:84%
I actually was a Division I
College coach for some time.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And it was when my
physical body started

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.190 align:middle line:84%
to break down that I started to
have some glimmers of the truer

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.510 align:middle line:90%
me inside of me.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.750 align:middle line:84%
But then I got pulled
into radio, actually.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.570 align:middle line:84%
I was a hip-hop morning
show host for many years.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.977 align:middle line:84%
And then that took me to New
York City, where I left--

00:01:47.977 --> 00:01:49.477 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
that Alyson Charles.

00:01:49.477 --> 00:01:52.170 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: I'm that
girl, yes, yeah.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And then I transitioned
into the world of television

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.070 align:middle line:90%
and I had so much fun.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.230 align:middle line:84%
I was a daytime
television talk show host.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.112 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
markets were you in?

00:02:00.112 --> 00:02:02.670 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: Oh, well,
it was a national show.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.000 align:middle line:84%
I was called "The Juice," and
it was a wellness talk show,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.449 align:middle line:84%
and we had celebs, and chefs,
and all sorts of people on.

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:11.595 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then
this evolution?

00:02:11.595 --> 00:02:13.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: The
evolution happened.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.700 align:middle line:84%
My story is one of those snap
of the finger and your life

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.680 align:middle line:90%
changes moments.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.572 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it did.

00:02:20.572 --> 00:02:21.372 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: It did.

00:02:21.372 --> 00:02:23.190 align:middle line:90%
I was living in Brooklyn.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.440 align:middle line:84%
I had pivoted out of a very
suffering-filled, long-term

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.270 align:middle line:90%
romantic relationship.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.790 align:middle line:84%
I just couldn't seem
to pluck myself out

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.680 align:middle line:84%
of some cycles of
insanity that were

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.750 align:middle line:90%
running for more than 16 years.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.672 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That happens.

00:02:37.672 --> 00:02:38.400 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: It has.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.540 align:middle line:90%
Has it ever happened to you?

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.070 align:middle line:84%
I wondered if you
could relate to that.

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.901 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't sure.

00:02:41.901 --> 00:02:43.068 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not quite like you.

00:02:43.068 --> 00:02:44.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: OK, well.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.790 align:middle line:84%
I got out of the relationship,
called off the engagement.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.790 align:middle line:84%
I moved to Brooklyn,
New York on my own.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.070 align:middle line:84%
And then as the
story sometimes goes,

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.610 align:middle line:84%
about six months later we
were thinking of venturing out

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.200 align:middle line:90%
as a couple yet again.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.680 align:middle line:84%
But my spiritual
guides said otherwise.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Don't do
it, don't do it.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.555 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: They
blew the whistle,

00:03:04.555 --> 00:03:06.780 align:middle line:84%
and on this
particular day I went

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.540 align:middle line:84%
to tell him we could head out
the door in a few minutes,

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.530 align:middle line:90%
but he was asleep.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And as I walked back
through my bedroom,

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.150 align:middle line:84%
I had my clairaudient
gift turned on,

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.930 align:middle line:84%
and I heard spirit speak to me
and say, stop and turn around.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.000 align:middle line:90%
And I'll whittle the story down.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.170 align:middle line:84%
That voice guided me to seeing
the truth of that relationship.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.770 align:middle line:84%
It blasted my egoic shell,
lifted the veil of illusion

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.080 align:middle line:90%
and showed me who I really am.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.433 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has that
voice stayed with you?

00:03:33.433 --> 00:03:35.850 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: Louder, and clearer,
and more and more present.

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.060 align:middle line:84%
I could actually get
really emotional thinking

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.640 align:middle line:84%
about the support that
is ever present for me.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm very grateful.

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Alyson, you
have a phrase called,

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.210 align:middle line:90%
winning but lost.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:46.822 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:03:46.822 --> 00:03:50.100 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: I was so grateful
when that message downloaded in

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.470 align:middle line:84%
because I thought oh this
perfectly encapsulates

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.940 align:middle line:90%
my pre-awakening life.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.400 align:middle line:84%
You know, like I said, all
of these accolades, all

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.220 align:middle line:84%
of these awards, and in
that past relationship

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.960 align:middle line:84%
on the outside a lot
of people thought

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.390 align:middle line:90%
it was an amazing relationship.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.260 align:middle line:84%
But there was abuse and all
sorts of things going on

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.460 align:middle line:90%
behind the scenes.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.710 align:middle line:84%
And so winning
but lost means you

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.780 align:middle line:84%
have all of this
external validation

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.400 align:middle line:84%
and all of this external
success, but on the inside

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.200 align:middle line:90%
you're lost.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.850 align:middle line:84%
You're not connected
to your soul

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.070 align:middle line:84%
and you're not connected
to your inner guidance.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This voice
that came to you.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.760 align:middle line:90%
Did you summon it up?

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.915 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:04:24.915 --> 00:04:28.260 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: I think on a deep
soul level I did summon it.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.910 align:middle line:84%
I think I was calling out in
an unconscious way for support

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.070 align:middle line:84%
to get out of those
cycles of insanity.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.820 align:middle line:84%
But no, I really liken it to
a true divine intervention

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.350 align:middle line:84%
where the angelic realms and
different spiritual guides

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:42.150 align:middle line:90%
all came in.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.610 align:middle line:84%
I felt their presence
in the moment,

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.520 align:middle line:84%
but I understood it more
clearly in hindsight

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.160 align:middle line:84%
that it required my
guides to step in

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.320 align:middle line:84%
and to really change
the course of my life.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.633 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they stepped in
in a big way, didn't they?

00:04:54.633 --> 00:04:55.510 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: Huge way.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.800 align:middle line:84%
I flew to Indiana
where I'm from after I

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.470 align:middle line:84%
had this divine
intervention and I stayed

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:02.700 align:middle line:90%
at my grandmother's house.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.760 align:middle line:84%
And in that back bedroom over
the course of a month or so

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.950 align:middle line:90%
I had additional awakenings.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And they were reviewing, taking
me through a review of my life,

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.120 align:middle line:84%
but showing me instances
without the denial

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.500 align:middle line:90%
that I had so staunchly been in.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.420 align:middle line:84%
They were showing
me those instances

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.060 align:middle line:84%
in truth and
illumination, and that

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.300 align:middle line:84%
was the moment where I
decided I need to surrender.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.340 align:middle line:90%
I need to get out of my own way.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And I'm ready to receive
guidance and heed guidance,

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.080 align:middle line:84%
and I spoke a surrender
statement and that's

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.880 align:middle line:90%
what I did.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.338 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
they approach you?

00:05:34.338 --> 00:05:36.280 align:middle line:84%
In a dream state
or were you awake?

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.080 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: No.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.790 align:middle line:84%
It was through
the clairaudience.

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And then when I was in Indiana
staying with my grandmother,

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.340 align:middle line:84%
that's when my clairvoyant and
my visual connection came in.

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:52.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, you know, I think my seer
gift is probably my strongest.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm able to see so much
about life, about people,

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.980 align:middle line:84%
and it's like I said,
it's my greatest gift,

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.230 align:middle line:84%
but it's one that has come
with a lot of challenge

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.020 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of responsibility
to see so much in people.

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:08.467 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Alyson, what made
you so open to accepting this?

00:06:08.467 --> 00:06:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: What made
me so open was the fact

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.248 align:middle line:84%
that I knew I could
no longer live

00:06:14.248 --> 00:06:15.540 align:middle line:90%
the way that I had been living.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.500 align:middle line:90%
It caused so much pain.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.750 align:middle line:84%
My body was trying
to get my attention.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.775 align:middle line:84%
I had autoimmune
disorders, panic disorders.

00:06:21.775 --> 00:06:23.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Everything was
going wrong with you.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.012 align:middle line:90%
You were shutting down.

00:06:25.012 --> 00:06:27.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: Everything was
clamoring to get my attention,

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.510 align:middle line:84%
but I was in a codependent
system in that relationship.

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And so I would try to
take psychic courses,

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.220 align:middle line:90%
but my ex wasn't a fan of that.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:37.600 align:middle line:90%
So I would shut that down.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And so it really took a lot
of help to get me on the path

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:42.850 align:middle line:90%
that I'm on today.

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:44.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sounds like it
was very toxic for you.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: It was,
and that is what

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.570 align:middle line:84%
has kept me so steadfast
in living in true devotion

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:53.770 align:middle line:90%
to the divine.

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:55.930 align:middle line:84%
I know what denial
feels like, and I

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.910 align:middle line:84%
know what illusion
feels like, and I

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:59.470 align:middle line:90%
knew I could never go back.

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And so my prayer when I spoke
that surrender statement is

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.990 align:middle line:84%
show me the way and I
have heeded the calls

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.090 align:middle line:84%
and I have committed
to living in devotion

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:08.770 align:middle line:90%
to truth and to the divine.

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:10.585 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you've
become a shaman.

00:07:10.585 --> 00:07:11.500 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: I have.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.815 align:middle line:84%
And you know, you've done
thousands and thousands

00:07:14.815 --> 00:07:16.690 align:middle line:84%
of interviews with so
many spiritual teachers

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:20.080 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure many shamans,
and I was born a shaman.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.020 align:middle line:84%
It's just at a
young age I felt I

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.650 align:middle line:84%
needed to kind of shut
down and suppress my gifts.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:28.690 align:middle line:84%
So it took that
divine intervention

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:29.770 align:middle line:90%
to wake me back up.

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:31.900 align:middle line:84%
But the point I
always like to clarify

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:35.500 align:middle line:84%
is after my surrender
moment I didn't set out

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.150 align:middle line:90%
on a quest to become a shaman.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.700 align:middle line:84%
I set out on a quest
to heal myself,

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:45.100 align:middle line:84%
and it was through that
devotion and listening to,

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.260 align:middle line:84%
you need to go to
this healer, you

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.170 align:middle line:84%
need to have a soul retrieval
session with your aunt

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:51.010 align:middle line:90%
who's a shaman.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:54.310 align:middle line:84%
In staying the course
on that journey, that

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:57.693 align:middle line:84%
is what allowed the true
calling inside of me of being

00:07:57.693 --> 00:07:59.110 align:middle line:84%
a shaman that was
always there, it

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:02.840 align:middle line:84%
allowed it to start to open
up and inform and communicate

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:03.640 align:middle line:90%
with me again.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when you
say you surrendered,

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:07.163 align:middle line:90%
who did you surrender to?

00:08:07.163 --> 00:08:08.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: Beautiful
question, and thank

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:10.120 align:middle line:90%
you so much for asking that.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:13.540 align:middle line:84%
I surrendered to Great
Spirit, Great Mother Earth,

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:15.130 align:middle line:90%
and my own soul.

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:17.830 align:middle line:84%
And that vertical
line is the line

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:20.380 align:middle line:84%
that I hold in the most
pristine and pure way

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.000 align:middle line:90%
that I possibly can to this day.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually
where the name Rock-Star

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:26.620 align:middle line:90%
Shaman comes from.

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.530 align:middle line:90%
Those main connection points.

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:32.866 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you help
other people at this point?

00:08:32.866 --> 00:08:35.260 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: The main way
is through my embodiment

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:39.820 align:middle line:84%
and it's through me
knowing that integrity

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.890 align:middle line:90%
is the most important thing.

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:47.650 align:middle line:84%
It's through my dedication to
facing all aspects of myself

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:52.030 align:middle line:84%
and really being a spiritual
teacher and leader who does my

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:54.160 align:middle line:90%
very best to walk the talk.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Alyson, people are
going through a very strange

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:57.430 align:middle line:90%
time right now.

00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:58.660 align:middle line:90%
I can feel it.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:00.310 align:middle line:90%
I can see it.

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:03.610 align:middle line:84%
They're uptight, they're not
as happy as they used to be.

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not talking about
everybody, but generally,

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.663 align:middle line:90%
do you feel that too?

00:09:08.663 --> 00:09:09.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: Absolutely.

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:14.650 align:middle line:84%
The old ways of living,
the old paradigm systems,

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:16.990 align:middle line:90%
they can last no more.

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:19.180 align:middle line:90%
They will not work anymore.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's this
energetic system that

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:25.480 align:middle line:84%
might feel scary or
challenging, but it's really

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:29.020 align:middle line:84%
just trying to usher
people into these ways

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:30.190 align:middle line:90%
that we're talking about.

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:33.040 align:middle line:84%
Ways of surrendering
to these unseen

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.040 align:middle line:84%
realms and the spiritual
support that's always there.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:40.300 align:middle line:84%
These ways of going inward
and connecting with our soul.

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.580 align:middle line:84%
For some reason
over the last 100

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:45.520 align:middle line:84%
or thousands of years
especially over here in the US,

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.680 align:middle line:84%
the vast majority
of people are so

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.660 align:middle line:84%
disconnected from the
truth of who they am.

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:51.880 align:middle line:84%
They're so disconnected
from spirit.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And if you're disconnected
from those places,

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:58.450 align:middle line:84%
you're missing out on the vast
majority of all the support

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:01.420 align:middle line:84%
and all the love that is
here for us at all times.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:03.355 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they even
know who they are?

00:10:03.355 --> 00:10:03.730 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: No.

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
suffering and that's

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:06.970 align:middle line:90%
where the pain comes from.

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And I have been on the
shamanic path long enough

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:16.260 align:middle line:84%
to know that the way that I
walk it, there's validity to it,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.760 align:middle line:90%
and there's power to it.

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:22.350 align:middle line:84%
Because I can honestly
say I am with the system

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:26.310 align:middle line:84%
of true fulfillment, true
peace, and true happiness.

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's because I face
myself and go within.

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:32.100 align:middle line:84%
When I had all those awards,
I was not truly happy.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And so thankfully we have
shows like this that show

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.490 align:middle line:84%
people rituals, and
practices, and ways

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:40.110 align:middle line:84%
where they can go
within and start

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:42.240 align:middle line:84%
to get to know the
totality of themselves,

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.500 align:middle line:90%
because that's the key.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.708 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And let's say there
are some people watching

00:10:45.708 --> 00:10:49.210 align:middle line:84%
this program right now and
they want to change themselves.

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:51.730 align:middle line:84%
They want to pick
themselves up, like you did.

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:52.805 align:middle line:90%
How do they start?

00:10:52.805 --> 00:10:54.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: You know,
I really recommend

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:55.630 align:middle line:90%
a surrender statement.

00:10:55.630 --> 00:11:01.480 align:middle line:84%
And I have found that it's the
simplest of spiritual practices

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.060 align:middle line:84%
that really can guide
people most powerfully.

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't have to be
a long surrender statement.

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:09.498 align:middle line:84%
Even if you're not someone
who is a daily meditator.

00:11:09.498 --> 00:11:11.290 align:middle line:84%
Even if you're someone
that doesn't already

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:13.360 align:middle line:84%
have an altar
space in your home.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:17.440 align:middle line:84%
It's just simply taking
an honoring 30 seconds

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.320 align:middle line:84%
to close your eyes,
to maybe put your hand

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.200 align:middle line:84%
on your heart and your lower
belly, to take a breath

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.480 align:middle line:84%
and to speak to whoever
it is you speak to.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:30.430 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's the universe,
Gaia, you know, the angelic

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:33.040 align:middle line:84%
realms, and finally
speak your willingness

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.420 align:middle line:90%
to get out of your own way.

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And the key is though, to heed
the messages that come in,

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:40.330 align:middle line:84%
because I see a lot of
people surrender and speak

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.730 align:middle line:84%
a statement, but then
the guidance will come in

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:43.780 align:middle line:90%
and they'll block it out.

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:44.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't
follow through.

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: You have to take
responsibility in that way.

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have an altar of
my producer Tom in my house.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:50.690 align:middle line:90%
I have a picture with Tom.

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:51.907 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm kidding.

00:11:51.907 --> 00:11:53.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: He's your main guide?

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:53.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm kidding.

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:54.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm kidding.

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.800 align:middle line:84%
But what did you mean by
an altar in your house?

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: You
know, at this point,

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:03.020 align:middle line:84%
I feel so blessed to
have a very ornate altar.

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.060 align:middle line:84%
In the home that I
share with my husband,

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:06.980 align:middle line:90%
Luke, in Austin, Texas.

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:11.100 align:middle line:84%
We have a ceremony loft
where the entire second floor

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:11.900 align:middle line:90%
of our home is--

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:13.175 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is devoted to that?

00:12:13.175 --> 00:12:13.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: It is.

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:15.470 align:middle line:84%
It's a living breathing
altar and there's

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:17.270 align:middle line:84%
incredibly powerful healings
that have taken place there--

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:18.683 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So, like a church?

00:12:18.683 --> 00:12:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: I feel that it is.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.130 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, a lot of
people say when they

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:25.760 align:middle line:84%
come in it feels of the
frequency of, like, temples

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:28.700 align:middle line:84%
and monasteries that
they've been in.

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:32.090 align:middle line:84%
But I want to make clear,
it doesn't have to be that.

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:33.320 align:middle line:90%
It can literally be--

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.853 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It doesn't have
to be that elaborate?

00:12:34.853 --> 00:12:35.653 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: No.

00:12:35.653 --> 00:12:36.830 align:middle line:90%
It can be a dedicated space.

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:37.630 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:42.290 align:middle line:84%
It's a place of dedication where
you will go at least once a day

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:45.410 align:middle line:84%
to connect to the truth of who
you are and the unseen realms.

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And it can literally be
a rock that you found

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.450 align:middle line:90%
on a walk and maybe a feather.

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:51.290 align:middle line:90%
It can be simple.

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:52.850 align:middle line:90%
It's just a dedicated space.

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:56.082 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
the unseen realms?

00:12:56.082 --> 00:12:59.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: The
infinite expanse that

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:04.820 align:middle line:84%
holds the wisdoms and
guidances of all that is.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:09.170 align:middle line:84%
It's everything that
we don't tangibly,

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:12.800 align:middle line:84%
physically see right here,
but through my seer gift,

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:17.150 align:middle line:84%
being my main gift, I'm able
to instantaneously connect

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:18.590 align:middle line:90%
into these unseen realms.

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And when you learn how to do
so with honor, with reverence,

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:30.320 align:middle line:84%
with responsibility, the
keys, and codes, and healing

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:35.630 align:middle line:84%
transmissions, and messages
that can help guide your life,

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:38.802 align:middle line:84%
it's beyond what we can
articulate in human language,

00:13:38.802 --> 00:13:40.010 align:middle line:90%
the support that lives there.

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:41.135 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is there a danger?

00:13:41.135 --> 00:13:43.100 align:middle line:84%
Is there something
that you should

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:45.240 align:middle line:84%
be aware of before
you dive into it?

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.040 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: Yeah.

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.640 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of things that
I think it's wise for people

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:54.800 align:middle line:84%
to take into account because it
holds infinite transmissions,

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.800 align:middle line:84%
and energetics, and
infinite types of beings,

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:00.260 align:middle line:84%
just like there's
duality here, there's

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.930 align:middle line:84%
darker or lighter energetics
on the other side.

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:06.500 align:middle line:84%
So I always do a very
simple prayer of protection.

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:09.440 align:middle line:84%
I always call in the
highest and most pristine

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.620 align:middle line:84%
divine blessings and
protection to be with me,

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:16.400 align:middle line:84%
so I know I'm always held in
that space before I connect in.

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:20.690 align:middle line:84%
But the other important thing
is once your gifts start

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:27.110 align:middle line:84%
to come online and once you
start to live in that devotion,

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:30.410 align:middle line:84%
to infinitely evolve and
allow your gifts to open

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:33.260 align:middle line:84%
more and more, that comes
with great responsibility

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:34.910 align:middle line:90%
in that respect as well.

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:38.690 align:middle line:84%
Just because you can see so much
about someone, that does not

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:41.120 align:middle line:84%
equate to you should
instantly tell

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.890 align:middle line:90%
that person what you're seeing.

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:43.910 align:middle line:90%
I usually wait.

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:45.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm never invasive
with my gifts.

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.450 align:middle line:84%
I usually wait for
an invitation in.

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:49.700 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot to keep an eye on.

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:51.405 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Take me on
a shamanic journey.

00:14:51.405 --> 00:14:53.030 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: Well, I
have one rattle here

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:58.183 align:middle line:84%
that I just wanted to clear
the space of the chair.

00:14:58.183 --> 00:14:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right,
you're going to have

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:01.417 align:middle line:90%
to show us how you use it.

00:15:01.417 --> 00:15:04.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: Yeah, well,
I typically use drums,

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:07.230 align:middle line:84%
but I also use rattles,
and I also can guide people

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:09.150 align:middle line:90%
without an instrument as well.

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:14.220 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of it has to do
with the embodiment energetics

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:18.990 align:middle line:84%
that I carry and this really
clean, clear, pristine line

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:21.180 align:middle line:90%
to these most divine places.

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And I have journeyed
thousands of people.

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:28.500 align:middle line:84%
I have in the middle of
Manhattan and Bryant Park,

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:32.310 align:middle line:84%
I've taken more than 10,000
people on a shamanic journey.

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:33.110 align:middle line:90%
I've done live--

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.985 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:15:33.985 --> 00:15:34.950 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: Yeah, yes.

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:39.960 align:middle line:84%
I've really been able to
take consciousness teachings

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:43.800 align:middle line:84%
and shamanic teachings into
places where it's been lacking

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.530 align:middle line:84%
and where it's needed
most, and help people

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:48.600 align:middle line:84%
in these more
mainstream communities

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.550 align:middle line:84%
remember who they
really are and remember

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:52.497 align:middle line:84%
these ways that our
humanity sacred practices.

00:15:52.497 --> 00:15:54.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would be
some of the benefits,

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:57.092 align:middle line:84%
Alyson, of pulling
out this information?

00:15:57.092 --> 00:15:58.300 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: There's countless.

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.520 align:middle line:84%
A recent healing
session that I did,

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:04.670 align:middle line:84%
we worked for about three hours
cutting any energetic cords

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:05.470 align:middle line:90%
to past--

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:06.942 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's intense.

00:16:06.942 --> 00:16:09.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: It is, but
it was so beautiful.

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:11.800 align:middle line:84%
Just releasing and
clearing the way

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.350 align:middle line:84%
of any past relationships
that oftentimes

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:15.490 align:middle line:90%
we aren't even aware.

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:18.460 align:middle line:84%
You break up with someone
and you think that it's over,

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:20.650 align:middle line:84%
but energetically
there can still

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:23.470 align:middle line:84%
be these, like, energetic
connection lines and cords that

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:24.910 align:middle line:90%
are really tethering you back.

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:26.481 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or a death of a friend.

00:16:26.481 --> 00:16:27.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: Yes, yes.

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:29.770 align:middle line:84%
All of that, and so we
spent about three hours

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:31.120 align:middle line:90%
clearing that.

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.220 align:middle line:90%
Shadow work is another huge one.

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.590 align:middle line:84%
I facilitated, or
co-facilitated,

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:39.820 align:middle line:84%
a beautiful women's only
gathering with about 100 women,

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:43.330 align:middle line:84%
and with my drum I took
them into a shamanic cave

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:46.450 align:middle line:84%
and allowed them to feel
and face some shadow

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:48.640 align:middle line:84%
aspects that they've
been previously

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.260 align:middle line:90%
suppressing and denying.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, there's not
much greater liberating work

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:54.668 align:middle line:90%
that one can do.

00:16:54.668 --> 00:16:56.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had a friend,
he lives in Saint Louis,

00:16:56.710 --> 00:17:00.280 align:middle line:84%
and he's restricted
to a wheelchair.

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:04.599 align:middle line:90%
He was born with almost no legs.

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:07.430 align:middle line:84%
He was deformed, but he
got around and everything,

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:11.500 align:middle line:84%
I bought him a car when a couple
of years ago, a little junky

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:12.667 align:middle line:90%
thing for him to get around.

00:17:12.667 --> 00:17:13.958 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: That's so beautiful.

00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:15.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he had
it modified, so he

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:18.190 align:middle line:84%
had like pedals for the
gas and stuff like that.

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And I hadn't heard from him in
a year, which is not unusual.

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:25.964 align:middle line:84%
But I went on Facebook
and found out he died.

00:17:25.964 --> 00:17:26.839 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: Oh, bless.

00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:27.964 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Found out he died.

00:17:27.964 --> 00:17:31.165 align:middle line:84%
Now those are tough times
for people, aren't they?

00:17:31.165 --> 00:17:33.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: Yeah, those
are, you know, yes.

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:37.887 align:middle line:84%
Especially when it's an
experience like that.

00:17:37.887 --> 00:17:39.970 align:middle line:84%
You know, I haven't really
shared this story much,

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:41.920 align:middle line:84%
but in your
vulnerability and sharing

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.200 align:middle line:84%
that, it's I feel
called to share.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:47.230 align:middle line:84%
My husband and I, we have
such a beautiful relationship,

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:49.570 align:middle line:84%
and we've been on the
pregnancy journey.

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And up until about a
year ago I had never

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:56.452 align:middle line:84%
been pregnant and didn't know
what that experience was like,

00:17:56.452 --> 00:17:57.910 align:middle line:84%
but we were really
calling that in.

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:01.560 align:middle line:84%
And we did get pregnant, and
about nine weeks later, I

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:02.730 align:middle line:90%
had a miscarriage.

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:03.472 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sorry to hear that.

00:18:03.472 --> 00:18:05.139 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: It's OK,
you know, thank you.

00:18:05.139 --> 00:18:06.630 align:middle line:90%
But it ended up being--

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:10.650 align:middle line:84%
oh, yeah, I feel the waves of
the power of that experience

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:14.220 align:middle line:84%
because of who I am at
this time in my life

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:18.420 align:middle line:84%
and because I'm in such healthy
relation with the totality

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:21.240 align:middle line:84%
of myself and with the
totality of all that is

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:24.150 align:middle line:84%
and the full spectrum of
human earthly emotions,

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:27.120 align:middle line:84%
I was able to navigate
that experience

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:31.770 align:middle line:84%
and be more connected to
miracle energy than ever before.

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:35.040 align:middle line:84%
Hear the messages of the
spirit of that baby telling me

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:38.580 align:middle line:84%
why it happened, and it brought
my husband and I together.

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:42.090 align:middle line:84%
We were able to give back
to our land, the dissolving

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:43.830 align:middle line:84%
of that miscarriage,
and it ended up

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:46.290 align:middle line:84%
being one of the most beautiful
experiences of my life.

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And that is what the shamanic
path has afforded me.

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:50.310 align:middle line:90%
That is what it has taught me.

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:52.268 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you have
done this shamanic path

00:18:52.268 --> 00:18:53.335 align:middle line:90%
all over the country.

00:18:53.335 --> 00:18:54.585 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: All over the world.

00:18:54.585 --> 00:18:55.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You
brought it all over.

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:56.140 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:56.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: Yeah.

00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:01.900 align:middle line:84%
That flows through me
and wants to access you.

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:05.125 align:middle line:84%
I'm just here to deliver
that to you all tonight.

00:19:05.125 --> 00:19:13.780 align:middle line:90%


00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:16.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready.

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And through the chakras in
the palms of your hands,

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:22.960 align:middle line:84%
you're going to start
to invite in whatever

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:28.180 align:middle line:84%
divine energies that want to
access you for your highest

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:29.680 align:middle line:90%
greatest earthly good.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.570 align:middle line:84%
It was fascinating for
me because I started

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:33.820 align:middle line:84%
getting a lot of the visions
and channeled guidance

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:36.820 align:middle line:84%
for what to offer
on stage yesterday.

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And as it was pouring in,
there was a channeled song

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:41.350 align:middle line:84%
that you'll hear in a
second, but it was--

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:48.928 align:middle line:90%
[CHANTING]

00:19:48.928 --> 00:19:51.220 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: We don't get to
see people like this often.

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And when I do, I'm a
happy go-lucky person.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:57.542 align:middle line:90%
So and she's beautiful too.

00:19:57.542 --> 00:19:58.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: Thank you.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:19:59.560 align:middle line:90%
Well.

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.143 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank
you for your energy.

00:20:01.143 --> 00:20:03.340 align:middle line:84%
Come back and just bring
that energy with you

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:06.550 align:middle line:84%
so I could just like absorb
it, and I don't get it often.

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:10.296 align:middle line:84%
Especially in this
beautiful city of New York.

00:20:10.296 --> 00:20:15.070 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: This was such a
mystical, powerful, magical

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:17.170 align:middle line:90%
action-packed day.

00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:18.592 align:middle line:90%
I'm electrified from it.

00:20:18.592 --> 00:20:20.800 align:middle line:84%
I can tell I'm going to be
feeling all these energies

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.060 align:middle line:90%
for days to come.

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:25.540 align:middle line:84%
To be able to bring
these kinds of medicines

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:31.870 align:middle line:84%
and this kinds of consciousness
work into an event like this,

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:35.050 align:middle line:84%
it means everything to
me and it opens my heart.

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:38.710 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for coming along,
for the journey, for the ride.

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:39.790 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:41.500 align:middle line:90%
I will see you next time.

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.997 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You are having
a good time there too.

00:20:43.997 --> 00:20:45.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: Thank you
for feeling the joy.

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:51.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this path has been
the wildest ride of my life.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And I have had to access
levels of courage and bravery

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:58.160 align:middle line:84%
within me that are
so far beyond what

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.980 align:middle line:90%
I could ever try to explain.

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:07.010 align:middle line:84%
But it has also brought me the
deepest joy and fulfillment.

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that I was
reflecting and watching

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.300 align:middle line:90%
that clip, because those--

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:12.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: When was that?

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:14.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: Those events
were some years ago

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:15.950 align:middle line:84%
when I was living
in New York City.

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:18.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm not real good with time,
but let's say at least five,

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:19.110 align:middle line:90%
six, seven--

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:21.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you still doing
similar things like that?

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:26.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: Yeah, I was recently
keynote speaker at a big plant

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:29.540 align:middle line:84%
medicine and other type of
conference called Meet Delic,

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:33.230 align:middle line:84%
and gave a talk about higher
power couple with my husband

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:36.260 align:middle line:84%
at another big conference,
but what I'm seeing

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:40.220 align:middle line:84%
is lately I've been called
more into community work.

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And down in Austin there's
a huge spiritual community,

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:46.100 align:middle line:84%
so I've done a lot
of blessing ways

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:49.580 align:middle line:84%
for mothers and really
holding space for friends

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:51.562 align:middle line:90%
and the community to transform.

00:21:51.562 --> 00:21:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's amazing
work that you do.

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:54.500 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: Thank you so much.

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:55.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I appreciate it.

00:21:55.970 --> 00:22:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And I truly live in a space
that's not of the mind,

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:02.750 align:middle line:90%
but it's of divine.

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And it requires me to get
out of the way and to trust.

00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:09.020 align:middle line:84%
To get on a stage
like that and to--

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:10.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That takes guts.

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:13.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: It really
does, and to be honest,

00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:15.380 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you a quick funny
story with that HBO Film

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:18.350 align:middle line:84%
Festival, guiding that
journey for 10,000 people.

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:22.550 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't until I got off stage
that the man who hired me said,

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:25.850 align:middle line:84%
do you know in the 25 year
history of this film festival,

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:29.810 align:middle line:84%
you're the first person
to ever come on the stage

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:31.940 align:middle line:90%
before we air the movie.

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:35.690 align:middle line:84%
We've never hired anyone to
do that before in the history,

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:39.290 align:middle line:84%
and I'm really glad I
didn't know that before.

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:41.780 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's in hindsight
where I think, oh my gosh,

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:43.100 align:middle line:90%
where did I get that courage?

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:46.640 align:middle line:84%
The courage is because
I heed what divine

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:48.590 align:middle line:90%
tells me and I trust in that.

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:52.160 align:middle line:84%
I trust, even though I'm
not a skilled singer,

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.583 align:middle line:90%
I'm a medicine singer.

00:22:53.583 --> 00:22:54.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You did well.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:55.310 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: Well, thanks.

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:56.227 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You did well.

00:22:56.227 --> 00:22:58.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: I just trust that
what I'm told I need to do,

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:01.250 align:middle line:84%
I do and I know if I'm
right with god, goddess,

00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:03.010 align:middle line:90%
then I'm good.

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:04.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The way
that you handled

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:06.340 align:middle line:90%
the crowd inspired them.

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:08.050 align:middle line:84%
You could tell that
they were getting

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:09.970 align:middle line:90%
into what you were doing.

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:13.660 align:middle line:84%
What was the end result
when it was done?

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:16.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: Oh, I just I really
feel even what I just did right

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:19.420 align:middle line:90%
there, that soul relief.

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:21.100 align:middle line:84%
It takes me back
to that question

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:24.310 align:middle line:84%
you asked earlier about this
massive shift in consciousness

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:26.680 align:middle line:84%
and this shadow
revelation that's

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:29.230 align:middle line:84%
been happening, especially
over the last few years.

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:32.530 align:middle line:84%
People, even if it's
on a deep soul level

00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:35.200 align:middle line:84%
or even if it's more on
an unconscious level,

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:38.140 align:middle line:84%
they know that there's something
different meant for them.

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:41.620 align:middle line:84%
They know that there's something
that they need to lean into.

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure you're
seeing it more and more.

00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:46.330 align:middle line:84%
People that might have you
know scoffed, or joked,

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:48.820 align:middle line:84%
or laughed at having
your palm read,

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:51.790 align:middle line:84%
or doing a numerology report,
or going on a shamanic journey

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:56.590 align:middle line:84%
even two or three years ago,
now they're leaning into that

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:59.180 align:middle line:84%
and asking their friends
for different trusted guides

00:23:59.180 --> 00:23:59.980 align:middle line:90%
to go to.

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:02.080 align:middle line:84%
So there's a definite
major paradigm shift

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.710 align:middle line:90%
where we're being witnessed to.

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:05.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Alyson, we talk
a lot on this program

00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:07.610 align:middle line:90%
about spirit guides.

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:10.970 align:middle line:84%
What in your opinion
is a spirit guide?

00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:15.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: Well, any guide
in the unseen realms.

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:19.850 align:middle line:84%
I only call in and allow
in benevolent spirit guides

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:21.200 align:middle line:90%
to work with me.

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:25.820 align:middle line:84%
But right after I had my divine
intervention, Ascended Master

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:30.650 align:middle line:84%
Jesus, was who presented to
me and he has been my main--

00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:32.435 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You go straight
to the top, huh?

00:24:32.435 --> 00:24:35.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: You know,
thank you, Jesus.

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:38.810 align:middle line:90%
No joke really intended, but I--

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:43.730 align:middle line:84%
yeah, I could not be happier
than to have Ascended Master

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:45.140 align:middle line:90%
Jesus as my main guide.

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And then the next four
guides who came in

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.040 align:middle line:84%
happened to be
power animal guides.

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:52.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what's
a power animal guide?

00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:57.170 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: They are the animal
guides in the spirit realms.

00:24:57.170 --> 00:24:59.900 align:middle line:84%
Every single animal,
every single creature

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:03.260 align:middle line:84%
has healing and wisdom
attributes for us.

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And when they start
to present, they're

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:06.770 align:middle line:90%
presenting for a reason.

00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:08.450 align:middle line:90%
They have a message for you.

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:11.150 align:middle line:84%
They have an alchemical
code for you.

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:13.490 align:middle line:84%
They have something for
you that can positively

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:14.930 align:middle line:90%
transform your life.

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:16.738 align:middle line:90%
And the black jaguar, the bear.

00:25:16.738 --> 00:25:18.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's go to
some of these pictures

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:19.670 align:middle line:90%
that you brought with us.

00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: Yeah, these are
probably pictures, yes,

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:23.360 align:middle line:90%
from my book.

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:27.890 align:middle line:84%
So the black
jaguar, for me, this

00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:30.620 align:middle line:90%
is my core power animal guide.

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:34.310 align:middle line:84%
So along our life journey
we all have a core animal

00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:38.150 align:middle line:84%
who is with us from birth
until we transition back

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:39.140 align:middle line:90%
to the other realms.

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:42.145 align:middle line:84%
And then we also have different
supporter power animal guides

00:25:42.145 --> 00:25:44.270 align:middle line:84%
that come in depending upon
where we're at in life.

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:45.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like the bear?

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:46.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: Like the bear.

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:47.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take
a look at the bear.

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:49.850 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: Yeah, the bear
was a huge one for me.

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:54.230 align:middle line:84%
The bear taught me how
to truly surrender and be

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:57.590 align:middle line:90%
held by the spiritual realms.

00:25:57.590 --> 00:26:01.160 align:middle line:84%
It would guide me
to sit in its lap

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:04.820 align:middle line:84%
and learn how to lean back
and be held by its support.

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:08.930 align:middle line:84%
So I'm forever indebted by to
bear, and the deer and the frog

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:10.010 align:middle line:90%
were the other two.

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:12.245 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, frogs are some
of my favorite creatures.

00:26:12.245 --> 00:26:12.560 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: Really?

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.130 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:14.047 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't know.

00:26:14.047 --> 00:26:16.620 align:middle line:84%
Since I was a little boy,
I used to raise tadpoles.

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:17.420 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: Wow.

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:18.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And watch
their little legs

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.080 align:middle line:84%
sprout, turn them
into little frogs,

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.912 align:middle line:84%
and then drop them
off at a nearby creek.

00:26:22.912 --> 00:26:23.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: Oh, my gosh.

00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:25.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was just a kick.

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:25.770 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: That's so beautiful.

00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:26.687 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love frogs.

00:26:26.687 --> 00:26:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: Well, the
frog really taught me,

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:31.040 align:middle line:84%
especially as I was
trying to get out

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:33.200 align:middle line:84%
of those old cycles
of the relationship,

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.810 align:middle line:84%
it carried for me the
code and the messaging

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:37.490 align:middle line:90%
of leaps of faith.

00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And as you probably know,
frogs only ever leap forward.

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
precise message that I

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:45.910 align:middle line:84%
needed to get into
embodiment with no more going

00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:48.410 align:middle line:84%
back, no more looking back,
only leaping and moving forward.

00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:50.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I never saw
a frog leap backwards.

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:50.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: Never, never.

00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:51.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ever.

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:52.730 align:middle line:90%
What about the deer?

00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:54.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: The deer is
the path of the heart.

00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And I-- oh my gosh,
another wave of emotion

00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:01.550 align:middle line:84%
comes over me when I think
about the medicine of the deer,

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:04.040 align:middle line:84%
because that has been a
steadfast guide for more

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:06.170 align:middle line:84%
than a decade and
the deer actually

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:09.920 align:middle line:84%
played a huge role in me getting
together with my now husband.

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:14.270 align:middle line:84%
So the deer showed me to
not shut my heart down

00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:17.180 align:middle line:84%
despite the betrayal and
the huge heartbreak that

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:19.310 align:middle line:90%
caused my awakening.

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:24.260 align:middle line:84%
It told me to stay steadfast
in keeping my heart open

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:27.390 align:middle line:84%
and now I'm in an most
incredible relationship.

00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:28.190 align:middle line:90%
All thanks to that.

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:28.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:30.677 align:middle line:84%
And your book of course
is called "Animal Power."

00:27:30.677 --> 00:27:31.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: "Animal Power."

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which you
did, and that's

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:35.570 align:middle line:84%
where the illustrations
are, no doubt.

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:38.310 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: Yes, that's where all
of those animal illustrations

00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:39.110 align:middle line:90%
came from.

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:42.530 align:middle line:84%
I worked on that book
for so many years.

00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:45.410 align:middle line:84%
That was probably one of
the greatest initiations

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:46.250 align:middle line:90%
of my life.

00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And the funny story with this
is I, for about three or four

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:53.780 align:middle line:84%
years, was called into different
literary agent and publisher

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:55.490 align:middle line:84%
meetings when I was
living in New York.

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:58.220 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to work with me
and wanted me to write a book.

00:27:58.220 --> 00:27:59.303 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's the place.

00:27:59.303 --> 00:28:02.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: I couldn't get clear
on what the book should be.

00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:03.910 align:middle line:84%
That took three
years to get clear.

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:06.370 align:middle line:84%
I finally got the right
agents, had a meeting.

00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:08.410 align:middle line:84%
I said, OK, I'll write
a book on surrender.

00:28:08.410 --> 00:28:10.600 align:middle line:84%
I flew off to Bali
to write the book.

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:14.290 align:middle line:84%
First morning meditation in
Bali, hundreds and hundreds

00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:15.663 align:middle line:90%
of power animal guides came in.

00:28:15.663 --> 00:28:17.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Coming
at you like crazy.

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:19.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: And they said,
that is not the book.

00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:21.820 align:middle line:84%
You're to co-create
this book with me.

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:24.460 align:middle line:84%
Thankfully my team
was on board, and I

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:26.470 align:middle line:84%
worked with the
animals for many years

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:28.395 align:middle line:90%
to birth that into fruition.

00:28:28.395 --> 00:28:29.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
the animals have

00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:31.330 align:middle line:90%
this kind of clout and power?

00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:32.130 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: How?

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:37.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, because they hold so many
incredible wisdom attributes.

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:41.560 align:middle line:84%
One that also evokes
emotion for me is the leech.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:42.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The leech?

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:46.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: The leech, and I love
to tell this story because it's

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:48.190 align:middle line:90%
one of my greatest teachers.

00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:51.460 align:middle line:84%
It taught me how to
shift from fear to love.

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
if we have time,

00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:55.690 align:middle line:84%
but I did send over
some really cool video

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:58.260 align:middle line:84%
footage of me getting leech
therapy done on my knee.

00:28:58.260 --> 00:28:59.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I have it.

00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:00.060 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:02.930 align:middle line:90%


00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:04.550 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: Oh, OK.

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:05.390 align:middle line:90%
Oh my gosh.

00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:06.980 align:middle line:90%
OK, OK.

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And how long do people
keep them on for?

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:12.170 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well, anywhere
from half an hour to an hour

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:15.590 align:middle line:84%
or as they dropped
out themselves.

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:20.500 align:middle line:90%


00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:22.460 align:middle line:90%
Just breathe.

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:23.700 align:middle line:90%
Can you feel it?

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:24.575 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: I feel it.

00:29:24.575 --> 00:29:27.590 align:middle line:90%


00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:29.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to become
friends with it.

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:32.718 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to give
him good energy.

00:29:32.718 --> 00:29:34.010 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Do you feel it now?

00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:34.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: I do.

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:35.260 align:middle line:90%
I felt him.

00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:36.493 align:middle line:90%
I felt him attach.

00:29:36.493 --> 00:29:37.910 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: That's
the whole pain.

00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:39.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: I think it's
just knowing that they're

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:41.540 align:middle line:84%
going to plump up and
get fatter and fatter

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:42.890 align:middle line:90%
and filled up with my blood.

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:44.348 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: And
not with the blood.

00:29:44.348 --> 00:29:45.920 align:middle line:90%
With your lymphatic liquid.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:49.340 align:middle line:84%
The blood by percentage
is about 10, 15%.

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:52.160 align:middle line:84%
This is a very deep
detoxification of liver.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:56.090 align:middle line:84%
So any problems,
health problems that

00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:59.750 align:middle line:84%
are associated with the toxic
liver will start to clear.

00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:02.540 align:middle line:84%
One of them could
be skin problems.

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:07.010 align:middle line:84%
One of them could be
asthma and lung problems.

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:10.550 align:middle line:84%
Or just general, there's
many people coming just

00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:11.488 align:middle line:90%
to cleanse their body.

00:30:11.488 --> 00:30:13.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: Oh, Mr.
Plucinski, one of them's

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:14.530 align:middle line:90%
really digging in their teeth.

00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:16.580 align:middle line:84%
I feel more stinging now
in one of these up here.

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:19.160 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Just a little,
but that's about it.

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: What's the number
one reason people come in

00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:23.160 align:middle line:90%
for leech therapy?

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:24.420 align:middle line:90%
What health benefit?

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:29.610 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Migraines,
headaches, varicose veins,

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:34.950 align:middle line:84%
high cholesterol, cysts,
like female cysts.

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:36.450 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: And with
high cholesterol

00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:38.160 align:middle line:84%
because I know it's a really
common problem, especially

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.787 align:middle line:84%
for Americans, like where do
you put the leeches for that?

00:30:40.787 --> 00:30:41.870 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's where--

00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:42.570 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: Here too?

00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:44.130 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes,
because cholesterol

00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:48.160 align:middle line:84%
is created by our own body,
and among our own body,

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.910 align:middle line:84%
liver is the main
component of that process.

00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:55.410 align:middle line:84%
This is a chemical
factory, if you will,

00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:56.760 align:middle line:90%
in a tiny little body.

00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:00.030 align:middle line:84%
If you cut them open, you have
hundreds of different pipes

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:03.150 align:middle line:84%
and different rooms and
storage and this and that.

00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:08.820 align:middle line:84%
It's a very complicated animal
that produces a miracle drug.

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:11.640 align:middle line:84%
Leeches are over 20
million years on earth,

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:14.310 align:middle line:84%
and they never fail, and
they always do the work.

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:16.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm not sure
I'd go through that.

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:19.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: I know very
deeply that you could

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:21.000 align:middle line:90%
muster the courage to do it.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I could
muster the courage,

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:24.180 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not sure
I would do that.

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:27.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: Yeah, you know,
they were a massive teacher

00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:29.610 align:middle line:84%
of alchemization,
because you could

00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:30.988 align:middle line:90%
see my face in that video.

00:31:30.988 --> 00:31:33.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why were you
breathing the way you were?

00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:35.310 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: Trying
to calm myself,

00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:37.710 align:middle line:84%
trying to open
myself up to receive,

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:41.305 align:middle line:84%
and also trying to make that
pivot from fear to love.

00:31:41.305 --> 00:31:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you
kind of freaking out?

00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: I was absolutely.

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:46.950 align:middle line:84%
I had never seen a
leech in real life,

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:49.440 align:middle line:84%
and then when I went
to this medical clinic

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:52.890 align:middle line:84%
with that renowned Austrian
leech therapist, you know,

00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:56.255 align:middle line:84%
he pulls out a jar with
literally hundreds of leeches.

00:31:56.255 --> 00:31:57.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
he get them out?

00:31:57.630 --> 00:31:58.860 align:middle line:90%
Did he reach in there?

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:00.540 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: He reaches in.

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:02.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is he wearing gloves?

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:04.180 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: I don't think so.

00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:04.980 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:06.930 align:middle line:84%
But it still it
felt right for me.

00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And the beautiful
thing that I learned

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:12.507 align:middle line:84%
is the leeches have hundreds
of teeth and you feel it.

00:32:12.507 --> 00:32:13.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Little tiny ones?

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: Yes, tiny
teeth, and you feel it

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:17.460 align:middle line:90%
when they latch and attach.

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:21.210 align:middle line:84%
Even though they so generously
secrete a painkiller,

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:23.160 align:middle line:90%
I still very much felt it.

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:24.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The leeches
secrete a painkiller?

00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: They have
their own painkiller.

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nice of them.

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:29.017 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: I know,
it's very kind.

00:32:29.017 --> 00:32:31.080 align:middle line:84%
They're very
beautiful creatures.

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:33.990 align:middle line:84%
And then once they
are attached, they

00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:36.660 align:middle line:84%
start to extract
the lymph that needs

00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:38.280 align:middle line:90%
to go and start to detoxify.

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And then they put
that in one chamber

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:42.570 align:middle line:84%
and then in a
different place they

00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:45.180 align:middle line:84%
start to provide to you
these healing enzymes.

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:47.768 align:middle line:84%
I forget how many, it's more
than 100 healing enzymes.

00:32:47.768 --> 00:32:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long did
he keep those on you?

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:51.227 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: It was a
good amount of time.

00:32:51.227 --> 00:32:53.010 align:middle line:84%
I want to say it was
close to an hour,

00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:55.020 align:middle line:84%
and towards the end of
the-- well, that was more

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:56.760 align:middle line:84%
the middle of the
video, you saw how

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:59.070 align:middle line:84%
they started to inflate
almost like a balloon.

00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:03.000 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is they will
get so full that they will just

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.870 align:middle line:84%
start to roll off because
they can't receive anymore.

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:10.807 align:middle line:84%
And I get emotional a lot when
I look back at that video.

00:33:10.807 --> 00:33:12.390 align:middle line:84%
I haven't seen that
in a while or when

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:16.290 align:middle line:84%
I talk about the leeches
because I carried forever

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:20.460 align:middle line:84%
more from that experience
knowing the possibility of how

00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:23.430 align:middle line:84%
in real time to shift from
fear to love and leeches

00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:24.390 align:middle line:90%
taught me that.

00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And I love to have different
creatures like that in my book,

00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:29.520 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the
snake, or the spider,

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:32.760 align:middle line:84%
or the leech because it
helps people transcend

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:35.340 align:middle line:84%
limiting beliefs and
expand outside of the box.

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:41.430 align:middle line:84%
Because some people might think,
oh, the cougar or the shark

00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:44.040 align:middle line:84%
might have a teaching for
me, but the spider might not.

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:47.080 align:middle line:84%
But every single power animal
has beautiful healing wisdom

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:47.880 align:middle line:90%
attributes.

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:49.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: After the
fact when it was done,

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:51.450 align:middle line:84%
did you kind of freak out
thinking that you still

00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:52.620 align:middle line:90%
had leeches on you?

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:54.180 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: No, no.

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:56.730 align:middle line:84%
But there was a bit
of a longer healing

00:33:56.730 --> 00:34:00.390 align:middle line:90%
process than anticipated.

00:34:00.390 --> 00:34:03.240 align:middle line:84%
The puncture, the wound
is actually quite deep.

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:06.420 align:middle line:84%
So I had to keep it covered
for quite a few days.

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it was a very
transformational.

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:09.659 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Don't you scar up?

00:34:09.659 --> 00:34:13.297 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: I actually still do
have four tiny scars above my--

00:34:13.297 --> 00:34:14.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right here?

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:16.297 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: Above my liver,
and I went back for more.

00:34:16.297 --> 00:34:18.300 align:middle line:84%
I went back a second time
and had leech therapy

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:19.469 align:middle line:90%
done on my right knee.

00:34:19.469 --> 00:34:21.889 align:middle line:84%
So it clearly was a
positive experience.

00:34:21.889 --> 00:34:24.139 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Those little guys
go right at it, don't they?

00:34:24.139 --> 00:34:26.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: Yeah, they're so
generous, and so powerful,

00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:27.110 align:middle line:90%
and beautiful.

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:28.429 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How long do they live?

00:34:28.429 --> 00:34:30.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: When you
get leech therapy done

00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:33.679 align:middle line:84%
at a medical center, they're
actually sacrificial.

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:36.511 align:middle line:84%
And when they are done
doing the leech therapy,

00:34:36.511 --> 00:34:37.969 align:middle line:84%
that's the end of
their life cycle.

00:34:37.969 --> 00:34:38.449 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is it.

00:34:38.449 --> 00:34:39.249 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: Yeah.

00:34:39.249 --> 00:34:41.139 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does an
animal eat them?

00:34:41.139 --> 00:34:42.139 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: I'm not sure.

00:34:42.139 --> 00:34:43.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or a bird or something?

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:45.173 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: That would
be a beautiful ending.

00:34:45.173 --> 00:34:47.177 align:middle line:84%
I hope that that's
how it happens.

00:34:47.177 --> 00:34:48.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my gosh.

00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:50.420 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you give me a
little power animal reading?

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:52.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: OK, well, thank
you for the invitation.

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:55.610 align:middle line:84%
I clearly have it
since you just asked.

00:34:55.610 --> 00:34:58.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
take a moment to tune

00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:06.540 align:middle line:84%
in, get connected with the
ever present and generous love

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:09.530 align:middle line:90%
of Great Mother Earth.

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:13.970 align:middle line:84%
Get connected to the most
powerful place within me, which

00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:19.420 align:middle line:84%
is my heart, and taking
my connection line up

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:23.130 align:middle line:84%
to the center point of
source consciousness divine.

00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:26.130 align:middle line:90%


00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And George, would you like for
me to call in the power animal

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:33.000 align:middle line:84%
that most has a message
for you right now or do you

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.787 align:middle line:90%
have a specific question?

00:35:34.787 --> 00:35:36.495 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why don't
you call in an animal?

00:35:36.495 --> 00:35:54.840 align:middle line:90%


00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:57.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: Hmm.

00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:59.930 align:middle line:84%
It's always so beautiful
when I do these,

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:01.940 align:middle line:84%
and you know what
I just remembered?

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:05.300 align:middle line:84%
I was woken up at 3:00
o'clock in the morning

00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:07.820 align:middle line:84%
because there were
animals already trying

00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:09.170 align:middle line:90%
to make their way to you.

00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:11.960 align:middle line:84%
I totally forgot that
until this moment.

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:14.450 align:middle line:84%
I have been waking up
in that witching hour

00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:16.250 align:middle line:84%
every night for
the past few weeks,

00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:18.620 align:middle line:84%
and last night it happened
because the animals

00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:20.540 align:middle line:90%
were so present for you.

00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And then when I
tune in like that,

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.450 align:middle line:84%
there's usually some
peripheral animals that show up

00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:29.330 align:middle line:84%
and you had a whole plethora
of them that came in.

00:36:29.330 --> 00:36:30.530 align:middle line:90%
But then I wait.

00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:33.590 align:middle line:84%
There's a different feeling
when the main messenger

00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:36.663 align:middle line:84%
animal shows up, and for you,
it was actually the flamingo.

00:36:36.663 --> 00:36:37.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The flamingo?

00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:37.940 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:39.232 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: It was the flamingo.

00:36:39.232 --> 00:36:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And I will tell you,
the first message,

00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:45.230 align:middle line:84%
and then if we have
time, I'll dip back in

00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:47.330 align:middle line:84%
to get the deeper
messaging around it.

00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:52.190 align:middle line:84%
But the flamingo was an honoring
animal messenger for you.

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:57.870 align:middle line:84%
It was showing that
it was thanking you

00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:02.100 align:middle line:84%
for bringing in a community
of millions of people.

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:04.110 align:middle line:84%
Gosh, it's been a
long time since I've

00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:07.080 align:middle line:84%
done an interview where I've
almost cried this often.

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:10.050 align:middle line:84%
So that says a lot about
you and the space you hold.

00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:14.820 align:middle line:84%
But the flamingo is thanking
you for your longevity

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:19.260 align:middle line:84%
and your career of
being a way shower

00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:23.580 align:middle line:84%
and starting the spiritual
content so long ago

00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:27.550 align:middle line:84%
and holding such a safe and
powerful space for millions

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:28.350 align:middle line:90%
of people.

00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:31.440 align:middle line:84%
Flamingos, especially at
one location in Africa,

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:35.190 align:middle line:84%
they will call in millions
of fellow flamingos

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:36.135 align:middle line:90%
and they gather.

00:37:36.135 --> 00:37:37.635 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
all over the place.

00:37:37.635 --> 00:37:41.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: It's a very
powerful family power animal,

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.620 align:middle line:90%
and it was also honoring you.

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:47.162 align:middle line:84%
It showed stability, it was
standing on one of its legs,

00:37:47.162 --> 00:37:49.620 align:middle line:84%
and that would be the message
that I would want to dip back

00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:51.420 align:middle line:84%
in, unless there's
something coming to you,

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:55.710 align:middle line:84%
it was honoring your
stability in life.

00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:58.110 align:middle line:84%
Do you think of yourself
or feel yourself

00:37:58.110 --> 00:37:59.940 align:middle line:90%
as having stable energies?

00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:03.480 align:middle line:84%
Do people, friends and
family, know that about you?

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:05.100 align:middle line:90%
Do they go to you for--

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:06.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Its growing, I think.

00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:07.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: It's growing.

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:10.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because I go to
certain events and stuff,

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:15.420 align:middle line:84%
and it seems like my
notoriety is picking up higher

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:16.440 align:middle line:90%
and higher and higher.

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:20.040 align:middle line:84%
I've seen it over the years,
but the last year or two, I've

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:21.197 align:middle line:90%
never seen it this high.

00:38:21.197 --> 00:38:22.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: Oh, that's beautiful.

00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:24.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was going
through TSA to come down

00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:27.840 align:middle line:84%
to Boulder here for
our Gaia tapings,

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:29.640 align:middle line:90%
and a guy pulled me out of line.

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, oh no,
there's nothing on me.

00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:33.930 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what's going on?

00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:36.090 align:middle line:90%
He goes, I love what you do.

00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:37.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: Oh.

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:41.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Introduced him, took
a picture, and off I went.

00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:41.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: Yeah.

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:43.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's amazing.

00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:44.910 align:middle line:90%
That's happening a lot.

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:47.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: Yeah, and
especially with the content

00:38:47.490 --> 00:38:49.770 align:middle line:90%
that you're willing to cover.

00:38:49.770 --> 00:38:53.310 align:middle line:84%
So much of the media is opposite
of what we're sitting here

00:38:53.310 --> 00:38:54.540 align:middle line:90%
talking about today.

00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:58.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is the most
important thing for us

00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:02.730 align:middle line:84%
to be reconnecting people
back to are these teachings.

00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:05.460 align:middle line:84%
And without people
like you, people

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:07.710 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't have that
strong of a compass.

00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:10.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm going to Las
Vegas in a couple of weeks

00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:14.070 align:middle line:84%
and I was thinking about the
first hotel in Vegas that

00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:15.480 align:middle line:90%
started it all.

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:17.220 align:middle line:90%
And it was the Flamingo.

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:18.600 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: Are you serious?

00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:20.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, I'm dead serious.

00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:22.080 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: See, I'm
having a moment.

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And this type of experience that
we're having is pretty typical.

00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:29.680 align:middle line:84%
When I do these power
animal readings,

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:32.980 align:middle line:84%
I just have to give thanks
again to the power animal

00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:36.640 align:middle line:84%
guides and realms because
they have worked with me so

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:39.580 align:middle line:84%
strongly, clearly,
lovingly, and steadfastly

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:42.070 align:middle line:90%
for far more than a decade.

00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And I know, I trust that even
in a live setting like this,

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:48.940 align:middle line:84%
they always show
up for me and they

00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:50.650 align:middle line:90%
bring in such magical moments.

00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:52.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Even in strange ways.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.140 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: Yeah, wow.

00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:55.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would you say
your mission is, Alyson?

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:58.765 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: Oh, I want
to tune in to that.

00:39:58.765 --> 00:40:02.200 align:middle line:90%


00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:04.150 align:middle line:90%
It's multifaceted.

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:08.800 align:middle line:84%
My mission is to fully
live my soul's calling

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:12.460 align:middle line:84%
to the absolute
best of my ability,

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:18.730 align:middle line:84%
and when I say that, integrity
and embodiment are paramount,

00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:22.090 align:middle line:84%
but I also really,
really embrace

00:40:22.090 --> 00:40:24.710 align:middle line:84%
and hold in reverence
the human Alyson as well.

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:25.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:31.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: And I think that
that is so important because we

00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:35.440 align:middle line:84%
need to live in
devotion to facing

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:38.170 align:middle line:90%
all aspects of ourselves.

00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And I know I've done a
really great job at that.

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:44.470 align:middle line:84%
I know that I'm a
human and I know

00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:47.920 align:middle line:84%
that there are flaws and
flubs, but what I also

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:51.190 align:middle line:84%
know about myself is
that I live in very

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:52.600 align:middle line:90%
clear conscious awareness.

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:56.560 align:middle line:84%
And I'm willing to catch
myself and I'm also

00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:58.870 align:middle line:90%
willing to correct myself.

00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And that allows an
energetic feeling

00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:05.510 align:middle line:84%
of progress more
than perfection.

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:08.510 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of life
left in me to live.

00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:10.100 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, I want
to start a family,

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:11.725 align:middle line:84%
and there's so many
other things that I

00:41:11.725 --> 00:41:13.040 align:middle line:90%
want to experience in life.

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:16.280 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, I know
that if I were to transition

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:19.190 align:middle line:84%
into the other realms
in this moment,

00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:22.610 align:middle line:84%
I have really lived
the heck out of life.

00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:28.940 align:middle line:84%
I have lived such
a full rich life.

00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And I just hope that I can be
a living testament of ushering

00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:37.160 align:middle line:84%
people over into a phrase that
I like to teach a lot about,

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:40.490 align:middle line:90%
and that phrase is in relation.

00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And that opens you
up to the web of all

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:47.600 align:middle line:84%
that is and allows you to
not feel embarrassed or feel

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:50.540 align:middle line:84%
like you need to suppress those
shadow aspects of yourself.

00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:54.410 align:middle line:84%
But rather invite them
right in front and start

00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:56.270 align:middle line:84%
to have a dialogue
with them and start

00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:59.660 align:middle line:84%
to get into true,
healthy, full integration

00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:01.760 align:middle line:90%
with the totality of yourself.

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And that opens you up to
trust within yourself,

00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:10.290 align:middle line:84%
which opens you up into getting
into the allness of this Earth

00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:11.090 align:middle line:90%
walk.

00:42:11.090 --> 00:42:14.990 align:middle line:84%
And I can't think of
a greater objective

00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:18.950 align:middle line:84%
than to feel like
you lived as fully as

00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:22.130 align:middle line:84%
possible and in the
greatest degree of integrity

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:24.200 align:middle line:84%
and healthy embodiment
as possible,

00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:25.790 align:middle line:84%
I can't think of
anything better.

00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:27.920 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I
try my best to do.

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:30.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm getting these
spirit guide feelings

00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:32.510 align:middle line:84%
that your first child is
going to be a little boy.

00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:33.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: Aww.

00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:35.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If I'm
right, let me know.

00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:37.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: I will send
you a message, for sure.

00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:39.445 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for tuning into that.

00:42:39.445 --> 00:42:40.612 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's what I feel.

00:42:40.612 --> 00:42:41.810 align:middle line:90%
That's what they're saying.

00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:42.980 align:middle line:90%
You think of flamingos.

00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:43.828 align:middle line:90%
I think of kids.

00:42:43.828 --> 00:42:44.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: We'll take it.

00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:47.255 align:middle line:90%
That's a good, good exchange.

00:42:47.255 --> 00:42:49.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Give me one of
those shamanic chants

00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:50.450 align:middle line:90%
as we wrap things up.

00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:57.490 align:middle line:90%


00:42:57.490 --> 00:42:58.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES: It's words.

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:00.280 align:middle line:90%
It's typically normally sounds.

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:09.510 align:middle line:84%
But it's-- it's words of
(SINGING) allness, unity,

00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:16.040 align:middle line:90%
humanity, sacred practices.

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:26.170 align:middle line:84%
Wholeness, unity,
humanity, sacred ways.

00:43:26.170 --> 00:43:29.000 align:middle line:90%


00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:39.545 align:middle line:90%
Allness, unity, humanity we are.

00:43:39.545 --> 00:43:43.520 align:middle line:90%


00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:45.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Feels
good for the heart.

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:46.900 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:51.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you feel energetic
when I listen to that?

00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:55.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLES: Because it
holds divine truths.

00:43:55.330 --> 00:43:59.050 align:middle line:84%
Especially in this
path of shamanism,

00:43:59.050 --> 00:44:01.120 align:middle line:84%
there are a lot
of misconceptions

00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:03.790 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of confusions
around what it is.

00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And at the foundational
truth of it,

00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:10.090 align:middle line:84%
we all, all living beings,
both in this Earth realm

00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:12.640 align:middle line:84%
and the unseen realms,
we all have a birthright

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:15.610 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to connect
and communicate with honor

00:44:15.610 --> 00:44:16.840 align:middle line:90%
this planet we inhabit.

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And connect and communicate
with honor the unseen realms.

00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:24.670 align:middle line:84%
We all have this birthright
and these are all

00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:26.980 align:middle line:90%
of humanity's sacred practices.

00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:29.890 align:middle line:84%
And that song that
came through held that,

00:44:29.890 --> 00:44:32.500 align:middle line:84%
and of course, there are
really important nuances

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:35.770 align:middle line:84%
that are important to
speak to because shamanism

00:44:35.770 --> 00:44:38.440 align:middle line:84%
is a global practice
and it migrated

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:41.860 align:middle line:90%
its way to every continent.

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:44.350 align:middle line:84%
As it made its migration,
there are of course

00:44:44.350 --> 00:44:49.060 align:middle line:84%
different lineage
ways in shamanism,

00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:52.780 align:middle line:84%
and any time that you
feel the call to learn

00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:56.590 align:middle line:84%
specific rites, and
prayers, and songs

00:44:56.590 --> 00:45:00.940 align:middle line:84%
that adhere, or sometimes
people take a sacred oath

00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:03.730 align:middle line:84%
and adhere to that
shamanic lineage

00:45:03.730 --> 00:45:07.240 align:middle line:84%
and that oath carries them
their whole way through.

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:10.570 align:middle line:90%
And we have to honor that.

00:45:10.570 --> 00:45:14.880 align:middle line:84%
But I think that some
of these misconceptions

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:19.410 align:middle line:84%
make people scared to open
up to these shamanic ways.

00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And so I just want
to express that it's

00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:25.700 align:middle line:84%
all of our birthrights
and it's very simple.

00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:28.670 align:middle line:84%
The ultimate
foundation of shamanism

00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:32.360 align:middle line:84%
is Earth and spirit,
rock and star.

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And yet if you get
pulled or called

00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:41.180 align:middle line:84%
into learning a specific
lineage way and you learn that,

00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:44.100 align:middle line:84%
it boils down to two simple
things, communication

00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:44.900 align:middle line:90%
and honor.

00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:48.110 align:middle line:84%
If there was a prayer or a
song that really spoke to you,

00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:51.350 align:middle line:84%
ask that elder or
teacher if you have

00:45:51.350 --> 00:45:54.470 align:middle line:84%
permission to carry that
prayer or song forward.

00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And always acknowledge where
you learned it with honor.

00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And the last important
thing that I want to say

00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:02.480 align:middle line:84%
is there was a
massive shift that

00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:05.000 align:middle line:84%
started to happen about
10 or 15 years ago.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.470 align:middle line:84%
That's where I was ushered in
to going around New York City

00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:11.420 align:middle line:84%
and helping people in
the concrete jungle

00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:12.620 align:middle line:90%
remember who they are.

00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And there are different
lineages from around the world,

00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:17.960 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the Mamos
who were told to come down

00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:19.910 align:middle line:84%
from the caves in
the Sierra Nevadas

00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:22.490 align:middle line:84%
or the Naba lineage
from the Dogons

00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:24.440 align:middle line:90%
in the West African tradition.

00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:27.960 align:middle line:84%
They were told,
just as I was told,

00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:32.460 align:middle line:84%
to start to share more with the
Western cultures and mainstream

00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:33.270 align:middle line:90%
societies.

00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:36.690 align:middle line:84%
They too were given
similar or same messages.

00:46:36.690 --> 00:46:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say that out of
all the shamanic colleagues

00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:44.460 align:middle line:84%
and friends that I have from
all over the world, we all share

00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:47.160 align:middle line:84%
and hold the same
sentiment, that these are

00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:49.050 align:middle line:90%
humanity's sacred practices.

00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And they're meant for us
all, but of course, they

00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:54.180 align:middle line:84%
need to be worked
with and shared

00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:57.390 align:middle line:84%
with honor, and with
proper due diligence,

00:46:57.390 --> 00:46:59.070 align:middle line:90%
and with respect and reverence.

00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:02.010 align:middle line:84%
But that song I think
why you felt it,

00:47:02.010 --> 00:47:06.480 align:middle line:84%
it's because it holds the real
truths, the real divine truths.

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:10.710 align:middle line:84%
And I want people to feel safe
to explore shamanic ways again.
