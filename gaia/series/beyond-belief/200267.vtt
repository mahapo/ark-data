>>GEORGE NOORY: And
welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.520 align:middle line:90%
George Noory here with you.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.700 align:middle line:84%
Caroline Cory is an
award-winning filmmaker,

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.860 align:middle line:84%
author, and the founder
of the OMnium method.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.060 align:middle line:10%
Now throughout her life,
Caroline has had lots of ESP

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.920 align:middle line:10%
and other worldly contact
experiences, which

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.320 align:middle line:10%
led her to become
deeply concerned

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.360 align:middle line:10%
and connected with spirituality.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.080 align:middle line:84%
Caroline started and now
heads the OMnium Media,

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.450 align:middle line:84%
which is a media
platform company which

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.140 align:middle line:84%
tackles thought-provoking
topics on the human condition

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.970 align:middle line:90%
and the nature of reality.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.770 align:middle line:84%
Caroline, welcome
to Beyond Belief.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.353 align:middle line:84%
>>CAROLINE CORY:
Thanks for having me.

00:01:01.353 --> 00:01:04.069 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Fascinating little
bio that you've got there.

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:05.960 align:middle line:84%
How did you get
involved in this?

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: Well, I actually started
out as a personal experience,

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.360 align:middle line:90%
when I was five years old.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Five?

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yes.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.670 align:middle line:10%
I realized that I could
perceive the subtle energy.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.930 align:middle line:10%
I could see the
energy around people.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.110 align:middle line:84%
I could figure out
and see very clearly

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.160 align:middle line:90%
what was wrong with them.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.320 align:middle line:90%
What they were struggling with.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.990 align:middle line:90%
I could help them heal.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, I got on a
journey of trying to understand

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.270 align:middle line:84%
what it took me to be able to
do that when others couldn't.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Could not.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.030 align:middle line:90%
Was it genetic?

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.370 align:middle line:90%
Did you get it from your family?

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:43.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: I don't think so.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:44.740 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.390 align:middle line:84%
I think I had a
grandmother who--

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.008 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Grandmother
passes it down.

00:01:48.008 --> 00:01:49.300 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Or something like that.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.270 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't just that I
was perceiving the aura.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.690 align:middle line:84%
It's as if I was tapping into
their whole consciousness.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.150 align:middle line:90%
I could see everything.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.740 align:middle line:90%
How they came about.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:00.730 align:middle line:90%
What they were doing.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.310 align:middle line:90%
What their life story was about.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And so because of
that I started to ask

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.979 align:middle line:90%
the question, how does it work?

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And what did my physical
brain do in order

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.330 align:middle line:90%
to tap into that information?

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And so I got on this journey
of consciousness study.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.860 align:middle line:84%
But of course in
college, just to rule out

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.133 align:middle line:90%
that I wasn't totally crazy--

00:02:25.133 --> 00:02:26.425 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They don't teach that.

00:02:26.425 --> 00:02:27.675 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: They don't teach that.

00:02:27.675 --> 00:02:33.400 align:middle line:10%
So I studied
psychology in college.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.200 align:middle line:90%
And by the time--

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a good field.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: Yeah, just
to, first of all,

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.000 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that my mind
was not making stuff up.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.720 align:middle line:84%
Because I was very concerned
that I would put out

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.570 align:middle line:84%
information that was just
subjective and projecting

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:52.370 align:middle line:90%
my own--

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Thoughts.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Whatever, yeah.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.910 align:middle line:90%
Because you can do that.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.550 align:middle line:90%
And so I studied psychology.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.190 align:middle line:84%
By the time I got to
the master's degree,

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.610 align:middle line:84%
I thought, OK, there's
nothing wrong with me here.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm just tapping into other
realities, other information.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.350 align:middle line:90%
And I kept getting validation.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.660 align:middle line:84%
Meaning I would
work with someone.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.170 align:middle line:84%
I would know something
that they never told me.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.660 align:middle line:84%
I would help them heal
something that they

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.970 align:middle line:90%
couldn't heal for 20 years.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:23.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.120 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: So that's validation.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.848 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Over and over and over.

00:03:26.848 --> 00:03:28.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Even one
time is validation.

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Exactly.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And so that gave me
a lot of confidence

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.480 align:middle line:90%
and understanding that--

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.870 align:middle line:84%
I started to figure out what
did I do to get that validation?

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.583 align:middle line:84%
Like, how was my
consciousness working?

00:03:43.583 --> 00:03:44.500 align:middle line:90%
What is the mechanism?

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What put
you in that position.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.660 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Exactly.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.770 align:middle line:84%
And so I ended up developing
a whole methodology

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.610 align:middle line:84%
for energy medicine and
consciousness expansion,

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:01.000 align:middle line:84%
helping other people study
how to tap into the root

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.370 align:middle line:90%
cause of their issue.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And just by reprogramming
their consciousness,

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.770 align:middle line:84%
reprogramming the information
that is in the cell,

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.550 align:middle line:84%
you could literally
instantaneously shift.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:21.620 align:middle line:84%
So I trained people from all
over the world for 15 years.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.520 align:middle line:90%
And it works.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people were
healing things.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We know it works.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:29.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We know it works.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.930 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah.

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.305 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
something called

00:04:31.305 --> 00:04:33.370 align:middle line:84%
parapsychological
phenomena or PSI.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.590 align:middle line:90%
What exactly is that?

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: PSI phenomena refers
to anything that goes beyond

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.320 align:middle line:84%
the physical body, things
that we cannot measure through

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.960 align:middle line:90%
the classical science.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.645 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
telepathy, precognition,

00:04:50.645 --> 00:04:51.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Telekinesis.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.353 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Telekinesis.

00:04:52.353 --> 00:04:53.170 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:54.070 align:middle line:90%
Psychokinesis.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.090 align:middle line:84%
So all of that became
my field of study.

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
explain this stuff?

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: I wanted more than
just the experiential.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.910 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to bring some sort
of scientific validation.

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.460 align:middle line:84%
So I started working
with different scientists

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.010 align:middle line:84%
from physicists
to astrophysicists

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.410 align:middle line:90%
to quantum biologists.

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:15.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
were open to this?

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.140 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: They were very open.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.060 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I attracted
the ones that were open.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.150 align:middle line:84%
But we're talking
about real scientists,

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, from
Stanford to Harvard.

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:25.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:26.750 align:middle line:90%
Good credentials.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:27.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Exactly.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.600 align:middle line:90%
And so we set up experiments.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.900 align:middle line:84%
For example, putting
water and trying

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.890 align:middle line:84%
to influence the pH
of water with the mind

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.190 align:middle line:84%
or the electrical
conductivity with the mind.

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.550 align:middle line:84%
And you know, we're
not the first ones who

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:47.800 align:middle line:90%
have done something like this.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dr. Emoto, the late
Dr. Emoto was very good at that.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Of course.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And William Tiller did
a very famous experiment

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.310 align:middle line:90%
with pH, water pH.

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And we were able to duplicate
that over and over and over.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:08.990 align:middle line:84%
So this tells us that
the mind can literally

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.700 align:middle line:84%
affect the molecular structure
of water or, for example,

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.440 align:middle line:90%
change its pH.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.670 align:middle line:84%
This is how we started to have
scientific validation to what

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:20.750 align:middle line:90%
we call the PSI.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did the
scientists who generally

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.970 align:middle line:84%
would have been pretty skeptical
about this, what did they start

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:27.380 align:middle line:90%
saying to you about this?

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: Well, actually, some of
the results were mind blowing.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it wasn't
that we were changing

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:39.580 align:middle line:84%
the electrical conductivity in
water by a fraction, we were--

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was huge.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: It was huge.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I remember the
first time I worked on this.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:49.380 align:middle line:84%
The electricity went up
400% instantaneously.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: So just
for the folks who

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.370 align:middle line:84%
are listening to this to
understand how it works

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.720 align:middle line:90%
in a scientific experiment.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:02.510 align:middle line:84%
We don't just go in and
start working on the DNA

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:04.610 align:middle line:90%
sample or the water sample.

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.340 align:middle line:90%
We do what we call a baseline.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.600 align:middle line:84%
So we measure the
electrical conductivity

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.000 align:middle line:90%
in water over a period of time.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.800 align:middle line:90%
So we get--

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.342 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's
how you gauge it?

00:07:17.342 --> 00:07:18.560 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Exactly.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.700 align:middle line:84%
So we know exactly
the parameters.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:27.980 align:middle line:84%
And then exactly at the time
that we focus on the target,

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.320 align:middle line:84%
this is where we
see the difference.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And then when we stop
focusing on the target,

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.987 align:middle line:84%
this is where it goes
back to the baseline.

00:07:35.987 --> 00:07:37.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now you've
recently completed

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:40.430 align:middle line:84%
a documentary film on the
topic of mind over matter.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:41.900 align:middle line:90%
It's called "Superhuman."

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.280 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look
at the trailer.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.510 align:middle line:90%


00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:49.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Because the energy
is all around us,

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:52.807 align:middle line:84%
you can communicate with all
types of different things.

00:07:52.807 --> 00:07:55.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what we do here is
collect intelligence against

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:58.453 align:middle line:84%
foreign threats using a
parapsychology discipline

00:07:58.453 --> 00:07:59.370 align:middle line:90%
called remote viewing.

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:02.460 align:middle line:84%
We essentially want to invite
you to become a psychic spy.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:07.380 align:middle line:84%
>> We know our own CIA had been
experimenting in psychic tests

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:08.770 align:middle line:90%
and abilities.

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:11.462 align:middle line:84%
>> The Israelis had an
interest in it and may still.

00:08:11.462 --> 00:08:13.920 align:middle line:84%
We know for a fact that the
Russians were involved in this.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.560 align:middle line:84%
We know for a fact that the
Chinese were and are probably

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.610 align:middle line:90%
still involved.

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:21.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Something's happening
that's bigger than us.

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:22.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my gosh.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.660 align:middle line:90%
This is blowing my mind.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.940 align:middle line:90%
Like this is insane.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:30.850 align:middle line:84%
>> We are pieces of
consciousness playing avatars

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:36.039 align:middle line:84%
in a virtual reality game
called this physical world.

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:40.230 align:middle line:10%
>> This is Captain Corey of
the USS red recorder leaving

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:45.510 align:middle line:10%
a message that may be
detected in other universes.

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:48.460 align:middle line:84%
>> The rain was
tapping on the windows,

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.080 align:middle line:90%
and the wind was banging.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.560 align:middle line:84%
>> So we sort of
come to this world.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And I guess, in our
materialistic sense,

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.150 align:middle line:84%
we want to forget
the vibrations.

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:01.580 align:middle line:84%
We just want to think
of matter and stuff.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:02.990 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a whole unit.

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:04.490 align:middle line:90%
That's a large effect.

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:08.480 align:middle line:84%
The fact that you can change
the acid alkali balance in water

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:12.160 align:middle line:84%
implies that you could
change it in the body.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:17.130 align:middle line:84%
>> This is what this is
about, mind over matter.

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That truly
is remarkable.

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:21.660 align:middle line:84%
You even had Corey Feldman
in there, the actor.

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:22.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yes.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:23.260 align:middle line:90%
So what I--

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:24.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How'd he get in there?

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:27.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: So what I
wanted to do is not

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:32.130 align:middle line:84%
to show only energy
healers or people who

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:33.990 align:middle line:90%
know how to work with energy.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:38.200 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to invite random people
who had never done anything

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.000 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.820 align:middle line:84%
So we worked with people
from all over the world.

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.580 align:middle line:84%
Some were proficient in it,
others never done it before.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:46.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were not.

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:49.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: And I also
wanted to perhaps try

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:53.100 align:middle line:84%
to invite a little bit
of celebrities or people

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:57.760 align:middle line:84%
that we recognize maybe so
people to relate to this topic.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:58.560 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.917 align:middle line:84%
That this is not some
crazy thing out there.

00:10:01.917 --> 00:10:03.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not just
woo woo stuff, right?

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:05.580 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: Exactly,
because that's how

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.235 align:middle line:90%
we're labeled, unfortunately.

00:10:07.235 --> 00:10:08.035 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: True.

00:10:08.035 --> 00:10:10.740 align:middle line:84%
People need to be open to
it for it to work for them.

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:11.610 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't it?

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:13.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yes, absolutely.

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.460 align:middle line:90%
Although, yeah.

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:16.290 align:middle line:84%
I think the most
important thing is--

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:18.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Negative
attitude, it won't work.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.070 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: It just doesn't
work because it's all

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:21.760 align:middle line:90%
about consciousness and energy.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And so if you are putting
your focus on a target

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.995 align:middle line:84%
and at the same time
thinking, I can't do this

00:10:27.995 --> 00:10:31.090 align:middle line:84%
or this will never work,
then it will never work.

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:32.320 align:middle line:90%
So that's the idea.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.170 align:middle line:90%
So you have to be at least open.

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:37.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My late aunt on my
father's side, Dr. Shafica

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:42.780 align:middle line:84%
Karagulla, devoted her entire
psychiatric practice, Caroline,

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:45.510 align:middle line:90%
to investigating the paranormal.

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:48.480 align:middle line:84%
Something had happened in
her life where she said,

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:51.120 align:middle line:84%
there's much more
to the human mind

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.120 align:middle line:90%
than I know as a psychiatrist.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to devote
my practice to that.

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:57.930 align:middle line:84%
So she began to
investigate, wrote

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:00.270 align:middle line:84%
a book called "Breakthrough
to Creativity."

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:04.290 align:middle line:84%
But she began to investigate
telekinesis, telepathy,

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:05.730 align:middle line:90%
intuitiveness.

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And she was convinced
that there's

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:13.450 align:middle line:84%
something about the human trait
that allows us to do this.

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:15.750 align:middle line:84%
She wasn't sure whether
we're born with it

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:19.530 align:middle line:84%
or whether we develop it or
whether we tap into something,

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:21.540 align:middle line:84%
but she was convinced
it was real.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.310 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: It's absolutely real.

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:26.970 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, that was
the point of the movie.

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:30.300 align:middle line:84%
We demonstrated, under
laboratory conditions,

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:34.710 align:middle line:84%
how it's possible to do it and
do it over and over and over.

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:38.010 align:middle line:84%
So this means that it
works, that it is real.

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:39.240 align:middle line:90%
We didn't make this up.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind of
experiments did you do?

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.500 align:middle line:90%
And then what were the results?

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:47.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: So we did an
experiment with water,

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.340 align:middle line:90%
like I said earlier.

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.610 align:middle line:84%
We tried to change the
pH, bring it up or down.

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:52.068 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just by
thinking about it?

00:11:52.068 --> 00:11:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: Just by
thinking about it.

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.620 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there's a
little bit of preparation.

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:59.790 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, I've been training
myself and many other people

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:02.890 align:middle line:84%
to do this, which
is not very easy.

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:07.260 align:middle line:84%
I can teach you to move
an object in two hours.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:11.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just knowing
what type of protocol to do.

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:14.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we do it in
10 minutes on this program?

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:14.520 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: 10 minutes?

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:14.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can I move it?

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:15.150 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: We can.

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:17.067 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can I move
something on this program?

00:12:17.067 --> 00:12:19.053 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: Maybe not like
my chair or something.

00:12:19.053 --> 00:12:21.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm going to lift you
up six inches or something.

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:22.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah, right, levitate.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:23.880 align:middle line:90%
We're working on that.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:28.960 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, seriously, but
so we did work with water.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.170 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why I
wanted to pick this subject

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:36.630 align:middle line:84%
because people know that
acidic water in the body

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:40.300 align:middle line:84%
promotes viruses or illnesses
and things like that.

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:45.600 align:middle line:84%
So when you have an alkaline
environment in your body,

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.660 align:middle line:90%
it's better for healing.

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:47.460 align:middle line:90%
So that's--

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:49.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the one
as strong as the many?

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:53.070 align:middle line:84%
Or is the collective
consciousness of many strong?

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:54.570 align:middle line:90%
Let me give you an example.

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:56.700 align:middle line:84%
On our radio show,
"Coast to Coast,"

00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:00.210 align:middle line:84%
we have done experiments
during hurricanes.

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And they're aimed right
at Florida, for example.

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.070 align:middle line:90%
They're coming right at Florida.

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:08.520 align:middle line:84%
Meteorologists are
saying, it's days away.

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.880 align:middle line:84%
I'll go on the air and tell
our audience of millions

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:15.390 align:middle line:84%
to concentrate on
moving the hurricane.

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:17.680 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you need to be
a little more specific.

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'll set that
example in a second.

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And so this vast audience
of millions of people

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:27.540 align:middle line:84%
will concentrate on
this hurricane that's

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:30.480 align:middle line:84%
barreling down on
Florida, that they say

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.060 align:middle line:90%
is going to be a category 5.

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.190 align:middle line:90%
And all of a sudden, it moves.

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:37.380 align:middle line:10%
It moves off away from Florida.

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:41.644 align:middle line:10%
Unfortunately, it
hit the Bermuda.

00:13:41.644 --> 00:13:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And I guess you have to
really be specific and say,

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:47.497 align:middle line:84%
send it out into the
ocean, make sure it

00:13:47.497 --> 00:13:48.580 align:middle line:90%
doesn't hit anything else.

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:49.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Anything, right.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We didn't do that.

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:52.540 align:middle line:90%
We just said, don't hit Florida.

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:53.340 align:middle line:90%
Move it.

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:55.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, we moved it,
and it hit Bermuda

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.530 align:middle line:84%
with that incredible
hurricane force.

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:00.020 align:middle line:90%
It obliterated the area.

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:00.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Exactly.

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And you actually mentioned
something very important

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:05.470 align:middle line:90%
is the specificity.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:08.670 align:middle line:84%
So when you have many people,
at the same time, focusing

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:13.020 align:middle line:84%
on the same target, each
person has a different way.

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:15.920 align:middle line:84%
For example, one
person is going to say,

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:20.390 align:middle line:84%
I am focusing on making
this piece of paper move

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:21.230 align:middle line:90%
in this direction.

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:23.240 align:middle line:84%
Somebody else could
be saying, well,

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:26.030 align:middle line:84%
it should move any way it wants
to move, as long as it moves.

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:28.160 align:middle line:84%
Somebody else is
going to say, well,

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.685 align:middle line:84%
I needed to-- you
know what I mean?

00:14:29.685 --> 00:14:30.485 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:14:30.485 --> 00:14:33.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: So the
specificity of the intent

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:36.170 align:middle line:90%
needs to be very, very clear.

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:38.210 align:middle line:84%
That's the problem with
working with a group.

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:40.700 align:middle line:84%
You kind of have to go
through this preparation.

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:43.175 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lynne McTaggart
calls it the force,

00:14:43.175 --> 00:14:46.500 align:middle line:84%
that we're tapping into
something that's out there.

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And once you get into
it, once you're on the,

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.060 align:middle line:84%
I call it, the wireless
internet of life.

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:51.860 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yes.

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:54.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Once you tap into it,
you can do incredible things

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.520 align:middle line:90%
with it.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:56.320 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Exactly.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
point of the film.

00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:00.770 align:middle line:84%
I call it source, the
source energy, which

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:02.740 align:middle line:90%
is the source of all of life.

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:05.420 align:middle line:90%
You tap into it, you are it.

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And you bring it through and
you direct it on the target,

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:11.660 align:middle line:90%
whether it be piece of paper.

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:15.290 align:middle line:84%
But of course, the idea
of doing it, practicing

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:18.800 align:middle line:84%
on a piece of paper or on
a toothpick or something

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.930 align:middle line:84%
that we're trying
to move, the idea

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:24.170 align:middle line:84%
is to eventually
focus on your body.

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:27.470 align:middle line:84%
Because if you can do
this on water or on DNA,

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:29.320 align:middle line:84%
it means you can
do it on your body.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:29.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, you
can heal yourself.

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Exactly.

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:33.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know and
do incredible things.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.450 align:middle line:84%
Were the scientists
baffled by this?

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:37.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: They were
blown away because we

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.790 align:middle line:84%
were able to do some experiments
that were never done before.

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:44.840 align:middle line:84%
For example, we did a
telekinesis experiment

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.410 align:middle line:84%
where we were moving
a piece of paper.

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is
that you can tell

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:54.890 align:middle line:84%
when it is moving because
of your consciousness

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:57.860 align:middle line:84%
of your intent because
the behavior of the paper.

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:01.340 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, you create a
baseline for a long time.

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And then exactly when we're
focusing on this piece

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:06.460 align:middle line:90%
of paper, it starts to rotate.

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:07.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:08.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: It rotates.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.190 align:middle line:90%
But then, it stops.

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And then it rotates in
the other direction.

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:13.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who does that?

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:15.050 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Exactly.

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:17.750 align:middle line:84%
So for the folks or
even the scientists

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:19.820 align:middle line:84%
who are looking at
it, wait a minute.

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:23.120 align:middle line:84%
Is that the molecule
in the air doing that?

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:27.080 align:middle line:84%
Is there some sort of
electromagnetism that we're not

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.400 align:middle line:90%
seeing that's doing that?

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:31.880 align:middle line:84%
Is this a temperature
change that is doing that?

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:36.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you see the
behavior of the paper changing

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:40.340 align:middle line:84%
direction, it's hard to
kind of imagine that this

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:42.320 align:middle line:90%
is triggered by anything else.

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
done a pendulum experiment?

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:45.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yes many, many times.

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:46.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That works too.

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:47.140 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah.

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:50.420 align:middle line:84%
But if I may continue
with the telekinesis

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:53.640 align:middle line:84%
because it's
extremely significant.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:57.000 align:middle line:84%
So what we've done
is we said, OK, fine.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.690 align:middle line:84%
We know for a fact that this
is triggered by the intent of--

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:05.310 align:middle line:90%
but by the consciousness itself.

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:09.619 align:middle line:84%
But let's do it under
complete vacuum,

00:17:09.619 --> 00:17:11.839 align:middle line:90%
meaning in a Faraday cage.

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:13.619 align:middle line:84%
When you do it in
a Faraday cage--

00:17:13.619 --> 00:17:15.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which
insulates it, right?

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:16.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Exactly.

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:17.510 align:middle line:90%
There is no electromagnetism.

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:18.980 align:middle line:90%
There is no electricity.

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:20.720 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing going in.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And yet, the piece of paper
behaves exactly the way

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:26.069 align:middle line:90%
you ask it to.

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:29.160 align:middle line:90%
So that was very mind blowing.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:33.120 align:middle line:84%
But then, I also wanted to
take it even to another level.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:33.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh yeah?

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.310 align:middle line:90%
And what was that level?

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:36.540 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: I don't know if--

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:40.140 align:middle line:90%
I have not seen anyone do it.

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:41.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure there are
people doing it.

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:44.950 align:middle line:84%
But we ended up doing
it long distance.

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:46.540 align:middle line:90%
So I was 2,000--

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:47.915 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
been done before.

00:17:47.915 --> 00:17:48.715 align:middle line:90%
It works.

00:17:48.715 --> 00:17:49.673 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Move an object.

00:17:49.673 --> 00:17:50.473 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:50.473 --> 00:17:52.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's been
very intriguing.

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:52.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Exactly.

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:54.270 align:middle line:90%
So I'm in California.

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:57.240 align:middle line:90%
The scientist is in Oregon.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And then again, we
established a baseline.

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And exactly at the time that
I'm focusing on the target,

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.860 align:middle line:90%
it moves.

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:09.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're talking
twice, like 780 degrees.

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:09.810 align:middle line:90%
It stops.

00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:12.610 align:middle line:84%
It rotates in the
other direction.

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:15.960 align:middle line:84%
This was mind blowing
because think about this.

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:21.940 align:middle line:84%
If you can influence an
actual physical object--

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:22.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From afar.

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:25.710 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: --2,000 miles
away, or, actually,

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:29.940 align:middle line:84%
it's 1,000 miles
away, apologies,

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:33.708 align:middle line:84%
what does that tell you if
you can influence an actual--

00:18:33.708 --> 00:18:34.625 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's instant.

00:18:34.625 --> 00:18:36.340 align:middle line:90%
There was this connection.

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:39.750 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at how the DNA
experiment in your documentary

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:42.150 align:middle line:90%
worked out.

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:44.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GLEN REIN: I have a
special device here.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.260 align:middle line:90%
It's called a potentiostat.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:50.140 align:middle line:84%
This allows me to take a measure
of the conductivity of DNA.

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:53.940 align:middle line:84%
So DNA is very sensitive
to human consciousness

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:56.280 align:middle line:90%
from my own previous research.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:00.020 align:middle line:84%
The experiment to see if you
can influence the conductivity.

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:01.510 align:middle line:90%
I need a fresh sample of DNA.

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:03.635 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're going to do
three controls in a row.

00:19:03.635 --> 00:19:04.435 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: OK.

00:19:04.435 --> 00:19:05.790 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to write control here.

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:06.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REIN: the going to be--

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:07.673 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Control one.

00:19:07.673 --> 00:19:08.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REIN: Control one.

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:10.770 align:middle line:84%
So what we're
actually doing now is

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:13.230 align:middle line:84%
we're calculating the
experimental error

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:16.590 align:middle line:84%
by looking at what
happens to the DNA

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:17.970 align:middle line:90%
when there's no intervention.

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:20.720 align:middle line:84%
In this case, we're
doing three controls

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.328 align:middle line:90%
at three different times.

00:19:22.328 --> 00:19:24.370 align:middle line:84%
Then we're going to do it
a fourth time in a row,

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:25.960 align:middle line:84%
and except you're
going to intervene.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:26.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: OK.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:29.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REIN: So we know what
the variation will be.

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And the experimental error,
as I was saying before,

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.070 align:middle line:84%
will be if there's
no intervention.

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: OK.

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:39.670 align:middle line:90%


00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:41.056 align:middle line:90%
>>REIN: 13.2--

00:19:41.056 --> 00:19:41.925 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: 13.2.

00:19:41.925 --> 00:19:42.725 align:middle line:90%
>>REIN: --kiloohms.

00:19:42.725 --> 00:19:43.890 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: That's the control.

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:48.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REIN: Control
number two is 12.9.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: 12.9.

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:51.870 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:58.740 align:middle line:10%
>>REIN: Control
number three, 12.46.

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:01.590 align:middle line:90%
So the average is 12.9.

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:04.300 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: 12.9 kiloohms.

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:07.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REIN: So if you now are able
to, with your consciousness,

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:11.100 align:middle line:84%
resonate with this and either
get it to go up or down,

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:12.617 align:middle line:90%
then we'll--

00:20:12.617 --> 00:20:14.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Caroline, who
was the scientist who

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:17.010 align:middle line:84%
was in that portion of
the clip we just saw?

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:18.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: This is Dr. Glen Rein.

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.740 align:middle line:90%
He's a quantum biologist.

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:24.120 align:middle line:84%
He's been working with water
and DNA for many years now.

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:27.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was he related to J.B.
Rhine from Duke University,

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.042 align:middle line:90%
do you know?

00:20:28.042 --> 00:20:29.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: No, I don't think so.

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:33.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who did experiments in
psychology and the paranormal?

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.210 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: I don't think so.

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:35.280 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:36.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: R-H-I-N-E.

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:36.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah.

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:37.720 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:38.810 align:middle line:90%
It's a different spelling.

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:39.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Different spelling.

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:39.290 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah.

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:40.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:42.900 align:middle line:10%
>>CORY: Well, what I
wanted to mention here,

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:45.600 align:middle line:10%
the reason why I wanted
to do a DNA experiment

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.810 align:middle line:10%
and why the electrical
conductivity in DNA

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:50.460 align:middle line:10%
is so important
because there was

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:54.420 align:middle line:10%
a study done in California
Institute of Technology

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.220 align:middle line:10%
in Pasadena.

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:59.280 align:middle line:84%
They did this study
on the DNA, how

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.740 align:middle line:90%
it was winding and unwinding.

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:05.340 align:middle line:84%
And then they noticed that when
the electrical conductivity was

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:09.180 align:middle line:84%
higher, meaning the
resistance is lower,

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:11.430 align:middle line:84%
then the DNA
behaved differently.

00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:13.110 align:middle line:90%
It changed shape.

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:16.110 align:middle line:84%
And it began, it
started to self repair.

00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:18.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like it had
a mind of its own.

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:19.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Exactly.

00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:22.260 align:middle line:10%
So this is very, very
important because it

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:26.340 align:middle line:10%
means that, if we are increasing
the electrical conductivity

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:30.300 align:middle line:10%
in our DNA, it starts to behave
like the [? thoracic ?] as

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:33.180 align:middle line:10%
opposed to a double helix.

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And it starts to
self heal, which

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:40.140 align:middle line:84%
means that the concept
raise your vibration.

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:43.110 align:middle line:90%
So it's a demonstration.

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:46.620 align:middle line:10%
It's an experiment
in showing how

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:51.150 align:middle line:10%
raising the electricity
that's going in your body,

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:57.925 align:middle line:10%
meaning raising the vibration
in the DNA helps itself repair.

00:21:57.925 --> 00:21:58.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:02.550 align:middle line:84%
Because I think if the human
body has that capability,

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:06.490 align:middle line:84%
it could fight off diseases,
cancer, who knows what.

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:07.290 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Exactly.

00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:08.560 align:middle line:90%
That's the point.

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.340 align:middle line:84%
That's the point of doing
all these experiments.

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:13.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How important is
consciousness to all of this?

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:15.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: Consciousness
is fundamental.

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:18.840 align:middle line:84%
It is your consciousness
that is directing

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.430 align:middle line:90%
your intent on a target.

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:26.040 align:middle line:84%
So if this target is DNA or
water or your physical body,

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:27.780 align:middle line:84%
it is through your
consciousness,

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:29.610 align:middle line:84%
it's because of
your consciousness

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:30.788 align:middle line:90%
that you are healing.

00:22:30.788 --> 00:22:33.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, let's take
a look at more of your results

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:34.288 align:middle line:90%
and some of your films.

00:22:34.288 --> 00:22:49.820 align:middle line:90%


00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:52.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: OK, I think I did it.

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:56.000 align:middle line:10%
It felt like it
responded very quickly.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.450 align:middle line:90%
That's why I kind of stopped.

00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:02.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REIN: OK, so here is the
magic number we're looking for.

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:07.830 align:middle line:90%
And it's way, way down to 6.5.

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:11.860 align:middle line:10%
It's a large, robust
effect demonstrating

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:14.230 align:middle line:10%
that at least your
consciousness is

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:17.920 align:middle line:10%
able to resonate with and
change the electrical properties

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:18.880 align:middle line:10%
of DNA.

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.710 align:middle line:84%
And the implication
for the audience

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:24.350 align:middle line:84%
is that if you can do
it, then we could do it.

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:29.890 align:middle line:84%
And with our own intention,
we can heal our own bodies.

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:32.990 align:middle line:84%
My theory is that you're
just projecting energy.

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:35.400 align:middle line:10%
And whether you project
it into a test tube

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:38.070 align:middle line:10%
or whether you project
it into your own body

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:40.980 align:middle line:10%
or whether you project
it into my body,

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:42.600 align:middle line:10%
it's the same phenomena.

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:46.080 align:middle line:84%
It's just a different
target receiving the energy.

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you went
from 12.9, which

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:51.540 align:middle line:84%
was in the original
documentary clip we saw.

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:54.163 align:middle line:84%
You brought it way
down under six.

00:23:54.163 --> 00:23:55.080 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: In 10 seconds.

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:56.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In 10 seconds.

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:57.957 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: Actually, it was
less than 10 seconds.

00:23:57.957 --> 00:24:01.560 align:middle line:84%
I kept focusing on it because
I felt like I zapped it.

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:04.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What were you
thinking to do that?

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:07.950 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: I just directed
my energy, the way I,

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:10.080 align:middle line:84%
like I said, I trained
myself to do it

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:14.640 align:middle line:84%
and intended to create
a strong effect.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you keep
thinking lower, lower?

00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:18.960 align:middle line:84%
Were you trying to
lower it or raise it?

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.668 align:middle line:84%
Because he said it
would work either way.

00:24:20.668 --> 00:24:22.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: Well, if you
lower the resistance,

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.000 align:middle line:90%
the conductivity is higher.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.740 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of
what I was doing.

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:29.700 align:middle line:84%
So I was raising the
electrical conductivity.

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:30.985 align:middle line:90%
I was lowering the electrical.

00:24:30.985 --> 00:24:31.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Lowering it?

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:32.735 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yes, correct.

00:24:32.735 --> 00:24:35.250 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I
was focusing on.

00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:36.480 align:middle line:90%
But it was more.

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:38.130 align:middle line:84%
When you are doing
these experiments,

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:41.340 align:middle line:84%
you're focused on the
energy that is coming out,

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:43.320 align:middle line:84%
that's being directed
on the target.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:45.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now what would
you say you physically

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:48.690 align:middle line:90%
did to get that to lower?

00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:50.050 align:middle line:90%
What were you shooting at that?

00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:50.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah.

00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:53.610 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, it's
I trained myself

00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:59.970 align:middle line:84%
and many other people, actually,
to be in a specific meditative

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:04.700 align:middle line:84%
alignment, I want to call it,
so that your mind and your body

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:08.190 align:middle line:84%
is perfectly aligned
with a source frequency.

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:10.150 align:middle line:84%
Like you're tapping
into the core--

00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:10.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You are.

00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:14.310 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: --the intelligence
of the universe directly.

00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:16.200 align:middle line:90%
And then that comes through you.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.430 align:middle line:84%
And then you direct
it as you wish.

00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:22.530 align:middle line:84%
So the more aligned you
are, the more trained

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:27.030 align:middle line:84%
you are, the more powerful
and efficient and fast.

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:29.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How important is
it that you can physically

00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:30.430 align:middle line:90%
see what you're doing?

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:33.480 align:middle line:84%
I know you talked earlier
about doing it from afar.

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.970 align:middle line:84%
But do you physically have
to be able to see it too?

00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:37.110 align:middle line:90%
Does that help?

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:38.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: Not me
personally because I've

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:41.670 align:middle line:84%
been doing many things in
person and long distance.

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:44.190 align:middle line:84%
But I noticed that
other people that I've

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:47.760 align:middle line:84%
trained that have been doing
this as well themselves,

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:51.870 align:middle line:84%
they prefer to, at least in the
beginning, to see the target.

00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:55.720 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like perhaps
psychological that it's there.

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:56.850 align:middle line:90%
This is what I'm doing.

00:25:56.850 --> 00:26:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, they
can work their way to--

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:02.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've done some
blindfolded experiments before,

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:03.390 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:05.110 align:middle line:90%
Covered your eyes?

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:09.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: George, the blindfold
perception is crazy.

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.400 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:14.430 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is that
these are children.

00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:15.510 align:middle line:90%
These are adults.

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:17.980 align:middle line:84%
There are people
all over the world.

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:22.530 align:middle line:84%
I found people in the UK,
in Germany, Romania, Russia,

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:27.960 align:middle line:84%
and I know of in Canada,
Mexico, who can do everything

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.210 align:middle line:90%
completely blindfolded.

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And so, to me, that was
the ultimate demonstration

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:40.110 align:middle line:84%
that your consciousness or what
you believe in can literally

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:43.950 align:middle line:84%
supersede your physical body,
your physical perception,

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:45.023 align:middle line:90%
your physical eyes.

00:26:45.023 --> 00:26:46.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
proof right there.

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:47.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Exactly.

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:48.120 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.143 align:middle line:84%
And so again, when
you first look at it,

00:26:50.143 --> 00:26:51.060 align:middle line:90%
you go, wait a minute.

00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:51.970 align:middle line:90%
This is a trick.

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:54.390 align:middle line:90%
There's no way.

00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:56.670 align:middle line:84%
But when you see
what these folks are

00:26:56.670 --> 00:27:00.570 align:middle line:84%
able to do, which
is read perfectly,

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:05.640 align:middle line:84%
work, do all kinds of sports,
go out and drive, and, I mean,

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.510 align:middle line:90%
crazy stuff.

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And so again, in order
to bring some sort

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:14.370 align:middle line:84%
of a scientific
validation, what we've done

00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:20.070 align:middle line:84%
is we put a device inside
the mask to make sure

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:22.590 align:middle line:84%
that there was no
light whatsoever.

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:23.910 align:middle line:90%
And it went down.

00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:26.460 align:middle line:84%
The light photons
went down to whatever

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:29.970 align:middle line:84%
they were to completely
zero, which means

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:32.340 align:middle line:90%
there is no light whatsoever.

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And you know very
well science tells us,

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:39.270 align:middle line:84%
we see because the light
is being reflected.

00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:40.720 align:middle line:90%
No light means--

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:41.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No seeing.

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:42.420 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: No seeing.

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And yet, the brain was behaving
exactly as if there was light.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it the brain,
or is it something outside

00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:51.958 align:middle line:90%
of the brain?

00:27:51.958 --> 00:27:53.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Well, that's the thing.

00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:58.020 align:middle line:84%
It's your consciousness
that is telling your brain

00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:01.920 align:middle line:84%
to pretend that there is
light, that you're not

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.180 align:middle line:90%
wearing anything.

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:06.330 align:middle line:84%
That's what's
extraordinary here.

00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:11.050 align:middle line:84%
The physical brain itself,
on its own, is doesn't--

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:13.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's responding
to your signal.

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:16.227 align:middle line:84%
And your signal comes
from your consciousness.

00:28:16.227 --> 00:28:18.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you call
this remote viewing,

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:19.210 align:middle line:90%
what you're doing?

00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:20.010 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: In a way.

00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:20.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:22.770 align:middle line:84%
Tom Campbell, who's in
my film, by the way,

00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:25.500 align:middle line:84%
he thinks it's a form
of remote viewing.

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:28.250 align:middle line:84%
To me, it's slightly
different or tapping

00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:30.957 align:middle line:84%
into the stream, collective
stream of consciousness.

00:28:30.957 --> 00:28:33.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, there's question
you're tapping into something.

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:34.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yes.

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:34.900 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:39.320 align:middle line:84%
To me, it's basically it's
not seeing is believing.

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:42.020 align:middle line:84%
It's more like
believing is seeing.

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:42.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is seeing.

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:45.710 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: So your consciousness
is telling your brain,

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:48.020 align:middle line:90%
pretend there is no mask.

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:50.030 align:middle line:90%
Pretend there is light.

00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:54.350 align:middle line:84%
Imagine the amount of
conviction or belief

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:57.440 align:middle line:84%
you have to have
in order to change

00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:00.380 align:middle line:84%
the mechanism of
your brain to allow

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:01.970 align:middle line:90%
it to see without your eyes.

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:03.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With this
ability, can you

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:07.190 align:middle line:84%
alter people's
thoughts this way?

00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:12.080 align:middle line:84%
Can you enter someone's brain
or whatever we're dealing with

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:14.150 align:middle line:84%
and get them to
change something?

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:16.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Technically, you can.

00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:20.960 align:middle line:84%
But I want to say that there
is something very important

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.180 align:middle line:90%
that this is a huge topic.

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:24.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad you
asked that question.

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:26.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to try to
keep it very brief.

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:28.620 align:middle line:90%
But technically, you can.

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:31.130 align:middle line:84%
But of course, we
all have free will.

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is
people, we're not trained.

00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:38.780 align:middle line:84%
People don't tell us
how to use our free will

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:41.360 align:middle line:84%
to protect ourselves,
what our consciousness

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.080 align:middle line:90%
is capable of doing.

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:47.810 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes I can see their
energy is completely open.

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And so here comes
a person who knows

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:54.350 align:middle line:84%
how to use all of
these techniques,

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:56.810 align:middle line:84%
and they kind of
can take advantage

00:29:56.810 --> 00:29:59.330 align:middle line:84%
because you are not
protected, because you are not

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:02.240 align:middle line:84%
understanding that
this is possible.

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:05.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've done personal
experiments this way,

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:08.180 align:middle line:84%
where I've concentrated
on individuals

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:10.610 align:middle line:84%
to try to get them to
change their mind thought

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:12.380 align:middle line:90%
or to do something.

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And I got to tell you,
Caroline, it works.

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:15.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yes.

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:18.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've gotten people
who have changed their minds.

00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:22.270 align:middle line:84%
Or in job interviews, I've
concentrated on the person who

00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:24.350 align:middle line:90%
is supposed to do the hiring.

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, they
call you the next day.

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:31.970 align:middle line:84%
It's uncanny at how it works
when you're into that technique

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:33.110 align:middle line:90%
and you believe it.

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.980 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Absolutely.

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:34.780 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:37.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've also
gotten things done.

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:40.410 align:middle line:84%
Usually, it's not having
somebody change their mind.

00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:43.592 align:middle line:84%
It's more changing
the perception that--

00:30:43.592 --> 00:30:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or making
them more aware.

00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:45.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah, exactly.

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:47.360 align:middle line:84%
It's more opening
their awareness.

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:50.690 align:middle line:84%
Or sometimes when there's a lot
of red tape for something super

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:55.130 align:middle line:84%
silly, like, I don't know,
paperwork and things like that,

00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:56.880 align:middle line:90%
that is just ridiculous.

00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:58.910 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes you can
just put it out there,

00:30:58.910 --> 00:31:01.200 align:middle line:84%
just to make it effortless,
to make it easy.

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:02.432 align:middle line:90%
And somehow, it works.

00:31:02.432 --> 00:31:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
you think it works?

00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:05.450 align:middle line:90%
What makes it work?

00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:07.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: There's several
things going on.

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:10.400 align:middle line:84%
The consciousness, like
I said, has the ability

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:13.520 align:middle line:90%
to project information.

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.500 align:middle line:84%
See, it's all we're
all information.

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:17.210 align:middle line:90%
Your DNA is information.

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:22.160 align:middle line:84%
Your DNA tells your body
how to look, how to behave,

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.670 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:27.290 align:middle line:84%
So you are consciousness
and information.

00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And we all are within a larger
consciousness and a larger

00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:34.430 align:middle line:90%
information stream.

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:37.550 align:middle line:84%
So all that it
takes is that if you

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:44.810 align:middle line:84%
know how to align your
consciousness with the larger

00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:50.060 align:middle line:84%
consciousness stream, you can
pretty much move things around

00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:53.450 align:middle line:84%
because your free will,
so to speak, your focus,

00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:56.090 align:middle line:90%
your intent is very directed.

00:31:56.090 --> 00:32:01.020 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it's you are
asking for something to happen.

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And you're tapping
into a potential.

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:06.860 align:middle line:84%
So the potential is waiting
for you to tell it what to do.

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:09.830 align:middle line:84%
You know how people
say, ask the universe,

00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:11.080 align:middle line:90%
and the universe will respond?

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:12.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just put
in the universe.

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:12.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah.

00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:13.323 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:32:13.323 --> 00:32:15.890 align:middle line:10%
But actually,
there's it's actually

00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:20.780 align:middle line:10%
a mechanism that the
consciousness can, in fact, tap

00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:25.200 align:middle line:10%
into this database,
so to speak, and shift

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:27.140 align:middle line:10%
it this way or that way.

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I was
trying to do in the film,

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:34.790 align:middle line:84%
to demonstrate and
scientifically show

00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:36.860 align:middle line:90%
that this works.

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:39.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who's more adept at
this, Caroline, a man, a woman,

00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:41.445 align:middle line:90%
a child?

00:32:41.445 --> 00:32:42.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: Well, for
certain things,

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:47.550 align:middle line:84%
I want to say children can learn
certain things much easier,

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:50.365 align:middle line:84%
for example, especially with
the blindfold perception.

00:32:50.365 --> 00:32:51.990 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, you
highlighted children

00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:53.470 align:middle line:10%
in your documentary,
"Superhuman."

00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:54.270 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yes, yes.

00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:58.330 align:middle line:90%


00:32:58.330 --> 00:33:00.850 align:middle line:84%
Our first stop is
in the UK, where

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:04.930 align:middle line:84%
we encounter children who are
using blindfolds to access

00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:08.590 align:middle line:90%
their superhuman abilities.

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:11.080 align:middle line:90%
We're going to play some games.

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:13.720 align:middle line:84%
Put your blindfolds
on for me, please.

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:16.110 align:middle line:90%
Ready?

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:20.370 align:middle line:84%
Justin, tell me
what's on this card.

00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:22.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Tea cup.

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:25.930 align:middle line:10%
>>CORY: And now tell
me what's on this card.

00:33:25.930 --> 00:33:27.120 align:middle line:10%
>> Tiger.

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:30.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: Isabella, what is the
shape and color of this stone?

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Kind of like a circle.

00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:35.340 align:middle line:84%
And I don't-- it's not really--
it's kind of like see through.

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:37.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: Here is
yet another example

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:39.050 align:middle line:84%
of how consciousness
can interact

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:42.020 align:middle line:84%
with the physical world
beyond what science

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:44.120 align:middle line:90%
claims to be possible.

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:46.570 align:middle line:84%
Now you're going to
read a line each.

00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:50.430 align:middle line:84%
>> The other dragons were purple
with smooth, shiny scales.

00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:56.310 align:middle line:84%
But Marmaduke was faded
orange with sticky-out scales.

00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:57.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Excellent.

00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:57.910 align:middle line:90%
Good girl.

00:33:57.910 --> 00:34:00.680 align:middle line:10%
>>CLAIRE MOLONEY: It's
like witnessing a miracle.

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:03.400 align:middle line:10%
It's really it's just
beautiful to watch.

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:07.130 align:middle line:84%
>> George was enjoying a quiet
evening in the Heavenly Hippos

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:08.794 align:middle line:90%
Wildlife Park.

00:34:08.794 --> 00:34:12.929 align:middle line:84%
But suddenly, he spotted a
group of animals creeping past.

00:34:12.929 --> 00:34:14.840 align:middle line:10%
>>PETE THOMPSON: The
first time I actually

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:18.130 align:middle line:10%
saw it for myself when I
come to do my training,

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:20.150 align:middle line:10%
the only word I can
think of is emotional.

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:21.890 align:middle line:90%
It was very emotional.

00:34:21.890 --> 00:34:23.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Pitter-patter.

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:26.580 align:middle line:84%
The rain was tapping
at the windows.

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:28.840 align:middle line:90%
And the wind was banging.

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:32.449 align:middle line:10%
>>ANGELA ANDRADE: When my son
started to read and I saw him

00:34:32.449 --> 00:34:33.540 align:middle line:10%
reading--

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:36.940 align:middle line:10%
>> Our day out is ruined.

00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:38.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDRADE: They kind of shine.

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:41.366 align:middle line:90%
It's just amazing.

00:34:41.366 --> 00:34:42.949 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
telling me, Caroline,

00:34:42.949 --> 00:34:45.210 align:middle line:84%
that those children were
reading those books?

00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:46.010 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: They were.

00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:47.427 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
couldn't see it?

00:34:47.427 --> 00:34:48.590 align:middle line:90%
They were blindfolded.

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:49.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Exactly.

00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:51.409 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Had they
seen it before?

00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:53.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, did they have
these things memorized?

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:54.310 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: No.

00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:57.035 align:middle line:84%
I don't think so because we
kept changing the different--

00:34:57.035 --> 00:34:58.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's remarkable.

00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:58.970 align:middle line:10%
>>CORY: Exactly.

00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:04.580 align:middle line:10%
And also, to prove that
they didn't memorize it

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:06.860 align:middle line:10%
or they didn't know
what they were reading,

00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:10.190 align:middle line:10%
I actually would write
something on a piece of paper.

00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:13.950 align:middle line:84%
So they didn't even
know what was coming.

00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And then I would show them a
piece of paper from far away.

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:18.770 align:middle line:90%
So they had no idea.

00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:20.523 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't have
prepared for it.

00:35:20.523 --> 00:35:22.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm going to do a
quick mind experiment with you.

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:24.062 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: OK.

00:35:24.062 --> 00:35:25.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And close your eyes.

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:25.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: OK.

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:26.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And mine
are closed too.

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:27.550 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: OK.

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:29.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I'm
going to send you,

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:31.990 align:middle line:90%
between one and five, a number.

00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:32.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: OK.

00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:33.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I
want you to tell me

00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:36.080 align:middle line:84%
what that first number
is the moment I tell you

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:37.100 align:middle line:90%
I have sent it.

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:37.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: OK.

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:41.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So kind of keep your
brain clean like a chalkboard

00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:42.430 align:middle line:90%
with nothing written on it.

00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:43.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: OK.

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:46.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm going to hold
up my fingers to the camera,

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:50.540 align:middle line:84%
so everybody can see the
number I'm about to send you.

00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:51.830 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:35:51.830 --> 00:35:53.390 align:middle line:90%
And now get ready.

00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:55.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm sending you the number.

00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:57.780 align:middle line:90%
It's sent.

00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:59.090 align:middle line:90%
What number did I send you?

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:02.650 align:middle line:90%


00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:03.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: I don't know.

00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:06.080 align:middle line:84%
I feel like it's a four,
a three or four, yeah.

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:06.880 align:middle line:90%
I could see like--

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:07.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Open your eyes.

00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:08.520 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Because you know what?

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:11.350 align:middle line:84%
From my angle, I couldn't
see the other finger.

00:36:11.350 --> 00:36:12.505 align:middle line:90%
It was three or four.

00:36:12.505 --> 00:36:12.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:14.487 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you
basically with your eyes

00:36:14.487 --> 00:36:18.147 align:middle line:84%
closed concentrated on
my hands out there to see

00:36:18.147 --> 00:36:19.230 align:middle line:90%
how many I was holding up?

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:19.640 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah.

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:21.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
pretty remarkable.

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:22.038 align:middle line:90%
You said three or four.

00:36:22.038 --> 00:36:22.838 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah.

00:36:22.838 --> 00:36:24.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, because
you're also, the way

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:26.380 align:middle line:84%
you were holding your
hand from my angle,

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:28.650 align:middle line:84%
I actually saw, it
was kind of like that.

00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:31.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the percent
of getting it right is 20%.

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:32.430 align:middle line:90%
One out of five.

00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:32.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Is it?

00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:33.650 align:middle line:90%
Oh, there you go.

00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:35.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I
would say I'm going

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:36.988 align:middle line:90%
to give you a hit on that.

00:36:36.988 --> 00:36:38.155 align:middle line:90%
That's my little experiment.

00:36:38.155 --> 00:36:39.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: OK, that's great.

00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:40.303 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Scientific?

00:36:40.303 --> 00:36:42.490 align:middle line:84%
What would the scientists
say about that?

00:36:42.490 --> 00:36:44.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: Oh, in this case,
they would probably say it

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:46.300 align:middle line:90%
was 50-50 chance.

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:47.934 align:middle line:90%
Well, no, actually, no, no.

00:36:47.934 --> 00:36:47.976 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:36:47.976 --> 00:36:48.090 align:middle line:90%
You have five possibilities.

00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:48.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Because one to five.

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:49.030 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:49.480 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:50.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a 20% chance.

00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:50.970 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah.

00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:51.940 align:middle line:90%
Maybe a fluke.

00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:53.020 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:55.730 align:middle line:84%
But the idea, the scientists
will say, can you repeat it,

00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:57.260 align:middle line:90%
or can other people do it?

00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:59.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's how it
gets very rigorous.

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
tried to do in the film

00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:06.260 align:middle line:84%
was to show that there
was no other influence.

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:07.600 align:middle line:90%
There was not a fluke.

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:10.560 align:middle line:84%
It was-- and also, I
started with these children.

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And like I said earlier,
we found adults.

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:14.260 align:middle line:90%
We found--

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:15.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I
was going to say,

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:16.550 align:middle line:84%
would adults be
able to do that too?

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:17.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yes.

00:37:17.350 --> 00:37:18.150 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:20.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, so adults,
some of them read.

00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:22.750 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of them
do other things.

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:29.290 align:middle line:84%
So for example, we have in the
film, people going into a store

00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:33.088 align:middle line:84%
and picking out things from
a shelf knowing exactly.

00:37:33.088 --> 00:37:34.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've been
to a supermarket.

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:36.590 align:middle line:84%
You know what a
shelf looks like.

00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And so to pick the one thing
that you're looking for,

00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:42.260 align:middle line:84%
it's pretty remarkable,
completely blindfolded.

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:45.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what would
you say about the children?

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:47.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: So the children
are just more open.

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:51.070 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like they haven't
been programmed enough

00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:52.850 align:middle line:90%
that, you can't do it.

00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:53.770 align:middle line:90%
This is impossible.

00:37:53.770 --> 00:37:55.400 align:middle line:90%
This is crazy.

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:57.340 align:middle line:90%
So I've seen them prepare.

00:37:57.340 --> 00:38:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And I also work with children
actually doing this technique.

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:05.320 align:middle line:84%
The first day,
when you tell them,

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:09.730 align:middle line:84%
especially color, identifying
color, and they can just do it.

00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:13.360 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like you just
tell them what to focus on

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:14.440 align:middle line:90%
and let go.

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:15.790 align:middle line:90%
And they just do it.

00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:18.700 align:middle line:84%
But adults, it's like,
is this going to work?

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:20.210 align:middle line:90%
I don't think I can do this.

00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:21.130 align:middle line:90%
How does it work?

00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:23.170 align:middle line:90%
You know, all this mind chatter.

00:38:23.170 --> 00:38:25.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How can we
use this ability,

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:29.180 align:middle line:84%
this incredible ability
in our day-to-day lives?

00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:31.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: Well, see,
something happens

00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:34.870 align:middle line:90%
when you try to do something.

00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And I also noticed
a big difference.

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:41.990 align:middle line:84%
When I'm working with water
or DNA, as you saw earlier,

00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:44.320 align:middle line:90%
the DNA responds so quickly.

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.490 align:middle line:90%
The water also the same way.

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:49.300 align:middle line:84%
But when I'm working
on trying to shift

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:51.895 align:middle line:84%
an electronic device or an
electrical device, the device--

00:38:51.895 --> 00:38:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A little
more difficult.

00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:56.140 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: It behaves differently.

00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:59.410 align:middle line:84%
But then it's
almost like you feel

00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:01.420 align:middle line:90%
how it's responding to you.

00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And then by the time you
get to a piece of paper,

00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:06.130 align:middle line:84%
a piece of foil,
or piece of wood

00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:08.310 align:middle line:84%
that you're trying
to move, that's

00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:12.610 align:middle line:84%
a completely different
feeling or experiment.

00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens is that as
you are doing this training,

00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:19.150 align:middle line:84%
in fact, that's the
reason why we are training

00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:21.910 align:middle line:84%
people and doing
workshops, it's kind of you

00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:25.930 align:middle line:84%
learn how you are where
you're getting stuck.

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:28.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do people get better
and better the more they do it?

00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:30.190 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Absolutely.

00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And so for example, I
could tell that when

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:37.920 align:middle line:84%
I was working with water, I
was focusing a certain way.

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:40.830 align:middle line:84%
But then when I was working
with a piece of paper,

00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:46.120 align:middle line:84%
I had to focus in a certain way
but then completely pull back

00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:48.410 align:middle line:84%
and let go, which
is very different.

00:39:48.410 --> 00:39:51.970 align:middle line:84%
So the piece of paper, as
if it had an ego, you know?

00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:54.200 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I think
about it this way,

00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:56.110 align:middle line:90%
as if it had a mind of its own.

00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:57.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe it was your mind
that you were transferring.

00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:58.627 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah, exactly.

00:39:58.627 --> 00:40:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And then it would not do
specifically certain things

00:40:03.010 --> 00:40:04.780 align:middle line:84%
sometimes, other
times, you know?

00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:08.440 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm trying
to say is as you do,

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:13.190 align:middle line:84%
you go through this training,
you learn a lot about yourself.

00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:14.740 align:middle line:90%
What's coming up for you?

00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:15.950 align:middle line:90%
What are the beliefs?

00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:17.410 align:middle line:90%
What are the blocks?

00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And so because of that,
it's extremely empowering.

00:40:21.730 --> 00:40:24.130 align:middle line:84%
So you begin to,
in the training,

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:28.570 align:middle line:84%
we train people to let
go of what's coming up.

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:32.470 align:middle line:84%
Make sure you're focused very
clearly, all the mind chatter.

00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:34.360 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very empowering.

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:37.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can this
be used for evil?

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:38.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Of course.

00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:39.670 align:middle line:90%
Anything can be used for evil.

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:41.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Darn.

00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:42.983 align:middle line:84%
We want righteousness
and goodness.

00:40:42.983 --> 00:40:43.783 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yes.

00:40:43.783 --> 00:40:46.490 align:middle line:84%
But honestly, like I
said, part of the training

00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:49.760 align:middle line:84%
also is to understand
how consciousness works.

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And if you understand that
your consciousness allows

00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:56.870 align:middle line:84%
you to always be protected,
then that's what you do.

00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:58.435 align:middle line:90%
You get up in the morning.

00:40:58.435 --> 00:40:59.310 align:middle line:90%
You brush your teeth.

00:40:59.310 --> 00:41:01.370 align:middle line:84%
You take a shower
every day, right?

00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:05.270 align:middle line:84%
So there's something
called energetic cleanse,

00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:07.880 align:middle line:90%
an energetic preparation.

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:10.377 align:middle line:90%


00:41:10.377 --> 00:41:11.210 align:middle line:90%
I had a word for it.

00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:12.180 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:13.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And work is ongoing.

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:16.760 align:middle line:84%
So how can people get more
information about what you do?

00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:20.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: So the consciousness
work and the energy medicine

00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:22.512 align:middle line:84%
work is on my website,
carolinecory.com.

00:41:22.512 --> 00:41:23.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Spell it out for us.

00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:28.370 align:middle line:10%
>>CORY: Caroline Cory,
it's C-A-R-O-L-I-N-E, Cory,

00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:29.820 align:middle line:10%
C-O-R-Y dot com.

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:30.620 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:32.470 align:middle line:10%
>>CORY: But then for
the film, because this

00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:35.660 align:middle line:10%
is a whole new field
of mind over matter,

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:39.020 align:middle line:10%
it's superhumamfilm.com.

00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:41.840 align:middle line:10%
And when people go there,
they will see the information

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:44.720 align:middle line:10%
on the workshops
that are specifically

00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:46.230 align:middle line:10%
on those techniques.

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:47.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Perfect.

00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:48.950 align:middle line:84%
Caroline, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:49.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: Thank you so
much for having me.

00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:51.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating process.

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that
science is backing it up

00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:55.880 align:middle line:84%
makes it even more
dramatic, I think.

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:58.340 align:middle line:10%
>>CORY: I think that's why
I'm so excited about this

00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:00.350 align:middle line:10%
because we've been
talking about it.

00:42:00.350 --> 00:42:01.460 align:middle line:10%
Your mind does this.

00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:02.480 align:middle line:10%
Your mind does that.

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:03.890 align:middle line:10%
Positive thinking.

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:07.790 align:middle line:84%
But we haven't really been able
to put it all under one roof,

00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:11.300 align:middle line:84%
to demonstrate it, to
prove it, to show it,

00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:14.880 align:middle line:84%
so that people can be empowered
and realize, this is real.

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:16.320 align:middle line:90%
This is not just talk.

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:17.410 align:middle line:90%
This really happens.

00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:18.243 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:42:18.243 --> 00:42:20.510 align:middle line:10%
And I was going to
transfer to you a mindset

00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:22.910 align:middle line:10%
to watch "Beyond
Belief" all the time.

00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:23.840 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:25.010 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to do that.

00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:26.330 align:middle line:90%
You already do.

00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:29.050 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:42:29.050 --> 00:42:35.000 align:middle line:90%
