>>SHEILA GILLETTE: I had a
near-death experience in 1969

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.920 align:middle line:90%
after the birth of a child.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.020 align:middle line:90%
There was this bright light.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.890 align:middle line:84%
And I saw movement
at the end of my bed.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And when I looked, Jesus was
standing at the end of my bed.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Oh my,
not a hallucination?

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.950 align:middle line:84%
Do we all enter the fifth
dimension at some time?

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.659 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: We're all in it now.

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:36.680 align:middle line:84%
They identify as
Theo as a group.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And they're teachers
and overseers.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.900 align:middle line:90%
They will answer you directly.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.648 align:middle line:90%
You can ask Theo the question.

00:00:43.648 --> 00:00:44.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Anything I want.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.280 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Anything you want.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.140 align:middle line:90%
It is the beginning, is it not?

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.840 align:middle line:90%


00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.590 align:middle line:84%

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.260 align:middle line:90%
Sheila, welcome to the program.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.420 align:middle line:10%
>>GILLETTE: George, it's
so nice to be here and be

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.420 align:middle line:10%
with you, to all your
listeners and watchers.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How old were
you when you started

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.170 align:middle line:90%
the channeling of archangels?

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.342 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: I was 24.

00:01:23.342 --> 00:01:24.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened?

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.330 align:middle line:90%
What was the episode?

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: I had a
near-death experience in 1969

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.030 align:middle line:90%
after the birth of a child.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.715 align:middle line:90%
And I had pulmonary embolisms.

00:01:32.715 --> 00:01:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my gosh.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And both my
lungs were nonfunctional.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On the birth table,
this all happened to you?

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.980 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: No, it
happened after the birth.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:41.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my God.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And so
what pulmonary embolism

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.560 align:middle line:84%
is they're blood clots
that go into your lungs

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.688 align:middle line:84%
and break the blood
vessels in your lungs.

00:01:48.688 --> 00:01:49.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can die from that.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.430 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: You die from that.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.530 align:middle line:84%
So I felt both my lungs
were full of fluid,

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.740 align:middle line:84%
and I felt as if I had an
elephant sitting on my chest.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:00.840 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't breathe.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.750 align:middle line:10%
>>GILLETTE: And my
family was being prepared

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.430 align:middle line:10%
for my death in that day.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.780 align:middle line:90%
And so I was in intensive care.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.580 align:middle line:84%
And I had two
little kids at home,

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.290 align:middle line:84%
and I had a brand
new baby, and I

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.840 align:middle line:90%
said, hey, God, give me a job.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.670 align:middle line:90%
I'll do anything.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Please, God.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:19.050 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Please.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And I wanted to be
on the planet for my children.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.690 align:middle line:90%
And I just-- that was my mantra.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.540 align:middle line:84%
And the nurses would come in and
say, you have to go to sleep.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.230 align:middle line:84%
But if I knew I
would close my eyes,

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.730 align:middle line:90%
I would never open them again.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you
scared to go to sleep?

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.015 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: I was fighting
really hard to stay alive.

00:02:38.015 --> 00:02:39.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't blame you.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.920 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And so in
a moment, the room,

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.380 align:middle line:84%
the little cubicle
in intensive care

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.800 align:middle line:84%
became extremely bright
as if the sun had

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.050 align:middle line:84%
risen in the room itself,
and I saw movement

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.190 align:middle line:90%
at the end of my bed.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And when I looked, Jesus was
standing at the end of my bed.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh my, not
a hallucination?

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.860 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: No, it was--

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.670 align:middle line:90%
people call them apparitions.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:07.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: But he was
standing at the end of my bed.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.340 align:middle line:84%
And he had like a cloak
on with big, open sleeves.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.670 align:middle line:84%
But I was mesmerized
by his eyes.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.510 align:middle line:84%
He had the most
beautiful hazel eyes.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And I thought-- a funny
thought that I had was

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.290 align:middle line:90%
his hair was about this length.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And I thought all
the pictures I had seen were

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.100 align:middle line:90%
blonde-eyed--

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.810 align:middle line:84%
blue-eyed, blonde Jesuses
in church statues and things

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.110 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.430 align:middle line:84%
And then I would see the
auburn hair ones as well.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.110 align:middle line:84%
But it was-- his
hair was auburn.

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did he have
a halo around it?

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:45.510 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: No.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.455 align:middle line:84%
But there was this
bright light and--

00:03:48.455 --> 00:03:49.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which
was bright enough.

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.455 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Yeah, it
was bright enough.

00:03:51.455 --> 00:03:57.390 align:middle line:84%
But the presence and
his eyes were so kind.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And then he took his arms
and he went like this under

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.860 align:middle line:84%
the sleeves, and when
he did that, I heard,

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.130 align:middle line:84%
in my inner mind hearing as
we hear our own thoughts--

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.360 align:middle line:84%
not externally as
you're hearing me--

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: --I
heard a male voice,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.310 align:middle line:84%
distinct male voice say
to me, remember, my child,

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.450 align:middle line:90%
you're loved.

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.340 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, I felt as
if my crown had opened up.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And I likened it
to warm honey being

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.420 align:middle line:84%
poured in because this
warmth started seeping down

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:33.810 align:middle line:90%
inside my body.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.770 align:middle line:84%
I could feel this
enormous warmth.

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And as it went through
the trunk of my body,

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.500 align:middle line:84%
I felt as if I could
take a deep breath.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And it could have happened
in hours or moments.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.930 align:middle line:84%
It's as fresh to me in my
mind as when it happened.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: After this
apparition occurred,

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.570 align:middle line:84%
when was the connection
with the archangels?

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:59.980 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: I was
in the hospital

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.630 align:middle line:90%
then and started getting better.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.660 align:middle line:90%
My doctors were amazed.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And I was in the
hospital for a month.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.670 align:middle line:84%
And about six months after
I was out of the hospital,

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:15.580 align:middle line:84%
I started having all
kinds of psychic phenomena

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.220 align:middle line:84%
happening to me
internally, externally.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I see.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: I
could hear messages

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.330 align:middle line:84%
as I heard Jesus's voice
in the hospital that day.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.840 align:middle line:90%
And I had phenomena happening.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.390 align:middle line:84%
I had my bed levitate in the
middle of the night one night.

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And if spirit or the angels
wanted to talk to me,

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.220 align:middle line:84%
the chair in which
I would be sitting

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.750 align:middle line:84%
would physically be
shaking and moving.

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:43.550 align:middle line:90%
So I had--

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:44.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You could feel it.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:45.650 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Oh, absolutely.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.170 align:middle line:90%
It was very visible, too.

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:51.980 align:middle line:84%
And then I could do
automatic writing

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:56.150 align:middle line:84%
where if I held the pen,
it would write messages.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And I could do telekinesis
where you could move objects

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.920 align:middle line:90%
with your mind.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:04.837 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right, right.

00:06:04.837 --> 00:06:09.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And so I did that
because I was experimenting

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.527 align:middle line:84%
with all this to
make sure that--

00:06:11.527 --> 00:06:12.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This was novel for you.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: --this
was a real thing.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.580 align:middle line:90%
Well, you can think 1969--

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:17.540 align:middle line:90%
think back.

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.011 align:middle line:84%
So much was going on
in the world then.

00:06:20.011 --> 00:06:20.844 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my gosh.

00:06:20.844 --> 00:06:20.930 align:middle line:90%
It never stops.

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.280 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: But this isn't--

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.460 align:middle line:84%
these topics that
you and I discuss

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:30.100 align:middle line:84%
weren't even topics that
we would talk about openly.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.300 align:middle line:90%
Some people would--

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:31.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was very private.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:32.630 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: It was so private.

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:32.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very private.

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Because
there was so much fear.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.960 align:middle line:84%
I didn't go into
social situations,

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.860 align:middle line:84%
for example, and say,
guess what I can do?

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.830 align:middle line:84%
Because people would
have been afraid of me.

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.160 align:middle line:90%
And so this developed.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:53.350 align:middle line:84%
I was invited to come
and speak to scientists

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.810 align:middle line:84%
and be tested for
my psychic ability.

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which was getting
better and better and better,

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:59.290 align:middle line:90%
I assume.

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:01.120 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: It was.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.680 align:middle line:84%
But I was considered a
direct voice trance medium.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.130 align:middle line:84%
The word channeling
wasn't even used then

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:14.520 align:middle line:84%
because I was laying down
just like Edgar Cayce, and I--

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you alert?

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.023 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: I would
be totally not alert.

00:07:18.023 --> 00:07:18.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You were out.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: I was
in a trance state,

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:24.820 align:middle line:84%
and this voice would
speak through me.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.990 align:middle line:84%
But over time now,
it's developed to today

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:34.720 align:middle line:84%
where I stand and they walk me,
and they speak and eyes open,

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.420 align:middle line:84%
but then eyes
closed, totally out.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:41.170 align:middle line:84%
But what was good
about that is that I

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:45.830 align:middle line:90%
was so analytical and curious.

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:49.310 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to be sure
that the messages weren't

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:52.965 align:middle line:84%
being infiltrated
by my consciousness.

00:07:52.965 --> 00:07:53.765 align:middle line:90%
That it was pure.

00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:55.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That you were
inputting as opposed to--

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:56.570 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Exactly.

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:59.295 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But at that point, did
you were dealing with angels?

00:07:59.295 --> 00:07:59.740 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:00.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You did.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:01.075 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:08:01.075 --> 00:08:01.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.780 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: I was told--

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:03.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 12?

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:04.910 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: --by them.

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:11.000 align:middle line:84%
The first spokesman was one
called Aulus and said that--

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to say he for lack
of a better terminology--

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.750 align:middle line:84%
was there to prepare my
body for higher teachers

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.875 align:middle line:84%
because it's such an
energetic exchange.

00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:22.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They had
a plan for you.

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:22.730 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: They did.

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:24.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They probably still do.

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:24.720 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yeah.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.262 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want you
to look at a clip

00:08:26.262 --> 00:08:28.640 align:middle line:84%
from Gaia's program,
"Initiation."

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:33.409 align:middle line:84%
Matias de Stefano talks
about the fifth dimension.

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:37.010 align:middle line:84%
After we see this, explain to
us why that fifth dimension

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:38.039 align:middle line:90%
is so important.

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:38.920 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: OK.

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:39.720 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:45.380 align:middle line:10%
- The fifth dimension is
born in the same moment

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.050 align:middle line:10%
that the first
dimension was born.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:51.770 align:middle line:84%
The first dimension
was born from the idea

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:54.980 align:middle line:84%
that this being
has about itself.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:59.330 align:middle line:84%
But this idea has
love to be expressed,

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:04.250 align:middle line:84%
has wisdom to understand
who it is, who it was,

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:09.140 align:middle line:84%
and who it will be, and has
will to move and create,

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:13.970 align:middle line:84%
and also have this
idea of living

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:17.630 align:middle line:84%
a process of four
statements that we

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:21.680 align:middle line:84%
call, in the whole
role, like evolution.

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And once you accomplish
the evolution

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:29.240 align:middle line:84%
of every stages of the
universe, you are a co-creator.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:34.640 align:middle line:84%
You are able to become not
only a creation but also

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.440 align:middle line:90%
a creator itself.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.890 align:middle line:84%
The fifth dimension
is the one where

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:44.390 align:middle line:84%
the wise ones, those
who has accomplished

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:46.280 align:middle line:84%
the experience of
the third dimension,

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.890 align:middle line:84%
can watch the
expression, can watch

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:53.330 align:middle line:84%
the whole process of the fourth
dimension and understand why,

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.700 align:middle line:90%
what's the purpose of it.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.747 align:middle line:84%
That's why there's
a lot of people

00:09:57.747 --> 00:09:59.330 align:middle line:84%
that says that in
the fifth dimension,

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:03.260 align:middle line:84%
we have the masters, the guides,
the people and beings who

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:07.280 align:middle line:84%
are heading us in our
mission, who are leading us

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:14.810 align:middle line:84%
in our purpose on life, and
are those who speak to our ears

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:18.690 align:middle line:84%
and say what is good, what is
bad, where to go or not to go,

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:20.120 align:middle line:90%
what to do, what not to do.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.430 align:middle line:84%
Those people that
hear themselves

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:24.290 align:middle line:84%
in the fifth
dimension are the ones

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:27.560 align:middle line:84%
that channel the
information from the whole,

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.410 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that have
the whole picture.

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:33.380 align:middle line:84%
Fifth dimension is
related to the third one

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:36.050 align:middle line:84%
because fifth dimension
is the one that

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:38.540 align:middle line:84%
helps us to understand
the process we

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.060 align:middle line:84%
live in the third and
the fourth dimension.

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:44.030 align:middle line:84%
That's why the beings
in the fifth dimension

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:46.310 align:middle line:90%
guide us in the third dimension.

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And as we do our lives and
as we express our realities

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:55.760 align:middle line:84%
in the third dimension as
human beings, or plants,

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.630 align:middle line:84%
or as animals,
minerals, whatever,

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:03.890 align:middle line:84%
in the third dimension, we help
the people from fifth dimension

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:08.660 align:middle line:84%
to understand their selves
through that experience.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.810 align:middle line:84%
So we used to
believe that beings

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:14.630 align:middle line:84%
in the fourth, the fifth,
the sixth dimension

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:19.850 align:middle line:84%
are people or beings that
are more evolved than we are,

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:20.870 align:middle line:90%
but it's not like that.

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:21.670 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:24.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sheila, explain to us
what the fifth dimension is.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Well,
I agree with him.

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:30.350 align:middle line:84%
My first book was
called "Fifth Dimension,

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:31.743 align:middle line:90%
Channels to a New Reality."

00:11:31.743 --> 00:11:32.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There you go.

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And what
Theo spoke to us about

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:38.540 align:middle line:84%
is that this time we're
living in right now,

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:41.510 align:middle line:84%
we're fully, all
of us, experiencing

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:43.010 align:middle line:90%
the fifth dimension.

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And the fifth dimension is
the realization of the masters

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:47.720 align:middle line:90%
that we are.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.120 align:middle line:84%
The third is our
physical reality,

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.550 align:middle line:84%
the fourth is our
spiritual awakening,

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:56.390 align:middle line:84%
and the fifth is the fuller
expression in and through us

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:58.850 align:middle line:84%
of this consciousness
of the fifth dimension.

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:01.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we all enter the
fifth dimension at some time?

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.420 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: We're all in it now.

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:04.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ongoing.

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.920 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It's
vibrational frequencies.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.780 align:middle line:90%
One could call it enlightenment.

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:14.040 align:middle line:84%
The fifth-- Theo says there's
12 dimensions about the Earth.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:18.540 align:middle line:84%
The fifth and sixth will be
expressed and experienced

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:21.450 align:middle line:84%
in our human experience
or physical experience

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:26.120 align:middle line:84%
and the others we're in contact
with as the teaching realm.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:31.390 align:middle line:84%
So I agree with what he had
said that there are beings,

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:33.300 align:middle line:84%
such as Theo, the
archangels, that

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:38.580 align:middle line:84%
are here to teach and assist
us evolve in our consciousness.

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:42.570 align:middle line:84%
And this is a time of this
consciousness evolution

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:45.330 align:middle line:84%
that they said has never
happened on this planet before.

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:48.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, is Theo an
umbrella for all the archangels

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:48.960 align:middle line:90%
or is it just one?

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:52.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Is an umbrella
or spokesmen for 12.

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:53.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 12 of them.

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:53.910 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Mhm.

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:57.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, how do we know
at any particular time which

00:12:57.490 --> 00:12:59.580 align:middle line:90%
is which or doesn't matter?

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Well, they
say it doesn't matter.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:05.220 align:middle line:84%
They will not
identify singularly.

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:10.230 align:middle line:84%
They identify as
Theo, as a group.

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:12.900 align:middle line:84%
But we've noticed over
time and listening

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:16.980 align:middle line:84%
to recordings you can tell a
little bit of a difference who

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:21.780 align:middle line:84%
the spokesman is, but
they won't identify who,

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:27.360 align:middle line:84%
that they say the message
is what is of import

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.340 align:middle line:90%
and that the messenger--

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:30.930 align:middle line:84%
there would be
too much attention

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:33.120 align:middle line:84%
paid to the messenger
and not the message.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:36.708 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
channel, how do you begin?

00:13:36.708 --> 00:13:39.000 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm going to have
you do that in just a moment.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.150 align:middle line:90%
But tell us the process.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:46.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Well, what I
do is I just close my eyes.

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:50.620 align:middle line:84%
I take a couple of deep
breaths to center myself.

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And then I invite
Theo to come in.

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:58.660 align:middle line:84%
And they've always come in
the right side of my body.

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All 12 of them.

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:02.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Well,
the spokesman does.

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:04.510 align:middle line:84%
But the energy of
the 12 is there.

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:11.610 align:middle line:84%
That's why I say my body
is constantly adjusting

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:12.980 align:middle line:90%
to their higher frequency.

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:14.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are these the
archangels, Sheila,

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:16.770 align:middle line:90%
that we have always known of--

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:20.340 align:middle line:84%
Gabriel, Michael, people
like that, angels like that?

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:21.240 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They are, OK.

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:26.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And they're
teachers and overseers

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:32.280 align:middle line:84%
that are here to assist
us in our recognizing

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.990 align:middle line:90%
the masters that we are.

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:35.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And in
the channeling, do

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:39.480 align:middle line:84%
I ask your physical
body the question?

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:42.720 align:middle line:84%
They hear it, and they
answer it through you?

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: They will
answer you directly.

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:46.260 align:middle line:90%
You ask them.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.398 align:middle line:90%
You can ask Theo the question.

00:14:48.398 --> 00:14:49.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Anything I want.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.920 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Anything you want.

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:53.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when we're done
with the questioning, how

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.810 align:middle line:90%
do I get you back?

00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: You just say, Theo,
I'm finished with my questions,

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:01.960 align:middle line:84%
and they'll give a
salutation to you.

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:02.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And then they'll
leave, and I'll be back.

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right, let's try.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:08.970 align:middle line:90%
Let's get you into the mode.

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:11.250 align:middle line:90%
And how do I know when to start?

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:13.210 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: They will
say, you may begin.

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:14.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:18.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And they'll come in
and say, this is the beginning,

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.260 align:middle line:90%
is it not?

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.110 align:middle line:90%
And that's how it always starts.

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll say, there's
one who wishes to ask questions

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:29.820 align:middle line:84%
or there's an asking, and
they'll say, you may begin.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And this is not
harmful to you in any way?

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:36.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: No, they've been
working with me for like,

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:37.803 align:middle line:90%
I say, 50 years.

00:15:37.803 --> 00:15:38.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a long time.

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:40.635 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So it's
become comfortable.

00:15:40.635 --> 00:15:41.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you're only 35.

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:42.540 align:middle line:90%
How did this happen?

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:44.140 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: [LAUGHS] I know.

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:44.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love it.

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:46.172 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's begin.

00:15:46.172 --> 00:15:47.130 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Here we go.

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:48.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do what you do.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.537 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: All
right, here we go.

00:15:49.537 --> 00:16:04.440 align:middle line:90%


00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:07.908 align:middle line:90%
It is the beginning, is it not?

00:16:07.908 --> 00:16:11.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: May I begin
to question you, Theo?

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:14.400 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: You may ask, yes.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Theo, we seem to be
at a time in our life on planet

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:20.850 align:middle line:84%
Earth where everything is
going wrong with people.

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:25.350 align:middle line:84%
We've had a epidemic of a
disease called COVID-19.

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:29.050 align:middle line:84%
We have armed
conflicts in Europe.

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:32.920 align:middle line:84%
Everything seems to be
upside down for people.

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.790 align:middle line:90%
How does our future look?

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:37.920 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: We see
it as very positive.

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:42.780 align:middle line:84%
We've been speaking about
this time for five decades.

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:48.430 align:middle line:84%
It is now the full fifth
dimensionary energy

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:50.920 align:middle line:84%
that is about the
planet, which is

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:53.320 align:middle line:84%
a magnificent shift
of consciousness

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:58.280 align:middle line:84%
for the human species and
all species on your planet.

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And this is bringing
about what one

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:05.359 align:middle line:84%
would call a new world,
collaborative world,

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:07.640 align:middle line:90%
for the highest good of all.

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:10.880 align:middle line:84%
So the old structures
and foundations

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:15.089 align:middle line:84%
that have been
known do not work.

00:17:15.089 --> 00:17:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And that is completing,
dissolving, if you would.

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:23.619 align:middle line:84%
So the political structures
are changing dramatically.

00:17:23.619 --> 00:17:27.690 align:middle line:84%
The economic structure,
which is global,

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:31.840 align:middle line:84%
will be changed in
the betterment of all.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And then there is, as you've
seen, the pandemic, as it were,

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:44.120 align:middle line:84%
has shown you that
you're all connected.

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:50.350 align:middle line:84%
It did not discriminate between
you as you do between others.

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:53.170 align:middle line:84%
It was an equal
opportunity for all

00:17:53.170 --> 00:18:02.400 align:middle line:84%
to then be caring, most
importantly, of each other.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And this is a time of great
change that is a positive.

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And out of this
chaos will come order

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.710 align:middle line:90%
by the people of the world.

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:16.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So that's a good thing.

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:17.930 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: It is a good thing.

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:22.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Many people talk
about end times, apocalypse.

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.170 align:middle line:90%
Are we in those end times now?

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:25.820 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It's
an end time of what

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:29.360 align:middle line:84%
has been known, the foundations
that are dissolving.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:33.740 align:middle line:84%
But there are many good things
being born out of this time--

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:39.470 align:middle line:84%
new industry, new recognition
of how to care for the world.

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:42.080 align:middle line:84%
You witnessed in the
pandemic, did you

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:48.050 align:middle line:84%
not, that when people would
stop doing what they were doing,

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:50.180 align:middle line:90%
the planet would heal itself?

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And it happened
immediately, did it not?

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:55.640 align:middle line:84%
So these are the ways
of the world that

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.760 align:middle line:84%
will change new
industry that is better

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:02.690 align:middle line:84%
for the planet, new
consciousness that is better

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:05.390 align:middle line:84%
for the planet,
new collaborations

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:09.620 align:middle line:84%
amongst the artisans in
the sciences that bring

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:16.340 align:middle line:84%
about the highest good
and order for all species

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:18.170 align:middle line:90%
upon this planet.

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:21.440 align:middle line:90%
You are not competitive species.

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.240 align:middle line:90%
You are collaborative.

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:26.240 align:middle line:84%
But there are those who
have been competitive

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:31.640 align:middle line:84%
that wish to rule others,
and that won't work anymore.

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Theo, why
do you channel?

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:36.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: We've come
here to be teachers

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:39.610 align:middle line:84%
in this evolution
that is happening

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:46.120 align:middle line:84%
and to allow others to become
aware of how magnificent

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:47.290 align:middle line:90%
you are.

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:50.980 align:middle line:84%
If you could see
yourselves as we see you,

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:54.100 align:middle line:84%
there would be no
discontent, and you

00:19:54.100 --> 00:20:01.810 align:middle line:84%
would treat each other with
love, not harm and judgment.

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:03.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
know those angels

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:06.370 align:middle line:84%
that have been called
the fallen angels?

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:08.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: We see
no fallen angels.

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:15.210 align:middle line:84%
That's a concept that
humans have made out

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:19.950 align:middle line:90%
of the good and bad thinking.

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:23.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So we didn't
have Satan at the time?

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:27.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: That's an
imagination of people

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:29.460 align:middle line:90%
doing bad things, isn't it?

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.770 align:middle line:84%
So there had to be
a name given it,

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:38.620 align:middle line:84%
and unfortunately, it has
been given to one of our own.

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:40.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who is still with you?

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:42.910 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:47.140 align:middle line:84%
You call him Lucifer, but
he is a very light angel,

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:49.180 align:middle line:90%
not a fallen angel.

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Satan is the evil
you see in the world.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:58.820 align:middle line:84%
That dichotomy of
good and bad and evil

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:01.460 align:middle line:90%
have been manmade thoughts.

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:04.220 align:middle line:90%
God is not a punishing God.

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:08.360 align:middle line:84%
It is a solid state
of unconditional love

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:14.210 align:middle line:84%
and would not send those who
would harm, only to enlighten.

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:16.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Have you met God?

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:19.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is God?

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Solid state
of unconditional love.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:25.350 align:middle line:84%
It is not one who
sits on a mountain

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:29.400 align:middle line:84%
with white hair and a
long beard demanding

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:32.910 align:middle line:90%
one be smitten or one be saved.

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:35.770 align:middle line:90%
It is not that.

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:41.200 align:middle line:84%
You all have the power of
God, the creator, that is you.

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:44.520 align:middle line:90%
You are made in that likeness.

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:49.990 align:middle line:84%
It is the beliefs of not being
that, that has harmed you.

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:52.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is there so
much evil on this planet?

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:55.370 align:middle line:90%
And there is evil.

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:57.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: That is
coming from beliefs of not

00:21:57.890 --> 00:22:02.710 align:middle line:90%
being good enough, unworthy.

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:04.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do
children go and shoot up

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.500 align:middle line:90%
other children in schools?

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:09.080 align:middle line:90%
Why do we have so much hatred?

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:12.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Because
they've experienced hatred

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:18.170 align:middle line:84%
by those who've they've come
to think of as loving to them

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:19.700 align:middle line:90%
and have not been.

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:25.570 align:middle line:84%
Hurting people hurt
and hurt others.

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:27.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there
a way out for us?

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:30.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Of course, that's
what we're talking about.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.860 align:middle line:84%
If each and every one of you
would do soul integration,

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:37.920 align:middle line:84%
integrate the fragmented
aspects of your soul that

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:43.050 align:middle line:84%
have been harmed in other
times and other experiences,

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:47.040 align:middle line:84%
and loving them, the higher
self, the whole self of you

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:49.950 align:middle line:84%
giving them love
unconditionally,

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:53.040 align:middle line:84%
and changing, rewriting
the script of your beliefs

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:58.920 align:middle line:84%
of not being worthy
or good enough,

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.020 align:middle line:84%
and giving the
self that love, you

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:03.330 align:middle line:84%
would be able to
give it to others.

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:07.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Theo, how do we get
Sheila back for more questions?

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:10.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: In the
asking, it is given.

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:13.750 align:middle line:84%
You are complete with your
question in this moment?

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:16.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I may summon
you back later on, can I?

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:20.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: In your asking,
it would be given, yes.

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:21.725 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Thank you.

00:23:21.725 --> 00:23:22.600 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Good day.

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:23.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good day.

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:30.520 align:middle line:90%


00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:33.090 align:middle line:90%
Sheila, are you back yet?

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:34.147 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:23:34.147 --> 00:23:35.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, while
that was going on,

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:40.870 align:middle line:84%
that conversation with Theo,
did you recollect any of it?

00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:42.562 align:middle line:90%
Did you hear what's going on?

00:23:42.562 --> 00:23:44.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: I hear
what's going on.

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:46.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't retain all the words.

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:49.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I asked
him about Lucifer.

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:52.120 align:middle line:84%
I asked him about
the apocalypse.

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:55.210 align:middle line:84%
I asked him about other world
events and things like that.

00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:57.050 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty fascinating.

00:23:57.050 --> 00:23:57.850 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: It is.

00:23:57.850 --> 00:23:59.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's pure
love, too, isn't it?

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:02.630 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: It is, very much so.

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:06.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have they ever
not been there for you?

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:07.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Once.

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:09.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened?

00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:11.000 align:middle line:10%
>>GILLETTE: I had a client--

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.240 align:middle line:10%
a private client--
that at the time

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:17.750 align:middle line:10%
I was seeing people
privately, and they would come

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:20.330 align:middle line:10%
to my office or to my home.

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And this gentleman came
for his appointment.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And this has only
happened this one time.

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.540 align:middle line:90%
And he came in.

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:30.770 align:middle line:90%
He sat down.

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:37.460 align:middle line:84%
I sat down as we did today,
and I invited Theo to come in.

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And Theo came in and
said to this gentleman,

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:46.200 align:middle line:84%
you are not willing to
hear the truth and left.

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And left?

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: And they left.

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And so I came out
of the trance state

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:56.300 align:middle line:84%
and here's this gentleman
looking at me like you are,

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:58.400 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't know
what to say or do.

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.530 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what happened?

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
Theo told me I'm not

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:04.910 align:middle line:90%
willing to hear the truth.

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:06.050 align:middle line:90%
And I said, oh, really?

00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:06.850 align:middle line:90%
And he said, yes.

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:08.238 align:middle line:90%
And they're absolutely right.

00:25:08.238 --> 00:25:09.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They were right.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted
nothing to do with him.

00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:11.920 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: And he agreed.

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I almost
canceled my appointment

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:18.630 align:middle line:84%
because I was afraid of
what I was going to hear.

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:20.460 align:middle line:84%
And he was perfectly
fine with it.

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:23.760 align:middle line:84%
But I was mortified at
first because I thought, now

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.560 align:middle line:90%
what am I going to do?

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:27.030 align:middle line:90%
But I have no control over it.

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:30.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have they
ever brought to you--

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:32.940 align:middle line:90%
you talked about Jesus earlier.

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:37.620 align:middle line:84%
But have they ever brought
to you the God figure?

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:39.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: I think
it's all around us.

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:45.150 align:middle line:84%
So I feel, in their presence,
every time they work with me

00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:48.120 align:middle line:90%
I imbue--

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:51.060 align:middle line:84%
am imbued by that energy
through them and--

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:55.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I pick up vibes
from you of pure love.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:58.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you have an
angry bone in your body.

00:25:58.140 --> 00:25:59.370 align:middle line:90%
You're a human being.

00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:02.243 align:middle line:84%
How were you able
to accomplish that?

00:26:02.243 --> 00:26:03.410 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Oh, I get angry.

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:04.475 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you?

00:26:04.475 --> 00:26:05.275 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: I do.

00:26:05.275 --> 00:26:07.370 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] I wish
I was that great.

00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:09.605 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, George,
for saying that.

00:26:09.605 --> 00:26:11.217 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't show it.

00:26:11.217 --> 00:26:12.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Oh, I
have my moments just

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:13.880 align:middle line:90%
like everybody else.

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We'll talk
to your husband.

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:16.672 align:middle line:90%
He'll tell us the truth, right?

00:26:16.672 --> 00:26:21.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: He'll say
I'm pretty human, yeah.

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:23.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What have you
learned from this experience

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:25.090 align:middle line:90%
for yourself?

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:28.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Oh,
gosh, I wouldn't be

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:31.720 align:middle line:84%
the person I am today had
I not had this experience

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:35.890 align:middle line:84%
and not had the
teachers that I have.

00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:40.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm a student of them just
like everybody who hears them.

00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And they brought forth a
process, a soul integration

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:51.190 align:middle line:84%
process which allows us to
let go of limiting beliefs,

00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:54.520 align:middle line:84%
of changing the beliefs,
the patterns of belief

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:58.760 align:middle line:84%
that keep bringing
negative experiences to us.

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And so I've been a
student of that as well.

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:04.420 align:middle line:84%
So to answer your question,
how can I be who I am today

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:09.140 align:middle line:84%
is being that student and
really applying that information

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:09.940 align:middle line:90%
in my life.

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How often
do you channel them?

00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:13.090 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Every day.

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:15.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For yourself or
for the good of humanity?

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:18.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: For
myself and for others.

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:19.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Clients?

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:20.980 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Mhm.

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And we do a lot of teaching
now, mentoring programs.

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And we do a lot of internet
mentoring programs.

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And so we have a global group,
a global family, I call them.

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And we have a certification
program in the soul integration

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:44.230 align:middle line:84%
process that now there are
other people in the world that

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:49.540 align:middle line:84%
are out assisting people to come
into that state of self-love.

00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:52.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Generally, do
your clients channel Theo

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:53.990 align:middle line:90%
through you like we just did?

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.790 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:57.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
they want to know?

00:27:57.490 --> 00:28:00.770 align:middle line:84%
Do they get involved in their
personal life, the finances,

00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:01.610 align:middle line:90%
the relationships?

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:02.440 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Everything.

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:03.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They'll ask all that?

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:04.380 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yeah.

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:06.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And will
the angels supply

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:07.130 align:middle line:90%
that kind of information?

00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:07.930 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:12.100 align:middle line:84%
And they say no
question is unimportant.

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:14.680 align:middle line:84%
If we have a question
in our mind and heart,

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:16.780 align:middle line:84%
when that becomes
satisfied, we're

00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:19.840 align:middle line:84%
ready to ask the
bigger, deeper, broader,

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:22.090 align:middle line:84%
however we want to talk
about it questions.

00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:25.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they get
involved in our direct life

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:28.240 align:middle line:90%
with any kind of influence?

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:32.960 align:middle line:84%
Can they manipulate
and change things?

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:35.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: They always say,
in the asking, it is given.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:38.810 align:middle line:84%
That they're not there
to usurp our free will.

00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:43.770 align:middle line:84%
But if we ask their
assistance, ask them for help--

00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:47.850 align:middle line:84%
and that's true for all of us
who have angels and guides--

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:49.870 align:middle line:90%
they're waiting to be asked.

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:55.020 align:middle line:84%
So every day I ask Theo to
assist my life that day.

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:57.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let me ask them
a few more questions

00:28:57.090 --> 00:28:59.470 align:middle line:84%
if you could get back
into that mode for us.

00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:00.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: I sure will.

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:01.470 align:middle line:90%
I'd be happy to.

00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:02.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Go ahead.

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:03.135 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: OK, here we go.

00:29:03.135 --> 00:29:17.360 align:middle line:90%


00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:20.365 align:middle line:90%
It is the beginning, is it not?

00:29:20.365 --> 00:29:21.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is, Theo.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.390 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:24.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: We appreciate
the opportunity

00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:28.180 align:middle line:90%
to be of service unto you.

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you consider
being on a national radio

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:35.590 align:middle line:84%
show one day to get the word
out to millions of people?

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:37.825 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: We would,
in the asking, yes.

00:29:37.825 --> 00:29:42.350 align:middle line:90%


00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you ever
have a life as a human?

00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:46.040 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: No.

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:48.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were simply
what from the beginning?

00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:51.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: We were
archangels as messengers

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:54.440 align:middle line:84%
of what you call God
or that solid state

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:57.330 align:middle line:90%
of unconditional love.

00:29:57.330 --> 00:30:00.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is Michael with you?

00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:05.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Michael is
with us as with you.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can I talk
to him individually?

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:09.070 align:middle line:90%
Or who am I talking to now?

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:12.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: You are talking
to Theo, the collective group

00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:15.370 align:middle line:90%
as the archangels, we are.

00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:18.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are all 12 of you
inputting as you speak?

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:20.440 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:23.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:27.490 align:middle line:84%
I had heard years ago
that Michael was always

00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:30.950 align:middle line:84%
there on the battlefield
of soldiers to help them.

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:31.840 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:35.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: That's
a human vision.

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:37.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:40.300 align:middle line:90%
But did it ever happen?

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:42.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Yes, because
he's the overseer

00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:47.350 align:middle line:84%
of that legion of angels
that are there to assist.

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:52.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why when people pray,
do sometimes angels assist them

00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:54.315 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes they don't?

00:30:54.315 --> 00:30:55.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: They
always assist them,

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:59.110 align:middle line:84%
but they may not
get what they want.

00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:02.290 align:middle line:84%
It may not be in the
highest good of their soul.

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And the soul has control,
not the personality.

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:11.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why does God
allow bad things to happen?

00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:14.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It's people
that bad things happen.

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:17.070 align:middle line:90%
It's personality disorder.

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:21.020 align:middle line:90%
It's human activity.

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:24.520 align:middle line:90%
God is a loving God.

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.690 align:middle line:90%
But you have the power.

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:28.600 align:middle line:84%
That's why we're
here to let you know.

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:34.500 align:middle line:84%
Each and every one of you
have a convenient excuse

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:37.800 align:middle line:84%
that God did this
or that to you.

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:39.660 align:middle line:90%
Nothing happens to you.

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:42.470 align:middle line:90%
It happens through you.

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:48.170 align:middle line:84%
Life happens through you
and for you, not to you.

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:50.490 align:middle line:90%
Life is a gift.

00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:52.700 align:middle line:84%
There are billions
of souls that would

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:54.920 align:middle line:90%
like to have a human body.

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:56.850 align:middle line:90%
You won the lottery.

00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:58.830 align:middle line:90%
You got one.

00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And so what you do with
that is of great importance,

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:08.130 align:middle line:84%
particularly now in this
shift of consciousness.

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And what you are doing in
informing people of the power

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:17.280 align:middle line:84%
within is a purposeful
gift you give them.

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:21.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you sometimes
wish you were in a human body?

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:23.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: No, we
like what we do.

00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:25.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a
great thing, though.

00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:27.630 align:middle line:90%
You can have a great time.

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:32.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: We have the
opportunity of having that

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:33.665 align:middle line:90%
through you and with you.

00:32:33.665 --> 00:32:36.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wouldn't you
like to eat a hot dog?

00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:38.123 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: We don't eat.

00:32:38.123 --> 00:32:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
my sense of humor.

00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:39.930 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:41.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you catch it?

00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:42.060 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: We did.

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:42.315 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you appreciate it?

00:32:42.315 --> 00:32:44.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: That
was ours as well.

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:45.240 align:middle line:90%
We don't eat.

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you laugh?

00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:49.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: We think
things are very humorous,

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:52.190 align:middle line:84%
but most think we
are very serious.

00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:54.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you cry?

00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:56.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: We
have sadness, yes.

00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:59.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What makes you sad?

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:03.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Sometimes
what humans do.

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:06.462 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a strange
being that we are.

00:33:06.462 --> 00:33:08.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: We
find you oftentimes

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:13.070 align:middle line:84%
humorous for you keep doing
the same things over and over

00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:17.690 align:middle line:84%
again, and in that having
similar results until you

00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:19.280 align:middle line:90%
change your thinking.

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:24.458 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're here to
impress upon you to change.

00:33:24.458 --> 00:33:26.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Theo, thank you for
spending some time with us

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:27.810 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:31.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: We are appreciative
of the opportunity to serve.

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:33.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: May we
have Sheila back?

00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:35.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: God's
love on to you.

00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:36.640 align:middle line:90%
Good day.

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:37.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Thank you.

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:46.350 align:middle line:90%


00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:50.010 align:middle line:84%
Sheila, I asked Theo some
pretty profound questions,

00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:52.537 align:middle line:90%
and they answered me directly--

00:33:52.537 --> 00:33:53.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: They do.

00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --without
any hesitation.

00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:58.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: I found that to be
true now for the five decades

00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:01.590 align:middle line:90%
I've worked with them.

00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:04.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk about
the documentary "Tuning In"

00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:07.910 align:middle line:84%
on our Gaia and talk
about channeling

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:10.040 align:middle line:84%
and see what they
experienced to see if it

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:11.750 align:middle line:90%
echoes what you went through.

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:13.189 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: OK.

00:34:13.189 --> 00:34:13.989 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:34:13.989 --> 00:34:14.789 align:middle line:10%
- All right.

00:34:14.789 --> 00:34:16.130 align:middle line:10%
- Greetings, dear ones.

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:17.179 align:middle line:10%
- Yes, hello, dear.

00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:21.440 align:middle line:10%
- May the peace of the great
spirit be with you always.

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.870 align:middle line:10%
- So let us begin
with the discussion.

00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:27.870 align:middle line:90%


00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:29.690 align:middle line:10%
The first time I
ever talked to Tobias

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:33.260 align:middle line:10%
was on an Airplane in 1997.

00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:38.420 align:middle line:10%
And I wasn't particularly
spiritual or metaphysical.

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:40.159 align:middle line:10%
I was in the business
world at the time,

00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:43.639 align:middle line:10%
and Tobias came in on this
plane flight and started talking

00:34:43.639 --> 00:34:45.830 align:middle line:10%
and hasn't stopped since.

00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:50.270 align:middle line:10%
But initially, it was
just me talking to Tobias.

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:52.310 align:middle line:10%
I hadn't even told
Linda about it.

00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:54.740 align:middle line:10%
- And how long did it take
you before you broke it

00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:55.782 align:middle line:10%
to Linda, that this was--

00:34:55.782 --> 00:34:57.063 align:middle line:10%
- It was about a year.

00:34:57.063 --> 00:34:58.730 align:middle line:10%
- So you kept it to
yourself for a year?

00:34:58.730 --> 00:34:59.530 align:middle line:10%
- Yeah.

00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:03.250 align:middle line:90%


00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:05.740 align:middle line:10%
- I received what
felt like what I

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:08.380 align:middle line:10%
experienced to be a
telepathic contact from Bashar

00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:09.460 align:middle line:10%
and his people.

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:12.430 align:middle line:10%
In that moment of the
telepathic contact,

00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:15.370 align:middle line:10%
a memory actually
came back of having

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:21.320 align:middle line:10%
made an agreement somewhere
prior to this life to do this.

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:27.260 align:middle line:10%
- I grew up in a Roman Catholic
family of Sicilian immigrants.

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:30.320 align:middle line:10%
Most of them, even
today after I've

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:34.250 align:middle line:10%
been channeling Joseph for 15
years, don't know what I do.

00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:38.660 align:middle line:10%
They have some idea, because
I don't talk about it to them,

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:40.315 align:middle line:10%
and they don't ask me.

00:35:40.315 --> 00:35:41.690 align:middle line:10%
They know I do
something "weird."

00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:44.420 align:middle line:10%


00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:45.870 align:middle line:10%
- I was very lucky.

00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:47.930 align:middle line:10%
I had a lot of support.

00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:50.150 align:middle line:10%
My friends were very accepting.

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:52.850 align:middle line:10%
And that's one thing that I've
always been really open about.

00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:56.720 align:middle line:10%
I didn't really hide
it even from employers.

00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:00.410 align:middle line:10%
And I've always felt it
was really important for me

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:02.975 align:middle line:10%
to be honest about that because
I saw how it impacted people.

00:36:02.975 --> 00:36:07.100 align:middle line:90%


00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:10.850 align:middle line:10%
- I started in a class
where we were really

00:36:10.850 --> 00:36:17.900 align:middle line:10%
studying making a trance
bridge, an intro psychic bridge

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:20.160 align:middle line:10%
to other sources
of intelligence.

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:22.385 align:middle line:10%
And so it started in the
context of that class.

00:36:22.385 --> 00:36:25.030 align:middle line:10%


00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:27.130 align:middle line:10%
- See, I thought that all
of these esoteric things

00:36:27.130 --> 00:36:30.610 align:middle line:10%
were for older women over
40 and it would have nothing

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:31.697 align:middle line:10%
to do with men.

00:36:31.697 --> 00:36:34.030 align:middle line:10%
So I was dragged to these two
guys who channeled for me,

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:36.460 align:middle line:10%
and there was something--
this was three years apart.

00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:38.450 align:middle line:10%
They both told me
the same thing.

00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:40.360 align:middle line:10%
And that is when I had
to start looking at,

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:45.135 align:middle line:10%
how could guys 20 years apart
in age, three years apart in ID,

00:36:45.135 --> 00:36:46.510 align:middle line:10%
who never knew
each other give me

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:48.490 align:middle line:10%
information that was identical?

00:36:48.490 --> 00:36:49.900 align:middle line:10%
And the information
just happened

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:52.340 align:middle line:10%
to be that there was a
master named Cryon who I

00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:53.590 align:middle line:10%
was supposed to get a hold of.

00:36:53.590 --> 00:36:53.920 align:middle line:90%

>>NOORY: Sheila,
what would you like

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:58.920 align:middle line:84%
to tell the many people who
are watching you right now?

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:00.450 align:middle line:90%
You've got a platform.

00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:02.190 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Well,
what I'd like to tell

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:06.090 align:middle line:84%
people is you are more
than you think you are

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:09.460 align:middle line:84%
and that you're better
than you think you are.

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And getting in touch on
the inner with that wisdom

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:17.680 align:middle line:84%
that each and every
one has that that's

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:20.290 align:middle line:84%
what we're here for now
in this fifth dimension.

00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:24.580 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're here for now
in this consciousness shift.

00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And if we all gain that inner
love-- it's an inside-out job--

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:30.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:34.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: --we can let go
of those limiting beliefs.

00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:36.280 align:middle line:90%
We can have peace on our planet.

individuals, angels,

00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:53.808 align:middle line:84%

when I needed help, too.

00:37:53.808 --> 00:37:55.100 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: I'm sure they have.

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:57.880 align:middle line:84%

their backs, do they?

00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:59.410 align:middle line:10%
>>GILLETTE: No.

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:04.260 align:middle line:10%
They just are constant in
the message, in the love.

happy for our future?

That's living, I guess.

>>GILLETTE: Yeah, I guess so.

00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:20.040 align:middle line:10%
But I think as we evolve
in our conscious state

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:24.730 align:middle line:10%
and in our self-love, it
will change the world.
