>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.033 align:middle line:90%
We've got a great guest for you.

00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:30.870 align:middle line:10%
Patti Negri is with
us, a psychic medium.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.410 align:middle line:10%
A good witch best known for her
recurring role on the Travel

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.210 align:middle line:10%
Channel show "Ghost Adventures."

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.510 align:middle line:84%
She is also an international
best-selling author,

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.870 align:middle line:84%
has graced numerous magazine
covers, and has conducted

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.020 align:middle line:84%
seances on radio,
film, and television.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.850 align:middle line:90%
And she knows a lot of people.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.700 align:middle line:84%
You've worked with, like,
Jon Voight, Chevy Chase,

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.542 align:middle line:90%
the late Greg Hines.

00:00:51.542 --> 00:00:53.250 align:middle line:84%
>>PATTI NEGRI: Yes,
yes, I've been lucky.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.920 align:middle line:84%
I guess I'm an LA
native, born and raised

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.840 align:middle line:90%
in the Hollywood area.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.095 align:middle line:84%
It just kind of goes
with the territory.

00:00:58.095 --> 00:00:59.845 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
get involved in this?

00:00:59.845 --> 00:01:02.250 align:middle line:10%
>>NEGRI: I-- well, a
long and windy road.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.330 align:middle line:10%
I knew when I was a little kid
that those imaginary friends

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.370 align:middle line:10%
little kids have
weren't all imaginary.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.080 align:middle line:10%
I could talk to spirits.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.672 align:middle line:10%
And then I also kind of
went into the showbiz realm,

00:01:12.672 --> 00:01:14.130 align:middle line:10%
and then one day
they all collided.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.763 align:middle line:90%


00:01:17.763 --> 00:01:18.930 align:middle line:90%
I ran a production company--

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:19.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.265 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: And I just--

00:01:22.265 --> 00:01:24.390 align:middle line:84%
I stayed away, even though
I talked to dead people,

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.460 align:middle line:84%
even though I was a
witch and I did magic.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.650 align:middle line:84%
I thought that wasn't
proper if I was doing

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.210 align:middle line:90%
big shows for Mattel and IBM.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Scare people.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: Yeah, yes, but
one day, like in 2008,

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.497 align:middle line:84%
when kind of the
corporate market

00:01:36.497 --> 00:01:38.580 align:middle line:84%
dropped out of corporate
entertainment and reality

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.140 align:middle line:84%
television was
going up like this,

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.900 align:middle line:84%
I kind of came out of the
proverbial broom closet.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.320 align:middle line:84%
Somebody had asked me to
do a show on, I think,

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.210 align:middle line:90%
"Mobile Home Disaster" on CMT.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, well, nobody
will watch that.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.870 align:middle line:90%
I could do that show.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And people did watch
it and it didn't

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.480 align:middle line:84%
hurt my corporate career, though
this career turned into where

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.620 align:middle line:90%
my passion really lies.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.865 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And this is basically
your full-time career.

00:02:00.865 --> 00:02:02.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: This my full
time career, yes.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.032 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Casting spells, doing
all kinds of things on people.

00:02:05.032 --> 00:02:07.959 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: Casting spells,
working with people, seances,

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:08.759 align:middle line:90%
a lot of house--

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:09.900 align:middle line:90%
I see energy.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.790 align:middle line:84%
I do-- everything
is energy-based and

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.080 align:middle line:90%
empowerment-based.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.860 align:middle line:84%
So whether I'm getting the
ghost of Aaron Spelling out

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.310 align:middle line:84%
of Spelling Manor, or helping
a little beauty shop that

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.140 align:middle line:84%
doesn't know why they can't keep
clients and clearing it out,

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.100 align:middle line:90%
or everywhere in the middle.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Patti, is
your gift inherited?

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: I think it's inherited.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.775 align:middle line:84%
When I was little, my mom always
said, oh, grandma, did that.

00:02:33.775 --> 00:02:36.150 align:middle line:84%
Grandma was able to talk to
people at the end of the bed,

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.450 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
because my father had

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.950 align:middle line:84%
this Sephardic
Jewish background.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.750 align:middle line:84%
But we were raised--
my grandfather

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.310 align:middle line:90%
was this very famous atheist.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.070 align:middle line:84%
He hung out with Carl
Sagan, academic--

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, he did?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: --and it is like
anything religious or spiritual

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.680 align:middle line:90%
was a dirty word to me.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.890 align:middle line:84%
So I wasn't raised with
any kind of spirituality.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.930 align:middle line:84%
But I would pass a
church, or I would

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.600 align:middle line:84%
pass a temple or a synagogue,
and I'd see this energy,

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.830 align:middle line:90%
and I'd just want to know more.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.060 align:middle line:84%
So I think I was 13 by the time
I said, can I go to church?

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.980 align:middle line:84%
Can I-- and my mom's like, you
could do anything you want.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.320 align:middle line:90%
And thus, a seeker was born.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And I just went everywhere
and learned everything,

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.050 align:middle line:84%
and took it all down to that
one similarity of the energy.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sounds like
your mother was very

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.237 align:middle line:90%
supportive of what you did.

00:03:19.237 --> 00:03:21.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: They've always been
very, very supportive, yes.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's good.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.930 align:middle line:84%
You look like a younger
version of Barbra Streisand.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:24.280 align:middle line:90%
You ever get that?

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Oh, thank you.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.270 align:middle line:84%
No, but I'll take that
as a huge compliment.

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can you sing?

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:28.385 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: No.

00:03:28.385 --> 00:03:29.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, you can't.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.047 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: It's the one
thing I really don't do.

00:03:31.047 --> 00:03:32.550 align:middle line:90%
I've done it a lot, weirdly.

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.240 align:middle line:84%
I even got my SAG card
singing in "Rocky III."

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.980 align:middle line:90%
Because I'm queen of--

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.780 align:middle line:84%
because I'm a good
witch, I guess, I

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.250 align:middle line:90%
can do things that I can't do.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.410 align:middle line:84%
I can't boil water and I
made it on "Master Chef."

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: But my singing has to
be kind of character singing

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.400 align:middle line:84%
because I slide off
key a little bit.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
a psychic medium.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:51.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Yeah.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.171 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now tell me
exactly what you do there.

00:03:54.171 --> 00:03:55.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: Well, on
the psychic side,

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.510 align:middle line:90%
you just kind of know things.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
intuitive about that?

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.188 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: I'm intuitive.

00:03:59.188 --> 00:04:01.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm intuitive and I kind
of see more trajectory.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.327 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
ever tell somebody,

00:04:03.327 --> 00:04:05.160 align:middle line:84%
you're going to get hit
by a bus on Tuesday.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.870 align:middle line:84%
Because number one, nothing
is written in stone.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.000 align:middle line:90%
We have free will.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And I could say be
careful on Tuesday,

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.735 align:middle line:84%
and then you won't
get hit by a bus.

00:04:12.735 --> 00:04:14.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do warn them.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: I do warn them.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.170 align:middle line:84%
Just like, you might not be
paying attention to things.

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:20.920 align:middle line:90%
But I am much bigger--

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.580 align:middle line:84%
especially the witch side of
me, of that free will and we

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.310 align:middle line:84%
create our own fate
over what we are given.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:28.270 align:middle line:90%
And the medium portion of that?

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.062 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: The mediumship
is that the talking

00:04:30.062 --> 00:04:31.650 align:middle line:90%
to dead people and spirits.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.990 align:middle line:84%
I really-- I thought
everybody could.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.350 align:middle line:90%
I just thought it was normal.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.040 align:middle line:90%
I was three or four, or five.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.950 align:middle line:90%
And I had my friends and I had--

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.858 align:middle line:90%
I would astral project.

00:04:42.858 --> 00:04:44.400 align:middle line:84%
I would tell my
mom-- she'd be going,

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.742 align:middle line:84%
we're going to go meet the
Joneses for the first time.

00:04:46.742 --> 00:04:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, oh, I
was there last night.

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.400 align:middle line:84%
She's like, you were
not there last night.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.660 align:middle line:90%
And I--

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ha!

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.630 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I was, mom.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: Yeah, I'd explain
every room in their house

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.010 align:middle line:90%
and the color of the wallpaper.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And I always had this obsession,
but not in a dark or morbid

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.740 align:middle line:90%
way, for the dead.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.650 align:middle line:84%
So I literally did my first
seance, I was seven or eight,

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.620 align:middle line:84%
and my little suburban
Long Beach-area home.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.060 align:middle line:84%
I went into my windowless
hall and stuffed towels

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.080 align:middle line:84%
under the door so there
would be no light.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: I then realized I
didn't know any dead people.

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.380 align:middle line:84%
So I was, like, well, Marilyn
Monroe and John Kennedy--

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.180 align:middle line:90%
they're dead.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.710 align:middle line:84%
It's the late 60s,
so immediately, I

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.030 align:middle line:90%
came up with my first chant.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.860 align:middle line:84%
It was just kind of inside
of me, and what to say.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And my little windowless,
lifeless hallway

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.580 align:middle line:84%
filled with orbs and lights
and things flying around.

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And me and my
girlfriend, Sheri Jones,

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.230 align:middle line:90%
ran out of the room screaming.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.810 align:middle line:84%
But inside, I'm like,
yes, this is real.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.900 align:middle line:84%
So I spent my entire life
figuring out what it was

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.407 align:middle line:90%
and developing and embracing it.

00:05:45.407 --> 00:05:47.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's take a
look at more of what you do.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: OK.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.050 align:middle line:10%
My name is Patty Negri.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.510 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for coming
to my website.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.880 align:middle line:84%
Here, you're going to find
a little bit about what I do

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.240 align:middle line:90%
and who I am.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.150 align:middle line:84%
But I'll give you a
real quick start--

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:59.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm a psychic medium.

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.640 align:middle line:10%
I was actually voted top psychic
in the United States this year,

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.670 align:middle line:10%
and top medium and tarot
reader in the world.

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.440 align:middle line:10%
I actually had the
honor of gracing,

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.180 align:middle line:10%
like, five different
magazine covers

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.950 align:middle line:10%
and being in 20 different books
over the last year, or two.

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:17.342 align:middle line:10%
So I'm very honored and
humbled and grateful.

00:06:17.342 --> 00:06:19.300 align:middle line:84%
I knew when I was two or
three years old that I

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.750 align:middle line:90%
was a little bit different.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.960 align:middle line:84%
I knew that the so-called
"imaginary friends"

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.390 align:middle line:84%
that kids have in the
closet and under the bed

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:26.865 align:middle line:90%
weren't imaginary at all.

00:06:26.865 --> 00:06:28.240 align:middle line:84%
They were real
beings and I could

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.150 align:middle line:90%
talk to and communicate with.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.530 align:middle line:90%
I worked elementally in my work.

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:34.090 align:middle line:84%
I do regular
readings with people.

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:35.200 align:middle line:90%
I do tarot.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.900 align:middle line:84%
But my specialty is
really moving energy.

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.640 align:middle line:90%
I see through the veil.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.000 align:middle line:84%
I see the energy and where
it needs shifting and moving.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.280 align:middle line:84%
So whether we're doing
a journey session,

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.640 align:middle line:84%
we're doing a spell-working,
we're doing a ritual together,

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.220 align:middle line:84%
or just a straight tarot
reading or a divination

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.190 align:middle line:84%
of another form, what you're
going to come away with

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:57.730 align:middle line:84%
is a clearer path,
a clearer picture

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:59.650 align:middle line:90%
of what to do with your life.

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:00.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm also a witch.

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:02.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm a good witch,
or a white witch.

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:04.370 align:middle line:90%
I don't worship the devil.

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.190 align:middle line:90%
I don't turn people into frogs.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.480 align:middle line:90%
But I do believe in magic.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.520 align:middle line:84%
I do believe in
magic is everywhere--

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:14.050 align:middle line:84%
in the trees, in the stars,
in stones, and herbs and oils

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:14.910 align:middle line:90%
and sounds.

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:15.993 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're a psychic.

00:07:15.993 --> 00:07:16.900 align:middle line:90%
You're a medium.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.220 align:middle line:90%
How did the witchcraft happen?

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.947 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: The
witchcraft, again, I

00:07:19.947 --> 00:07:21.280 align:middle line:90%
think it's sort of in the blood.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.950 align:middle line:84%
It's a knowledge, whether it
comes from the great unknown,

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:25.030 align:middle line:90%
Akashic records.

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:28.780 align:middle line:84%
But I would find myself in
my little suburban backyard

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.790 align:middle line:84%
picking Rosemary and
knowing what to do with it.

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:33.330 align:middle line:84%
Putting some in my mom's
wallet to bring her more money.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:33.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:34.815 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: And it's just--

00:07:34.815 --> 00:07:36.190 align:middle line:84%
and then, of
course, I studied it

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.273 align:middle line:84%
because I'm a believer in
learn what you're doing,

00:07:38.273 --> 00:07:40.660 align:middle line:90%
as well, versus all natural.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And once I started studying
belief systems, cosmologies,

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:48.280 align:middle line:84%
religions, I decided this
was a nice, romantic one.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.960 align:middle line:84%
I think they all have
beautiful truths.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.970 align:middle line:84%
They're just kind of,
to me, like a template

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:54.460 align:middle line:84%
you step on top what
path you want to use,

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:57.220 align:middle line:84%
what cosmology,
what wording system.

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:58.570 align:middle line:90%
And the pagan one is pretty fun.

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:00.933 align:middle line:84%
You get to wear cloaks
and dance around bonfires.

00:08:00.933 --> 00:08:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Patti,
what has Hollywood

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:04.480 align:middle line:90%
done to the image of witches?

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: Well, it's
getting a lot better.

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:10.340 align:middle line:84%
But it's always been
negative-- the big, ugly, old--

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't have a wart on
my nose and they're not--

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:12.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can I look?

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:13.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: --eating babies.

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:14.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nope, no wart.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:15.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: No, I don't.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.195 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No wart.

00:08:16.195 --> 00:08:19.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: So over the years,
it's scary because, again,

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:24.430 align:middle line:84%
whether Hollywood has done
it or religion has done it,

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:25.840 align:middle line:90%
it's been bad.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:26.950 align:middle line:90%
But it's getting better.

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:29.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even some silly shows
like "Charmed," that came back.

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:30.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:32.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: They at least
made them good witches

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.130 align:middle line:90%
and they did good things.

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:33.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, "Bewitched"
was a fun show.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: "Bewitched"
was a fun show.

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:38.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm still working
on that nose wiggle.

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:38.650 align:middle line:90%
I haven't got that yet.

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:40.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Elizabeth
Montgomery was a great witch.

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.282 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: Yeah, she
was a great witch.

00:08:42.282 --> 00:08:44.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now her mother,
played by Agnes Moorehead, eh,

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:46.450 align:middle line:90%
was a little evil, wasn't it?

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:50.035 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: Well, she was
mother-in-law-y, mother-y.

00:08:50.035 --> 00:08:51.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if evil
is the right word.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:52.425 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Now to be psychic--

00:08:52.425 --> 00:08:52.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Yeah.

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:54.573 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --what does
that mean to you?

00:08:54.573 --> 00:08:58.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: To me, that means,
again, just having a knowledge,

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:02.650 align:middle line:84%
or I see it, again, as energy,
kind of knowing a path that

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:03.910 align:middle line:90%
looks like a path is coming.

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:05.440 align:middle line:84%
Kind of knowing
that the phone is

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.638 align:middle line:84%
going to ring, kind of
knowing that somebody

00:09:07.638 --> 00:09:09.430 align:middle line:84%
is going to have certain
kind of struggles,

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:12.380 align:middle line:84%
or could have struggles-- that's
where my, again, witchness

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:13.180 align:middle line:90%
wants it going.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:15.580 align:middle line:84%
OK, you could have a
tough financial year.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:17.980 align:middle line:84%
Let's do something to change
your perception on money.

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:19.510 align:middle line:84%
Let's do something
to change that,

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:22.000 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a
spell-working or what.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is a spell
something from within,

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.765 align:middle line:90%
or is it something from outside?

00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:26.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Yes, both.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:27.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is?

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:32.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: I'm a big believer in
that mind-body-spirit thing.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.980 align:middle line:84%
200,000 books are written about
mind-body-spirit, self-help,

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:38.540 align:middle line:90%
spirituality, psychology.

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:40.700 align:middle line:84%
We will never surpass
our thought pattern.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.780 align:middle line:84%
so you have to believe that, so
that's part of spell-working.

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:46.990 align:middle line:84%
The body-mind, the body
part taking action.

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:49.588 align:middle line:84%
But the spirit, that's
the part most people miss.

00:09:49.588 --> 00:09:51.130 align:middle line:84%
One out of three is
wishful thinking.

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:53.230 align:middle line:90%
Two out of three is hit or miss.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:54.730 align:middle line:84%
Three out of three
is a home-run.

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:58.060 align:middle line:84%
The spell-working could
be the magic behind it.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:59.170 align:middle line:90%
It's the battery power.

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:01.600 align:middle line:84%
So it could also be done
through prayer-- go to church,

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.550 align:middle line:84%
go to temple,
affirmations, new age.

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:07.430 align:middle line:84%
It could be done through
positive thinking or vision

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:08.230 align:middle line:90%
boards.

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:10.870 align:middle line:84%
But I kind of like
burning herbs and oils,

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:13.330 align:middle line:90%
and candles and chants.

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:18.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you use the wrong
spell for the right thing?

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:19.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: I don't know.

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:21.867 align:middle line:90%
Right and wrong is--

00:10:21.867 --> 00:10:22.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Subjective.

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:23.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: It's very subjective.

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:28.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that there's
an exact way to do anything.

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:31.990 align:middle line:84%
I do believe your intent
is what's right or wrong.

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:34.382 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about
what a wrong spell is.

00:10:34.382 --> 00:10:36.090 align:middle line:84%
Like you're supposed
to use a red candle,

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:37.200 align:middle line:90%
but all you have is purple?

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.010 align:middle line:90%
Use the purple.

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:39.830 align:middle line:84%
Or you feel purple
is the right candle--

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:40.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right,
something's not going

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.570 align:middle line:90%
to happen and backfire on you.

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:44.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: But the about
the "bad" spell-working

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.860 align:middle line:84%
is doing anything that
manipulates anybody else.

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your book, "Magick
For the Modern World--"

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:50.190 align:middle line:90%
tell me about that.

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:52.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: OK, that was my--
it's a really simple book.

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:55.350 align:middle line:84%
I honestly spent more
time unwriting it,

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:58.690 align:middle line:84%
because when I started,
what, 30-some years ago,

00:10:58.690 --> 00:10:59.490 align:middle line:90%
I get these--

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:01.365 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What, were you
two when you started?

00:11:01.365 --> 00:11:02.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Yes, yes, two--

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.080 align:middle line:90%
I wish.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.395 align:middle line:90%
Nah, I love it.

00:11:05.395 --> 00:11:07.020 align:middle line:84%
I would get these
big, beautiful books,

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.145 align:middle line:90%
but they'd be overwhelming.

00:11:08.145 --> 00:11:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd get a simple
little book that was really easy

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:12.600 align:middle line:84%
and I could relate
to, and that's

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.950 align:middle line:90%
what I wanted this to be.

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:16.360 align:middle line:84%
It's not made for
psychics or mediums.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.090 align:middle line:90%
It can be any belief system.

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:21.120 align:middle line:84%
But it's about, again,
that empowering people.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.610 align:middle line:84%
It's how to relax
when you can't relax.

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:26.070 align:middle line:84%
If your head gets chatty,
how to relax that.

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:28.620 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it's great to
meditate for an hour.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.180 align:middle line:84%
But we usually
don't have an hour.

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.470 align:middle line:84%
We have 30 seconds
to pull it together.

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:35.200 align:middle line:84%
So I take my "magical"
techniques, like hug

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.800 align:middle line:84%
a tree to relax, or run
your hands under water.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:38.950 align:middle line:90%
That's your water element.

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:39.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:43.035 align:middle line:84%
You end the word magic
in your book with a K--

00:11:43.035 --> 00:11:45.823 align:middle line:90%
M-A-G-I-C-K-- how come?

00:11:45.823 --> 00:11:47.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: To me, that
is what delineates,

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:49.500 align:middle line:84%
and that's kind of
how the world sees it.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:50.917 align:middle line:84%
The difference of
magic with the C

00:11:50.917 --> 00:11:52.833 align:middle line:84%
means you could pull a
rabbit out of your hat,

00:11:52.833 --> 00:11:53.920 align:middle line:90%
or do card tricks.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.880 align:middle line:84%
Magick with a K means you're
doing the kind of magic that

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.120 align:middle line:90%
isn't an illusion.

00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.370 align:middle line:90%
It's really shifting.

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:01.440 align:middle line:84%
To me, that's what
magic, or spell-working,

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.870 align:middle line:84%
or anything-- something
that causes a shift

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:06.240 align:middle line:90%
in the natural trajectory.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.480 align:middle line:84%
In life, nature,
everything kind of

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.660 align:middle line:84%
goes in the easiest pattern
to me-- almost flows

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:13.710 align:middle line:90%
downhill like gravity.

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:14.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm-hmm.

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:16.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: Our life, if
we don't put this to it,

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.450 align:middle line:84%
just is going to
take the easy path.

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:20.280 align:middle line:84%
Magic is going
[EXHALES QUICKLY]..

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:23.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to shift that,
whether it's my perception,

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.710 align:middle line:84%
or myself around
the world within me.

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:27.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Patti, are you
almost like a psychologist

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.080 align:middle line:90%
when you're dealing with us?

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: I am so much
like a psychologist.

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:33.060 align:middle line:84%
My atheist grandfather
would be proud

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:34.750 align:middle line:90%
because he was a psychologist.

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:36.630 align:middle line:84%
He worked with this
whole Hollywood set.

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:38.070 align:middle line:90%
And I find myself there.

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:41.108 align:middle line:84%
It's-- yeah, I'm not a
trained psychologist.

00:12:41.108 --> 00:12:42.150 align:middle line:90%
But I'm pretty damn good.

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:44.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You said your
atheist grandfather--

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:45.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Yes.

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:46.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --atheist.

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:47.820 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
he's doing now?

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:52.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: I think-- I've
actually spoken to him and he--

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:54.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did he say
that he was wrong?

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: He wouldn't use the
word 'wrong,' but he sees

00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:59.040 align:middle line:90%
an expanded view.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.410 align:middle line:84%
My thing-- and again,
talking to the other side,

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:04.920 align:middle line:84%
people don't get
angelic, or get wise.

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:08.370 align:middle line:84%
But they almost always get a
slightly higher perspective,

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:11.430 align:middle line:84%
a bigger view, whether it's
literally a higher perspective.

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:14.680 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of the petty things,
the little things get resolved.

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:15.990 align:middle line:90%
There's still them, but--

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:18.390 align:middle line:90%
I read his books now.

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:19.980 align:middle line:90%
He wrote lots of books.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:22.895 align:middle line:84%
And where they were just
undoing belief systems,

00:13:22.895 --> 00:13:24.270 align:middle line:84%
and he knew more
about religion--

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:24.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was a skeptic.

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: He was a skeptic.

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:29.220 align:middle line:84%
But I read his books now and
it's almost the same belief

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:30.870 align:middle line:90%
system, just different words.

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:33.330 align:middle line:84%
He would use scientific
and academic words,

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:36.720 align:middle line:84%
while somebody else will
use Judeo-Christian words,

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.760 align:middle line:84%
or somebody else
will use pagan words.

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:40.950 align:middle line:84%
But that basic
truth is the same.

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:42.880 align:middle line:84%
So I read his books and
it's like, that's not

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:43.680 align:middle line:90%
all that different.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Taking religion out
of the equation for a moment,

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:50.370 align:middle line:84%
the reason why I think there's
another side, the afterlife,

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:53.570 align:middle line:84%
is because we can't explain why
we're here in the first place.

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:54.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Yeah.

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:56.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This
unbelievable wonderment

00:13:56.610 --> 00:14:00.540 align:middle line:84%
of what life is just
simply carries on.

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And to me, it's not we're
alive, we die, that's it.

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:08.230 align:middle line:84%
People can't explain how we
got here in the first place.

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:10.720 align:middle line:84%
Again, taking religion
out of the equation--

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.600 align:middle line:84%
that's the easy way of
saying, oh, god made us.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:17.190 align:middle line:84%
But with that aside,
how do we get here?

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And if that's the case, and
if you can't answer that,

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:23.050 align:middle line:84%
you can't negate the
possibility of an afterlife.

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:23.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Yeah.

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:25.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I've
always thought that.

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:28.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: Yeah, and I love
the what-we-don't-know part.

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:30.960 align:middle line:84%
Some people want to know
things and they have firm--

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.840 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's why most
religion was even created,

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:37.080 align:middle line:84%
to give us, well, this is this,
and so it explains something.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.550 align:middle line:90%
I love the unknown.

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:42.780 align:middle line:84%
I love what I don't know,
and we don't know a lot.

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:44.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is magic to you?

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:47.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: Magic to me is,
again, causing a shift,

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:50.100 align:middle line:90%
causing a change, and taking--

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:53.190 align:middle line:84%
basically, taking power--
taking power over your own life,

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:55.380 align:middle line:84%
taking power over
your situation,

00:14:55.380 --> 00:15:00.030 align:middle line:84%
taking power over
love, finances, health.

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:02.490 align:middle line:84%
I would be extraordinarily
sick or dead if I

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:03.510 align:middle line:90%
didn't believe in magic.

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:04.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:04.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Yeah.

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:05.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dead?

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:06.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Dead, I would be dead.

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:07.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's pretty strong.

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:08.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: I would be dead.

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:09.110 align:middle line:90%
I would be dead.

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:11.270 align:middle line:90%
I was-- probably.

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:14.670 align:middle line:84%
The dying-- part of
my little journey

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:16.860 align:middle line:84%
is I was diagnosed
when I was a teenager

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:18.040 align:middle line:90%
with diethylstilbestrol.

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:18.840 align:middle line:90%
It's a--

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What the heck is that?

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.373 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: It's a drug they
gave pregnant women in the 50s

00:15:22.373 --> 00:15:26.483 align:middle line:84%
and 60s under the false belief
that it prevented miscarriage.

00:15:26.483 --> 00:15:28.400 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know it was
a horrible carcinogen.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.240 align:middle line:84%
When we hit puberty,
we started dying.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, geez.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:34.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: I basically went
menopausal at puberty instead.

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:37.670 align:middle line:84%
So by the time I
was 30, I was so

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:40.850 align:middle line:84%
victimized by everything--
you have a brain tumor here.

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:42.470 align:middle line:84%
You have five
fractures in your back.

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:43.940 align:middle line:84%
You have-- oh, does
she have lupus?

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:47.190 align:middle line:84%
Just all of these things,
and I just went, no.

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:48.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm a witch.

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:51.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- and they said if
you made it to 50, you'd be--

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.540 align:middle line:84%
with not having all
these horrible cancers,

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:54.950 align:middle line:84%
you'd be in a wheelchair
because you have

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:56.240 align:middle line:90%
the bones of an 80-year-old.

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.450 align:middle line:90%
And I just said no.

00:15:57.450 --> 00:15:58.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm a witch.

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:01.310 align:middle line:84%
I believe we, as
humans, are powerful.

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:03.080 align:middle line:90%
We are divine and we are human.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.250 align:middle line:90%
We have free will.

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:05.720 align:middle line:90%
Every symptom went away--

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:08.810 align:middle line:84%
everything-- all the weird
rashes, the weird things.

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:12.380 align:middle line:84%
So at 50, instead of being
dead or in a wheelchair,

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:14.310 align:middle line:84%
I did the world's
hardest obstacle course.

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:16.052 align:middle line:84%
I got on that TV
show "Wipe Out."

00:16:16.052 --> 00:16:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've
done a lot of that.

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:19.177 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: I've done a
lot of weird things

00:16:19.177 --> 00:16:22.118 align:middle line:84%
to just prove how
amazing humans are.

00:16:22.118 --> 00:16:23.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you
remember that drug

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:25.970 align:middle line:84%
they gave women who were
pregnant-- thalidomide?

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:27.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: Thalidomide--
the flipper babies.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.095 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the
kids were born--

00:16:29.095 --> 00:16:30.560 align:middle line:84%
exactly, with little
flipper hands.

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.768 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: And ours was just
as bad or worse than that,

00:16:32.768 --> 00:16:34.280 align:middle line:84%
but the people
don't know about it

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.920 align:middle line:84%
because it was inside things,
or its reproductive things.

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:39.200 align:middle line:84%
So it was-- you don't
talk about it as much.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.750 align:middle line:84%
But it was considered the
biggest American tragedy ever.

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:42.668 align:middle line:90%
10 million people--

00:16:42.668 --> 00:16:43.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was horrible.

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:45.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: --effected
by it worldwide.

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:49.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now when you talked
about coming out of the closet,

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:50.270 align:middle line:90%
did you ever ride a broom?

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:52.128 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: [LAUGHS] I
use my broom every day.

00:16:52.128 --> 00:16:53.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Witches do
that, don't they?

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:55.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Yes, they do.

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:57.070 align:middle line:90%
The broom is actually the best.

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:58.850 align:middle line:84%
And the witch's
broom, it's actually

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:00.920 align:middle line:84%
how you can travel
between the world.

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.563 align:middle line:84%
Not so much straddling
it and flying--

00:17:03.563 --> 00:17:05.480 align:middle line:84%
I haven't gotten off the
ground with that yet.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:08.640 align:middle line:84%
But it's traveling the worlds,
through the veil with it, yes.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:09.440 align:middle line:90%
It's the best.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.550 align:middle line:90%
I will lie it down.

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:13.145 align:middle line:84%
On this side of the
broom is the real world,

00:17:13.145 --> 00:17:15.020 align:middle line:84%
where you go shopping
and you pay your bills.

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:17.930 align:middle line:84%
That side is a wonderment
where anything can happen.

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:20.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Patti, when people come
to you, what do they ask for,

00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:21.670 align:middle line:90%
primarily?

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:22.079 align:middle line:90%
What do they want?

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:23.599 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: OK, when
people come to me,

00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:26.660 align:middle line:84%
it's usually because something
in their life isn't going well.

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And like with anybody
who works in this field,

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:30.570 align:middle line:90%
love is number one.

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:32.720 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] It's love
isn't working right,

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:34.530 align:middle line:84%
or they can't find the
love of their life,

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:36.590 align:middle line:90%
or whatever that is.

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:39.330 align:middle line:84%
Love first, and then money and
career second, and then health,

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:40.130 align:middle line:90%
third.

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:41.755 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So when
people read your book,

00:17:41.755 --> 00:17:43.550 align:middle line:84%
"Magick For the
Modern World," what's

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:45.575 align:middle line:84%
the big thing you
want them to grasp?

00:17:45.575 --> 00:17:47.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: The big thing
I want them to grasp

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:50.960 align:middle line:84%
is that it's really easy
to change your life.

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.280 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't take money.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.760 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't take a lot of time.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.990 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't take a
thought-provoking anything.

00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:59.143 align:middle line:84%
Literally, if you've got
something you feel like

00:17:59.143 --> 00:18:00.560 align:middle line:84%
it's a curse,
because most aren't.

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:01.520 align:middle line:90%
Well, grab a lemon.

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.230 align:middle line:90%
Grab some salt. Do this thing.

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:04.130 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:05.210 align:middle line:90%
It goes away.

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:07.510 align:middle line:84%
Again, I'm combining
that belief system,

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:09.500 align:middle line:84%
that a body of
action and the magic

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:11.300 align:middle line:84%
that's in the
lemon and the salt.

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:14.810 align:middle line:84%
But again, I think I'm mostly
proud of those elemental

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:17.090 align:middle line:90%
exercises I do that can--

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:19.310 align:middle line:84%
I say 30 seconds to
cure almost anything.

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:21.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
you know it works?

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:22.820 align:middle line:90%
You see results, I assume?

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:23.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: I see results.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:24.400 align:middle line:90%
I see results.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.177 align:middle line:84%
I've seen people,
again, find that love

00:18:27.177 --> 00:18:29.510 align:middle line:84%
of their life, where they've
married the wrong person 10

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:30.310 align:middle line:90%
times.

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:32.960 align:middle line:84%
I've seen people change
their financial situations.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.090 align:middle line:84%
More than anything,
their health situations,

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:36.560 align:middle line:84%
because this is the most
important thing we have--

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because of
you, or because of them?

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:39.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Not because of me.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.130 align:middle line:90%
I don't do anything.

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:41.390 align:middle line:84%
I just give them
some suggestions.

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:42.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you
cast the spells.

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.225 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: I cast-- no,

00:18:44.225 --> 00:18:45.025 align:middle line:90%
We do it together.

00:18:45.025 --> 00:18:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like the money spell,
the love spell, the health

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:48.860 align:middle line:90%

>>NEGRI: We do it together.

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:52.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to go off--

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:55.400 align:middle line:84%
because again, for every
one legitimate one of me

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.350 align:middle line:84%
there are-- as you
know, there's thousands

00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:58.940 align:middle line:84%
of charlatans and
fakes, and people

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:01.650 align:middle line:84%
who don't know what they're
doing who take people's power.

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:03.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm about giving
people the power.

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:04.250 align:middle line:90%
You do this.

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:06.370 align:middle line:90%
Look if we do this together.

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:09.530 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, miraculous--
I've seen people who've

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:13.365 align:middle line:84%
had to take medication to not be
all nervous get off medication.

00:19:13.365 --> 00:19:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've got
a YouTube channel--

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:15.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: I do.

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:16.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --called
"HollyWitch Blvd."

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:17.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: "HollyWitch Blvd."

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:18.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I like that.

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:18.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Thank you.

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:20.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you talked
about a spell for money.

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:22.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Yes, let's look.

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:24.650 align:middle line:84%
I think we're ready to
cast our first spell--

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:27.010 align:middle line:90%
my money spell.

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:30.350 align:middle line:84%
First, what you'll need,
of course, is money.

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:34.550 align:middle line:84%
Just $1 bill, but I should warn
you, we are going to burn it.

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:37.500 align:middle line:84%
So first, to create your
space, light your candle

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:38.300 align:middle line:90%
and the incense.

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:41.360 align:middle line:90%


00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.490 align:middle line:84%
As you light your
candle and your incense,

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:46.950 align:middle line:84%
I want you thinking about
all the wonderful things

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:50.100 align:middle line:84%
that some extra money can
bring in to your life--

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:55.740 align:middle line:84%
ease, grace, happiness,
new shoes, paid off debts.

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And as you're thinking about it,
I want you to smell that money.

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:00.230 align:middle line:90%
I want you to taste it.

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:03.480 align:middle line:84%
I want you to feel it in
every cell of your bone.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And when you really got a good
visual, once you could really

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:09.800 align:middle line:84%
feel it, I want you to start
writing it on the dollar

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.630 align:middle line:90%
bill with passion.

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:13.550 align:middle line:84%
This is that
important part again.

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And then to add
the air element, I

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:18.380 align:middle line:84%
want you to waft it through
the incense three times--

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:20.870 align:middle line:90%
one, two, three.

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:24.350 align:middle line:84%
Then I want you to lay it
over the candle three times

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:26.540 align:middle line:90%
as you watch the flame.

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:30.752 align:middle line:84%
And on that third time,
I want you to light it.

00:20:30.752 --> 00:20:32.680 align:middle line:90%
[VOCALIZING]

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:37.500 align:middle line:90%


00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:38.950 align:middle line:90%
[SCREAMS]

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:41.470 align:middle line:84%
By the power of
three times three,

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:44.330 align:middle line:90%
this spell bound round shall be.

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:45.130 align:middle line:90%
You could say that.

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:46.380 align:middle line:90%
Or you could say, amen.

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:47.660 align:middle line:90%
Or you could say, ah-ho--

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:50.530 align:middle line:84%
just something to go, this
is complete and this is done.

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Now remember the
one real rule is

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:54.820 align:middle line:84%
don't do spell-working
on anybody else,

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:57.790 align:middle line:84%
and always stay in integrity
and work in the light,

00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:58.830 align:middle line:90%
and all will be well.

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:01.420 align:middle line:84%
So post a comment
below when your spell

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:03.130 align:middle line:90%
starts working because it will.

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:04.660 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's really fast.

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:06.340 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it takes
a little while.

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:09.280 align:middle line:84%
But believe me, it has
brought amazing abundance

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:11.065 align:middle line:84%
to tons of people
over the years.

00:21:11.065 --> 00:21:13.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Whoever that
person was is out $1.

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:14.140 align:middle line:90%
Or was it yours?

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:16.820 align:middle line:10%
>>NEGRI: [LAUGHS]
That was my dollar.

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:20.080 align:middle line:10%
But if somebody-- it's so
funny because we have this--

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.880 align:middle line:10%
again, our perceptions
about money,

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.710 align:middle line:10%
the sacred thing about money.

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:25.110 align:middle line:90%
And though I do think it is--

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:26.620 align:middle line:84%
probably you're not
supposed to burn money.

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:28.537 align:middle line:84%
The government doesn't
get mad unless you want

00:21:28.537 --> 00:21:29.737 align:middle line:90%
them to replace it for you.

00:21:29.737 --> 00:21:31.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, at least
it wasn't $100 bill.

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:33.112 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: It wasn't
a $100 bill, but I

00:21:33.112 --> 00:21:36.540 align:middle line:84%
bet you would-- if you put that
importance of that $100 bill,

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:37.720 align:middle line:90%
it would work even better.

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:38.660 align:middle line:90%
But you don't need to.

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:41.380 align:middle line:84%
And if somebody is really
troubled burning a $1 bill,

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:42.350 align:middle line:90%
use monopoly money.

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:43.150 align:middle line:90%
Use play money.

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:44.200 align:middle line:90%
Draw $1.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.680 align:middle line:84%
I've had people
from Canada going--

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:46.480 align:middle line:90%
coins.

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:47.650 align:middle line:90%
No, you can't burn a coin.

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:49.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How often
will that come back?

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:51.310 align:middle line:84%
That dollar will come
back how many times?

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:54.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: Oh, I started
doing this in the 80s--

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:55.720 align:middle line:90%
a kabillion times.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.910 align:middle line:84%
I've had people like, I
really need a computer,

00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:00.550 align:middle line:84%
and then somebody
gives them a computer.

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:05.190 align:middle line:84%
I've seen people get cars,
get jobs, get raises.

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:07.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a big lottery
person because I

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:10.590 align:middle line:84%
think that's a weirdness
and might be personal thing.

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:12.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
say go win lottery.

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:14.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't give you
lottery numbers.

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:18.700 align:middle line:84%
But it's asking the universe,
you changing your perception.

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:22.360 align:middle line:84%
Literally, you're sacrificing
your dollar bill, the old sac--

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:23.665 align:middle line:90%
and it just works.

00:22:23.665 --> 00:22:26.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why does
this work for me?

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:30.370 align:middle line:84%
I will-- whether it's Los
Angeles, or Boulder, Colorado,

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:33.400 align:middle line:84%
or St. Louis, see
a homeless person.

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's very difficult
for me to go past them

00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:38.920 align:middle line:90%
without giving them something--

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.840 align:middle line:90%
$5, $20.

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:43.450 align:middle line:84%
I've even given $100
every once in a while,

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:45.010 align:middle line:90%
just to see their face.

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:48.390 align:middle line:84%
Actually, that's one
of the reasons I do it.

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:51.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's to help them, but
it makes you feel good.

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:55.960 align:middle line:84%
But why is it when you
do that, it seems that it

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:57.263 align:middle line:90%
comes back to you five times?

00:22:57.263 --> 00:22:58.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: Because
that's the exact rule--

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:00.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean,
here's an example--

00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:04.270 align:middle line:84%
I gave a homeless person who
was outside the post office

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:08.675 align:middle line:84%
in Sherman Oaks,
California, $20.

00:23:08.675 --> 00:23:10.300 align:middle line:84%
He was sitting there
with a little sign

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:11.410 align:middle line:90%
right outside the door.

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:14.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, with his wife
and a little baby.

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:15.730 align:middle line:84%
It was horrible,
just seeing that.

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:17.680 align:middle line:90%
I gave him $20.

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:20.140 align:middle line:84%
Went into the post office,
opened up my little post office

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:22.480 align:middle line:84%
box, and there's an
insurance check in there

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:26.620 align:middle line:84%
that I have no idea
was coming, for $1,500.

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:27.580 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen?

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:29.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: That's the
law of the universe.

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:33.640 align:middle line:84%
What you put-- a cause and
effect, action and reaction.

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:36.280 align:middle line:84%
What you put out
comes back to you.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:40.077 align:middle line:84%
That's why I wouldn't do
curses or dark spells.

00:23:40.077 --> 00:23:41.410 align:middle line:90%
Because if you live in a world--

00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:42.785 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to curse
you-- then you

00:23:42.785 --> 00:23:45.340 align:middle line:84%
live in a worse world
where curses exist.

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:48.100 align:middle line:84%
If you give and you're
generous with your time,

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:51.472 align:middle line:84%
with your money, with your love,
that's what comes back to you.

00:23:51.472 --> 00:23:53.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's it like to
communicate with the dead?

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Oh, it's fabulous.

00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:56.290 align:middle line:90%
Dead people are fun.

00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:57.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Some of them.

00:23:57.370 --> 00:23:59.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: Some of them--
yeah, like humans, there's

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:03.140 align:middle line:84%
good ones and bad ones,
happy ones and cranky ones.

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:03.940 align:middle line:90%
But I think--

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:04.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Evil ones.

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:08.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: Evil ones-- but like
humans, most dead are good.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.220 align:middle line:90%
Most humans are good.

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:10.810 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there's those
serial killers

00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:12.033 align:middle line:90%
out there and those bad guys.

00:24:12.033 --> 00:24:13.825 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
communicate with them, too?

00:24:13.825 --> 00:24:15.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: I have.

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:16.150 align:middle line:90%
In real life, I don't.

00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:18.610 align:middle line:84%
Like if someone is coming
to a seance at my house,

00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:22.370 align:middle line:84%
we're only going to allow
in their dead loved ones

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:23.170 align:middle line:90%
and relatives.

00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:25.280 align:middle line:84%
Talk to grandma, even
working the Ouija Board.

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:26.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can you control that?

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:28.155 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: I can
completely control that.

00:24:28.155 --> 00:24:29.740 align:middle line:90%
This is our realm of existence.

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:34.250 align:middle line:84%
I firmly believe that the other
side has to play by our rules.

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:37.210 align:middle line:84%
Witches, we don't know that,
so we give away our power.

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:38.250 align:middle line:90%
We give away our power.

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:40.103 align:middle line:84%
So now I can go into
those dark places,

00:24:40.103 --> 00:24:42.520 align:middle line:84%
like on "Ghost Adventures,"
or the show, where they're not

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:44.590 align:middle line:84%
going to go talk
to grandma ghosts.

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:47.830 align:middle line:84%
They're going to talk to
the Black Dahlia killer.

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:50.800 align:middle line:84%
I still believe that I can
walk away from that completely.

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:52.120 align:middle line:90%
They have to play by our rules.

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:54.400 align:middle line:84%
We just give our power
over to them with fear,

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.070 align:middle line:84%
or anger, or just
not knowing better.

00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:57.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What have
you found, Patti,

00:24:57.570 --> 00:24:59.920 align:middle line:90%
that the dead want with us?

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:02.150 align:middle line:84%
Why do they communicate
through you, for example?

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:02.950 align:middle line:90%
What do they want?

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:05.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: I think,
well, sometimes they

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:07.390 align:middle line:90%
have messages they want to give.

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:10.370 align:middle line:84%
I think the coolest thing, what
they get out of it-- sometimes

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:11.170 align:middle line:90%
it is.

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:14.100 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, grandma's
not stuck in the house.

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:16.822 align:middle line:84%
Every-- oh, it's such a shame
they're not crossed over.

00:25:16.822 --> 00:25:18.280 align:middle line:84%
They're almost
always crossed over.

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:19.720 align:middle line:90%
They just like to visit.

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:22.570 align:middle line:84%
But communicating one
on one, whether it's

00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:25.270 align:middle line:84%
a mediumship or
a seance, I don't

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:27.600 align:middle line:84%
believe that there's time
and space on the other side.

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.260 align:middle line:84%
So they could be
everywhere, anywhere.

00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:33.280 align:middle line:84%
But when we are communicating
one on one, it's real time,

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:34.810 align:middle line:90%
and they love that.

00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:37.060 align:middle line:84%
So it's like grandma,
what's your--

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:39.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've literally gotten
iPhone codes from spirits

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:40.915 align:middle line:90%
so they can open up their--

00:25:40.915 --> 00:25:41.715 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:25:41.715 --> 00:25:43.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: Yeah, practical--
I like practical spirits.

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:45.410 align:middle line:84%
So it's great to go
smell the butterflies,

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:46.990 align:middle line:84%
but they need to
open this iPhone.

00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:49.940 align:middle line:84%
So they like it because
it's-- you could say,

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:50.740 align:middle line:90%
how are you doing?

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:51.700 align:middle line:90%
Where's the will?

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:53.420 align:middle line:84%
Real time-- and
so it's a win-win.

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:54.220 align:middle line:90%
We get--

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:55.015 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's under the bed?

00:25:55.015 --> 00:25:56.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: What's under the bed?

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:59.900 align:middle line:84%
We get from them solace,
happiness, information--

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:00.700 align:middle line:90%
whatever we get.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:03.298 align:middle line:84%
But they get real
with time, one on one,

00:26:03.298 --> 00:26:04.840 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's
the one thing they

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:05.860 align:middle line:90%
don't have on the other side.

00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:07.635 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Pretty remarkable--
you do a lot of seances?

00:26:07.635 --> 00:26:09.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: I do a lot of seances.

00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:11.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take a look
at you conducting a seance,

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.340 align:middle line:90%
so then we'll talk about it.

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:14.965 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: Guardians,
gods, and goddesses

00:26:14.965 --> 00:26:17.290 align:middle line:90%
of the watchtower of the East.

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Calling on gods and goddesses,
and guardians of the South.

00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:24.520 align:middle line:84%
Calling all guardians of
the watchtower of the West.

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:27.730 align:middle line:84%
Calling all guardians of
the watchtower of the North.

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:34.850 align:middle line:90%


00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:37.040 align:middle line:84%
So kind of what we
have here is a lot

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.810 align:middle line:84%
of representation of
some of the spirits

00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:42.160 align:middle line:90%
we're going to bring back for--

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:44.800 align:middle line:84%
just representation of all
the different entities.

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:47.298 align:middle line:84%
So if-- the more we could
really picture them, the better.

00:26:47.298 --> 00:26:48.840 align:middle line:84%
So if you need to
stare at something,

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:51.007 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's upside down
or the different things,

00:26:51.007 --> 00:26:52.290 align:middle line:90%
go for it.

00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:55.410 align:middle line:84%
Plus, we have different-- there
may be other modes besides

00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:58.410 align:middle line:84%
the Ouija Board that they
want to talk to us through,

00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:01.620 align:middle line:84%
like the tambourine,
or something may appear

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:03.528 align:middle line:84%
on our camera, or
there's a radio--

00:27:03.528 --> 00:27:05.070 align:middle line:84%
because there's a
lot of music going.

00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:07.460 align:middle line:84%
You're a musician and we're
dealing with two musicians.

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:09.990 align:middle line:84%
You might see something, a
flash in the side of your eye,

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:12.995 align:middle line:84%
or a cold or warm air
come all over you.

00:27:12.995 --> 00:27:15.120 align:middle line:84%
Or someone who's literally
talking to you that only

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:16.369 align:middle line:90%
you can hear.

00:27:16.369 --> 00:27:17.866 align:middle line:90%
[VOCALIZING]

00:27:17.866 --> 00:27:29.732 align:middle line:90%


00:27:29.732 --> 00:27:32.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you teach people
to communicate with the dead?

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:33.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: I can teach people.

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:34.885 align:middle line:90%
I think we're all born doing it.

00:27:34.885 --> 00:27:35.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: And I think
it just gets taught out

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:39.840 align:middle line:84%
of us, especially
in Western culture,

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.330 align:middle line:84%
because we're so matter of
fact, even our religion isn't

00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:43.320 align:middle line:90%
that spiritual.

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:46.150 align:middle line:84%
That's changing, but
that's your imagination.

00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:47.470 align:middle line:90%
This is real life.

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:49.500 align:middle line:84%
But I think we're
all born with it.

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's just-- it's
like going to the gym

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:54.300 align:middle line:84%
and learning to work out,
to just allow that intuition

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:55.290 align:middle line:90%
to come through.

00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:57.190 align:middle line:90%
There's exercises you can do.

00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:59.080 align:middle line:90%
There's meditations you can do.

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:02.760 align:middle line:84%
It's really just about
shutting down your left brain.

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:06.090 align:middle line:84%
You have to get reason
and logic out of the way

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:08.472 align:middle line:84%
and allow that world where--
that right brain side,

00:28:08.472 --> 00:28:09.555 align:middle line:90%
where anything can happen.

communicate with a loved one,

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:13.170 align:middle line:90%
what does that mean?

00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:15.510 align:middle line:84%
Who's been blocked,
or what's happening?

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:19.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: Well, if you cannot,
it could be your own fear,

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:24.240 align:middle line:84%
or your own doubt, or
your own disbelief.

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:27.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, sometimes they
really don't have anything

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:28.390 align:middle line:90%
to say they don't want to.

00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:30.180 align:middle line:84%
It's rare because
they usually do.

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:30.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:32.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: But there is some
spiritual, like, eh, I'm done.

00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:33.570 align:middle line:90%
I've moved on.

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:36.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to go back
and talk to anybody.

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:39.410 align:middle line:84%

a lot of blame effect to it.

>>NOORY: Do they reincarnate?

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:42.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: I think, yes.

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:44.520 align:middle line:90%
And what's crazy is that--

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:46.740 align:middle line:84%
I believe in
reincarnation, personally.

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:49.650 align:middle line:84%
Somebody told me who I
was a billion years ago.

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:52.083 align:middle line:84%
And actually, for the

00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:02.570 align:middle line:84%
and go, anybody come out
there, all the crazy people.

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:04.820 align:middle line:84%
So you don't do that
with a Ouija Board.

00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:08.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they should
be sold in toy stores.

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:11.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they should
have the same directions.

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:11.960 align:middle line:90%
This is not a toy.

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:12.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's not a game.

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:13.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: This should
not be a game.

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:14.583 align:middle line:90%
This should not be a toy.

00:34:14.583 --> 00:34:16.250 align:middle line:84%
There should not be
of a Barbie version.

00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:18.530 align:middle line:90%
I have the Barbie version, too.

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:20.870 align:middle line:90%
But I've literally had--

00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:22.790 align:middle line:84%
I have dozens of
them and I've never

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:24.380 align:middle line:84%
had a bad experience
with one ever,

00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:25.765 align:middle line:90%
because that is not my intent.

00:34:25.765 --> 00:34:27.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: God, I
had a horrible one.

00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:29.400 align:middle line:84%
When I was doing my
local show in St. Louis

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:34.310 align:middle line:84%
years ago, back in 1996, I had
a Ouija Board in the studio

00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:37.280 align:middle line:84%
because I was doing a
little show on Ouija Boards.

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:39.889 align:middle line:84%
Everything went wrong in
the studio technically

00:34:39.889 --> 00:34:41.060 align:middle line:90%
you can imagine.

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:42.739 align:middle line:90%
It never went wrong.

00:34:42.739 --> 00:34:45.020 align:middle line:84%
But this time,
everything went wrong.

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:46.159 align:middle line:90%
The board wouldn't work.

00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:47.929 align:middle line:90%
The commercials wouldn't run.

00:34:47.929 --> 00:34:51.469 align:middle line:84%
I finally gave it to my producer
and said, take this and get it

00:34:51.469 --> 00:34:53.239 align:middle line:90%
out of here, so he did.

00:34:53.239 --> 00:34:55.889 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know what he
did with it at the time.

00:34:55.889 --> 00:34:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden, I
had met one of our newscasters,

00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:00.825 align:middle line:90%
his name was Darryl.

00:35:00.825 --> 00:35:04.610 align:middle line:84%
A week later, Darryl had
been fired from our place,

00:35:04.610 --> 00:35:07.390 align:middle line:90%
for our station.

00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:08.640 align:middle line:90%
And I said, how are you doing?

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:09.680 align:middle line:90%
He said, not well.

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.030 align:middle line:90%
I said, what do you mean?

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:14.480 align:middle line:84%
He said, I got fired,
George, a week ago.

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:15.620 align:middle line:90%
You didn't know about that?

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And my relationship
fell down the tubes.

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:19.700 align:middle line:90%
Everything is wrong.

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And he said, but at least I
have that gift you gave me.

00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:25.340 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what gift?

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:29.650 align:middle line:84%
He said, Howard gave
me the Ouija Board.

00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:31.600 align:middle line:90%
I said, do you still have it?

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:32.440 align:middle line:90%
And he said, yeah.

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:35.300 align:middle line:90%
I said, Darryl, get rid of it.

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And he did and he got
rehired, and everything

00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:41.570 align:middle line:90%
started working for him again.

00:35:41.570 --> 00:35:42.860 align:middle line:90%
I don't like them, Patti.

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:43.660 align:middle line:90%
I don't like them.

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:44.493 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: I get that.

00:35:44.493 --> 00:35:47.050 align:middle line:84%
But see, that was a
bad one, or else we--

00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:49.060 align:middle line:90%
humans, or whatever, a spirit--

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:50.330 align:middle line:90%
that became a bad thing.

00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:52.990 align:middle line:84%
Again, we give the power
to things by our intention,

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:54.010 align:middle line:90%
I believe.

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:55.660 align:middle line:90%
So I haven't had a bad one.

00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:58.030 align:middle line:90%
And again, I'm intending not to.

00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:59.390 align:middle line:90%
But yes, get rid of it.

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:00.910 align:middle line:84%
I've had people
show up at my house.

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:03.430 align:middle line:84%
I had done a music
video, or somebody,

00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:06.838 align:middle line:84%
and we hadn't even
used a Ouija Board.

00:36:06.838 --> 00:36:09.130 align:middle line:84%
One day, all of a sudden, a
crew member, the camera man

00:36:09.130 --> 00:36:13.060 align:middle line:84%
was at my front door, handing
me this beautiful plywood

00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:14.352 align:middle line:90%
board from 1921, a Ouija Board.

00:36:14.352 --> 00:36:15.518 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm, classic, right?

00:36:15.518 --> 00:36:18.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: Yeah, classic, and it
had all sorts of weird symbols.

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:19.610 align:middle line:90%
He goes, will you take this?

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:20.817 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, sure.

00:36:20.817 --> 00:36:22.400 align:middle line:84%
He wouldn't give me
the history of it.

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:23.405 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He didn't
want it either.

00:36:23.405 --> 00:36:25.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: But again, I
think we're stronger.

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:27.460 align:middle line:84%
So if there's anything
bad, I get it out.

00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:29.410 align:middle line:90%
I have this haunted doll that--

00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:31.420 align:middle line:84%
the girl who sent it
to me from Belgium,

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:33.200 align:middle line:84%
it made her hair fall
out for three years.

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:34.000 align:middle line:90%
It made her sick.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:34.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god.

00:36:34.210 --> 00:36:35.668 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: But I got
that spirit out.

00:36:35.668 --> 00:36:37.553 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I didn't--
working with my guys.

00:36:37.553 --> 00:36:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And now I have a
beautiful haunted doll.

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:40.140 align:middle line:90%
It just has a nice little--

00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:41.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you heard of
Robert, the haunted doll, down

00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:42.115 align:middle line:90%
in Florida?

00:36:42.115 --> 00:36:43.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: Oh, yeah,
Robert the haunted doll.

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of people
have had horrible experiences

00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:45.850 align:middle line:90%
with him.

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:47.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: Peggy the
doll, in Zak's museum--

00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:49.670 align:middle line:84%
I did a seance with Peggy,
my first doll seance.

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:50.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They go
running around at night.

00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:52.783 align:middle line:84%
You can hear their
footsteps, pitter-patter.

00:36:52.783 --> 00:36:54.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: Yeah, my
doll runs around

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:55.990 align:middle line:90%
in the night a little bit.

00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:56.980 align:middle line:90%
You can see her eyes move.

00:36:56.980 --> 00:36:59.350 align:middle line:10%
They don't-- somebody will
do a photoshoot and she'll be

00:36:59.350 --> 00:36:59.950 align:middle line:10%
in the background.

00:36:59.950 --> 00:37:01.080 align:middle line:10%
She'll look different in every--

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:01.960 align:middle line:10%
I love haunted dolls.

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:03.627 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the
future hold for you?

00:37:03.627 --> 00:37:05.972 align:middle line:90%
What's next for you?

00:37:05.972 --> 00:37:08.483 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: I think I have to
keep writing a little bit

00:37:08.483 --> 00:37:10.650 align:middle line:84%
because again, I've had
such success with this book.

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:11.880 align:middle line:90%
And maybe I should do a--

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:13.920 align:middle line:84%
because I call this
a baby book, so I

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:15.300 align:middle line:90%
need to do a little bit more.

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:17.280 align:middle line:90%
I still want to do more TV.

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:19.590 align:middle line:90%
Because a bigger platform--

00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:22.140 align:middle line:84%
again, because it's all about
empowerment, not me or what I

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:23.010 align:middle line:90%
do.

00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:24.122 align:middle line:90%
People are so fabulous.

00:37:24.122 --> 00:37:25.080 align:middle line:90%
They have to know that.

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you had fun
with "Ghost Adventures."

00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:27.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: I love
"Ghost Adventures."

00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:29.370 align:middle line:90%
I love working with the boys.

00:37:29.370 --> 00:37:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And this last-- not
the one I just shot,

00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:32.850 align:middle line:90%
but the one that just aired--

00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:34.710 align:middle line:84%
this is the first
time Zak let me

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:36.380 align:middle line:90%
do a house clearing on camera.

00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:38.380 align:middle line:10%
Because that doesn't fit
the style of the show--

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:39.780 align:middle line:10%
it's these big guys
that come in and--

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:40.570 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Right, tough guys.

00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:41.700 align:middle line:10%
>>NEGRI: --and goes away.

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:43.260 align:middle line:10%
But this time, he's like--

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:46.620 align:middle line:10%
and after they're lock down and
everything, go in to clear it.

00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:48.360 align:middle line:10%
So it's like, yay, resolution.

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:51.150 align:middle line:10%
Yay, you can get rid of a
haunted house if you want to.

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:52.635 align:middle line:10%
So that was huge progress.

00:37:52.635 --> 00:37:53.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's great.

00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:55.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, Patti, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:57.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: My honor--
thank you, George.

00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:57.390 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:37:57.390 --> 00:37:58.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's great for
you being a good witch.

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:00.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: I am a good witch.

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:01.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Much better
than being a bad witch.

00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:02.505 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: I don't want
to be a bad witch.

00:38:02.505 --> 00:38:04.172 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Absolutely
not-- you know what?

00:38:04.172 --> 00:38:06.840 align:middle line:10%
I, for years, have
interviewed people

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:10.020 align:middle line:10%
who have dabbled in witchcraft
and the psychic realm,

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:12.060 align:middle line:10%
and they're mediums,
and it's always

00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:16.470 align:middle line:10%
refreshing to see them so
upbeat about the other side,

00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:18.090 align:middle line:10%
and Patti is one of those.

00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:20.880 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for doing what
you do, Patti, and thanks

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:23.270 align:middle line:90%
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:28.843 align:middle line:90%
