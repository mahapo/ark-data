Hello, everybody.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.844 align:middle line:90%
And welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:43.844 --> 00:00:45.010 align:middle line:90%
It's great to have you here.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.450 align:middle line:84%
How many of you have
been interested in trying

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.180 align:middle line:84%
to find out the
history of modern man?

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.670 align:middle line:84%
How he developed, and
the things that happened?

Well, what we have
for you tonight

William Henry.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.630 align:middle line:10%
William, come on.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:00.950 align:middle line:90%
Come on down.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:01.435 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAM HENRY:
Thank you, George.

00:01:01.435 --> 00:01:01.920 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: How are you?

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.405 align:middle line:90%
Good to have you.

00:01:02.405 --> 00:01:02.905 align:middle line:90%
Have a seat.

00:01:02.905 --> 00:01:03.860 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Thank you.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:04.830 align:middle line:90%
Hi, you guys.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.584 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Now tell us, what is
an investigative mythologist?

00:01:08.584 --> 00:01:11.000 align:middle line:10%
>> HENRY: Well, I look at myth
and history from a symbolic

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.500 align:middle line:10%
perspective.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.630 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people think
history repeats itself.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.940 align:middle line:10%
And I look for evidence
of that, thinking well,

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.080 align:middle line:10%
we tend to do the same
things over and over again.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we're repeating
ancient myths and legends

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.610 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.180 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I think
that's the case.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.596 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I think
we probably are.

00:01:23.596 --> 00:01:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And I happen to
think and believe

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.650 align:middle line:84%
that civilizations are
much older than what

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:30.460 align:middle line:90%
we think they are.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.450 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Perhaps millions
of years older than we think.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.730 align:middle line:84%
But let's just go back,
conservative, and play it

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.232 align:middle line:90%
around 10,000, 12,000 years.

00:01:36.232 --> 00:01:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: That's
still a long time.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:38.030 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Yeah.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.430 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It really is.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.180 align:middle line:84%
How did you get
interested in all of this?

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: I read "Holy
Blood, Holy Grail," in 1982,

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.050 align:middle line:90%
the moment it came out.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.920 align:middle line:90%
I was in college.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.370 align:middle line:84%
I was going to be an
entertainment lawyer.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:47.680 align:middle line:90%
And that book changed my life.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.888 align:middle line:84%
And there was something in
that book, a power packet.

00:01:49.888 --> 00:01:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
it's the book that

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:52.650 align:middle line:90%
featured Rennes-le-Chateau.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.670 align:middle line:84%
Said there was all these
mysteries about Jesus and Mary

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.980 align:middle line:90%
Magdalene.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.070 align:middle line:84%
It became the basis for
"The Davinci Code," which,

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.450 align:middle line:84%
of course, went on to
sell 85 million copies

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.130 align:middle line:84%
and inspired a
whole lot of people

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.636 align:middle line:90%
to explore the grail mysteries.

00:02:02.636 --> 00:02:05.010 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You are a pretty
accomplished author, yourself,

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.710 align:middle line:90%
aren't you?

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:06.240 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Thank you, yeah.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.200 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What are some of
your favorite books that

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.750 align:middle line:90%
you've written?

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.833 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Well, my most
recent one is my favorite,

00:02:09.833 --> 00:02:11.000 align:middle line:90%
"The Judgment Day Device."

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.840 align:middle line:84%
Before that, "The
Secret of Zion."

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.757 align:middle line:84%
People know me for
"Cloak of the Illuminati"

00:02:14.757 --> 00:02:16.340 align:middle line:84%
and "Crystal Halls
of Christ's Court."

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.980 align:middle line:84%
I've written, I
think, 17 books, now.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:18.730 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh, my gosh.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:19.980 align:middle line:90%
I'd say you're pretty prolific.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:20.340 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Yeah.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do you think
we're in the early stages

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.140 align:middle line:90%
of the apocalypse, end times?

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.750 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: I know we are.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.090 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people thought
maybe it ended at 2012.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.900 align:middle line:84%
But actually that's
just the beginning.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.235 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Probably
just started at 2012.

00:02:31.235 --> 00:02:32.860 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: A lot of
unfinished business.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:33.941 align:middle line:90%
And we're in it now.

00:02:33.941 --> 00:02:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And day to day, we're seeing
more and more evidence of that.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.920 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, you know, we see
evidence of locusts in Egypt,

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.350 align:middle line:84%
which they talk about as being
part of the 10 plagues out

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.850 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:43.690 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Right.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.950 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.366 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And you look at those
signs and you go, my gosh,

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:47.384 align:middle line:90%
is this real?

00:02:47.384 --> 00:02:48.050 align:middle line:90%
It is, isn't it?

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.675 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Yeah.

00:02:48.675 --> 00:02:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And people thought,
well, you know,

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.930 align:middle line:90%
nothing really happened on 2012.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.540 align:middle line:90%
But it sure did.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.610 align:middle line:90%
There was a huge shift.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And then, now you
have the next pope,

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.890 align:middle line:90%
last pope prophecy of Malachi.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And people are really
paying attention to that.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
kinds of things

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.800 align:middle line:84%
that just really
make you wonder.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.425 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's kind
of scary, isn't it?

00:03:04.425 --> 00:03:08.530 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Well, it is scary,
because it forces everybody--

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.260 align:middle line:84%
it's the judgment day scenario,
when your heart is weighed

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.980 align:middle line:84%
against the feather
of cosmic truth.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.225 align:middle line:84%
And so people have to
look inside and say,

00:03:15.225 --> 00:03:16.520 align:middle line:90%
hey, how am I doing?

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.670 align:middle line:84%
Have I lived my
life to my maximum?

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:19.900 align:middle line:90%
Have I worked out my karma?

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.760 align:middle line:90%
Have I been a good person?

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.590 align:middle line:84%
How light-hearted
of a person am I?

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.572 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't feel
like your light-hearted,

00:03:25.572 --> 00:03:27.780 align:middle line:84%
then now is the time to
really start working on that.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And opening up the heart chakra,
being kinder, being nicer,

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.400 align:middle line:90%
and exploring mysteries.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: William, if somebody
has not had one of those

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.830 align:middle line:84%
stellar lives, has not been
nice, probably hurt people.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.282 align:middle line:84%
What happens to them
in the other life?

00:03:42.282 --> 00:03:43.990 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Lots of
different perspectives.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.036 align:middle line:84%
I'm deep into research right
now on the Native American

00:03:47.036 --> 00:03:48.410 align:middle line:84%
tradition, they
call it "the path

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.780 align:middle line:84%
of souls," where they
believe the soul would

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.550 align:middle line:84%
be able to jump into the Milky
Way via the gateway of Orion.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And they have
accommodation for that.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.770 align:middle line:84%
That there would be guides
that would be there waiting

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.730 align:middle line:84%
for you to take you further
or to, perhaps, hold you back.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And one example is, there's
dogs that guard the gateways.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.981 align:middle line:84%
And if you've ever been
cruel to a dog in your life,

00:04:09.981 --> 00:04:11.480 align:middle line:84%
you're not getting
through the gate.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.396 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I love dogs.

00:04:12.396 --> 00:04:13.870 align:middle line:90%
I've been good to them.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.560 align:middle line:84%
Now these dogs, are
they the Dobermans

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.720 align:middle line:84%
with red eyes that
we see in movies.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.300 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Well, yeah.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.459 align:middle line:84%
They're described as
pretty ferocious, really.

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:20.860 align:middle line:90%
But yeah.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.640 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You were one of the
first to talk about stargates.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.222 align:middle line:90%
What are stargates?

00:04:25.222 --> 00:04:27.680 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Well, stargates, you
can find a stargate on three

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.180 align:middle line:90%
levels.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.360 align:middle line:84%
One, it's the connection
from the heart of one sun

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.030 align:middle line:84%
or star to another
star or star system.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.570 align:middle line:84%
It's also a portal, a gateway
from a star to a star system.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's a place on Earth where
the energy of a star or star

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.540 align:middle line:84%
system saturates the soil,
making it a higher energy

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:46.156 align:middle line:90%
place.

00:04:46.156 --> 00:04:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And then of course, as
you see in the movies,

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.950 align:middle line:84%
it's literally a
portal or a gateway.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.820 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Yeah, it
is that pathway.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.040 align:middle line:84%
I've long suspected
that if we're

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.830 align:middle line:84%
being visited by
extraterrestrials, obviously,

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.340 align:middle line:84%
they're not coming
here conventionally.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.500 align:middle line:84%
Not the way that we are
travelling right now.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.790 align:middle line:84%
I've always thought they had the
ability to bend space and time,

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.500 align:middle line:84%
and go through, like
the movie "Contact"

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.476 align:middle line:84%
some kind of a worm
hole or something.

00:05:10.476 --> 00:05:11.350 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Absolutely.

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
as many readers know,

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm deeply interested in the
work of Zecharia Sitchin.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And he would talk about the
Anunnaki traveling the universe

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.400 align:middle line:90%
in tin can spaceships.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.860 align:middle line:84%
But then he would show this
incredible artwork showing

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.810 align:middle line:84%
these same God beings coming
and going through gateways.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And their artwork
clearly showed that this

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.300 align:middle line:84%
was one of their
modes of travel.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.810 align:middle line:84%
At least, the most
super-advanced guys.

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.360 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Now is it a
gateway within our universe?

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.280 align:middle line:84%
Or is it a connection
to other universes?

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.660 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Well, it's a
connection from the Earth

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.730 align:middle line:90%
to other star systems.

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And maybe even inter-dimensional
travel, as well.

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, according
to the Sumerian scholars

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.630 align:middle line:84%
in the Chicago
Assyrian Dictionary,

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.540 align:middle line:84%
the word the nibiru,
which is the name

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.850 align:middle line:84%
of the planet the Anunnaki
came from, actually

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.650 align:middle line:84%
means a stargate
or crossing place.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.710 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Hundreds of
people, hundreds of people,

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.390 align:middle line:84%
if not thousands, disappear
off this planet every day.

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:05.134 align:middle line:90%
They're gone.

00:06:05.134 --> 00:06:06.300 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knows where they are.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.966 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Right.

00:06:06.966 --> 00:06:10.120 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is it possible
that they're walking along,

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.930 align:middle line:84%
they step into one of these
portals-- you can't see them,

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.060 align:middle line:90%
right?-- and they just vanish?

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.290 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: It's a possibility.

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.050 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that
I get hung up on,

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.770 align:middle line:84%
in answering a question most
affirmatively about that,

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.910 align:middle line:84%
is that, especially
in the ancient stories

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.802 align:middle line:84%
about the stargates, whenever
they would talk about humans

00:06:26.802 --> 00:06:28.510 align:middle line:84%
going through the
gates, there was always

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:33.140 align:middle line:84%
these really profound teachings
about human transformation.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.030 align:middle line:84%
An ordinary human couldn't go
through the gate of the gods.

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:39.519 align:middle line:84%
They had to become more pure,
or perfect, in order to do that.

00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:41.810 align:middle line:84%
And that was kind of the
point of the gods coming here.

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.630 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So we don't
all have that key, do we?

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.171 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Well, we have it, but
we just haven't activated it.

00:06:46.171 --> 00:06:48.800 align:middle line:84%
We all have the capability
of raising ourselves

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.910 align:middle line:84%
to a higher level of vibration,
or transforming ourselves

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.800 align:middle line:84%
into the next level of human
that's capable of doing this.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.594 align:middle line:84%
But many of us
just choose not to.

00:06:56.594 --> 00:06:58.510 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How many of
these portals are there,

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.310 align:middle line:90%
do you think, on this planet?

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.260 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Conservatively,
there's a dozen.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.177 align:middle line:84%
Beyond that, there's
probably thousands.

00:07:04.177 --> 00:07:05.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because
actually, it could be,

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.880 align:middle line:84%
anywhere you are could
conceivably be that portal.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.550 align:middle line:84%
Because, in fact,
the human body itself

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:13.360 align:middle line:84%
is considered to be a
portal or a gateway.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.010 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How do you learn
how to travel through one?

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:17.965 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Well, you--
first of all, you--

00:07:17.965 --> 00:07:19.340 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: That's
not easy, is it?

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.450 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: No, it's not easy.

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:22.380 align:middle line:84%
But again, the question
kind of goes back to,

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.680 align:middle line:84%
what they want to know is,
how pure of a being are you?

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.000 align:middle line:90%
How pure hearted are you?

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.910 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems like they don't
want the riff-raff out there

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:29.744 align:middle line:90%
in space.

00:07:29.744 --> 00:07:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of a
bone of contention.

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:32.620 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Oh, they're stuck
here on this planet, eh?

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:35.036 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Yeah, we're here in
cosmic kindergarten until we

00:07:35.036 --> 00:07:36.490 align:middle line:90%
graduate to first grade.

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:38.054 align:middle line:84%
And that's maybe a
bone I would have

00:07:38.054 --> 00:07:40.220 align:middle line:84%
to pick with the writers
of "Stargate," for example,

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.710 align:middle line:84%
where they show them
taking a nuclear missile

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:42.770 align:middle line:90%
through a stargate.

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:43.140 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:44.500 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: In the real world,
I don't think that's going

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:44.770 align:middle line:90%
happen.

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:44.950 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That doesn't happen?

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:45.491 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: No.

00:07:45.491 --> 00:07:47.560 align:middle line:84%
The beings that
guard these gates,

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.920 align:middle line:84%
and maybe even created them,
wouldn't allow something

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:50.520 align:middle line:90%
like that to happen.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.280 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They would
shut it down right away.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.155 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: They would
shut it down right away.

00:07:53.155 --> 00:07:56.530 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Iraq, there was some
interest in why we went there.

00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:00.220 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, we never found
weapons of mass destruction.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.555 align:middle line:84%
You believe that there's
something else there.

00:08:02.555 --> 00:08:03.430 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Absolutely.

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:05.860 align:middle line:84%
I started watching,
or following,

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:09.240 align:middle line:84%
the story of Saddam Hussein
in the early '90s when,

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.750 align:middle line:84%
after we first
went into the Gulf.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And I learned then
that Saddam believed

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:17.444 align:middle line:84%
he was the reincarnation of the
biblical king Nebuchadnezzar.

00:08:17.444 --> 00:08:18.110 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:19.330 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Huge
figure of prophesy.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:20.940 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: He even had a
Nebuchadnezzar army, didn't he?

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:22.106 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: He absolutely did.

00:08:22.106 --> 00:08:24.420 align:middle line:84%
He had paintings of
himself as Nebuchadnezzar.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, he rebuilt
Babylon in the 1980s,

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.570 align:middle line:90%
to the tune of $500 million.

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And had bricks that said,
to King Nebuchadnezzar

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:34.090 align:middle line:90%
in the reign of Saddam Hussein.

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:36.909 align:middle line:84%
So he was connecting
himself with that figure.

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:38.070 align:middle line:90%
And so think about this.

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:41.559 align:middle line:84%
We have a major world
figure who proclaims himself

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:43.696 align:middle line:84%
the reincarnation
of a biblical king.

00:08:43.696 --> 00:08:44.820 align:middle line:90%
Not just any biblical kind.

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:45.400 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And believed it.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.774 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: And
believed it, right.

00:08:46.774 --> 00:08:50.150 align:middle line:84%
But the biblical king who looted
and leveled Solomon's Temple

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:52.420 align:middle line:84%
in Jerusalem, was
the last known person

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.540 align:middle line:84%
to have the Ark of
the Covenant, perhaps.

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And he's proclaiming
himself this figure.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we
had to stop him.

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And so what I started doing is
following the art newspapers

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:04.620 align:middle line:90%
in the mid '90s.

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.514 align:middle line:84%
Because remember those
UN weapons inspectors.

00:09:07.514 --> 00:09:08.180 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.870 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: They're
going into Iraq,

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:12.300 align:middle line:84%
presumably doing nuclear
work, and that sort of thing.

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:12.990 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Looking everywhere.

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:13.960 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Looking everywhere.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And they're coming out
with their pockets loaded

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:17.840 align:middle line:90%
with ancient Iraqi artifacts.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:18.382 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Ah.

00:09:18.382 --> 00:09:20.339 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: And selling
them on the black market.

00:09:20.339 --> 00:09:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And so I took a huge
interest in this,

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:24.260 align:middle line:84%
because these little tiny
lipstick-sized cylinder

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:28.140 align:middle line:84%
seals were one of the ways that
the ancient Sumerians document

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.230 align:middle line:84%
their connection with the
gods, with the Anunnaki.

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:31.640 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: That's what
Zecharia would study, right?

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:32.540 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Absolutely.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And they're in the museums
all around the world.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:35.956 align:middle line:84%
And what is in the
open literature

00:09:35.956 --> 00:09:39.620 align:middle line:84%
is just mind-boggling--
spaceship-looking things,

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.172 align:middle line:90%
technology.

00:09:41.172 --> 00:09:43.130 align:middle line:84%
These are the real weapons
of mass destruction,

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:44.838 align:middle line:84%
I'm convinced, Saddam
actually possessed,

00:09:44.838 --> 00:09:46.690 align:middle line:84%
because he was-- what
he was trying to do

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:49.390 align:middle line:84%
was to create sort of a
Disneyland for the Anunnaki

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:50.320 align:middle line:90%
in Baghdad.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.050 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to bring tourists
from all over the planet

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:56.090 align:middle line:84%
to learn about our connection
with these ancient gods.

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And he rolls this knowledge out
into Judeo-Christian culture.

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:00.390 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:01.630 align:middle line:90%
That's bad news.

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:03.650 align:middle line:84%
Because it basically
says that, wait a minute,

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:05.960 align:middle line:84%
the underpinnings of
Western civilization

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.430 align:middle line:90%
are not as solid as we think.

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, goes back
thousands of years before that.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:12.340 align:middle line:90%
And Saddam had the evidence.

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:15.127 align:middle line:84%
And so what do we do when
we go into Baghdad in 2003?

00:10:15.127 --> 00:10:16.460 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Hit the museum, right?

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.376 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: We hit the
museum right off the bat.

00:10:18.376 --> 00:10:18.940 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.997 align:middle line:84%
Because that's where a lot of
the real goods were housed.

00:10:21.997 --> 00:10:24.330 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, most of that
stuff, they never got back,

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:24.550 align:middle line:90%
did they?

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:25.600 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: No, they
never got it back.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.600 align:middle line:84%
And it makes you wonder,
if this is what they're

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.600 align:middle line:84%
showing in the open literature,
what did Saddam actually have?

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.490 align:middle line:84%
Maybe in his palaces,
all those palaces

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:36.630 align:middle line:84%
that he had,
magnificent palaces.

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.560 align:middle line:90%
And we'll probably never know.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.140 align:middle line:84%
But my guess is, it's
probably in Langley, Virginia

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:43.420 align:middle line:90%
with the CIA.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:44.840 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's out in New Mexico.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:45.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't know whatever
happened to it.

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Or some billionaire
has it in his house.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:47.970 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Yeah.

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:48.650 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:50.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you find
that's very common.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:52.608 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I'm convinced, and
we're going to talk soon about

00:10:52.608 --> 00:10:54.630 align:middle line:84%
the Ark of the Covenant--
somebody has it.

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:58.221 align:middle line:84%
I think someone physically has
it as their own little museum

00:10:58.221 --> 00:10:58.720 align:middle line:90%
piece.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:10:59.220 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Yeah.

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:00.610 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it happens all the time.

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:01.985 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these
private collections

00:11:01.985 --> 00:11:04.350 align:middle line:84%
have some astounding
pieces in them

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:06.574 align:middle line:84%
that fill in huge
gaps in our knowledge.

00:11:06.574 --> 00:11:07.490 align:middle line:90%
And we really need it.

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:09.690 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: If you had
that much money, William,

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:12.420 align:middle line:84%
and you could buy anything
you want on this planet.

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:15.940 align:middle line:84%
You can go anywhere that you
want to go on this planet.

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:18.460 align:middle line:84%
The one thing you
don't have would

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:21.510 align:middle line:84%
be these ancient relics,
the chalice of Jesus,

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:23.990 align:middle line:84%
the Ark of the Covenant,
things like that.

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:25.729 align:middle line:84%
And if you had
that kind of money,

00:11:25.729 --> 00:11:28.270 align:middle line:84%
you would do whatever you had
to do you spend it to get that.

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:30.190 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Well, you would do it
because it holds the promise,

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:31.790 align:middle line:84%
the grail, the Ark
of the Covenant,

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:33.789 align:middle line:84%
many of these artifacts,
this ancient knowledge,

00:11:33.789 --> 00:11:37.630 align:middle line:84%
is about human transformation
and immortality.

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:38.860 align:middle line:90%
And that's why they seek it.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:40.609 align:middle line:84%
As soon as people
make a lot of money,

00:11:40.609 --> 00:11:41.650 align:middle line:90%
they want to live longer.

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:41.980 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yes they do.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:44.438 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: So they can hold
their money longer and spend it.

00:11:44.438 --> 00:11:46.550 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
key that drives

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:49.684 align:middle line:84%
a lot of these seekers is,
not just the incredible power

00:11:49.684 --> 00:11:50.850 align:middle line:90%
from a military perspective.

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:52.560 align:middle line:90%
I mean, FDR sought the grail.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:53.900 align:middle line:90%
So did Adolf Hitler.

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:56.800 align:middle line:84%
Not for the power of love,
but for the love of power.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:57.640 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And life.

00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:57.960 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Yes.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.650 align:middle line:84%
Because they knew
they could weaponize

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:01.080 align:middle line:90%
the true grail secrets.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.000 align:middle line:90%
It's not a cup.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.170 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Oh, Hugo Chavez, the
late president of Venezuela,

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:09.490 align:middle line:84%
apparently had $2 billion
in his bank account.

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:13.730 align:middle line:84%
But on his deathbed, he
was begging his doctors,

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:16.180 align:middle line:90%
don't let me die.

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.521 align:middle line:90%
He didn't want to leave.

00:12:17.521 --> 00:12:18.270 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Exactly.

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:21.665 align:middle line:84%
So that's the one thing we
try to buy, is more time.

00:12:21.665 --> 00:12:23.790 align:middle line:84%
But hey, maybe when your
time's up, your time's up.

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:26.040 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: When your time's
up, your time's up, indeed.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.270 align:middle line:84%
You seem like you have fun
doing what you're doing.

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:29.270 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Oh, I love it.

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:31.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's endlessly
challenging, endlessly

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.642 align:middle line:84%
fascinating, never
going to know everything

00:12:33.642 --> 00:12:35.350 align:middle line:84%
but going to have fun
trying to find out.

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:36.975 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is it
frustrating, sometimes?

00:12:36.975 --> 00:12:37.950 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Yeah, it is.

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:39.455 align:middle line:90%
Because you realize, wow!

00:12:39.455 --> 00:12:41.580 align:middle line:84%
Like when I wrote my recent
book, "The Judgment Day

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:45.650 align:middle line:84%
Device," it was such a huge load
following these guys around,

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:49.220 align:middle line:84%
because you just realized,
I don't have the IQ

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:51.149 align:middle line:90%
that some of these figures had.

00:12:51.149 --> 00:12:52.190 align:middle line:90%
And to be able to piece--

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:55.100 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And if you say that,
they really must have an IQ.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:57.230 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: No, I mean,
I'm in awe, really,

00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:02.191 align:middle line:84%
of like a Moses-type of a figure
who could conceive of, or could

00:13:02.191 --> 00:13:03.690 align:middle line:84%
create like the Ark
of the Covenant,

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:04.981 align:middle line:90%
and some of these other things.

00:13:04.981 --> 00:13:07.630 align:middle line:84%
We are talking some
major, major brains here.

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:09.232 align:middle line:84%
And that was part
of the challenge,

00:13:09.232 --> 00:13:11.190 align:middle line:84%
but it's also the fun of
following them around,

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:13.040 align:middle line:84%
is just to try to get a
little closer to them.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.060 align:middle line:90%
Maybe something will rub off.

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:14.670 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Exactly.

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:16.990 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take some
questions for William Henry.

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:20.070 align:middle line:84%
Who's got one for us, as we
talk about ancient times?

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:21.177 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:13:21.177 --> 00:13:23.510 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Do you believe
that the average American is

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:27.150 align:middle line:84%
prepared for the fundamental
change in their belief system

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:29.025 align:middle line:84%
that this knowledge
would bring about?

00:13:29.025 --> 00:13:30.650 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: I think
the average American,

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:33.040 align:middle line:84%
especially if you're thinking
the average American is someone

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.039 align:middle line:84%
who has maybe had a little
bit of Sunday school,

00:13:35.039 --> 00:13:39.480 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of history,
largely would be unprepared,

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.320 align:middle line:84%
but could quickly be
brought up to speed,

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.230 align:middle line:84%
because everybody has
an innate curiosity.

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:47.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's what this
is ultimately feeding.

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that
it would certainly

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.860 align:middle line:84%
be challenging to
their belief system.

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:55.870 align:middle line:84%
But then, once you
really dig in to many

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:59.170 align:middle line:84%
of the religious traditions,
be it Judaism, Christianity,

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:02.770 align:middle line:84%
or Islam, you find that
they're deeply mystical, deeply

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:06.160 align:middle line:84%
connected with star beings,
or beings from other realms.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.195 align:middle line:84%
And with a little bit
of prompting and maybe

00:14:08.195 --> 00:14:10.320 align:middle line:84%
some research, they would
say, well, wait a minute.

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.110 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there is a
broader universe

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:13.967 align:middle line:90%
than I've thought of before.

00:14:13.967 --> 00:14:15.800 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do you think
governments, William,

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.447 align:middle line:84%
would suppress
information from people

00:14:18.447 --> 00:14:19.530 align:middle line:90%
because they're concerned?

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:20.380 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Oh, yeah.

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:23.100 align:middle line:84%
They've undoubtedly
suppressed it for a long time,

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:24.540 align:middle line:90%
because it's a control factor.

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:26.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they've
actually done studies

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.440 align:middle line:84%
on this, and thinking
that they would completely

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.800 align:middle line:84%
lose control of civilization
if some of this information

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:31.601 align:middle line:90%
is widely known.

00:14:31.601 --> 00:14:33.850 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: OK another question
for William Henry, here.

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:34.400 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:35.720 align:middle line:90%
Right over here.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:40.600 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: We here in the West
and Southwest see more Mexican

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:45.700 align:middle line:84%
and Latin American artwork
than we do European artwork.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:51.500 align:middle line:84%
So I was wondering if you've
done much research into that?

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:54.120 align:middle line:84%
Because of things
like the paintings

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:57.210 align:middle line:84%
of the Virgin of Guadalupe,
that we see so often,

00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:58.130 align:middle line:90%
things like that.

00:14:58.130 --> 00:14:59.671 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: That's
one of my favorites,

00:14:59.671 --> 00:15:02.690 align:middle line:84%
where the mother Mary is in
her star cloak with the rainbow

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:03.300 align:middle line:90%
around her.

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:06.260 align:middle line:84%
This is what they call the light
body, or the robe of light,

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:07.930 align:middle line:90%
or the rainbow body.

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And so she's a prime
exemplar of, perhaps,

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:13.020 align:middle line:84%
evidence of a figure
who's achieved

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.970 align:middle line:84%
the next level of human
evolution, light body, rainbow

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:19.130 align:middle line:84%
body, and has the
ability to bi-locate,

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:21.900 align:middle line:84%
can instantly manifest or
spontaneously manifest.

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:24.120 align:middle line:90%
So she's a wonderful example.

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'm hugely
interested, right now,

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.610 align:middle line:84%
in many of the Native
American legends.

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:31.560 align:middle line:84%
Some of the Western
legends and even

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:34.210 align:middle line:84%
into the Eastern United
States, are fascinating.

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm discovering
is how deeply

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:40.950 align:middle line:84%
they correlate with some of the
European traditions, as well.

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:44.830 align:middle line:84%
So it seems to me,
there's one global story,

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:48.080 align:middle line:84%
at one point, that has sort
of-- like a broken mirror.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.790 align:middle line:84%
There's little shards
all over the place.

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:51.165 align:middle line:84%
When you piece
them all together,

00:15:51.165 --> 00:15:53.440 align:middle line:84%
it's going to ultimately
reveal the complete story.

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:57.760 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Isn't it incredible
how all these ancient cultures

00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.090 align:middle line:90%
all had similarities?

00:15:59.090 --> 00:15:59.880 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Yeah.

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.610 align:middle line:84%
And so that points
to the idea, there

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:03.679 align:middle line:84%
must have been an
original source.

00:16:03.679 --> 00:16:04.512 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Somewhere.

00:16:04.512 --> 00:16:05.345 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Somewhere.

00:16:05.345 --> 00:16:07.810 align:middle line:84%
The global flood myth is
the penultimate example.

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:09.060 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And it
communicated with everything.

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:10.393 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Yeah, it's everywhere.

00:16:10.393 --> 00:16:12.600 align:middle line:84%
So something had to have
happened at some point,

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:16.150 align:middle line:84%
and all of these cultures have
a slight variation on the story,

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:17.420 align:middle line:90%
but it's essentially the same.

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:19.336 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Another question
with William Henry?

00:16:19.336 --> 00:16:19.920 align:middle line:90%
Yes ma'am.

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:22.211 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: William, would
you describe for us what is

00:16:22.211 --> 00:16:26.211 align:middle line:84%
referred to in the literature
as the underground stream?

00:16:26.211 --> 00:16:27.585 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: The
underground stream.

00:16:27.585 --> 00:16:28.550 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What is that?

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Yeah, when you're
talking, and you go subrosa.

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:32.880 align:middle line:90%
It's beneath the surface.

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:36.260 align:middle line:84%
It's something often that's
hidden, but is kind of it

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.869 align:middle line:84%
weaves its way through
all the traditions.

00:16:38.869 --> 00:16:40.410 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's not
a stream of water?

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:41.120 align:middle line:90%
It's more--

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.440 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: No, it's a
stream of consciousness,

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:44.470 align:middle line:84%
a stream of thought,
stream of knowledge.

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:46.950 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And if you're in
that stream, what happens?

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:51.010 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: You're bathed in
the wisdom of all those world

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:52.150 align:middle line:90%
sacred traditions.

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:54.420 align:middle line:84%
And you're on the
path into, ultimately,

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:55.670 align:middle line:90%
the great cosmic ocean.

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:59.450 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Isn't it amazing how
so many of these things are out

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:02.620 align:middle line:84%
there, and everybody
is aware of this.

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:04.380 align:middle line:90%
And it seems to be growing.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:05.730 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Oh, it is.

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:08.440 align:middle line:84%
This is part of the New
Consciousness, this new energy.

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:09.900 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's because
of our alignment

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.399 align:middle line:84%
with the center of
the galaxy, maybe

00:17:11.399 --> 00:17:13.300 align:middle line:84%
it's the sun going
into an active phase.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:17.672 align:middle line:84%
It could be it's just time
for this knowledge to rise up.

00:17:17.672 --> 00:17:19.130 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's
something in our DNA.

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:20.769 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of
explanations for it,

00:17:20.769 --> 00:17:22.490 align:middle line:84%
but it's happening
all over the place.

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And I really trust that this
is the right next step for us.

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:28.260 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Another question
for William Henry, here,

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:29.500 align:middle line:90%
on "Beyond Belief."

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:31.050 align:middle line:90%
Who's got one?

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:32.814 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir, way in the corner.

00:17:32.814 --> 00:17:33.480 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.220 align:middle line:84%
There are two ultimate
questions that I have.

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:37.940 align:middle line:90%
Where did we come from?

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:40.270 align:middle line:84%
And where are we
going after death?

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:43.130 align:middle line:84%
Because, me and my wife had
this discussion on our way here.

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:46.300 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: The questions all of
us would love to have an answer

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:46.800 align:middle line:90%
for.

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:47.810 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Yeah, where
did we come from?

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:49.101 align:middle line:90%
And where do we go after death?

00:17:49.101 --> 00:17:50.460 align:middle line:90%
Well, we come from the source.

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:53.580 align:middle line:84%
I localize it to the center
of the Milky Way galaxy,

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.730 align:middle line:84%
because so many Shamanic
traditions teach us

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:57.182 align:middle line:90%
that that's where we came from.

00:17:57.182 --> 00:17:58.390 align:middle line:90%
So that's a good possibility.

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:02.380 align:middle line:84%
But then, there's 450 plus
billion galaxies out there.

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:05.340 align:middle line:84%
So there must be some other
greater cosmic source.

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:08.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's the same place
we return, after death.

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:11.800 align:middle line:84%
And again, the Native Americans
call this "the path of souls."

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.020 align:middle line:84%
That's the name they
have for the Milky Way.

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And their belief is
that, after death,

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:19.640 align:middle line:84%
if we've lived a righteous,
upright, ideal life,

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.510 align:middle line:84%
that we will jump
through Orion's gate

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:25.862 align:middle line:84%
and find our way going past
the star system Cygnus,

00:18:25.862 --> 00:18:27.820 align:middle line:84%
all the way to the center
the Milky Way galaxy.

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:30.627 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And this-- this
is everywhere, isn't it?

00:18:30.627 --> 00:18:31.710 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: It's everywhere.

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:32.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:35.550 align:middle line:84%
It's a global tradition
that we have this ability

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:37.460 align:middle line:90%
to travel these stargates.

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And we won't go in
this form, by the way.

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:40.977 align:middle line:90%
We will be in a different form.

00:18:40.977 --> 00:18:41.810 align:middle line:90%
So many traditions--

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:42.601 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Stardust.

00:18:42.601 --> 00:18:44.610 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Star, well,
divine sparks, yeah.

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:45.850 align:middle line:90%
That's how they describe us.

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:47.680 align:middle line:84%
We literally are
stardust, and we all

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:49.940 align:middle line:90%
have a spark of the creator.

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And we will ultimately manifest
this body to explore Earth

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:58.090 align:middle line:84%
and to work out karmas,
an exploration device.

00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:00.470 align:middle line:84%
The body is an energy
harvesting device.

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:01.580 align:middle line:90%
It gathers information.

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:04.600 align:middle line:84%
It's a transportation
system for our divine spark.

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.270 align:middle line:84%
And then, if we do
it right, we learn

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:10.030 align:middle line:84%
how to spin the body
into a vortex of energy

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:11.260 align:middle line:90%
they call the rainbow body.

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And we now we can open
stargate and worm holes,

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:15.290 align:middle line:84%
and navigate and
travel the universe.

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:16.660 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: If we do it right.

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:16.900 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Yeah.

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:18.350 align:middle line:90%
And that's the natural process.

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:20.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're all kind
of like in a pupal phase

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:22.030 align:middle line:90%
in the human body.

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And we identify ourselves
with the pupal phase,

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:26.550 align:middle line:84%
and very seldom do
we connect ourselves

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:28.930 align:middle line:84%
with our next level
of evolution, which

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:31.360 align:middle line:84%
we metaphorically refer
to as the butterfly.

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.839 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why is,
because, I think, it's fear.

00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:35.630 align:middle line:84%
We're all sort of like
the two caterpillars

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:37.960 align:middle line:84%
I saw once looking up
at the butterfly saying,

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.250 align:middle line:84%
you'll never get me up
in one of those things.

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:42.770 align:middle line:84%
So when people
talk about, oh, you

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:45.342 align:middle line:84%
have the ability of becoming
a Christ-like being,

00:19:45.342 --> 00:19:47.300 align:middle line:84%
or achieving the rainbow
body, the resurrection

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:49.224 align:middle line:84%
body, the glory body,
the body of bliss.

00:19:49.224 --> 00:19:51.140 align:middle line:84%
There's all these names,
every world tradition

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:53.730 align:middle line:84%
has a name and a
teaching about how

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:57.260 align:middle line:84%
we become the next human,
the next level of human.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:58.960 align:middle line:84%
But nobody really
subscribes to it.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:02.390 align:middle line:84%
Instead we identify ourselves
with our pupal phase.

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's a good pun,
because pupal is P-U-P-A-L.

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.570 align:middle line:90%
That refers to the cocoon.

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:09.600 align:middle line:84%
But we're also
pupils-- P-U-P-I-Ls.

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.335 align:middle line:84%
And we're trying
to become masters.

00:20:11.335 --> 00:20:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's, to me,
that's the point of life.

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:16.310 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Have we lost
knowledge over the ages?

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:18.560 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: We've lost a
tremendous amount of knowledge.

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:22.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's almost
incalculable what we've lost.

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:24.900 align:middle line:90%
But I feel like it's in us.

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:27.480 align:middle line:90%
It's hard-wired into our DNA.

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And every one of us
has the capability

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:34.481 align:middle line:84%
of activating that knowledge
and using it to their benefit,

00:20:34.481 --> 00:20:35.980 align:middle line:84%
as well as the
benefit of the world.

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:38.347 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, we all have a
responsibility to do that.

00:20:38.347 --> 00:20:40.680 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: William, let's talk
a little bit about the Ark

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:41.240 align:middle line:90%
of the Covenant.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:41.560 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: OK.

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:44.060 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And I want to ask you
about the parting of the Red

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:46.570 align:middle line:84%
Sea, and how these
things happened.

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:51.270 align:middle line:84%
The Red Sea, the Egyptians
are chasing the Israelites.

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:53.542 align:middle line:84%
Moses parts the Red
Sea, he stands up.

00:20:53.542 --> 00:20:54.750 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: He's got his staff.

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:56.666 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And we've all
seen the movie, right?

00:20:56.666 --> 00:20:58.480 align:middle line:90%
"The Greatest Story Ever Told."

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.170 align:middle line:90%
It opens up.

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:03.610 align:middle line:84%
The Israelites are
running across.

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:06.370 align:middle line:84%
Why it wasn't
soggy is beyond me.

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:11.280 align:middle line:84%
But then come the Egyptians,
and it closes in on all them.

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:12.590 align:middle line:90%
Something happened there.

00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:15.430 align:middle line:84%
They're beginning to find
ancient Egyptian artifacts,

00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:17.322 align:middle line:84%
wheels, and things
like that, right

00:21:17.322 --> 00:21:18.530 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the Red Sea.

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:19.196 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Right.

00:21:19.196 --> 00:21:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What the
heck happened, and how?

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:21.820 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Yeah, well.

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:23.611 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if we'll
ever know the answer.

00:21:23.611 --> 00:21:25.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have to
remember, biblical stories,

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:27.080 align:middle line:84%
like all myth and
sacred tradition,

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.540 align:middle line:84%
you can interpret
them on at least six

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:29.685 align:middle line:90%
or seven different levels.

00:21:29.685 --> 00:21:31.900 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are they based
on natural events that have

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:32.400 align:middle line:90%
happened?

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.524 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: I think they are.

00:21:33.524 --> 00:21:35.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, something
had to have happened.

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:37.924 align:middle line:84%
There had to have been a
literal event that became--

00:21:37.924 --> 00:21:39.590 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Could have
been an earthquake,

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:40.610 align:middle line:90%
could have been anything, right?

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:41.401 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Possibly.

00:21:41.401 --> 00:21:43.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when he parched
the Sea of Reeds,

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:45.340 align:middle line:84%
it could also have been an
inter-dimensional event,

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:45.840 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:48.330 align:middle line:84%
Because Moses was such
a powerful shaman.

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And the Israelites
were undoubtedly

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:52.370 align:middle line:84%
connecting with the
Promised Land, which

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:54.480 align:middle line:84%
is what the ancient
Egyptians referred

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.649 align:middle line:84%
to as the Sea of Reeds,
or the Reed Place.

00:21:56.649 --> 00:21:58.190 align:middle line:84%
When they referred
to that, they were

00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:00.250 align:middle line:84%
talking about the
afterlife realm.

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:02.050 align:middle line:84%
They were talking about
another dimension.

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:04.250 align:middle line:84%
And so since Moses was
trained in all the wisdom

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:06.190 align:middle line:84%
of the Egyptians,
that story could well

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:08.415 align:middle line:84%
be interpreted as an
inter-dimensional event,

00:22:08.415 --> 00:22:09.880 align:middle line:90%
or as an afterlife event.

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:12.170 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So you believe,
though, the sea did part.

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:13.641 align:middle line:90%
Something happened there, right?

00:22:13.641 --> 00:22:15.140 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Some kind
of a sea parted.

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:17.870 align:middle line:84%
Maybe even it's the
veil that separates us

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:19.700 align:middle line:90%
from life from the afterlife.

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:21.580 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, something
definitely happened.

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:23.413 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Ark of the
Covenant, what is that?

00:22:23.413 --> 00:22:25.520 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Mm, good question.

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a complicated
question, as well.

00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:30.720 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it was made by Moses
at the base of Mount Sinai.

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:36.250 align:middle line:84%
It's made by a master craftsman
named Bezalel, who created it

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:38.809 align:middle line:84%
as a copy of the
heavenly original.

00:22:38.809 --> 00:22:39.350 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:41.160 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: So right of the bat,
we know there's at least two

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:41.930 align:middle line:90%
Arks of the Covenant.

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:43.160 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And where
was the original?

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.659 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: The original is in
heaven, in a place called Zion.

00:22:45.659 --> 00:22:46.895 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Always was?

00:22:46.895 --> 00:22:47.770 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Presumably.

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:48.311 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:22:48.311 --> 00:22:51.250 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: And so we have the
earthly Ark made as a copy

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:52.880 align:middle line:90%
of the heavenly original.

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's described
as a golden box that

00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:59.420 align:middle line:84%
was created to house the Ten
Commandments, the rod of Aaron,

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:01.990 align:middle line:84%
the flask of manna, and a
cruse of this sacred oil.

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:03.920 align:middle line:90%
So I call it the kit.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:07.234 align:middle line:84%
It's a kit of tools that
were used by the Israelites.

00:23:07.234 --> 00:23:08.275 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: How big was it?

00:23:08.275 --> 00:23:11.870 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Uh, It's about
this wide, or this long,

00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:12.770 align:middle line:90%
by about this wide.

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:13.700 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Heavy?

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:15.479 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Well,
it's made of gold.

00:23:15.479 --> 00:23:16.770 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's a lot of gold.

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:19.340 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Well, or actually,
acacia wood lined with gold.

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:21.750 align:middle line:84%
With a mercy seat on top
of it, that some think

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:23.700 align:middle line:84%
could have weighed
as much as a ton.

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:24.760 align:middle line:90%
The estimates vary.

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.456 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it would
have been quite heavy.

00:23:26.456 --> 00:23:28.330 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And people
had to carry this thing.

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:30.246 align:middle line:84%
You would put sticks
through it, or something?

00:23:30.246 --> 00:23:32.250 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: There were
golden rings on the side,

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:34.320 align:middle line:90%
and they carried it on rods.

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea is that this is
some sort of a communications

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:39.640 align:middle line:84%
device, or maybe
even a tool kit.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:42.130 align:middle line:84%
But when you really get
into the Ark research,

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:44.740 align:middle line:84%
and when you read what the
Bible says about the Ark,

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:48.100 align:middle line:84%
you learn that it's also
the throne of Yahweh.

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:50.290 align:middle line:84%
That this is not just
a communications tool,

00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:53.730 align:middle line:84%
but it's actually some sort
of like a portal through which

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:55.841 align:middle line:84%
the Old Testament God
Yahweh would manifest.

00:23:55.841 --> 00:23:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: If you open
it up, or something?

00:23:57.590 --> 00:24:00.350 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Well, he would
speak between the wings

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:01.100 align:middle line:90%
of the cherubim.

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:02.780 align:middle line:84%
There were two angels
called cherubim,

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:06.060 align:middle line:84%
or something, seraphim, that
were on top of the mercy seat.

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And Yahweh would manifest
between these two angels,

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:11.010 align:middle line:90%
almost like a hologram.

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:12.870 align:middle line:84%
Because when they
describe him manifesting,

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:17.050 align:middle line:84%
it's a rainbow cloud with
lightning and a humanoid form

00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:19.770 align:middle line:90%
is sitting on this throne.

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:21.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's like,
well, wait a minute,

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:24.480 align:middle line:84%
this is what we,
today, call a stargate.

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.870 align:middle line:90%
It's like a docking station.

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:29.220 align:middle line:84%
There's one of these in heaven
and one of these on Earth.

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And for whatever reason,
when these beings

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:33.660 align:middle line:84%
want to travel back and
forth between the two realms,

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:35.220 align:middle line:84%
they're using the
Ark of the Covenant

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:36.890 align:middle line:90%
as this transportation device.

00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They say if
somebody touched it,

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:41.070 align:middle line:84%
they could get
electrocuted, basically.

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:41.820 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:43.320 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: That's
one of the stories.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And that, again, gets
back to this idea

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:47.820 align:middle line:84%
that, if you're not prepared
mentally, physically,

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:50.260 align:middle line:84%
spiritually, and emotionally
to handle it, yeah.

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:52.560 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be a
bad hair day for you.

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:55.190 align:middle line:84%
But if you are prepared, when
this thing was ultimately

00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:57.970 align:middle line:84%
taken to the Holy of
Holies of Solomon's Temple

00:24:57.970 --> 00:25:00.110 align:middle line:84%
atop mystic Mount
Mariah in Jerusalem.

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:02.990 align:middle line:84%
They build Solomon's Temple and
this golden cube shaped room.

00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:04.652 align:middle line:90%
And they put the Ark in there.

00:25:04.652 --> 00:25:07.110 align:middle line:84%
This thing would fill up with
this-- the room would fill up

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:10.560 align:middle line:84%
with this rainbow smokey
kind of energy and lightning.

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:14.180 align:middle line:84%
And the high priest could
even sit on that throne,

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.270 align:middle line:84%
and had the opportunity
himself to travel

00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:19.010 align:middle line:90%
from Earth to the Heavenly Zion.

00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:21.670 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: The Ten Commandments
were supposed to be in the Ark

00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:22.040 align:middle line:90%
of the Covenant.

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.415 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: The
Tablets of the Law.

00:25:23.415 --> 00:25:25.060 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Where are they?

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:26.890 align:middle line:90%
Now that's all speculation.

00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:29.860 align:middle line:84%
But if they existed,
they've got to be somewhere.

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:30.890 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Well, yeah.

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:33.477 align:middle line:84%
And again, are we
talking about-- are

00:25:33.477 --> 00:25:35.560 align:middle line:84%
we asking the question
from a literal perspective,

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:39.060 align:middle line:84%
historical, metaphorical,
allegorical, anatomical,

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:40.360 align:middle line:90%
astronomical?

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:41.670 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:43.700 align:middle line:90%
Let's take the anatomical.

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:44.500 align:middle line:90%
That's my favorite.

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:45.999 align:middle line:84%
Because I try to
put it in the body.

00:25:45.999 --> 00:25:48.770 align:middle line:84%
Because all of these stories
ultimately reflect our body.

00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:50.603 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about
the Ark of the Covenant

00:25:50.603 --> 00:25:53.980 align:middle line:84%
as a tool kit that has, the
ark is a box or platform.

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:56.560 align:middle line:84%
There's a rod of enlightenment
in it, two tablets,

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.160 align:middle line:90%
and some oil and some manna.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:02.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, our body has what's
called the chakra system,

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:03.910 align:middle line:90%
the seven chakras.

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:06.070 align:middle line:84%
We count them from the
base of our root chakra.

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:10.990 align:middle line:84%
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, all
children go to heaven.

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:12.450 align:middle line:84%
So you open up the
chakras, you can

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:13.825 align:middle line:84%
connect with the
heavenly realms.

00:26:13.825 --> 00:26:16.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, in this perspective,
the Ark of the Covenant

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:17.700 align:middle line:90%
is our lower three chakras.

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:20.610 align:middle line:84%
The rod of enlightenment,
that's our spinal cord.

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:23.520 align:middle line:84%
The two tablets, those are the
two hemispheres of our brain.

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:24.780 align:middle line:90%
What does our brain do?

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:26.910 align:middle line:84%
It produces this
sacred oil that can

00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:28.700 align:middle line:90%
transmute our body into light.

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:29.430 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It sounds
symbolic, doesn't it?

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:31.320 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Well, it's
not just symbolic.

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:34.730 align:middle line:84%
It's an actual esoteric
or mystery school teaching

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:37.010 align:middle line:84%
about what the body
can actually do.

00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
gets it so exciting.

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And that, to me, is
like-- that-- the church

00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:43.440 align:middle line:84%
wants you to think of it
as a simple golden box.

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:46.180 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get the Ark of
the Covenant, it's in Ethiopia.

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:48.110 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not.

00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:51.130 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: If it exists,
and if it is somewhere--

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:53.170 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: It does exist.

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:55.790 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What does that tell
you about all the stories about

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:57.370 align:middle line:90%
the biblical stories?

00:26:57.370 --> 00:27:00.210 align:middle line:84%
Does it convince you
that everything in there

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:01.400 align:middle line:90%
is probably accurate?

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.480 align:middle line:90%
Maybe subject to interpretation.

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:06.192 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Yeah, I mean, there's
been a lot of mistranslation

00:27:06.192 --> 00:27:07.500 align:middle line:90%
and that sort of thing.

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:10.042 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, you find the
Ark of the Covenant,

00:27:10.042 --> 00:27:11.500 align:middle line:84%
you reveal the Ark
of the Covenant,

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:14.660 align:middle line:84%
as the president of Iran is
presently attempting to do.

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:16.340 align:middle line:90%
And reveal it to the world.

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:19.010 align:middle line:84%
It completely
alters our reality.

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And so that's a really
important question.

00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:23.897 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Tell me about
the Judgment Day Device.

00:27:23.897 --> 00:27:25.980 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: All three of the
world's great spiritual

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:29.200 align:middle line:84%
traditions, Judaism,
Christianity and Islam,

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.550 align:middle line:90%
refer to a Judgment Day.

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:35.500 align:middle line:84%
A time when a Christ, a Messiah,
or as the Islamic people

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:38.110 align:middle line:84%
refer to it, this figure
is the Mahdi will appear.

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Somebody's
coming back.

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:42.740 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: All three of them are
symbolized by the same device.

00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And the word device means a
tool, appliance, as well as

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:47.730 align:middle line:90%
a sign and a symbol.

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:49.899 align:middle line:84%
That device is the
Ark of the Covenant.

00:27:49.899 --> 00:27:50.440 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Ah!

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.990 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: All three have
prophecies about the appearance

00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:56.094 align:middle line:84%
of a messianic figure who will
recover and reveal the Ark

00:27:56.094 --> 00:27:56.760 align:middle line:90%
of the Covenant.

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:58.680 align:middle line:84%
And I call it the
Judgment Day Device

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:01.270 align:middle line:84%
because our traditional
conception of the Ark

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:03.960 align:middle line:90%
is way incomplete.

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:05.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I often
wonder, really, I mean,

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:06.974 align:middle line:84%
there's been some
wonderful books

00:28:06.974 --> 00:28:09.700 align:middle line:84%
about the Ark of the
Covenant, but they just

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:12.031 align:middle line:84%
haven't brought all of
its pieces together.

00:28:12.031 --> 00:28:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And when you do,
you realize, you're

00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:16.770 align:middle line:84%
dealing with an extraordinary
supernatural device.

00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:20.390 align:middle line:84%
And the insiders in the
world's great religions

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:21.440 align:middle line:90%
have to know this.

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.229 align:middle line:84%
And those who seek
it-- Saddam Hussein

00:28:23.229 --> 00:28:24.520 align:middle line:90%
sought the Ark of the Covenant.

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:27.340 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Did he know
where it was, do you think?

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:30.400 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: I think he might have
been one of the closest to know

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:31.410 align:middle line:90%
where the Ark was.

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:33.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, again,
believing himself to be

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:35.970 align:middle line:84%
the reincarnation of
Nebuchadnezzar, who once

00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:39.360 align:middle line:84%
possessed it, he was obsessed
with finding these artifacts.

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:40.980 align:middle line:90%
And it's possible.

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:45.650 align:middle line:84%
But the Bible says God took
the Ark of the Covenant.

00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:47.870 align:middle line:84%
Islam, their
prophecy says angels

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:49.900 align:middle line:84%
will return the Ark of
the Covenant to Earth.

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:51.589 align:middle line:84%
The Ark of the Covenant
is not on Earth.

00:28:51.589 --> 00:28:52.880 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's been taken away.

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:54.960 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: It's been
taken off the planet.

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.130 align:middle line:84%
And if it returns as a
physical device-- I mean,

00:28:57.130 --> 00:29:00.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm firmly convinced it has
an anatomical correspondence

00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:01.637 align:middle line:90%
within our bodies.

00:29:01.637 --> 00:29:03.720 align:middle line:84%
But if we're talking about
an actual device which,

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:05.370 align:middle line:84%
come to think of it, is
about the same dimensions

00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:07.305 align:middle line:84%
as your desk, here,
now that I look at it.

00:29:07.305 --> 00:29:08.388 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Maybe I have it.

00:29:08.388 --> 00:29:09.304 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Yeah, right.

00:29:09.304 --> 00:29:12.840 align:middle line:90%


00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:15.407 align:middle line:84%
The Bible is clear, the
Ark is not on Earth.

00:29:15.407 --> 00:29:17.240 align:middle line:84%
And the artwork that
I've collected and show

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:19.760 align:middle line:84%
in "The Judgment Day Device"
shows that it, in fact,

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:23.950 align:middle line:84%
is in another celestial realm--
maybe another dimension, maybe

00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:25.370 align:middle line:90%
the galactic center.

00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:26.070 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:29.730 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Why is the quest
for the Ark so important?

00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:32.750 align:middle line:10%
>> HENRY: Well, because it
represents our connection with

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:33.250 align:middle line:10%
God.

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:38.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it represents the
ultimate secrets of mankind.

00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:41.819 align:middle line:84%
And especially, it's the
ultimate power object, as well.

00:29:41.819 --> 00:29:42.860 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: If you have it?

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:43.880 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: If you had it, yeah.

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:45.580 align:middle line:84%
You would know the
secrets of universe,

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:48.320 align:middle line:84%
because when Bezalel,
this master craftsman,

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:51.424 align:middle line:84%
made the Ark-- Moses didn't make
the Ark it was this craftsman.

00:29:51.424 --> 00:29:52.090 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:55.400 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: And God-- our current
word is downloaded to him

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:57.020 align:middle line:90%
the wisdom of the Holy Spirit.

00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:58.155 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: How to make it.

00:29:58.155 --> 00:29:58.780 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Yeah.

00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:01.620 align:middle line:84%
So why would God download
all the sacred wisdom

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:03.485 align:middle line:84%
of the universe to
a master craftsman

00:30:03.485 --> 00:30:05.214 align:middle line:84%
if he's making a
simple golden box?

00:30:05.214 --> 00:30:05.880 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:06.700 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: He wouldn't.

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:08.250 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about--
what that tells

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:11.300 align:middle line:84%
us is that the Ark is something
far more profound than we have

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:12.910 align:middle line:90%
heretofore, perhaps, realized.

00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:15.321 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Weren't the Nazis
obsessed with trying to find

00:30:15.321 --> 00:30:16.320 align:middle line:90%
the Ark of the Covenant?

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:17.153 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: They were.

00:30:17.153 --> 00:30:19.250 align:middle line:84%
As well as the
holy grail and many

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:21.930 align:middle line:84%
of these other mystic
objects, because they knew

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:23.404 align:middle line:84%
they could weaponize
these secrets.

00:30:23.404 --> 00:30:24.820 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: That's
what they wanted?

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:25.770 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Exactly.

00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:26.420 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Frightening.

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:27.110 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: It is frightening.

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:27.610 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And so, if it gets
in the wrong hands,

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:31.850 align:middle line:84%
it might not be such
a good scenario.

00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:35.700 align:middle line:84%
But if you subscribe to
this idea, as does Islam

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:38.510 align:middle line:84%
and as does Christianity,
that it's protected by angels,

00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:40.240 align:middle line:84%
then we're hoping
that they aren't

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.300 align:middle line:84%
bad angels that
are protecting it.

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:42.633 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh, well, that's true.

00:30:42.633 --> 00:30:44.790 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk a little
bit about these angels.

00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:46.820 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
they really are?

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:47.950 align:middle line:90%
Are they mystical?

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:50.480 align:middle line:90%
Are they a form of energy?

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think everybody has had
an angelic experience, where

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:55.604 align:middle line:90%
somebody has saved them.

00:30:55.604 --> 00:30:56.270 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Right.

00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:58.728 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Perhaps their guardian
angel has plucked them out

00:30:58.728 --> 00:30:59.635 align:middle line:90%
of some demise.

00:30:59.635 --> 00:31:00.260 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Yeah.

00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:01.950 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What do
you think they are?

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:04.440 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: I believe that
they're nonphysical,

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:05.710 align:middle line:90%
they're energy beings.

00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:07.280 align:middle line:90%
And they might even be us.

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:08.440 align:middle line:90%
They might even be humans.

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:10.720 align:middle line:84%
The book of Hebrews takes
you to Christ's throne,

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:13.120 align:middle line:84%
his heavenly throne,
the heavenly Zion,

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:15.410 align:middle line:90%
where you're greeted by angels.

00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:17.720 align:middle line:90%
And just humans made perfect.

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:19.590 align:middle line:90%
Well, who are these people?

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:22.440 align:middle line:84%
How did they get to go dwell
in this heavenly realm?

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:24.230 align:middle line:90%
What made them "perfect?"

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:27.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, what made them perfect is
they transformed the human body

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:28.920 align:middle line:84%
into its next
level of evolution,

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:31.570 align:middle line:90%
a nonphysical light body form.

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And all the mystery
school teachings

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:36.080 align:middle line:90%
tell us that, hey, you can, too.

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:40.560 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I love to equate
mysticism with Hollywood.

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And the movie "City of
Angels" with Nicolas Cage

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:46.890 align:middle line:84%
is so knowing,
that basically when

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:52.120 align:middle line:84%
you look at these angels having
personalities of human beings.

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:52.745 align:middle line:90%
They get upset.

00:31:52.745 --> 00:31:54.100 align:middle line:90%
They get happy.

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:55.945 align:middle line:84%
They get greedy,
and everything else.

00:31:55.945 --> 00:31:56.570 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Right

00:31:56.570 --> 00:31:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do you
think that's real?

00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:58.100 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: I do.

00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:00.270 align:middle line:84%
I think that when you're
talking about the Watchers

00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:02.920 align:middle line:84%
and the Nephilim of
the Old Testament,

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:05.980 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about
nonphysical beings that

00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:08.720 align:middle line:84%
have the capability
of taking physicality.

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:09.595 align:middle line:90%
That's extraordinary.

00:32:09.595 --> 00:32:10.261 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It is.

00:32:10.261 --> 00:32:10.820 align:middle line:90%
It's huge.

00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:11.445 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Yeah.

00:32:11.445 --> 00:32:16.447 align:middle line:84%
And then they can phase back
into their nonphysical being.

00:32:16.447 --> 00:32:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's something,
again, all of us

00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:19.870 align:middle line:90%
are alleged to be able to do.

00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:22.440 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do you think that
world came before the physical

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:23.660 align:middle line:90%
world?

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:25.160 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: I don't
know about that.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.270 align:middle line:90%
I can't say that, for sure.

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:29.010 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's a possibility.

00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:32.880 align:middle line:10%
But I think that they are kind
of-- they're here to guide us,

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:35.580 align:middle line:10%
and they're here to bring
us into their tribe.

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:38.690 align:middle line:10%
Because that would then
be our next natural state,

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:41.520 align:middle line:10%
traveling the cosmos as
these nonphysical beings

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:43.470 align:middle line:10%
that have the ability
to take physicality.

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:45.830 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: When they talk
about fallen angels,

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:47.790 align:middle line:90%
what does that mean to you?

00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:50.420 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Well, these
are the beings that were

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:55.000 align:middle line:84%
the nonphysical beings that took
on physical bodies on earth,

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.750 align:middle line:84%
and had children, offspring
with Earth females.

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:00.972 align:middle line:90%
Those are the fallen angels.

00:33:00.972 --> 00:33:02.680 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So we could
be related to them?

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:03.690 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Absolutely.

00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:04.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, definitely.

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:07.340 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: When you talk
about Rennes-le-Chateau,

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:08.120 align:middle line:90%
it's in France.

00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:09.050 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Yes.

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:11.320 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What's so special
about that structure?

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:12.112 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Well.

00:33:12.112 --> 00:33:13.070 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What's there?

00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:14.160 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: A lot
of mystery there.

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.480 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of layers to it.

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.910 align:middle line:84%
It goes back into vastly
ancient times, even

00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:18.860 align:middle line:90%
to prehistoric times.

00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:19.970 align:middle line:84%
It seems like people
have always been

00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:21.800 align:middle line:84%
going to this little
dot of real estate.

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:25.470 align:middle line:84%
It's spectacularly beautiful, in
the foothills of the Pyrenees.

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:28.270 align:middle line:84%
Ruggedly primitive,
kind of country,

00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:29.450 align:middle line:90%
which really appeals to me.

00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:31.600 align:middle line:84%
I like going where there's
more sheep than people.

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:33.210 align:middle line:90%
That's my favorite places.

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And according to the local
lore and tradition and history,

00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:41.520 align:middle line:84%
it's been a repository of
ancient secrets forever.

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And on top of that, there's
also the possibility

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:47.500 align:middle line:84%
that there's a portal
there that would allow

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:49.160 align:middle line:84%
you to travel to
other dimensions.

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:49.580 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You've been there.

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:51.330 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: I've been
there many times, yes.

00:33:51.330 --> 00:33:52.130 align:middle line:90%
Going back in May.

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:54.421 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is there a special
feeling when you go there?

00:33:54.421 --> 00:33:57.140 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Yeah, it's a feeling,
there's-- it's somewhat eerie,

00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:57.800 align:middle line:90%
in a sense.

00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:59.470 align:middle line:84%
But again, it's
spectacularly beautiful,

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:01.136 align:middle line:84%
so it kind of gives
you a comfort level.

00:34:01.136 --> 00:34:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And you just have
a sense that you're

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.620 align:middle line:84%
in one of the great power
places on the Earth, of which,

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:07.290 align:middle line:84%
they feel like there's
around 12 of them

00:34:07.290 --> 00:34:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And Rennes-le-Chateau is
certainly one of them.

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:09.672 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Is Egypt one of them?

00:34:09.672 --> 00:34:10.546 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Definitely.

00:34:10.546 --> 00:34:11.260 align:middle line:90%
The Giza Plateau.

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:14.010 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: William was
in Egypt some time ago,

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:18.750 align:middle line:84%
during the Arab spring on a bus,
calling us on "Coast to Coast."

00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:20.320 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Like,
get us out of here.

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.699 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Unbelievable
that you got out of there.

00:34:22.699 --> 00:34:23.760 align:middle line:90%
Would you go back?

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:23.929 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Yeah.

00:34:23.929 --> 00:34:24.929 align:middle line:90%
I would love to go back.

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:26.610 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I did go
back, last February.

00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:29.639 align:middle line:90%
And hope to go back in 2014.

00:34:29.639 --> 00:34:30.139 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:30.139 --> 00:34:31.454 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Is it safe?

00:34:31.454 --> 00:34:33.620 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: From what I've
heard, it's perfectly safe.

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:35.050 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely, perfectly safe.

00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:36.460 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:38.389 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What are
the mysteries there?

00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:40.170 align:middle line:84%
I've always been
fascinated with what

00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:41.820 align:middle line:84%
could be at the
base of the Sphinx,

00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:43.900 align:middle line:90%
as Edgar Cayce has said.

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:47.650 align:middle line:84%
Or those pyramids, which
I still can't figure out

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:48.795 align:middle line:90%
how they made those.

00:34:48.795 --> 00:34:50.170 align:middle line:84%
What's it like
when you're there?

00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:52.810 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Oh, you just stand
in front of the pyramids

00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:54.860 align:middle line:90%
and you're in awe, absolute awe.

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:56.989 align:middle line:84%
And personally, when I
stood there the first time,

00:34:56.989 --> 00:34:59.955 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, no, humans
didn't build these.

00:34:59.955 --> 00:35:00.955 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is beyond--

00:35:00.955 --> 00:35:01.720 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: There's no way.

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:02.345 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Yeah.

00:35:02.345 --> 00:35:03.140 align:middle line:90%
It's just beyond.

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's not to
take a condescending

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:08.340 align:middle line:84%
view towards humanity
and our capability.

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:09.960 align:middle line:84%
But you just get
the feeling that you

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:11.880 align:middle line:84%
are in the hands
of something way

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:13.920 align:middle line:84%
beyond anything we
can conceive there.

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:16.770 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: The only way that
humans could have made those

00:35:16.770 --> 00:35:21.260 align:middle line:10%
structures is if they possessed
high technology and they were

00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:25.480 align:middle line:10%
so advanced, way beyond
where we even are today.

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:26.740 align:middle line:10%
That's the only other way.

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:27.990 align:middle line:10%
If it was just done by humans.

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:32.020 align:middle line:10%
>> HENRY: You know, they had,
maybe they lived in a time

00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:34.840 align:middle line:10%
where the energy of the
planet was higher, as well.

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:37.390 align:middle line:10%
And perhaps, we're coming
back into that time now,

00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:39.326 align:middle line:10%
that would support that
kind of consciousness

00:35:39.326 --> 00:35:40.950 align:middle line:10%
that would enable
them to conceive that

00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:43.109 align:middle line:10%
and to execute such a plan.

00:35:43.109 --> 00:35:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I really
feel we're dealing with.

00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:46.690 align:middle line:84%
Is an extraordinary
intelligence,

00:35:46.690 --> 00:35:48.882 align:middle line:84%
but that intelligence
is within us, as well.

00:35:48.882 --> 00:35:51.340 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What fascinates you,
William about this work that

00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:53.310 align:middle line:90%
you do?

00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:58.194 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: I feel like ET
following the Reese's Pieces.

00:35:58.194 --> 00:36:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like there's
something that's guiding me.

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:00.870 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Something is there.

00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:02.536 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: I'm not
quite sure what it is,

00:36:02.536 --> 00:36:03.550 align:middle line:90%
but I keep following it.

00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And I seem to feel
like I get rewarded,

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:08.050 align:middle line:84%
because one thing
leads to another.

00:36:08.050 --> 00:36:11.162 align:middle line:84%
It opens into another
more incredible mystery.

00:36:11.162 --> 00:36:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And so it seems like
everything I've been doing

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:16.390 align:middle line:90%
is training for the next step.

00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:19.340 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are you getting closer
to whatever you're seeking?

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:20.410 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: I feel like it.

00:36:20.410 --> 00:36:22.040 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:25.480 align:middle line:84%
As long as it's taking
me closer to my heart,

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:29.150 align:middle line:84%
closer to my spirit, then I
know I'm on the right track.

00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:31.710 align:middle line:84%
If it's making me want
to be a better person,

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:33.980 align:middle line:84%
then I know for sure
I'm on the truth path.

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:37.190 align:middle line:84%
Because that's ultimately the
ultimate mystery teaching.

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:41.310 align:middle line:84%
Is that it's really easy
to move forward as a being.

00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:43.560 align:middle line:84%
It's just you have
to be kind-hearted.

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:45.260 align:middle line:90%
You have to speak the truth.

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And you have to be good
to your fellow man.

00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:49.970 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: These stargates
that you talk about,

00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:50.885 align:middle line:90%
they go both ways.

00:36:50.885 --> 00:36:51.510 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Yeah.

00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:54.250 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So what comes
through these stargates?

00:36:54.250 --> 00:36:58.740 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Yeah, that's-- having
never seen one open in front

00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:00.020 align:middle line:90%
of me, I can't say for sure.

00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:02.770 align:middle line:84%
But in all the stories
that I collect, be it

00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:05.570 align:middle line:84%
ancient Sumerian,
Egyptian, early Christian,

00:37:05.570 --> 00:37:07.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean Jesus, in my--
I wrote a book called

00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:10.290 align:middle line:84%
"The Secret of Zion" about Jesus
as a stargate traveling time

00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:10.790 align:middle line:90%
traveler.

00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:12.660 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what
the gnostic texts say.

00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:14.326 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they can't
be any more explicit.

00:37:14.326 --> 00:37:15.430 align:middle line:90%
He says, "I am the door."

00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And how many references to the
gate are there in the Bible?

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:20.540 align:middle line:90%
Over 100.

00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:21.920 align:middle line:90%
Where these gates going?

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:23.100 align:middle line:90%
They're going to heaven.

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:26.100 align:middle line:84%
And so this idea of
a stargate to heaven

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:27.700 align:middle line:90%
is not far-fetched at all.

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:30.034 align:middle line:84%
We just change the vernacular
a little bit, and it lines

00:37:30.034 --> 00:37:32.491 align:middle line:84%
up perfectly with what they
were always trying to teach us.

00:37:32.491 --> 00:37:35.120 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: William, is technology
helping you get things done

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:36.467 align:middle line:90%
a little quicker?

00:37:36.467 --> 00:37:37.550 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Yes, absolutely.

00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:40.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, having the
ability to access anything

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:42.762 align:middle line:90%
at my fingertips is incredible.

00:37:42.762 --> 00:37:44.345 align:middle line:84%
I still rely on-- I
live in Nashville.

00:37:44.345 --> 00:37:46.270 align:middle line:84%
I have the Vanderbilt
Divinity Library,

00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:47.950 align:middle line:90%
which is like a hall of records.

00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:49.340 align:middle line:84%
So I still have my
actual physical library.

00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:50.970 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's old school,
but it still works.

00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:51.969 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Yeah, exactly.

00:37:51.969 --> 00:37:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And then being able
to jump on a plane

00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:56.685 align:middle line:84%
and go take digital
photos, and all that.

00:37:56.685 --> 00:37:58.060 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How
about the internet?

00:37:58.060 --> 00:37:59.120 align:middle line:90%
How does that help you?

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:00.881 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Oh, the
internet is, of course,

00:38:00.881 --> 00:38:02.130 align:middle line:90%
a great source of information.

00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:04.030 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes there's a lot of
bogus stuff out there, too.

00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:06.071 align:middle line:84%
So you really have to be
able to sift through it.

00:38:06.071 --> 00:38:09.380 align:middle line:84%
But part of it is
just the acceleration

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:12.260 align:middle line:84%
of our consciousness, too,
that the internet has provided.

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's a real key
aspect of this, too.

00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:16.490 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Any special
surprises on the internet,

00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:17.775 align:middle line:90%
when you do your work?

00:38:17.775 --> 00:38:18.650 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Constantly.

00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:21.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm always
just blown away when

00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:23.940 align:middle line:84%
I find the next
great piece of art

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:26.826 align:middle line:84%
that I never knew was out there,
that perfectly illustrates

00:38:26.826 --> 00:38:27.825 align:middle line:90%
what I'm trying to stay.

00:38:27.825 --> 00:38:29.430 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And it steers
you into another direction.

00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:30.471 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Right, exactly.

00:38:30.471 --> 00:38:33.640 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Could you have done
what you do 20 years ago,

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:34.640 align:middle line:90%
without the internet?

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:35.431 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Oh, yeah.

00:38:35.431 --> 00:38:35.990 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.330 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Slower?

00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:38.913 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: You know, I read some
of these books from the 1800s,

00:38:38.913 --> 00:38:40.560 align:middle line:84%
you know, the print's
about this big.

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:41.900 align:middle line:90%
And the books about that thick.

00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And you just wonder-- well
they did it then, they

00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:45.430 align:middle line:90%
found a way to get it done then.

00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:47.419 align:middle line:90%
But it sure is easier, today.

00:38:47.419 --> 00:38:48.460 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's amazing.

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:49.640 align:middle line:90%
Well, you do great work.

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:50.130 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Thank you.

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Let's kind of take
some more questions for you.

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:52.210 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Sure.

00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:53.610 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: All right, who has
more questions for William

00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:54.330 align:middle line:90%
Henry?

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:55.300 align:middle line:90%
We'll take you first.

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:57.205 align:middle line:84%
And you in the back,
then, right after that.

00:38:57.205 --> 00:38:59.330 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I was just
wondering what your take is

00:38:59.330 --> 00:39:01.580 align:middle line:84%
on these light spirals that
are appearing in different

00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:02.970 align:middle line:90%
countries?

00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:04.330 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Light spirals?

00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:05.750 align:middle line:90%
I haven't seen those.

00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:06.615 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: In Norway,
specifically.

00:39:06.615 --> 00:39:07.906 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Oh the Norway spiral.

00:39:07.906 --> 00:39:08.680 align:middle line:90%
Yes of course.

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: There was another
one found near Russia.

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:13.091 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Yeah.

00:39:13.091 --> 00:39:13.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:14.280 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They're everywhere.

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:15.200 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:17.749 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they're
missiles that have misfired.

00:39:17.749 --> 00:39:19.790 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: I don't think
they're missiles, either.

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:24.030 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you'll have to go to
my blog on williamhenry.net.

00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:28.454 align:middle line:84%
I actually, in a way,
predicted that Norway spiral,

00:39:28.454 --> 00:39:30.245 align:middle line:84%
because this guy, Lord
Christopher Monckton

00:39:30.245 --> 00:39:33.930 align:middle line:84%
had been talking about the
apotheosis of their world order

00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:34.570 align:middle line:90%
was coming.

00:39:34.570 --> 00:39:35.903 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well, wait a minute.

00:39:35.903 --> 00:39:38.040 align:middle line:84%
That word means to deify,
to transform a human

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:39.540 align:middle line:90%
into a god being.

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And he must be
talking, or trying

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:43.840 align:middle line:84%
to use that in the context
of either George Washington

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:46.840 align:middle line:84%
and the dome of the US
Capitol, or the transfiguration

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:50.980 align:middle line:84%
images of Jesus that show these
purple spirals behind him as he

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:52.537 align:middle line:90%
is manifesting is light body.

00:39:52.537 --> 00:39:53.620 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Is it a message?

00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:54.860 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: It is a message.

00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And I think that when that
spiral manifested in Norway,

00:39:58.990 --> 00:40:00.614 align:middle line:90%
it was like, hey, pay attention.

00:40:00.614 --> 00:40:02.030 align:middle line:84%
I think it was a
test, personally.

00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:02.860 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Truly bizarre.

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:03.870 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Yeah, truly bizarre.

00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:06.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was, let's just
see how they handle this one.

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And what did the
"World Press" do?

00:40:07.830 --> 00:40:09.199 align:middle line:90%
Stargate Opens Over Norway.

00:40:09.199 --> 00:40:10.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's what
the "World Press" said.

00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:11.615 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't me.

00:40:11.615 --> 00:40:13.156 align:middle line:84%
That was what the
"World Press" said.

00:40:13.156 --> 00:40:13.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, wow.

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:14.250 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:15.650 align:middle line:90%
So they're getting us set up.

00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:18.960 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it could be part of that
Project Blue Beam business,

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:21.510 align:middle line:84%
where they talk about a
holographic projection.

00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: That was created
by man, though, wasn't it?

00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:23.910 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Yes, exactly.

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And to me it could be playing
into this messianic sort

00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:29.720 align:middle line:84%
of scenario they talk
about, where you're

00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:32.170 align:middle line:84%
going to see this
holographic messiah manifest,

00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:33.320 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:34.380 align:middle line:90%
Incredibly fascinating.

00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:35.213 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

00:40:35.213 --> 00:40:37.000 align:middle line:90%
We'll go to you right behind.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.820 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes, Are these
stargates a natural phenomenon,

00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:42.300 align:middle line:84%
or were they
engineered by somebody?

00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And if so, whose
technology is that?

00:40:44.570 --> 00:40:46.690 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Ah, where did
they come from, William?

00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:49.460 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Well, there
are natural stargates.

00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:52.560 align:middle line:84%
Any kind of sacred spot is,
by definition, a stargate,

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:55.927 align:middle line:84%
where the energy of a star or
star system saturates the soil.

00:40:55.927 --> 00:40:57.760 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And is hooked
into another system.

00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:59.343 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Yeah, like
the Giza Plateau.

00:40:59.343 --> 00:41:01.050 align:middle line:84%
The three pyramids
aligning with Orion.

00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:03.120 align:middle line:90%
That's a stargate.

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:06.732 align:middle line:84%
And so if there are those
that are engineered,

00:41:06.732 --> 00:41:08.190 align:middle line:84%
then you have to
ask, well, who are

00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:09.320 align:middle line:90%
the beings that engineered them?

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:09.880 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And why?

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:10.680 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: And why?

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:12.605 align:middle line:84%
And personally, I think it
would have been the Anunnaki.

00:41:12.605 --> 00:41:14.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think it goes
back deep, deep, deep

00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:17.840 align:middle line:84%
into human history with
these nonphysical beings.

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And the Anunnaki,
I believe, were

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:23.090 align:middle line:84%
beings that had the ability
to phase back and forth

00:41:23.090 --> 00:41:24.827 align:middle line:84%
between the physical
and the nonphysical.

00:41:24.827 --> 00:41:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And they're the ones that
originally brought the gateway

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:27.810 align:middle line:90%
technology.

00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:29.330 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the place
they came from

00:41:29.330 --> 00:41:31.080 align:middle line:84%
is called the
Nebiru, which means

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:33.534 align:middle line:90%
the stargate or crossing place.

00:41:33.534 --> 00:41:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And so then, all
of their stories,

00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:38.567 align:middle line:84%
the oldest human
stories, Inanna's descent

00:41:38.567 --> 00:41:39.400 align:middle line:90%
into the underworld.

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:43.030 align:middle line:84%
She takes off seven power
objects, her clothing,

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:44.660 align:middle line:84%
her shagura helmet
that makes her

00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:48.330 align:middle line:84%
go far into the universe, her
pala garment, and other objects

00:41:48.330 --> 00:41:51.430 align:middle line:84%
that she descends through
seven halls, or hulls,

00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:54.820 align:middle line:84%
to visit her sister
Ereshkigal in the kur, which

00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:55.880 align:middle line:90%
could be the core.

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:57.410 align:middle line:90%
Maybe the galactic core, right?

00:41:57.410 --> 00:41:58.995 align:middle line:90%
That's the oldest human story.

00:41:58.995 --> 00:42:01.240 align:middle line:84%
That's called the
Ur-myth, or the monomyth.

00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:03.690 align:middle line:84%
The next oldest human story
is "The Epic of Gilgamesh."

00:42:03.690 --> 00:42:06.896 align:middle line:84%
Gilgamesh is told by a goddess
he's 2/3 divine, 1/3 human.

00:42:06.896 --> 00:42:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And if he wants to
get through the gate

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:10.400 align:middle line:84%
to the gods, the
stargate of the gods--

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:13.070 align:middle line:84%
which is all of our goal-- he's
to have to clean up his act.

00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:14.850 align:middle line:84%
270 is not going
to get him through.

00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:16.950 align:middle line:84%
He's going to have
to become 360.

00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:18.950 align:middle line:84%
So these are the
oldest human stories.

00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:20.060 align:middle line:90%
And what are they about?

00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:21.930 align:middle line:84%
Going through the
gate of the Anunnaki.

00:42:21.930 --> 00:42:23.920 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Could they be
time traveling tunnels?

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:24.820 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Absolutely.

00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:25.900 align:middle line:90%
Without a question.

00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And because, I mean, I mentioned
earlier the example of Jesus

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.100 align:middle line:90%
in the gnostic gospels.

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:32.200 align:middle line:84%
He shows up in one, The
Revelation of the Magi,

00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:34.191 align:middle line:84%
and tells the three
magi, "What makes

00:42:34.191 --> 00:42:36.190 align:middle line:84%
you think this is the
first time I've been here?

00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:37.200 align:middle line:90%
I've been to the future.

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:38.116 align:middle line:90%
I've been to the past.

00:42:38.116 --> 00:42:39.920 align:middle line:90%
I've visited many generations."

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:42.899 align:middle line:84%
So there's no question to
me that these are stargate

00:42:42.899 --> 00:42:44.940 align:middle line:84%
traveling time travelers
we're dealing with here.

00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:46.810 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Yeah, that's fun to
travel through one of those.

00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:47.570 align:middle line:90%
I want to do that.

00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:48.820 align:middle line:90%
How about some more questions?

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:50.500 align:middle line:90%
William Henry, here.

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:51.620 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir.

00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:55.094 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: OK, back to our
origin, I read Billy Meier.

00:42:55.094 --> 00:42:56.260 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Billy Meier, yeah.

00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: This guy,
that we, as a human race,

00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:01.820 align:middle line:84%
were created after
another human race,

00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:04.880 align:middle line:84%
with a little bit of anger,
so we can become warriors,

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:08.510 align:middle line:84%
we can defend our race
and be able to fight.

00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:10.330 align:middle line:90%
So what's your take on that?

00:43:10.330 --> 00:43:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Sometimes anger
can be a good thing.

00:43:12.450 --> 00:43:16.440 align:middle line:84%
I took a group, a tour group
to Chartres, France, one time.

00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:16.990 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:43:16.990 --> 00:43:19.239 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: I'm walking them
up the bell tower up there,

00:43:19.239 --> 00:43:21.610 align:middle line:84%
because there's a
spectacular view at the top.

00:43:21.610 --> 00:43:22.730 align:middle line:84%
And we're going up
this winding staircase,

00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:24.640 align:middle line:84%
and we're about, I
don't know, halfway up.

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:25.410 align:middle line:84%
And people are
huffing and puffing

00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:26.830 align:middle line:90%
and they're really mad at me.

00:43:26.830 --> 00:43:28.280 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they're angry.

00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And I said, just keep
pushing, keep pushing.

00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:31.540 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Because you
pushed them up there?

00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:32.130 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Yeah.

00:43:32.130 --> 00:43:32.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:33.460 align:middle line:84%
They're angry at me
because I pushed--

00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Where's the elevator?

00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:36.870 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Yeah, right And so
we finally get up to the top,

00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:39.312 align:middle line:84%
and they see this
spectacular view.

00:43:39.312 --> 00:43:40.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, there you go.

00:43:40.270 --> 00:43:41.280 align:middle line:90%
That's called alchemy.

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:43.710 align:middle line:90%
You just transmuted your anger.

00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And you used it to get this
ultimate view up here on top.

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:49.120 align:middle line:90%
So anger can be--

00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:51.630 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So the anger was
changed to satisfaction.

00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:52.470 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Exactly.

00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:53.260 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of what we
have to learn how to do,

00:43:55.650 --> 00:43:57.965 align:middle line:84%
is if we have that anger
or those lower emotions,

00:43:57.965 --> 00:44:01.280 align:middle line:84%
is we have to transmute
them by focusing

00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:02.900 align:middle line:90%
on what it is that we do want.

00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And knowing and be motivated
by getting up to the top,

00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:08.306 align:middle line:84%
rather than by the
anger or the fear.

00:44:08.306 --> 00:44:10.305 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Some people say
we're a prison planet.

00:44:10.305 --> 00:44:14.100 align:middle line:84%
That because the human
species is so angry,

00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:15.840 align:middle line:90%
that maybe we were just dumped.

00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:17.940 align:middle line:84%
We're the mishaps
of the universe.

00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:19.440 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Yeah, I
don't know about--

00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:21.064 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't go so far
as to say mishaps.

00:44:21.064 --> 00:44:23.700 align:middle line:84%
But you do get a sense that
we are in a matrix here,

00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:26.690 align:middle line:84%
we're in quarantine, we're
in cosmic kindergarten

00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:28.630 align:middle line:84%
is perhaps a softer
way of saying it.

00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:30.250 align:middle line:90%
We're here to learn something.

00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:33.730 align:middle line:84%
And again, in my view, we're
in this pupal phase here.

00:44:33.730 --> 00:44:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And we're learning to
become, metaphorically,

00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:38.210 align:middle line:84%
the butterflies, our
next level of evolution.

00:44:38.210 --> 00:44:41.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is the place where
we seemingly learn to do that.

00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure this goes on
on many, many, many millions

00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:44.760 align:middle line:90%
of other planets, as well.

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:44.814 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Absolutely.

00:44:44.814 --> 00:44:46.880 align:middle line:84%
They're all probably
figuring out the same thing.

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:47.630 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Exactly.

00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:48.671 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Many questions.

00:44:48.671 --> 00:44:49.530 align:middle line:90%
How about some more?

00:44:49.530 --> 00:44:50.780 align:middle line:90%
One more, William Henry?

00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:52.375 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you right back here.

00:44:52.375 --> 00:44:54.750 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm wondering
what you think is in store

00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:59.720 align:middle line:84%
for us this year, since we
have the Mahdi prophecy,

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:05.020 align:middle line:84%
and the Malachi prophecy,
the new pope, the comet ISON.

00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And all these things kind
of happening all at once,

00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:08.270 align:middle line:90%
this year.

00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:10.353 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: A lot of events
happening on the planet,

00:45:10.353 --> 00:45:10.970 align:middle line:90%
William.

00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:13.694 align:middle line:90%
And do they all tie in together?

00:45:13.694 --> 00:45:14.860 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: I believe they do.

00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:16.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's not just
a conspiracy theory.

00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:18.520 align:middle line:84%
I think, I'm on the edge
of my seat, personally.

00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:20.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean she mentions
the Iran and the Mahdi,

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:23.760 align:middle line:84%
where you've got the
president of Iran

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:26.800 align:middle line:84%
believes that he's in
connection or communication

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:28.610 align:middle line:84%
with the Islamic
Messiah, the Mahdi.

00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And he further
believes that they

00:45:30.210 --> 00:45:32.010 align:middle line:84%
can hasten the
arrival of this figure

00:45:32.010 --> 00:45:34.210 align:middle line:84%
by creating global
chaos, because that's

00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:36.950 align:middle line:84%
part of the Islamic prophecy
for the return of this figure.

00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:39.480 align:middle line:84%
Who, then, will reveal
the Ark of the Covenant,

00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:42.410 align:middle line:90%
along with his assistant, Jesus.

00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And then, you flip over
to the next pope business,

00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:47.487 align:middle line:84%
where you get these
Malachi prophesies

00:45:47.487 --> 00:45:48.820 align:middle line:90%
that talk about the appearance--

00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:49.930 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: We've one more pope.

00:45:49.930 --> 00:45:50.940 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: The last pope.

00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:55.205 align:middle line:84%
And he introduces the judge
dread, the dreaded judge,

00:45:55.205 --> 00:45:57.197 align:middle line:84%
who is Jesus, at
Judgment Day when

00:45:57.197 --> 00:45:58.780 align:middle line:84%
he looks at all of
our hearts and say,

00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:01.052 align:middle line:84%
hey, how are you
doing, kind of thing.

00:46:01.052 --> 00:46:05.040 align:middle line:84%
So we've got this convergence
of all of these prophesies

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:06.640 align:middle line:90%
that are now playing out.

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:09.440 align:middle line:84%
And you know, Ahmadinejad
is getting voted out

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:10.260 align:middle line:90%
at the end of May.

00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:11.740 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I think so.

00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:13.041 align:middle line:90%
The Ayatollah wants him out.

00:46:13.041 --> 00:46:13.790 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Exactly.

00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And his term as Iranian
President is up.

00:46:16.130 --> 00:46:18.720 align:middle line:84%
So that suggests to me,
and he has proclaimed,

00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:21.200 align:middle line:84%
he proclaimed it at the
UN, back in September 2012,

00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:24.330 align:middle line:84%
that he is here to introduce
the Islamic Messiah, the Mahdi,

00:46:24.330 --> 00:46:27.140 align:middle line:84%
in a new age, based on
rebirth and resurrection.

00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:28.837 align:middle line:90%
And that's his purpose.

00:46:28.837 --> 00:46:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think he's
going to leave office

00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:34.064 align:middle line:84%
without taking a swing at
fulfilling that purpose.

00:46:34.064 --> 00:46:36.230 align:middle line:84%
So that tells me that the
period between now and May

00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:37.620 align:middle line:90%
could get pretty rocky.

00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:40.370 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, and it's amazing
how they all seem to focal

00:46:40.370 --> 00:46:41.535 align:middle line:90%
toward the same point.

00:46:41.535 --> 00:46:42.285 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Exactly.

00:46:42.285 --> 00:46:43.326 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Every religion.

00:46:43.326 --> 00:46:44.110 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Exactly.

00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:45.470 align:middle line:84%
They're all talking
about the same thing.

00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:47.640 align:middle line:84%
And it all converges on
the Ark of the Covenant.

00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:50.350 align:middle line:84%
Because whether you're talking
about the Jewish Messiah,

00:46:50.350 --> 00:46:53.370 align:middle line:84%
the Christian Christ, The Second
Coming, or the Islamic Mahdi,

00:46:53.370 --> 00:46:56.850 align:middle line:84%
they're all symbolized by
the same device or symbol,

00:46:56.850 --> 00:46:57.850 align:middle line:90%
the Ark of the Covenant.

00:46:57.850 --> 00:46:59.750 align:middle line:84%
That's why I wrote "The
Judgment Day Device."

00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:03.660 align:middle line:84%
Because we got to, if Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad introduces

00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:05.640 align:middle line:84%
the Mahdi, I wouldn't
know him from Adam.

00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:08.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean we have descriptions of
what he's going to look like.

00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't know Jesus
from Adam, if I saw him,

00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:11.400 align:middle line:90%
either, chances are.

00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:13.500 align:middle line:84%
You know, I don't think any of
us really could say for sure,

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:15.050 align:middle line:84%
that's definitely
Jesus, right there.

00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:17.270 align:middle line:84%
But they'll be symbolized
by the Ark of the Covenant.

00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And my thing is, if they
bring out some made in China

00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:22.960 align:middle line:84%
golden box and say, this
is the Ark of the Covenant,

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:24.210 align:middle line:90%
then we know they're a fake.

00:47:24.210 --> 00:47:24.850 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Exactly.

00:47:24.850 --> 00:47:25.516 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Right.

00:47:25.516 --> 00:47:27.500 align:middle line:84%
Because the Ark of the
Covenant is not just the

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:28.890 align:middle line:90%
made in China golden box.

00:47:28.890 --> 00:47:31.460 align:middle line:84%
It's the rod of enlightenment,
the flask of manna, the oil,

00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:34.540 align:middle line:84%
and all the other
components of this kit that

00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:35.770 align:middle line:90%
ultimately opened a portal.

00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:37.155 align:middle line:84%
And that's how these
figures would manifest.

00:47:37.155 --> 00:47:39.279 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Let's take one
more question for William.

00:47:39.279 --> 00:47:40.200 align:middle line:90%
Who's got one?

00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:41.239 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:47:41.239 --> 00:47:43.530 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: What do you
think would happen if a person

00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:46.130 align:middle line:84%
achieved the ability to
go through the stargate

00:47:46.130 --> 00:47:50.610 align:middle line:84%
but their body was still
here and perfectly healthy?

00:47:50.610 --> 00:47:53.870 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Chances are, their
body wouldn't stay here.

00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:54.820 align:middle line:90%
The tradition--

00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:56.120 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It goes with it, huh?

00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:56.970 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Well, no.

00:47:56.970 --> 00:47:57.845 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It doesn't?

00:47:57.845 --> 00:47:59.520 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: It's dissolved.

00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:01.620 align:middle line:84%
I followed the Tibetan
rainbow body tradition,

00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:04.350 align:middle line:84%
which is found in the ancient
Egyptian Star Walker tradition,

00:48:04.350 --> 00:48:07.300 align:middle line:84%
as well as many traditions
around the world speak of this.

00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:09.390 align:middle line:84%
And they tell us that
this body is designed

00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:12.700 align:middle line:84%
to be dissolved into what
they refer to as the rainbow

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:14.710 align:middle line:84%
body, resurrection
body, or light body.

00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:17.050 align:middle line:84%
So the physical body
would be dissolved,

00:48:17.050 --> 00:48:19.270 align:middle line:84%
leaving behind only hair,
toe, and fingernails,

00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:21.500 align:middle line:84%
which have no nerves
to be transmuted.

00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:23.610 align:middle line:90%
That's what would be left.

00:48:23.610 --> 00:48:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And then, there's the
scholars that I've consulted,

00:48:26.850 --> 00:48:29.120 align:middle line:84%
and these are people
that know the Dalai Lama,

00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:31.990 align:middle line:84%
and have translated the Tibetan
texts about these teachings

00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:33.890 align:middle line:84%
and were very
interested in my work

00:48:33.890 --> 00:48:35.660 align:middle line:84%
on the ancient
Egyptian Star Walkers.

00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And their belief in this is
that the body is left behind

00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:42.970 align:middle line:84%
and that the new body, the
rainbow body, resurrection

00:48:42.970 --> 00:48:45.640 align:middle line:84%
body, light body, star
walker body, as I call it,

00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:48.920 align:middle line:84%
has the ability to open
stargates and worm holes.

00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And so, in effect,
the body itself

00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:54.140 align:middle line:84%
is the worm hole,
which is incredible.

00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:57.089 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Much like Star Trek
when they are beamed aboard?

00:48:57.089 --> 00:48:57.880 align:middle line:90%
That kind of thing?

00:48:57.880 --> 00:48:59.296 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Yes,
absolutely, George.

00:48:59.296 --> 00:49:03.630 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of the many
names for this light body

00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:05.520 align:middle line:84%
is they call it the
beaming garment.

00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:07.930 align:middle line:84%
This is the term they
used in ancient Iran,

00:49:07.930 --> 00:49:10.260 align:middle line:84%
4,000 years ago,
the beaming garment.

00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:13.700 align:middle line:84%
Because when you put it on,
you beam, you radiate light.

00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:16.370 align:middle line:84%
But now that term works in
our Star Trek vernacular,

00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:18.880 align:middle line:84%
where beaming means
dematerialize the body

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:21.650 align:middle line:84%
into information, beam
it to another location,

00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:24.220 align:middle line:84%
and then re-materialize
it in a physical form

00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:26.640 align:middle line:84%
at that other location--
the beaming garment.

00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:29.480 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's amazing, William,
how it all comes back to just

00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:30.850 align:middle line:90%
pure energy.

00:49:30.850 --> 00:49:31.815 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Exactly.

00:49:31.815 --> 00:49:34.240 align:middle line:90%
And pure thought and pure love.

00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:35.920 align:middle line:90%
That's what it's all about.

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, in my work, I
talk about people I know.

00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:41.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, OK, how do I achieve
this stargate body,

00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:42.710 align:middle line:90%
or this light body?

00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:44.490 align:middle line:90%
Well, you've got to imagine it.

00:49:44.490 --> 00:49:46.339 align:middle line:84%
You have to be able
to conceive it.

00:49:46.339 --> 00:49:48.630 align:middle line:84%
You have to be directly
introduced to your true nature.

00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:51.110 align:middle line:84%
You're really a butterfly
in a pupal form, here.

00:49:51.110 --> 00:49:53.695 align:middle line:84%
Then you have to believe
that you can achieve this.

00:49:53.695 --> 00:49:55.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's where a lot
of people get hung up.

00:49:55.570 --> 00:49:56.430 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Absolutely.

00:49:56.430 --> 00:49:58.260 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Then you live your
life with the expectation that

00:49:58.260 --> 00:49:59.150 align:middle line:90%
that's what's going to happen.

00:49:59.150 --> 00:50:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And you study, you do the
spiritual work that's required.

00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:04.264 align:middle line:84%
And so you imagine it, you
believe it, you live it.

00:50:04.264 --> 00:50:06.180 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What did you
bring us here, William?

00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:07.000 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Ah!

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:07.500 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:09.200 align:middle line:84%
I brought a little
pyramid, here.

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:10.290 align:middle line:90%
It goes with a story.

00:50:10.290 --> 00:50:11.456 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Let me hold it up.

00:50:11.456 --> 00:50:12.300 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: OK.

00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:15.660 align:middle line:84%
The first time I went
to Egypt, I really

00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:17.800 align:middle line:84%
didn't know enough about
what I was doing there.

00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:18.540 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You were
a little green.

00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:20.082 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: A little
green, total off.

00:50:20.082 --> 00:50:21.290 align:middle line:90%
We go into the great pyramid.

00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:24.160 align:middle line:84%
We have private time and
we're in the King's Chamber.

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And so we decide we're going
to have a little quiet time,

00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:30.020 align:middle line:84%
meditate in the King's
Chamber, which is, basically,

00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:31.750 align:middle line:90%
near the middle of the pyramid.

00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And I just didn't know
really what to do.

00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:36.850 align:middle line:84%
So I slid my back against the
wall, just closed my eyes.

00:50:36.850 --> 00:50:38.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, OK,
I'm in the center

00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:40.910 align:middle line:84%
of the land masses of the
planet, one of the most

00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:42.510 align:middle line:84%
profound structures
in the world.

00:50:42.510 --> 00:50:45.040 align:middle line:84%
I just start sending out
love to my family and friends

00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:46.430 align:middle line:90%
back home.

00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing
I know, there's

00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:51.290 align:middle line:84%
these blue eyes just
come out of nowhere.

00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:53.940 align:middle line:84%
These-- and they're
beaming bliss at me.

00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And I've just got this
huge smile on my face.

00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And they're clearly
conscious entities.

00:50:58.410 --> 00:51:00.040 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do other
people see this?

00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:00.600 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: No.

00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:03.067 align:middle line:84%
Because, when we got out
of the pyramid I said, man,

00:51:03.067 --> 00:51:04.400 align:middle line:90%
did you all see those blue eyes?

00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, what
are you talking about?

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:07.270 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: William?

00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:08.186 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Yeah, right.

00:51:08.186 --> 00:51:10.090 align:middle line:90%
They were beaming bliss at me.

00:51:10.090 --> 00:51:12.030 align:middle line:84%
That's the only way
I can express it.

00:51:12.030 --> 00:51:14.320 align:middle line:90%
And so I'm like, what was that?

00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:15.900 align:middle line:90%
And I'm looking all around.

00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:18.140 align:middle line:84%
And nobody has any clue
what I'm talking about.

00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:20.830 align:middle line:84%
Finally, we get down
to the museum in Luxor,

00:51:20.830 --> 00:51:24.220 align:middle line:90%
down in Southern Egypt.

00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And I go into the museum there,
and here's this little pyramid,

00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:32.150 align:middle line:84%
with exactly the same
blue eye that I saw.

00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:33.540 align:middle line:90%
That with beaming bliss at me.

00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:34.910 align:middle line:90%
And it's the eye of Horus.

00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:36.240 align:middle line:90%
And I realized, wow!

00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:38.340 align:middle line:84%
I knew at that
moment that my life

00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:40.060 align:middle line:90%
was going to be-- was changed.

00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:42.900 align:middle line:84%
That I would be trying to figure
out what had happened to me.

00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:44.620 align:middle line:90%
And then I got an explanation.

00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:47.430 align:middle line:84%
I had interviewed a gentleman
named Andrew Collins, who

00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:50.350 align:middle line:84%
was a researcher on
the star system Cygnus.

00:51:50.350 --> 00:51:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And he worked with a
physicist named Wheeler,

00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:55.900 align:middle line:84%
who proposed that,
hey, if you're

00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:58.480 align:middle line:84%
some super advanced
civilization,

00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:00.940 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to send
spaceships out in the universe,

00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:03.584 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
send beams of light.

00:52:03.584 --> 00:52:04.500 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's easier.

00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:05.190 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Yeah, it's easier.

00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:06.640 align:middle line:84%
You're going to send
some particles around.

00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:07.720 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
go looking around

00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:10.025 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to look
for advanced consciousness.

00:52:10.025 --> 00:52:11.858 align:middle line:84%
And you might say, oh,
you look interesting.

00:52:11.858 --> 00:52:14.910 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to enter into
that person's consciousness.

00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:18.280 align:middle line:84%
And if you like what you see,
then perhaps these particles

00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:22.320 align:middle line:84%
have the ability to open
up a portal through which

00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:25.230 align:middle line:84%
a visitor from the other side
could come into this realm.

00:52:25.230 --> 00:52:27.990 align:middle line:84%
Or someone from this realm
could go through the portal

00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:29.554 align:middle line:90%
to that star system.

00:52:29.554 --> 00:52:31.220 align:middle line:84%
And I'm absolutely
convinced that that's

00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:33.190 align:middle line:84%
what that was, that
I had experienced.

00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:34.730 align:middle line:84%
It's maybe one of
these particles

00:52:34.730 --> 00:52:37.400 align:middle line:84%
was kind of interviewing
me, taking a look around,

00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:39.410 align:middle line:84%
and the portal
didn't open that day.

00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:40.940 align:middle line:90%
But maybe another time.

00:52:40.940 --> 00:52:44.670 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Is this planet unique?

00:52:44.670 --> 00:52:47.060 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: It is, as far
as NASA is concerned.

00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:49.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're out
looking for Earth's twin.

00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:50.980 align:middle line:90%
And we're having a hard time.

00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:52.340 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah, we are.

00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:53.640 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's a vast universe.

00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:54.960 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: It's a huge universe.

00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:57.490 align:middle line:90%
And this a precious planet.

00:52:57.490 --> 00:52:58.590 align:middle line:90%
Life is precious.

00:52:58.590 --> 00:53:00.980 align:middle line:84%
We have no idea
how lucky we really

00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:04.380 align:middle line:84%
are to be in a human body,
especially at this time.

00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And we have to all recognize
that, about what a gift

00:53:07.090 --> 00:53:10.820 align:middle line:84%
it is just to be present at
this time, and to participate.

00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And that gives us a
degree of responsibility.

00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:16.750 align:middle line:84%
We all have to say, wait a
minute, maybe, at some point,

00:53:16.750 --> 00:53:18.560 align:middle line:84%
there's going to
be a judgment day

00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:21.560 align:middle line:84%
and they'll ask, well, you
know, when it was all going down

00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:23.940 align:middle line:90%
there, what did you do?

00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:28.210 align:middle line:84%
Or what if you were
the one that we sent?

00:53:28.210 --> 00:53:30.865 align:middle line:84%
As Dannion Brinkley found out
in his near-death experience.

00:53:30.865 --> 00:53:31.120 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Exactly

00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:32.660 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: They
came back and said,

00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:36.480 align:middle line:84%
what if the Holy Spirit was off
that day, and they sent you?

00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:38.940 align:middle line:84%
What did do in your life,
or with your life, that

00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:41.200 align:middle line:84%
would be an exemplar
for generations to come?

00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:43.920 align:middle line:84%
And I try to live my life by
that code, as much as possible.

00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:44.230 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Well, you do.

00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:45.300 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Not in
an egotistical way,

00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:46.760 align:middle line:84%
but just to recognize
that's our--

00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:48.266 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You're
an enlightened guy.

00:53:48.266 --> 00:53:49.390 align:middle line:90%
And you've been everywhere.

00:53:49.390 --> 00:53:52.320 align:middle line:84%
You were on "Ancient Aliens"
on the History Channel, right?

00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:53.442 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Yep, loved that.

00:53:53.442 --> 00:53:54.400 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Noted author.

00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:56.530 align:middle line:84%
The book is out,
"Judgement" is out.

00:53:56.530 --> 00:53:58.610 align:middle line:90%
And what's next for you?

00:53:58.610 --> 00:54:01.720 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Well, going back to
Rennes-le-Chateau the first

00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:04.130 align:middle line:84%
of May, and working
on the path of souls.

00:54:04.130 --> 00:54:06.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to, you
know, people all

00:54:06.010 --> 00:54:08.100 align:middle line:84%
want to know, what's
the afterlife like?

00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:11.034 align:middle line:84%
And how do we get there
in the best possible way?

00:54:11.034 --> 00:54:12.700 align:middle line:84%
And, well, the answer
is many of these--

00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:14.530 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: There's no
easy road, is there?

00:54:14.530 --> 00:54:17.255 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Well, no.

00:54:17.255 --> 00:54:18.450 align:middle line:90%
Not an easy road.

00:54:18.450 --> 00:54:19.584 align:middle line:90%
But there are maps.

00:54:19.584 --> 00:54:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
surprising thing to me,

00:54:21.250 --> 00:54:23.280 align:middle line:84%
is how much of this
artwork reveals

00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:26.760 align:middle line:84%
what I refer to as soul
maps that tell us, hey,

00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:30.220 align:middle line:84%
when you're out of your body
and you're feeling lost,

00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:33.010 align:middle line:84%
look for these guides,
head towards Orion's Gate,

00:54:33.010 --> 00:54:33.650 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:54:33.650 --> 00:54:35.440 align:middle line:84%
Look for these signs
and the symbols,

00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:38.140 align:middle line:84%
because you will be able to
then navigate the afterlife.

00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:39.820 align:middle line:90%
So I'm on that quest right now.

00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:42.540 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What do you
think is on the other side?

00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:43.710 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Eternity.

00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:46.410 align:middle line:84%
Continued existence
as a conscious being.

00:54:46.410 --> 00:54:50.270 align:middle line:84%
I think we just go on and on and
on forever and ever and ever.

00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:53.115 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And some
people might not?

00:54:53.115 --> 00:54:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: I think everybody
gets an opportunity to.

00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:56.448 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They get that shot?

00:54:56.448 --> 00:54:59.400 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: There definitely are
warnings that your soul can be

00:54:59.400 --> 00:54:59.990 align:middle line:90%
destroyed.

00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:01.600 align:middle line:90%
And that just scares me.

00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:03.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's the most
frightening thought,

00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:06.420 align:middle line:84%
that you could ever have
your soul actually destroyed.

00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:10.500 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Why are some people
so enlightened, so gifted,

00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:14.200 align:middle line:84%
so nice, so loving, and
other people aren't?

00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:16.007 align:middle line:84%
We see he hatred on
this planet every day.

00:55:16.007 --> 00:55:17.590 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Yeah, the
cruelty is unreal.

00:55:17.590 --> 00:55:19.490 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Why do we have this?

00:55:19.490 --> 00:55:20.469 align:middle line:90%
I don't understand.

00:55:20.469 --> 00:55:22.510 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: I think there's
probably many different

00:55:22.510 --> 00:55:23.010 align:middle line:90%
reasons.

00:55:23.010 --> 00:55:25.030 align:middle line:84%
People coming here to
work out different karma.

00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:27.650 align:middle line:84%
Or it could be the culture
they came in, the timing.

00:55:27.650 --> 00:55:29.240 align:middle line:90%
It could be a genetic problem.

00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:30.240 align:middle line:90%
There's lots of answers.

00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:31.656 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I was
going to say that.

00:55:31.656 --> 00:55:35.160 align:middle line:84%
Do you think there's a genetic
reason why some people are just

00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:35.975 align:middle line:90%
plain evil?

00:55:35.975 --> 00:55:36.600 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Yeah.

00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:37.210 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:55:37.210 --> 00:55:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And that, you know, now we're
in a time where we can actually

00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:45.220 align:middle line:84%
detect that, because we can
make physical alterations

00:55:45.220 --> 00:55:48.300 align:middle line:84%
to our being while we're still
in the womb, genetically.

00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:51.460 align:middle line:84%
We're now in an age where
we can program our DNA.

00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:54.730 align:middle line:84%
So do we-- you know, what if we
had some way of sensing, hey,

00:55:54.730 --> 00:55:59.020 align:middle line:84%
this person's got a proclivity
for more evil than good?

00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:00.410 align:middle line:90%
Then what do we do?

00:56:00.410 --> 00:56:01.860 align:middle line:90%
Do you change that DNA?

00:56:01.860 --> 00:56:03.940 align:middle line:84%
Or do you just not allow
that person to be born?

00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:05.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean these are real
questions that we're

00:56:05.310 --> 00:56:07.640 align:middle line:84%
going to be coming upon
here in the coming years.

00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:09.890 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: William, briefly
tell us the story--

00:56:09.890 --> 00:56:12.910 align:middle line:84%
I want to wrap things up
with you going to the Capitol

00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:17.210 align:middle line:84%
Building, looking at the top
of the dome, on your back,

00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:18.670 align:middle line:90%
looking straight up.

00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:20.970 align:middle line:84%
What's the importance
of that symbolism?

00:56:20.970 --> 00:56:23.900 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Well, first of all,
the US Capitol was called

00:56:23.900 --> 00:56:24.950 align:middle line:90%
the People's Temple.

00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:27.760 align:middle line:84%
They actually, in
1793, they named it

00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:31.710 align:middle line:90%
the Temple of Celestial Liberty.

00:56:31.710 --> 00:56:35.240 align:middle line:84%
And so the whole place is
modeled after a Buddhist stupa,

00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:37.240 align:middle line:90%
which means it's a vortex.

00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And so when you enter into
the Capitol, into the Rotunda,

00:56:40.470 --> 00:56:43.890 align:middle line:84%
you are literally entering
into a gateway, or a portal.

00:56:43.890 --> 00:56:46.880 align:middle line:90%
Because all domes are feminine.

00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:48.630 align:middle line:90%
And domes are gateways.

00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:50.310 align:middle line:90%
And so you go into the Capitol.

00:56:50.310 --> 00:56:52.280 align:middle line:84%
In the center that
the Rotunda there's

00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:54.500 align:middle line:84%
this gold dot, which
marks the center.

00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:56.290 align:middle line:84%
There's actually
an axis that runs

00:56:56.290 --> 00:56:59.790 align:middle line:84%
from the painting of George
Washington, the fresco

00:56:59.790 --> 00:57:01.960 align:middle line:84%
of George Washington, up
on the ceiling, where he's

00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:04.300 align:middle line:84%
shown in "The Apotheosis
of George Washington"

00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:06.740 align:middle line:84%
as an ascended being,
as a god being,

00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:10.390 align:middle line:84%
in front of an open
sungate, a stargate, right?

00:57:10.390 --> 00:57:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And that vertical axis
goes from the sun,

00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:15.030 align:middle line:84%
right through the gold dot in
center of the Rotunda, down

00:57:15.030 --> 00:57:15.892 align:middle line:90%
the next level.

00:57:15.892 --> 00:57:17.350 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It was
designed that way.

00:57:17.350 --> 00:57:18.516 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Designed that way.

00:57:18.516 --> 00:57:21.490 align:middle line:84%
All the way down into the
tomb of George Washington.

00:57:21.490 --> 00:57:24.250 align:middle line:84%
Now who's buried in
Washington's tomb?

00:57:24.250 --> 00:57:25.840 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I've got
to believe, George.

00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:26.750 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: It's empty.

00:57:26.750 --> 00:57:27.730 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What do
you mean it's empty?

00:57:27.730 --> 00:57:30.105 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: No, it's empty,
because he's up on the ceiling.

00:57:30.105 --> 00:57:31.350 align:middle line:90%
He's a resurrected being.

00:57:31.350 --> 00:57:33.390 align:middle line:90%
Just like Jesus' tomb is empty.

00:57:33.390 --> 00:57:35.700 align:middle line:84%
So when you're in the
middle of the Rotunda

00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:37.770 align:middle line:84%
and you've got your
head on that gold dot,

00:57:37.770 --> 00:57:40.574 align:middle line:84%
and you're looking up
into that incredible dome,

00:57:40.574 --> 00:57:42.740 align:middle line:84%
you're looking at one of
the greatest mystery school

00:57:42.740 --> 00:57:44.250 align:middle line:90%
teachings of all time.

00:57:44.250 --> 00:57:46.920 align:middle line:84%
All the ascension
teachings of the ages

00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:48.952 align:middle line:84%
come together in the
dome the US Capitol.

00:57:48.952 --> 00:57:50.660 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And what's
the seeing eye mean,

00:57:50.660 --> 00:57:53.030 align:middle line:84%
that we see on
the back of money?

00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:55.684 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Well, to me, that's
the All-seeing eye of God.

00:57:55.684 --> 00:57:58.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's the-- it could be
even the eye of Horus, as well.

00:57:58.350 --> 00:58:01.450 align:middle line:84%
It's the eye of an advanced
spiritual consciousness.

00:58:01.450 --> 00:58:04.970 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Why do they
deal in so much symbolism?

00:58:04.970 --> 00:58:07.180 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Well, because
it's an easy way.

00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:09.960 align:middle line:84%
If they put it in words,
words can be disputed.

00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:11.740 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Just
spell it out for us.

00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:13.281 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: No, you
can't spell it out,

00:58:13.281 --> 00:58:16.180 align:middle line:90%
because symbols can go subrosa.

00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:19.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, you can show
somebody a symbol and it means,

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:23.200 align:middle line:84%
like your six petalled flower
of life there, on the Gaiam cup.

00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:25.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to somebody,
that's a really nice logo.

00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:27.740 align:middle line:84%
But someone who knows
what the flower of life is

00:58:27.740 --> 00:58:30.690 align:middle line:84%
can talk for days about the
ascension teaching encoded

00:58:30.690 --> 00:58:32.050 align:middle line:90%
in that symbol right there.

00:58:32.050 --> 00:58:34.950 align:middle line:84%
So the symbols can
live amongst everybody.

00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:36.670 align:middle line:90%
And some people look at them.

00:58:36.670 --> 00:58:38.270 align:middle line:84%
But then, when
you click on them,

00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:40.390 align:middle line:84%
then you have the
opportunity to advance

00:58:40.390 --> 00:58:42.180 align:middle line:84%
in the knowledge that's
encoded within it.

00:58:42.180 --> 00:58:44.846 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I had a friend of mine
in high school who used to wear

00:58:44.846 --> 00:58:46.680 align:middle line:90%
a pyramid hat.

00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And he would go to school, and
he would be getting bad grades.

00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:53.610 align:middle line:84%
He put the pyramid
hat on his head,

00:58:53.610 --> 00:58:56.790 align:middle line:84%
and he started
acing his classes.

00:58:56.790 --> 00:58:58.590 align:middle line:84%
There's some form
of energy that comes

00:58:58.590 --> 00:58:59.910 align:middle line:90%
from this kind of a shape.

00:58:59.910 --> 00:59:01.610 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: I keep
this on my desk.

00:59:01.610 --> 00:59:03.444 align:middle line:84%
It's never more than
two feet away from me,

00:59:03.444 --> 00:59:04.610 align:middle line:90%
when I'm working at my desk.

00:59:04.610 --> 00:59:06.470 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Yeah, I've got one
back in my LA office, too.

00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:07.460 align:middle line:90%
The same kind of thing.

00:59:07.460 --> 00:59:07.840 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Yeah.

00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:09.298 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Yours is
a little better.

00:59:09.298 --> 00:59:11.190 align:middle line:90%
I think I'll keep that.

00:59:11.190 --> 00:59:13.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, William, I want to wish
you the best in everything

00:59:13.690 --> 00:59:14.190 align:middle line:90%
you do.

00:59:14.190 --> 00:59:14.980 align:middle line:84%
>> HENRY: Thank
you for having me.

00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:15.646 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:59:15.646 --> 00:59:19.087 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And your many travels,
for people who want to monitor

00:59:19.087 --> 00:59:20.920 align:middle line:84%
you on your website,
where do they find you?

00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:23.130 align:middle line:10%
>> HENRY: Go to
williamhenry.net is my website.

00:59:23.130 --> 00:59:25.984 align:middle line:10%
You can read about my books
and DVDs, my blog, there.

00:59:25.984 --> 00:59:26.650 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Super.

00:59:26.650 --> 00:59:27.940 align:middle line:10%
Let's hear it, William Henry.

00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:28.928 align:middle line:90%
>> HENRY: Thank you, everybody.

00:59:28.928 --> 00:59:29.422 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Thank you, my friend.

00:59:29.422 --> 00:59:30.410 align:middle line:90%
Always a pleasure.

00:59:30.410 --> 00:59:34.860 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:34.860 --> 00:59:36.030 align:middle line:90%
Ancient mythology.

00:59:36.030 --> 00:59:39.030 align:middle line:84%
Who would ever
suspect that you would

00:59:39.030 --> 00:59:42.280 align:middle line:84%
have investigative
mythologists, who scurry around

00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:46.650 align:middle line:84%
this planet looking for answers
to our many, many questions?

00:59:46.650 --> 00:59:48.560 align:middle line:90%
William Henry, he's one of them.

00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:51.344 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching,
"Beyond Belief."

00:59:51.344 --> 00:59:54.236 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:54.236 --> 01:00:12.767 align:middle line:90%
