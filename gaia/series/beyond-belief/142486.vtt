00:00:18.617 --> 00:00:20.700 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.290 align:middle line:10%
You know I have a lot
of favorite guests

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:23.160 align:middle line:10%
on this program.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.960 align:middle line:10%
But you're going
to meet somebody

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.840 align:middle line:10%
in just a few moments here
who is one of my favorites.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.130 align:middle line:84%
She's a hypnotherapist,
psychotherapist, regressionist.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.050 align:middle line:84%
She has taken 3,000 people
into some of their past lives.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And she's written a new book
called "Meet the Hybrids."

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.460 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to "Beyond
Belief," Barbara Lamb.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.910 align:middle line:84%
>> BARBARA LAMB:
Thank you, George.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:43.785 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hi, Barbara.

00:00:43.785 --> 00:00:45.400 align:middle line:84%
It's always a pleasure
talking to you.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Thank you.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I love running into
you at conferences and places

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:49.530 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: I do, too.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: People love your work.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Awe.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
get involved in this?

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.650 align:middle line:10%
>>LAMB: Well, by 1991,
people started coming to me

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:04.290 align:middle line:10%
who wanted to do regressions
to very unusual experiences

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.660 align:middle line:10%
that they had had in this life.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And these turned out to be
extraterrestrial encounters.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.970 align:middle line:10%
So all through the 1990s and
the 2000s up until today,

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.910 align:middle line:10%
I've had many, many
visits that I've

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.360 align:middle line:10%
been aware of with
these other people

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.640 align:middle line:10%
to extraterrestrials visiting
them and taking them away.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.290 align:middle line:10%
And doing all of that work,
hundreds of people probably,

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.510 align:middle line:10%
1,800 people and many
more regressions,

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.020 align:middle line:10%
I've learned about the
hybridization program that's

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.550 align:middle line:10%
been going on with a number of
these extraterrestrial species

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.480 align:middle line:10%
and the humans whom they
take for these experiences.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And those hybrids, in my
awareness for many years,

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.510 align:middle line:84%
were not human enough
to live here on Earth.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.290 align:middle line:84%
So they were living on the
ships or on other planets

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.305 align:middle line:90%
with those beings.

00:02:05.305 --> 00:02:07.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when you say
not human enough, because they

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.729 align:middle line:90%
didn't look like us?

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: They didn't
look like us enough.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.820 align:middle line:90%
They sort of did.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.790 align:middle line:84%
But if they were
to be here, they'd

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.304 align:middle line:84%
be considered very
peculiar looking.

00:02:17.304 --> 00:02:18.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You could see them.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.090 align:middle line:84%
You'd say, something is
wrong with that person, yeah.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Yes, yes.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.370 align:middle line:84%
People would feel
very uncomfortable.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.450 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, a
more serious thing,

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.920 align:middle line:84%
really, is that they
were not human enough

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.530 align:middle line:84%
in proportion to
be able to tolerate

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.370 align:middle line:90%
our bacteria and our viruses.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.860 align:middle line:84%
So it was said by
these other beings

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.870 align:middle line:84%
that the hybrids would not be
able to withstand being here.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.900 align:middle line:84%
They might come here
for a minute or so.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.470 align:middle line:84%
But they would have to go
right back into the environment

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.350 align:middle line:84%
that they're accustomed
to on their ships.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.500 align:middle line:84%
So that all was going on for,
oh, a good 20 years or so.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And then I began to
realize by meeting

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.860 align:middle line:84%
certain people at conferences
that there were some hybrids.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.655 align:middle line:84%
Who were actually
living here on Earth.

00:03:14.655 --> 00:03:16.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were they
at our conferences

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.640 align:middle line:90%
and we didn't even know it?

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: That's right.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.000 align:middle line:84%
The first one was a
wonderful woman, a hybrid

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.690 align:middle line:90%
named Cynthia Crawford.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, does she
know she's a hybrid?

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: She did
know by that time--

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:30.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: --that she was a hybrid.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they don't know
when they're kids probably,

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.980 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: No, she did not
know until she was age 35.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow, wow.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: And how she found out
was that her father told her

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.610 align:middle line:90%
about this.

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.820 align:middle line:84%
Her father was
involved in some kind

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.990 align:middle line:90%
of unknown, secret program.

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:58.200 align:middle line:84%
So the father actually
drugged the mother

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.770 align:middle line:84%
before she was
pregnant and she was

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.300 align:middle line:84%
taken by a combination
of humans working

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:12.250 align:middle line:84%
with a few extraterrestrials,
taken away for an hour or two

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.050 align:middle line:90%
at the most--

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.133 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just enough time.

00:04:14.133 --> 00:04:16.649 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Yes-- to
do what they did.

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:21.420 align:middle line:84%
And they implanted
a fetus, an embryo,

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.350 align:middle line:84%
that was composed
of the sperm having

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.150 align:middle line:84%
been taken from the human
father and the eggs taken

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.730 align:middle line:84%
from the human mother
and then combined

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.000 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrial genetics
of three different types.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My God.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: So that embryo
then in that encounter

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.074 align:middle line:90%
was implanted in the mother.

00:04:44.074 --> 00:04:45.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She became
instantly pregnant, right?

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Instantly pregnant.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.090 align:middle line:84%
She had not been
intending to be pregnant.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.220 align:middle line:84%
They were not really expecting
that at that particular time.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.270 align:middle line:90%
But she was pregnant.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And she carried
that baby full term

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.020 align:middle line:84%
and delivered just like a
regular mother here on Earth

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.980 align:middle line:90%
does.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:10.570 align:middle line:84%
And that baby turned out
to be the hybrid, Cynthia.

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:11.370 align:middle line:90%
Now, Cynthia--

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.661 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a story, Barbara.

00:05:12.661 --> 00:05:13.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Oh, yeah.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:14.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My gosh.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Now, Cynthia didn't
know that until she was age 35.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.080 align:middle line:84%
And her father
finally thought, well,

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.890 align:middle line:84%
it's time that she knows
how she was created.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, how did
she accept this story?

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.359 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: She had always
felt very, very different--

00:05:32.359 --> 00:05:33.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Different, yeah.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: --than her
family and from anybody

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.290 align:middle line:90%
she ever knew anywhere.

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.920 align:middle line:84%
She certainly felt like a
different kind of child.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.190 align:middle line:84%
This, by the way, is very
typical of the other hybrids

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.024 align:middle line:84%
whom I've extensively
interviewed for the book,

00:05:49.024 --> 00:05:50.315 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You see a similarity--

00:05:50.315 --> 00:05:50.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: --"Meet the Hybrids."

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --and a pattern here,
don't you, with these people?

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Oh, yes.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:59.980 align:middle line:84%
With the eight hybrids who my
co-author and I extensively

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.060 align:middle line:84%
interviewed for "Meet
the Hybrids" book,

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.200 align:middle line:84%
they all had this common
pattern that they did not

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.890 align:middle line:84%
know until they were adults
that they were hybrids.

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:17.110 align:middle line:84%
But they all felt really
different from anybody else

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.070 align:middle line:90%
they knew.

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.070 align:middle line:84%
They all had
different abilities,

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:25.060 align:middle line:84%
rather unusual abilities that
some other people have some of.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:30.280 align:middle line:84%
But they were all very
psychic and clairvoyant.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.740 align:middle line:90%
They could all see auras.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.910 align:middle line:84%
They could all pick
up very sensitively

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:40.090 align:middle line:84%
on energies in
places and energies

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.580 align:middle line:84%
with different
people, very tuned

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.310 align:middle line:90%
into different frequencies.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when you hear
the term, Barbara, hybrid--

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:48.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Yes.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:51.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --you obviously
think part human,

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:52.760 align:middle line:90%
part extraterrestrial.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:53.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Yes.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of the
extraterrestrial type,

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.770 align:middle line:84%
are we talking about
one sect, one race,

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.680 align:middle line:84%
or a number of different
kinds of races out here?

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: We're talking
about a number

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.250 align:middle line:90%
of different kinds of races.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.050 align:middle line:84%
With these eight
hybrids whom I've

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:11.530 align:middle line:84%
come to know
extremely well, they

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:17.230 align:middle line:84%
come from 25 different
extraterrestrial races.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, there may very
well be other hybrids

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:25.450 align:middle line:84%
who are a mixture of still
more different kinds of races.

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:27.400 align:middle line:90%
I don't know about that.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:33.520 align:middle line:84%
But the eight whom we studied
have had 25 different races

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.150 align:middle line:84%
contributing their
genetics to them.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that would
include alien Greys,

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.670 align:middle line:84%
the Nordics that look like
humans, the Reptilians.

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:43.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Right.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.685 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It goes on and on.

00:07:44.685 --> 00:07:48.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Pleiadians, Blue
Arcturians, Andromedans.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Arcturians
are bird-like, aren't they?

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:52.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: The
Arcuturians, well, there

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:56.200 align:middle line:84%
are different types of
Arcturians, actually.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.510 align:middle line:84%
These people have the
genetics from what

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:02.020 align:middle line:84%
they call Blue
Arcturians who actually

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:04.740 align:middle line:84%
have the beautiful
blue tone of skin.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like avatars, almost.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:10.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Yes, like the avatars
in the movie, quite similar,

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:11.770 align:middle line:90%
not exactly.

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:14.300 align:middle line:90%
And they're shining beings.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:15.100 align:middle line:90%
They're glowing.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:18.160 align:middle line:84%
They're very, very
high consciousness,

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:22.960 align:middle line:84%
beautiful, wonderful beings,
very kind, very unconditionally

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.070 align:middle line:90%
loving.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:26.676 align:middle line:84%
And Mantis beings
are involved with--

00:08:26.676 --> 00:08:27.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't like them.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.407 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Oh, the Mantis beings--

00:08:29.407 --> 00:08:30.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They don't look--

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:32.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Well, they
look like big bugs.

00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:33.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:35.919 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: They're very
tall, very bug looking.

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:37.450 align:middle line:90%
But they are wonderful.

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:42.610 align:middle line:10%
Any experience that I
have had regressing people

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:45.580 align:middle line:10%
to their encounters
where they've

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.610 align:middle line:10%
been involved with
Mantis beings,

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:51.910 align:middle line:10%
they always experience
the Mantis beings

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:54.740 align:middle line:10%
as being extremely kind--

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:55.540 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:59.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: --loving,
intelligent, playful.

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:03.400 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one time I was
talking with a friend,

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.370 align:middle line:84%
sitting in my
backyard, my garden,

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:09.010 align:middle line:84%
and talking to the
friend on my cell phone

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:13.750 align:middle line:84%
for about 20 minutes, talking
about the Mantis beings.

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:17.650 align:middle line:84%
And I was aware that I
was talking in very, very

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:19.240 align:middle line:90%
enthusiastic tones--

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:22.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: --because I was
excited about the Mantis

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:25.660 align:middle line:84%
beings I had learned
about through all

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:27.220 align:middle line:90%
this regression work.

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:31.420 align:middle line:84%
And after 20 minutes of talking
excitedly about the Mantis,

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:33.234 align:middle line:90%
I looked down on my lap and--

00:09:33.234 --> 00:09:34.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There it was.

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:37.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: --there it was
a tiny, one-inch tall,

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:43.610 align:middle line:84%
at the most, little, baby
Mantis being suddenly appearing

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:44.410 align:middle line:90%
on my lap.

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:47.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you know that
wasn't an extraterrestrial?

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:51.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Well, I don't know that
it wasn't and extraterrestrial.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.350 align:middle line:90%
It could have been.

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:56.650 align:middle line:84%
It just seemed that the
synchronicity of talking

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:58.060 align:middle line:90%
about the big Mantis beings--

00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:59.101 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And there it is.

00:09:59.101 --> 00:10:01.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: --and seeing
instantly this little one,

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.420 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't even known we
had praying mantises

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:05.414 align:middle line:90%
in my back garden.

00:10:05.414 --> 00:10:06.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's great.

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:07.622 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: But there it was, yeah.

00:10:07.622 --> 00:10:08.621 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Barb, go ahead.

00:10:08.621 --> 00:10:10.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: There were a number
of different species.

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And the Sirian--
that's S-i-r-i-a-n--

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:17.460 align:middle line:90%


00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:22.740 align:middle line:84%
and Sirius-B beings have
contributed their genetics

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.900 align:middle line:90%
to some of these hybrids.

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And the tall, white Zetas,
the little Gray beings

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.750 align:middle line:84%
that we hear so
much about, quite

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:32.570 align:middle line:90%
a number of different species.

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are we a farm for them?

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:35.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Are we are farm?

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:38.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, what an
interesting question.

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:41.430 align:middle line:84%
You know, we don't really
know what their motivation

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:46.020 align:middle line:84%
is except that the beings
who contributed genetics

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:50.010 align:middle line:84%
to these hybrids whom
I know, they did this

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:53.820 align:middle line:90%
for a very wonderful purpose.

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:58.920 align:middle line:84%
They did it because they had
been very aware of humanity

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:02.970 align:middle line:84%
and the earth and what's
going on here, particularly

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:05.040 align:middle line:90%
among human beings.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.284 align:middle line:90%
And they're very concerned.

00:11:06.284 --> 00:11:07.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, they are?

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.906 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: They're very concerned
about humanity and the earth--

00:11:10.906 --> 00:11:12.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And our direction.

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:16.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: --and our direction
and the really atrocious things

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:21.570 align:middle line:84%
that many human beings do to
other human beings and how

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:22.885 align:middle line:90%
we're polluting the land--

00:11:22.885 --> 00:11:24.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's got
to shock them--

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:24.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: --really wrecking--

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:25.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --the way
we conduct ourselves.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: --ruining
the Earth, yeah.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:30.450 align:middle line:90%
And so they really want to help.

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And they have an agreement
among the cosmic communities

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:37.200 align:middle line:90%
of non-interference.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.080 align:middle line:84%
So they don't come
directly and help.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.797 align:middle line:84%
But they can't really survive
here very long anyway.

00:11:43.797 --> 00:11:45.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The hybrids or the ETs?

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:46.802 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: These
extraterrestrials--

00:11:46.802 --> 00:11:47.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: By themselves?

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: --would not be
able to stay here long.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But the hybrids can.

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:52.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: So, yes, it's a
brilliant plan, really.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:57.960 align:middle line:84%
Because then they take
regular human beings

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:02.340 align:middle line:84%
and hybridize them, and
I think not too many.

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:05.550 align:middle line:84%
But there probably are
some all over the world,

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:08.400 align:middle line:84%
hybridize them with
enough of their genetics

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:14.820 align:middle line:84%
so that these hybrids can be
working here to help humanity.

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:18.390 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea of
these hybrids is

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:25.860 align:middle line:84%
to assist humanity to
help us to save ourselves

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:29.640 align:middle line:84%
and to help us save
the Earth and to raise

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:34.620 align:middle line:84%
the overall consciousness
of humanity out of some

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:39.120 align:middle line:84%
of these very dysfunctional
ways that a lot of humanity

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:39.932 align:middle line:90%
is involved in.

00:12:39.932 --> 00:12:41.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't
think though that it's

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.920 align:middle line:90%
a program to replace us?

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:47.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: No, I do not think
it's a program to replace us.

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:50.840 align:middle line:84%
I think it's
completely benevolent.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:54.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, in saying this, I must
admit that I'm certainly

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:59.250 align:middle line:84%
aware of the
opinion of Dr. David

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:00.730 align:middle line:90%
Jacobs whom I know personally.

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:01.530 align:middle line:90%
I think he's--

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:01.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's brilliant.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:02.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: --a great guy.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.000 align:middle line:90%
I really enjoy him very much.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:06.847 align:middle line:90%
It just happens--

00:13:06.847 --> 00:13:08.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He thinks
the other position.

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:10.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: --he has had
people come to him

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:15.210 align:middle line:84%
who have had very different
experiences in regard

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:17.760 align:middle line:90%
to ET human hybrids.

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And that whole view is a very,
very pessimistic point of view.

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:26.820 align:middle line:84%
And it just happens
that people have

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:33.390 align:middle line:84%
come to me about hybridization
who have a very positive view.

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:38.190 align:middle line:84%
So all I can say is that
maybe there's some of both.

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:43.080 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there are some hybrids
who do intend to eventually take

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.250 align:middle line:90%
over the world.

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:45.900 align:middle line:90%
I don't know about that.

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:50.430 align:middle line:84%
That has not come across
my attention in my work.

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:53.370 align:middle line:84%
But there also are these
hybrids who are here

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:57.240 align:middle line:90%
really to help humanity.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:00.660 align:middle line:84%
There are so many of
the beings out there

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:04.310 align:middle line:84%
who have contributed their
genetics to these hybrids whom

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:10.870 align:middle line:84%
I know who are extremely
caring, really benevolent.

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:18.180 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they all are described
as unconditionally loving.

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And they emphasize
that we all are

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:29.490 align:middle line:84%
of the same overall
creative source.

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:34.980 align:middle line:84%
So that's not only humans
are of the creative source.

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:40.530 align:middle line:84%
But all of the species of
what we call extraterrestrials

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:46.150 align:middle line:84%
in the cosmos and in the
other dimension as well

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:49.870 align:middle line:90%
are all of the creative source.

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:53.290 align:middle line:84%
So they go on to
emphasize that we

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:57.580 align:middle line:84%
are all, humans,
extraterrestrials,

00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:03.250 align:middle line:90%
other dimensional beings, one.

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:05.290 align:middle line:90%
We're not separated.

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:11.170 align:middle line:84%
You know, here on Earth,
we tend to really emphasize

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:11.970 align:middle line:90%
independence--

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:12.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: True.

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:13.170 align:middle line:90%
True.

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:15.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: --and separateness.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:19.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm an individual different
than you as an individual.

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:23.334 align:middle line:84%
But actually that's an illusion
according to these beings.

00:15:23.334 --> 00:15:26.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they trying to make
us all the same, carbon copies?

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: No, not the
same, but to recognize

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:35.190 align:middle line:90%
that we are all one in life.

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And we're one with all the
species of life on the Earth.

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:43.990 align:middle line:84%
That maybe is a little
bit easier for many people

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:46.100 align:middle line:90%
to begin to ponder.

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:50.260 align:middle line:84%
But not only that, we're
one with all the others

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.320 align:middle line:90%
species all over the cosmos.

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:57.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Hybridization, to me,
means taking good parts of both

00:15:57.950 --> 00:15:58.750 align:middle line:90%
and mixing them--

00:15:58.750 --> 00:15:59.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Yes.

00:15:59.020 --> 00:15:59.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --into one.

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:00.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Yes.

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:01.756 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the
good part of the ETs

00:16:01.756 --> 00:16:03.470 align:middle line:90%
that they're trying to give us?

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:05.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Oh, there are
many, many good parts.

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:09.010 align:middle line:84%
For instance, they're
very intelligent.

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:14.020 align:middle line:84%
They're very broad in they're
thinking, very open-minded.

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:16.150 align:middle line:90%
They're very psychic.

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:18.760 align:middle line:90%
They have healing skills.

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:21.130 align:middle line:90%
They read auras easily.

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:24.280 align:middle line:90%
They feel the frequencies.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:28.736 align:middle line:84%
The hybrids have the
vibrations, the frequencies--

00:16:28.736 --> 00:16:29.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They pick that up.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: --of the
extraterrestrials.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what do
they want from us, Barb?

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:36.220 align:middle line:90%
What do we contribute here?

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:41.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Well, they recognize us
as a very intelligent species

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:44.200 align:middle line:90%
and a very important species.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:47.440 align:middle line:84%
For one thing,
humanity, they say,

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:52.540 align:middle line:84%
has been comprised with
extraterrestrial genetics

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:58.300 align:middle line:84%
from way back, probably in the
beginning of what we consider

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:01.604 align:middle line:90%
humanity, so a long time ago.

00:17:01.604 --> 00:17:03.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what's
fascinating is that even

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:09.339 align:middle line:84%
now we are experimenting between
the DNA of humans and animals.

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:13.030 align:middle line:84%
>> These scientific teams
are editing human embryos.

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:14.530 align:middle line:90%
You've seen the stories.

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:15.970 align:middle line:90%
You've seen the articles.

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:17.290 align:middle line:90%
What's your reaction to that?

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:20.680 align:middle line:84%
>> That has been reviewed
properly with EC institution

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:24.400 align:middle line:84%
just as one of the experiments
being performed with

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.160 align:middle line:90%
the leftover embryos.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.520 align:middle line:84%
And in China, that
hasn't really generated

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:33.100 align:middle line:84%
enough interest
versus the interests

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:36.730 align:middle line:90%
from international press.

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:38.530 align:middle line:10%
Because many of the
scientific detail

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:42.160 align:middle line:10%
hasn't really been
reported in those articles.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.110 align:middle line:10%
And also the intention
of the research

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:46.450 align:middle line:10%
hasn't really been
properly understood.

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:49.360 align:middle line:10%
Also, the regulatory process
hasn't been really being

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.854 align:middle line:10%
examined carefully enough.

00:17:51.854 --> 00:17:53.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Barb, that
Chinese researcher, to me,

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:57.280 align:middle line:84%
is talking about, of course,
manipulating animals and humans

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.360 align:middle line:90%
and combining them.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:59.830 align:middle line:84%
I find that an
abomination myself.

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:02.195 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Well, I do too, yes.

00:18:02.195 --> 00:18:03.070 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I think that's--

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:05.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's not what
the hybrid program is?

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:07.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: --totally unacceptable.

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:11.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're talking about
very, very different life forms

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.000 align:middle line:90%
here--

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:12.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: --people and animals.

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:18.810 align:middle line:84%
No, the hybrid
extraterrestrial human program

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:20.260 align:middle line:90%
is quite different.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:24.580 align:middle line:84%
Because in many ways, even
though there are differences,

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:29.740 align:middle line:84%
they are more like
humans than our animal

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:32.980 align:middle line:90%
species are like humans.

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:36.640 align:middle line:84%
We're all intelligent,
cognitive,

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:41.410 align:middle line:84%
talking, thinking,
communicating beings.

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:46.540 align:middle line:84%
We all have a large
range of value judgments,

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:50.990 align:middle line:90%
of perceptions, of spirituality.

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:55.510 align:middle line:84%
So these hybrids, or
the extraterrestrials

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:59.020 align:middle line:84%
who create the hybrids, are
very spiritually oriented.

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:00.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's an
interesting take.

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:04.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: And they would like
to see that the humans become

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:06.190 align:middle line:90%
more spiritually minded.

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:08.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When they're
born, where are they?

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:10.240 align:middle line:90%
Are they in the hospitals?

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.395 align:middle line:90%
Are they born in a house?

00:19:11.395 --> 00:19:11.710 align:middle line:90%
Where do they--

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:12.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Oh, the hybrids?

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:13.730 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes.

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:15.550 align:middle line:90%
You see, the hybrids--

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:20.440 align:middle line:84%
well, the let's say the
fetuses and the embryos

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:26.320 align:middle line:84%
in most cases become
hybridized and continue

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:30.259 align:middle line:84%
right on through the
whole gestation cycle

00:19:30.259 --> 00:19:31.300 align:middle line:90%
inside the human mother--

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:32.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they're born in
hospitals like children, right?

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:34.105 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: --and they're born.

00:19:34.105 --> 00:19:36.340 align:middle line:84%
Yes, they're born
in hospitals or home

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:38.100 align:middle line:90%
like all of the rest of us.

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:39.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does the
delivery doctor

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:41.350 align:middle line:90%
know that they're hybrids?

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:43.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: No, the
delivery doctor does not

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:44.650 align:middle line:90%
know that there are hybrids.

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:45.490 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knows.

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:48.480 align:middle line:84%
Even the parents don't
know at that point--

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My gosh.

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:50.571 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: --that they're hybrids.

00:19:50.571 --> 00:19:54.730 align:middle line:84%
But the parents do
notice as the babies

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:57.297 align:middle line:84%
are developing into
toddlers and young children.

00:19:57.297 --> 00:19:58.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That they're something.

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:01.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: They notice that
they're substantially different.

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:04.960 align:middle line:84%
And they hear from
these children

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:10.060 align:middle line:84%
who are hybridized that the
children often say you're not

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:12.075 align:middle line:90%
my real mother and father.

00:20:12.075 --> 00:20:14.497 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, it's got to be
heartbreaking to hear that.

00:20:14.497 --> 00:20:15.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: You're not my real home.

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:19.120 align:middle line:84%
My real home is
somehow out there.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.310 align:middle line:90%
And I long to go home.

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:22.200 align:middle line:90%
You're wonderful.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.490 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:25.240 align:middle line:90%
You are fine parents.

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:32.350 align:middle line:84%
But I just keep sensing that
my real home, my real family,

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:34.450 align:middle line:90%
is out there somehow.

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:39.930 align:middle line:84%
So these children are recognized
as being a bit unusual.

00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:42.740 align:middle line:84%
But they look like
regular humans.

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:44.180 align:middle line:90%
They do not look peculiar.

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:46.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't have the big
heads or the huge, black eyes.

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:48.303 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: No, the big,
wrap-around-- no, they don't.

00:20:48.303 --> 00:20:49.660 align:middle line:90%
No, they look like our children.

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:52.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But earlier
experimentation did.

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Those hybrids, I think, of
years gone back were noticeable,

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.830 align:middle line:90%
weren't they?

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:03.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: I really don't
know about earlier hybrids.

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:04.295 align:middle line:90%
I just know about--

00:21:04.295 --> 00:21:05.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: About these.

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:06.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: The ones I can
really speak about--

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:07.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These are the
ones that have perfected.

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:09.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: --or the ones
I know now, yeah.

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:10.896 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the
hybrids, if they're not

00:21:10.896 --> 00:21:16.180 align:middle line:84%
told by their fathers,
how do they know

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:18.130 align:middle line:90%
that they are who they are?

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:21.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Well, the hybrids, you
see, they grow up with a sense

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:23.380 align:middle line:90%
that they're not from here.

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:25.960 align:middle line:84%
This family is not
their real family.

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And they notice that they
have all these other abilities

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:32.080 align:middle line:84%
that other people in
their family don't have,

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:36.490 align:middle line:84%
psychic abilities, healing
abilities, the clairvoyant,

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:40.000 align:middle line:84%
seeing auras, feeling
their frequencies,

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.690 align:middle line:84%
having a lot of empathy
for people and so forth.

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And they noticed in school and
in the neighborhood playing

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:49.570 align:middle line:84%
with their children
that they have

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:53.650 align:middle line:84%
all these abilities that other
children don't seem to have.

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And in many ways, it's a
very distressing thing--

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:58.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, I would
think so, yeah.

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:00.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: --for these children
because the other children make

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:02.950 align:middle line:84%
fun of them like,
oh, stop talking

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:04.750 align:middle line:90%
about the colors around my head.

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:05.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:06.395 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Or how do
you know what's

00:22:06.395 --> 00:22:07.870 align:middle line:90%
going on inside my stomach?

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:10.340 align:middle line:84%
Or how do you know what's
going to happen tomorrow,

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:11.800 align:middle line:90%
in the future?

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they not
invited into the inner core

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:15.430 align:middle line:90%
of other kids?

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:18.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Well, sometimes they're
excluded by other children.

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:20.620 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, if they're
fortunate, they

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:22.400 align:middle line:90%
have some friends at least.

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:26.200 align:middle line:84%
But they keep experiencing
that they're different.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:27.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they get sick?

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:28.510 align:middle line:90%
Do they eat?

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:29.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: No, no they don't.

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:33.520 align:middle line:84%
They tend not to get
sick particularly.

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.500 align:middle line:90%
So that's a help.

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:41.980 align:middle line:84%
But they do have, many of
them, unusual interior physical

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:43.240 align:middle line:90%
features.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If they were X-rayed,
what would a doctor see?

00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:48.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Well, one
of them was X-rayed

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:52.170 align:middle line:84%
because she had a
series of broken bones.

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And so finally they tested
the bone consistency

00:22:56.130 --> 00:23:00.450 align:middle line:84%
and realized that she had a
different bone consistency

00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:03.030 align:middle line:90%
from the rest of us humans.

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:07.590 align:middle line:84%
Another one discovered over
time because of various tests

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:10.860 align:middle line:84%
that she had a different
blood consistency that

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:12.720 align:middle line:90%
was quite unusual.

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And one young man one of
our hybrids in England

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:20.760 align:middle line:84%
actually had one of the
lower internal organs up here

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.180 align:middle line:90%
in his chest.

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:22.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:27.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: And another hybrid had
a different muscle consistency,

00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:30.990 align:middle line:84%
actually a weaker
muscle consistency,

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:34.230 align:middle line:84%
and was advised
not to participate

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:36.210 align:middle line:90%
in sports because of that.

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:38.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we know
how long they live?

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:42.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Well, so far the oldest
one whom I know is age 65.

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:43.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 65.

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.386 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: They seem
to live normal--

00:23:45.386 --> 00:23:46.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not too old.

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:47.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: --human lifetimes.

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:50.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could they
go to 200, 300?

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: I don't know if they
could live beyond 100 or so.

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.570 align:middle line:90%
Time will tell.

00:23:55.570 --> 00:23:56.580 align:middle line:90%
We don't know that yet.

00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:59.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this hybridization
program, the one that you've

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:02.510 align:middle line:90%
been studying, relatively new?

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:05.640 align:middle line:84%
Or has been going on since
the beginning of time?

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Well, really, all I
know is that these people,

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:15.900 align:middle line:84%
the oldest of whom is 65 at
this point, 66 maybe by now--

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:20.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if this has
been going on for centuries

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:21.690 align:middle line:90%
and there were other hybrids.

00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:29.640 align:middle line:84%
I suspect, but I don't know
that it might be this generation

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.420 align:middle line:90%
type of happening.

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:32.220 align:middle line:90%
But I don't know.

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:35.530 align:middle line:84%
You see, I think the earth
is in more trouble than it--

00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:36.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe so.

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:40.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: --has ever been because
of our nuclear proliferation--

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There's so much hate.

00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:45.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: --nuclear capability
and all the polluting

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:48.760 align:middle line:84%
that we're doing of the earth
getting worse and worse.

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:51.010 align:middle line:84%
And some of these
other species who

00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:55.770 align:middle line:84%
were very benevolent and caring
are really, really concerned.

00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:59.820 align:middle line:84%
For one thing, they have a
right to be concerned because

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:02.790 align:middle line:84%
with our nuclear
capability, if we start

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:04.900 align:middle line:90%
sending off nuclear bombs--

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:05.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:09.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: --it not only would
pollute the earth and probably

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:13.170 align:middle line:84%
eventually eliminate
all life on Earth,

00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:16.710 align:middle line:84%
which we don't want to see
and even these other beings

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:22.740 align:middle line:84%
don't want to see, but the
nuclear radiation rises

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:27.614 align:middle line:84%
and spreads out not only, they
say, through our solar system--

00:25:27.614 --> 00:25:28.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But through--

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:30.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: --but beyond
the solar system--

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:30.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they pick that up?

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:32.114 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: --to other planets.

00:25:32.114 --> 00:25:37.484 align:middle line:84%
So we are a very dangerous place
with what we're tampering with.

00:25:37.484 --> 00:25:39.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, it's interesting
the Roswell crash occurred

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:43.066 align:middle line:84%
two years after we
detonated nukes over Japan.

00:25:43.066 --> 00:25:43.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: That's right.

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe they picked
something up and went, woah,

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.670 align:middle line:90%
they're now in this new age.

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:50.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Yes.

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:51.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We better
get over there.

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:52.413 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Yes, that's right.

00:25:52.413 --> 00:25:55.390 align:middle line:10%
I think that really
caught their attention.

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:58.440 align:middle line:10%
So I think that
extraterrestrials have

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:00.120 align:middle line:10%
been paying attention to earth.

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:05.230 align:middle line:10%
UFOs have been appearing, oh,
way, way back in our history,

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:09.010 align:middle line:10%
maybe at the very beginning
of our human history.

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:13.200 align:middle line:84%
But I think there's much more
activity now due to the fact

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.810 align:middle line:84%
that so many of
these species are

00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:19.380 align:middle line:84%
aware of what we're doing
here and that we could

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:21.130 align:middle line:90%
be such a threat to them--

00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:21.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:25.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: --out there as well
as, of course, to ourselves.

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:28.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As a regressionist,
as a hypnotherapist,

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:32.460 align:middle line:84%
as a psychotherapist,
are you in shock

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:36.690 align:middle line:84%
over what you're discovering
about this hybrid connection?

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:37.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Not really.

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:40.590 align:middle line:84%
Because I think
the shock came more

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:43.350 align:middle line:84%
when I began to realize
that people were really

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:48.720 align:middle line:84%
having visits and encounters
with extraterrestrial beings.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:53.250 align:middle line:84%
So that was back in
the late 1980s and 1991

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:55.380 align:middle line:84%
in particular when
people started

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:58.020 align:middle line:90%
really coming to me for this.

00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:03.720 align:middle line:84%
So it's been a slow,
gradual build up from 1991

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:08.294 align:middle line:90%
until about 2009 or so--

00:27:08.294 --> 00:27:09.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is
more prevalent now?

00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:13.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: --when I think I met
my first hybrid living here.

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:16.740 align:middle line:90%
And so I wasn't shocked.

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:21.190 align:middle line:84%
But, wow, that's
a whole new aspect

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:25.330 align:middle line:84%
that's opening up for me that
I hadn't realized before.

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:28.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And does it seem to
be getting bigger and bigger,

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:29.294 align:middle line:90%
these cases--

00:27:29.294 --> 00:27:30.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Yes, I think--

00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:31.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --in terms of numbers?

00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:35.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Yes, I think that we
have a huge number of people,

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:39.240 align:middle line:84%
even in America,
who have been having

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:42.630 align:middle line:84%
these extraterrestrial
encounters.

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:47.400 align:middle line:84%
I think the number of hybrids
is a much smaller number.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:53.000 align:middle line:10%
But in 1999, there was a Roper
poll, the second Roper poll,

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.140 align:middle line:10%
about extraterrestrial
experiencers.

00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:58.240 align:middle line:90%
And it was estimated--

00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:59.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's gone up.

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:02.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: --that there were
eight million Americans--

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:03.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:04.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: --having
extraterrestrial--

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:05.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just here.

00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:05.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: --encounters--

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:05.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:07.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: --just in America.

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.877 align:middle line:90%
And it's a worldwide phenomenon.

00:28:08.877 --> 00:28:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
hybrids do you think

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:12.260 align:middle line:90%
are out there on the planet?

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Oh, I could
only make a guess.

00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:17.060 align:middle line:90%
I know of eight.

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:21.450 align:middle line:84%
David Jacobs knows
of other ones.

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:22.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It could be millions.

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:24.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Well, it
could be millions.

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:26.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure about that at all.

00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:29.780 align:middle line:84%
Maybe thousands, probably
a good number of a few.

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:32.635 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
breed with humans?

00:28:32.635 --> 00:28:33.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Yes, they do.

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:35.265 align:middle line:84%
They breed with humans
and have children.

00:28:35.265 --> 00:28:36.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what are
the children like?

00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:37.940 align:middle line:84%
Of the Hybrids, what
are the children like?

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:41.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Yeah, the hybrids
can breed with other humans.

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:44.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It sounds
biblical, doesn't it?

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:47.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Right, and then
they can have children

00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:52.950 align:middle line:84%
who may or may not, depending
on the genetics they inherit,

00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:57.520 align:middle line:84%
have some of these
special abilities or not.

00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:58.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or not.

00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.861 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Again,
depending on what they

00:28:59.861 --> 00:29:02.902 align:middle line:90%
happen to inherit genetically.

00:29:02.902 --> 00:29:04.860 align:middle line:84%
But yes, they grow up
and they marry and have--

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they feel
human, the hybrids?

00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:09.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: They feel human except--

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:14.900 align:middle line:84%
yes, very human-- that they
have these different abilities.

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:18.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, you see, these people,
these hybrids are here

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:20.850 align:middle line:90%
doing a wonderful service.

00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:24.180 align:middle line:84%
The ones that I know,
they're doing healing.

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:26.100 align:middle line:90%
They're doing teaching.

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:27.600 align:middle line:90%
They're doing counseling.

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they tell
people they're hybrids?

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:32.665 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Sometimes they tell
people they're hybrids.

00:29:32.665 --> 00:29:34.289 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the
reaction of people?

00:29:34.289 --> 00:29:36.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Sometimes
they're just considered

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:39.900 align:middle line:84%
a very advanced
spiritual teacher

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:41.484 align:middle line:90%
who's here for helping humans.

00:29:41.484 --> 00:29:43.025 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, I
would think, Barbara,

00:29:43.025 --> 00:29:46.890 align:middle line:84%
if somebody-- and I know someone
who claims to be a hybrid.

00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:49.530 align:middle line:90%
She's a very gorgeous girl.

00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:51.510 align:middle line:90%
They did well with this one.

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:53.790 align:middle line:84%
But she tells people
she's a hybrid

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:55.900 align:middle line:90%
and they walk away from her.

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:56.700 align:middle line:90%
It's almost like--

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:57.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Yes.

00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:59.022 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, you know--

00:29:59.022 --> 00:30:00.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: A little
too uncomfortable.

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:01.521 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --she's strange.

00:30:01.521 --> 00:30:04.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: The people who
hear this are so often not

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:06.900 align:middle line:90%
ready to hear this.

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's completely
understandable.

00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:15.090 align:middle line:84%
So the hybrids I know don't go
around saying, I'm a hybrid.

00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:18.252 align:middle line:84%
But if they are asked,
you seem to be--

00:30:18.252 --> 00:30:19.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They tell the truth.

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:20.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: --unusual.

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:22.800 align:middle line:84%
You seem to have
unusual abilities.

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:24.600 align:middle line:90%
Why do you think that is?

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:29.580 align:middle line:84%
They might say, well, I have
some extraterrestrial genetics.

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:33.620 align:middle line:84%
But generally speaking,
they're just offering classes

00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:38.700 align:middle line:84%
and doing some coaching and
teaching, counseling, healing

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:42.660 align:middle line:84%
and not making a big
point of being a hybrid.

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:46.590 align:middle line:84%
A couple of them
have written books.

00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:52.080 align:middle line:10%
Jacqueline Smith has written
books and Jujuolui Kuita.

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:56.790 align:middle line:84%
One of the special abilities
that some of these hybrids have

00:30:56.790 --> 00:31:02.377 align:middle line:84%
is communicating wonderfully
with animals here on Earth.

00:31:02.377 --> 00:31:03.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I could see that.

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:05.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Yeah, so
Jacqueline Smith--

00:31:05.050 --> 00:31:05.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Telepathy?

00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:08.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: --is very--
yes, telepathy--

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:12.930 align:middle line:84%
very, very cognizant,
very conversant

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:15.370 align:middle line:90%
with animals of all types.

00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And Jujuolui Kuita, who is
a hybrid living in Arizona,

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:25.950 align:middle line:84%
is very fond of all animals,
communicates with them

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:31.290 align:middle line:84%
and particularly likes
the reptile type of life.

00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:32.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like snakes.

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:35.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Loves snakes,
even poisonous snakes.

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:39.090 align:middle line:84%
She's entirely
comfortable with them.

00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And, you see, she has a good
deal of reptilian DNA in her.

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:49.120 align:middle line:84%
Several of these
hybrids have reptilian

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:51.570 align:middle line:90%
aspects, reptilian genetics.

00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:53.020 align:middle line:90%
And yet they look like--

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:54.186 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fascinating.

00:31:54.186 --> 00:31:57.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: --perfectly attractive,
likable human beings.

00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:01.470 align:middle line:84%
And the reptilian
hybrids have been known

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:04.380 align:middle line:90%
to shape shift temporarily--

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:05.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Into--

00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:08.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: --into their
reptilian form.

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:12.600 align:middle line:84%
So that's happened with three
of them whom I know about.

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:16.760 align:middle line:84%
One of them, a beautiful
hybrid living in England,

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:22.500 align:middle line:84%
her name is Charmaine, the
way that she got confirmation

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:27.990 align:middle line:84%
that she is a hybrid was
having an encounter with some

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:31.710 align:middle line:84%
of her reptilian
extraterrestrials.

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And she has encounters
with other types as well

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:37.080 align:middle line:90%
and genetics from other types.

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:41.430 align:middle line:84%
But in one encounter,
when she was about age 27,

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:45.300 align:middle line:84%
with her reptilian
extraterrestrials,

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:52.470 align:middle line:84%
they helped her to shape shift
into her total, pure reptilian

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:53.670 align:middle line:90%
form.

00:32:53.670 --> 00:32:54.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And she can do that?

00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:54.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: And she did.

00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:56.489 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Goes back
and forth within?

00:32:56.489 --> 00:32:59.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: And, yeah, she can go
back and forth as she pleases.

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:01.260 align:middle line:90%
Mostly she's human.

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:02.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:05.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: But when she shape
shifted into her reptilian

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:11.040 align:middle line:84%
form, she was
absolutely delighted.

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:14.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, most of us might be rather
horrified at the thought.

00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:18.090 align:middle line:84%
But she was delighted
because she had always

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:22.590 align:middle line:90%
felt some reptilian in her.

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And I hasten to say that
even though reptilian

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:30.784 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials tend to have
a very negative press here--

00:33:30.784 --> 00:33:32.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, no
question about it, sure.

00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:35.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: --humans, we hear a lot
of negative things about them.

00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:38.200 align:middle line:84%
But I have discovered
in this work

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:44.020 align:middle line:84%
that there are quite a number of
different types of reptilians,

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:48.850 align:middle line:84%
different species of reptilians
within that overall species.

00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are very
kind, very friendly, very nice,

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:59.320 align:middle line:84%
good agendas, agendas that we
would appreciate and definitely

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:00.460 align:middle line:90%
approve of.

00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And she is one of that
type of reptilian.

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:06.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they go
through a scientific study

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:09.940 align:middle line:84%
where scientists will look
at their DNA and go, whoa,

00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:11.790 align:middle line:90%
this is not human?

00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:12.590 align:middle line:90%
Does that happen?

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:16.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Well, these particular
eight hybrids whom I know

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:20.650 align:middle line:84%
so well have elected not
to have genetic testing--

00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:22.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, we got
to get that done.

00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:25.949 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: --even though
understandably almost everybody

00:34:25.949 --> 00:34:28.261 align:middle line:90%
wonders, well, have they been--

00:34:28.261 --> 00:34:29.469 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We'll know for sure.

00:34:29.469 --> 00:34:30.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: --genetically tested?

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:30.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:31.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Of course.

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:32.520 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's a normal thing.

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:33.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The fact
that they don't do it,

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:34.810 align:middle line:90%
doesn't that make you a suspect?

00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:36.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: No, it really doesn't.

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:39.580 align:middle line:84%
Because I've talked to
them at length about this.

00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:42.340 align:middle line:84%
For one thing, they
have been told,

00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:44.739 align:middle line:84%
they have heard
from other people

00:34:44.739 --> 00:34:49.719 align:middle line:84%
being genetically tested that
the results of the genetic test

00:34:49.719 --> 00:34:54.340 align:middle line:84%
automatically get sent
from the testing lab

00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:59.265 align:middle line:84%
to a certain department
of the US government.

00:34:59.265 --> 00:35:00.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:04.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: So what these hybrids
are concerned about is

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.040 align:middle line:84%
if the people receiving this
information would say, oh,

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:12.732 align:middle line:84%
these few people here are
very unusual, very strange--

00:35:12.732 --> 00:35:14.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right, where
did they come from?

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: --I think we
want to investigate this.

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.000 align:middle line:90%
I think we might want to--

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:18.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's dissect them.

00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:19.443 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: --test them.

00:35:19.443 --> 00:35:21.427 align:middle line:84%
Yes, they really
are afraid of that.

00:35:21.427 --> 00:35:23.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Barbara, one
of my favorite movies,

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:25.900 align:middle line:84%
"The Fifth Element," that
dealt with scientists trying

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:28.990 align:middle line:84%
to reconstruct DNA
from what they might

00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:31.120 align:middle line:90%
have found on a crashed craft.

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:33.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Tightly packed with
infinite genetic knowledge,

00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:36.382 align:middle line:84%
almost like this
being was engineered.

00:35:36.382 --> 00:35:40.078 align:middle line:90%


00:35:40.078 --> 00:35:41.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Is there any danger?

00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:42.290 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:44.290 align:middle line:10%
We put it through the
cellular hygiene detector.

00:35:44.290 --> 00:35:49.710 align:middle line:84%
The cell is, for lack of
a better word, perfect.

00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:52.170 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, go ahead.

00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:53.957 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Perfect better
be polite otherwise

00:35:53.957 --> 00:35:56.240 align:middle line:90%
I turn him into cat food.

00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:58.361 align:middle line:90%
>> Activated.

00:35:58.361 --> 00:35:59.735 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: OK, so
that's Hollywood.

00:35:59.735 --> 00:35:59.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: That's Hollywood.

00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:01.906 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But it might
have some reality to it.

00:36:01.906 --> 00:36:05.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Sometimes Hollywood does
put in some aspects of reality.

00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:06.725 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to know--

00:36:06.725 --> 00:36:06.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I always thought--

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:08.271 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: --on the surface of it.

00:36:08.271 --> 00:36:10.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --the reptilians
were like devil-type.

00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:11.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: I know.

00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:14.030 align:middle line:90%
They have such a bad rap.

00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:15.980 align:middle line:90%
And maybe some of them are.

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:21.470 align:middle line:84%
Some of them seem to be more
power hungry, more arrogant,

00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:24.290 align:middle line:90%
more egocentric.

00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:27.800 align:middle line:84%
They have big musculature
and fancy costumes sometimes.

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:28.799 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yellow eyes.

00:36:28.799 --> 00:36:29.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Yellow eyes, yes.

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:36.110 align:middle line:84%
But some of them are much
more gentle and friendly,

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:42.590 align:middle line:84%
benevolent, kind,
good-willed, even loving.

00:36:42.590 --> 00:36:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And I say that with
conviction because I

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:52.760 align:middle line:84%
myself had an encounter,
awake, in the light of day,

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:53.640 align:middle line:90%
plenty of daylight--

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:54.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:57.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: --with a reptilian
who suddenly showed up

00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.300 align:middle line:84%
and I spent a few
minutes with him.

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And I had a completely
positive feeling about him.

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And other people I know
whom I've worked with

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.910 align:middle line:84%
have had some
positive experiences.

00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:14.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when you say
showed up, what do they do?

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:15.680 align:middle line:84%
Do they just walk
through the door?

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:18.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Well, in this
case, I don't know

00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:20.090 align:middle line:90%
if he walked through the door.

00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:22.760 align:middle line:84%
I think, you see, so
many of these beings

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:25.490 align:middle line:90%
are interdimensional.

00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:28.310 align:middle line:84%
I think that he
suddenly, poofed,

00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:32.580 align:middle line:84%
appeared in the middle of my
living room one afternoon.

00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:35.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe he knew
you wanted to meet one.

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:36.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Yes.

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:41.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, the reason he
came to me, he said,

00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:45.740 align:middle line:84%
was because he and
others know that I

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:48.480 align:middle line:84%
do a lot of this regression
therapy work with--

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:49.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Smart.

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:51.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: --experiencers.

00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And every once in a while,
if I was away on vacation

00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:57.350 align:middle line:84%
and not doing this
work for a while,

00:37:57.350 --> 00:38:00.380 align:middle line:84%
the thought would
occur to me, hm, I

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:04.220 align:middle line:84%
wonder if this could
really be happening.

00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:06.350 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if this
could really be true.

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:08.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think the mission is?

00:38:08.570 --> 00:38:10.950 align:middle line:84%
What are they trying to
do here and accomplish?

00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:14.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Well, in that particular
case with that reptilian,

00:38:14.090 --> 00:38:17.960 align:middle line:84%
he said they, because they're
so telepathically tuned

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:23.510 align:middle line:84%
in even from remote distances,
tuned into to us humans.

00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:26.870 align:middle line:84%
They knew that every once in
a while I would have thought

00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:29.370 align:middle line:90%
about the work I was doing.

00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And yet when I was doing the
regression work with people,

00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:33.560 align:middle line:90%
they knew--

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:34.760 align:middle line:90%
and it was true--

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:40.790 align:middle line:84%
that I was completely with
the person, following along,

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:44.270 align:middle line:84%
and believing what
they were experiencing

00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:48.500 align:middle line:84%
in the regression memory of
whatever their experience was.

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:50.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It seems
to me, Barbara,

00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:57.200 align:middle line:84%
that they're trying to replace
humans with hybrids, all of us.

00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:58.070 align:middle line:90%
That's my feeling.

00:38:58.070 --> 00:39:04.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Yeah, my own feeling
about it, my own perspective

00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:08.360 align:middle line:84%
is that these hybrids,
or the extraterrestrials,

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:14.090 align:middle line:84%
are not trying to take over
humanity by creating hybrids.

00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:15.174 align:middle line:90%
I know that David Jacobs--

00:39:15.174 --> 00:39:16.048 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You promise?

00:39:16.048 --> 00:39:17.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: --does feel that.

00:39:17.090 --> 00:39:17.889 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He does.

00:39:17.889 --> 00:39:19.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: I do not feel
that in any way at all.

00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:20.725 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Could you be wrong?

00:39:20.725 --> 00:39:21.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: I have no evidence.

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:22.366 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Could you be wrong?

00:39:22.366 --> 00:39:26.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: It's possible that
there are different kinds

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:29.210 align:middle line:90%
of hybrid programs going on.

00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:35.120 align:middle line:84%
The hybrids I have come to know,
about 15 of them quite well,

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:37.730 align:middle line:84%
they have nothing to do
with taking over the world.

00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:44.420 align:middle line:84%
They had everything to do with
being here to assist humanity,

00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:48.680 align:middle line:84%
particularly to raise the
consciousness as much as they

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:54.590 align:middle line:84%
can of humanity and to even
help with the process of what

00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:57.490 align:middle line:90%
is called ascension.

00:39:57.490 --> 00:40:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And ascension means
raising the consciousness

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:09.170 align:middle line:84%
and creating or increasing
the spirituality of humanity

00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:14.369 align:middle line:84%
as a general so that we will
be treating each other better--

00:40:14.369 --> 00:40:15.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, I hope so.

00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:16.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: --we will be
treating the earth better.

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:18.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We should be doing
that on our own but we're not.

00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:20.436 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: We should be
doing it on her own

00:40:20.436 --> 00:40:22.170 align:middle line:84%
and we're not
doing enough of it.

00:40:22.170 --> 00:40:25.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would humans
except hybrid's directly?

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:27.950 align:middle line:90%
Do they mesh well together?

00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:31.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Yes, humans and
hybrids do mesh well together.

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:37.100 align:middle line:84%
Yes, because people come across
as regular, normal people.

00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:40.070 align:middle line:84%
They look like
regular, normal humans.

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:44.420 align:middle line:84%
They are regular, normal
humans except that they

00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:48.620 align:middle line:84%
do have quite a bit of the
extraterrestrial genetics--

00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:49.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:53.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: --of the the types,
by the way, that they do

00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:55.670 align:middle line:90%
have encounters with.

00:40:55.670 --> 00:41:00.010 align:middle line:84%
So an important point
here is that all

00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:05.380 align:middle line:84%
of the hybrids whom I
know do have visits from

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:06.430 align:middle line:90%
and encounters--

00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:07.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ongoing.

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:10.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: --with the
extraterrestrial types

00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:13.150 align:middle line:90%
that they have the genetics of.

00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:18.190 align:middle line:84%
So many people consider that
when extraterrestrials come,

00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:20.540 align:middle line:90%
they have abductions.

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:23.230 align:middle line:84%
That's a very common
word for it, abductions,

00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:27.830 align:middle line:84%
being taken away for an
hour or so and returned.

00:41:27.830 --> 00:41:29.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they show emotion?

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:30.050 align:middle line:90%
Do they cry?

00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:30.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Oh, yes.

00:41:30.850 --> 00:41:35.350 align:middle line:84%
Hybrids do have emotion because
they're primarily human.

00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:36.330 align:middle line:90%
Yes, they do.

00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:37.150 align:middle line:90%
They're very much--

00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:37.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What kind of jobs--

00:41:37.810 --> 00:41:38.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: --like the rest of us.

00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:41.044 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind of jobs
do they take in society?

00:41:41.044 --> 00:41:42.460 align:middle line:10%
>>LAMB: Well, these
hybrids whom I

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:49.720 align:middle line:10%
know do not have regular day
jobs like so many of us do.

00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:56.650 align:middle line:84%
But they do set themselves up
to teach classes, give lectures,

00:41:56.650 --> 00:42:02.460 align:middle line:84%
teach workshops, do individual
counseling of people,

00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:03.260 align:middle line:90%
generally--

00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:04.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So trying
to educate us.

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:07.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Yeah, trying to educate
us, trying to, as they say,

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:13.090 align:middle line:84%
upgrade the consciousness,
the viewpoint of humanity.

00:42:13.090 --> 00:42:16.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If an
individual suspects

00:42:16.090 --> 00:42:19.565 align:middle line:84%
that something is
different about themselves

00:42:19.565 --> 00:42:21.940 align:middle line:84%
and they could be hybrids,
but that's not the first thing

00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:24.100 align:middle line:84%
somebody would think
about, obviously,

00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:26.160 align:middle line:90%
what do you recommend they do?

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:27.440 align:middle line:90%
Where do they go?

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:30.520 align:middle line:84%
How many Barbara
Lambs are out there?

00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:33.246 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Unfortunately, I think
there are not enough people--

00:42:33.246 --> 00:42:34.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Only one, I think.

00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:38.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: --who are doing
the regression therapy.

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:41.620 align:middle line:84%
Most of the states have
at least one person.

00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And some of the other
countries have one rare person

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:47.510 align:middle line:90%
who does this type of work.

00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:50.320 align:middle line:84%
But if somebody would
like to find somebody

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:52.900 align:middle line:84%
who does his
regression therapy work

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:55.690 align:middle line:84%
for this particular
purpose, they

00:42:55.690 --> 00:43:00.640 align:middle line:84%
could go to the website
of the group called

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:05.470 align:middle line:84%
FREE which is actually
officially called the Edgar

00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:11.670 align:middle line:84%
Mitchell Foundation for
Research into Extra-terrestrial

00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:12.470 align:middle line:90%
Encounters.

00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:14.290 align:middle line:90%
A long name.

00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:18.640 align:middle line:84%
So the website is
simply experiencer.org.

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:20.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Perfect.

00:43:20.730 --> 00:43:21.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LAMB: Experiencer.org.

00:43:21.730 --> 00:43:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And they have, among the
very extensive website,

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:30.580 align:middle line:84%
done a lot of research
on these topics.

00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And they also have a list of
psychotherapists, regression

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:37.780 align:middle line:84%
therapists all over
the United States

00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:40.240 align:middle line:90%
who do this kind of work.

00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:42.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Barbara, if this
program of hybridization

00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:46.380 align:middle line:84%
continues, where do you
see our planet unfolding?

00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:47.180 align:middle line:90%
How does it unfold?

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:49.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LAMB: Well, if the
program continues and there

00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:54.220 align:middle line:84%
are more and more hybrids
helping to upgrade society,

00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:58.570 align:middle line:84%
upgrade the consciousness, I
think it's a very good plan.

00:43:58.570 --> 00:44:01.210 align:middle line:84%
I think that we
might have a fighting

00:44:01.210 --> 00:44:09.130 align:middle line:84%
chance of more and more people
expanding their point of view,

00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:11.890 align:middle line:84%
becoming more
helpful to humanity,

00:44:11.890 --> 00:44:16.240 align:middle line:84%
more helpful to the earth, more
helpful to other human beings.

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:19.610 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully that will
be taking hold.

00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:23.470 align:middle line:84%
So there will be some great
improvements among humanity.

00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:27.890 align:middle line:90%

The next time you
meet somebody who

00:44:30.610 --> 00:44:34.720 align:middle line:10%
might be a little different,
maybe a little strange,

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:37.460 align:middle line:10%
you could be meeting
a human hybrid.
