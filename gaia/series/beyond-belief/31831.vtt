>> [BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.828 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:15.828 --> 00:00:19.555 align:middle line:84%
>> People are basically going
to keep on to help uncover what

00:00:19.555 --> 00:00:20.355 align:middle line:90%
really happened.

00:00:20.355 --> 00:00:22.970 align:middle line:84%
>> I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.710 align:middle line:84%
>> We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.426 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:31.790 align:middle line:90%

>>GEORGE NOORY: Well, hello.

00:00:40.076 --> 00:00:41.410 align:middle line:90%
And welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.690 align:middle line:10%
You know, I have
always been amazed

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.940 align:middle line:10%
with psychics, people
who have the ability

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.820 align:middle line:10%
to glance into the
future and tell us

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.060 align:middle line:10%
things that will happen, things
that will affect all of us.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.570 align:middle line:84%
One such psychic was born
in France in the same region

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.700 align:middle line:90%
that Nostradamus was born.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.570 align:middle line:84%
He was incredible with what
he does and his prolific ways

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.370 align:middle line:90%
of the future.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.680 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
let's take a look.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Louis is 15 years old and
staying with his grandmother,

Rachelle [? Derollo. ?] In
the middle of the night,

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.600 align:middle line:90%
he's awakened by a sound.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.600 align:middle line:84%
Downstairs, he is surprised
to see his grandma, dressing

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.470 align:middle line:90%
and disappearing into the dark.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.430 align:middle line:90%


00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.230 align:middle line:84%
>> I instinctively knew
I had to investigate.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Louis follows her.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.140 align:middle line:84%
At a clearing deep
in the woods, he

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.130 align:middle line:84%
discovers the old lady
looking to the heavens

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.390 align:middle line:90%
through a sextant.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I was mesmerized
to look at her.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.240 align:middle line:84%
>> As Louis comes out
of his hiding place,

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.090 align:middle line:84%
his grandmother has
a message for him.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.900 align:middle line:84%
>> She was telling me the stars
are more than dead rock hanging

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.580 align:middle line:84%
out there for the
sake of beauty.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.070 align:middle line:84%
I realized that
reading tea leaves

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:00.877 align:middle line:84%
and the tarot cards, astrology,
it is part of my background.

00:02:00.877 --> 00:02:01.960 align:middle line:90%
That's how it all started.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Please
welcome Dr. Louis Turi.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.550 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:07.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUIS TURI: Thank you.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.008 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How are you, my friend?

00:02:09.008 --> 00:02:12.672 align:middle line:90%


00:02:12.672 --> 00:02:15.710 align:middle line:84%
So your grandmother had
a great influence in you.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.150 align:middle line:84%
>>TURI: Indeed-- big
influence, I might add,

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.590 align:middle line:90%
that changed my life.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When this
first happened to you,

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.320 align:middle line:84%
when you started learning things
that she helped teach you,

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.120 align:middle line:90%
I mean, was it scary?

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.370 align:middle line:84%
Or did you just
accept it right away?

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.430 align:middle line:10%
>>TURI: I believe everything
is written in the stars.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.926 align:middle line:10%
Your fate is already preset.

00:02:36.926 --> 00:02:38.300 align:middle line:10%
And, of course,
the interaction I

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.550 align:middle line:10%
had with all the
extraterrestrials since then

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.140 align:middle line:10%
led me to what I'm doing today.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.121 align:middle line:10%
But indeed, it was a
pretty interesting time

00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:46.370 align:middle line:10%
when I was going out with her.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long had she
had she been doing that?

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.640 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: Forever.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.460 align:middle line:84%
This has been going
on in our families--

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.110 align:middle line:90%
I guess I have some gypsy in me.

[BOTH CHUCKLING]

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.180 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, but the
legacy is very real.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, it's all
written in the stars.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And she taught
you about the stars.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.910 align:middle line:84%
>>TURI: She taught me
to keep an open mind,

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.940 align:middle line:84%
to realize that what cannot be
seen or touched doesn't really

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.514 align:middle line:90%
mean doesn't exist.

00:03:12.514 --> 00:03:13.930 align:middle line:84%
That's what I've
learned from her.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.929 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Louis, lots of
things happen to people,

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:18.560 align:middle line:90%
good things, bad things.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.300 align:middle line:84%
Is it all related to the
cosmic code and events

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.100 align:middle line:84%
that will unfold to
affect people's lives?

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.900 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: Indeed.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.280 align:middle line:90%
There are no accidents.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.180 align:middle line:84%
There are only cosmic
circumstances that are unknown

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.950 align:middle line:84%
and [? unheeded ?] just yet
by 99.9% of the people walking

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.887 align:middle line:90%
this Earth, including science.

00:03:38.887 --> 00:03:40.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have made
some incredible predictions

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.470 align:middle line:90%
on "Coast to Coast."

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And we look at those
chronologies of the dates

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.560 align:middle line:84%
that you give us,
and strange things

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.420 align:middle line:90%
do happen on those dates.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And you've hit many
of those events

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.950 align:middle line:90%
with some frightening accuracy.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:05.270 align:middle line:84%
These events seem to be all
pretty sad, all dangerous.

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.040 align:middle line:90%
Why is prophecy that way?

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.170 align:middle line:84%
Why can't prophecy say
things will be great?

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.920 align:middle line:84%
>>TURI: Yeah, I wish
I had only good news.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.120 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work that way.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:22.820 align:middle line:84%
In fact, 18 days prior to the
loss of a fireman in Arizona,

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.710 align:middle line:90%
I wrote everything in detail.

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.760 align:middle line:84%
I put it on
Facebook, on Twitter.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.920 align:middle line:90%
I put it on my website.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.470 align:middle line:84%
All my Cosmic Code
[INAUDIBLE] can certify it.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.850 align:middle line:90%
It's still on the internet.

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.000 align:middle line:84%
What I'm trying to say
is the stars don't care.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.884 align:middle line:90%
They just do.

00:04:35.884 --> 00:04:37.300 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty much
like God creating

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.820 align:middle line:84%
an earthquake or a tsunami
and killing innocent children.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.650 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have
cosmic consciousness,

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.870 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be
doing things, and you're

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.520 align:middle line:90%
going to pay the price.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.070 align:middle line:84%
You respect the laws of
when you're in the street.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.380 align:middle line:84%
If you see the stop
sign or the red light,

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.740 align:middle line:84%
you're been taught to
respect the laws of physics.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.570 align:middle line:84%
But because you do not see
the other side of my hand

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:58.820 align:middle line:90%
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.750 align:middle line:90%
There is another set of laws.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.240 align:middle line:84%
Those laws are written
in light by God himself.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.700 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this is how God
speaks through his children,

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.050 align:middle line:90%
through the signs.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.700 align:middle line:84%
And let me refer to what
happened [? suddenly. ?]

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.600 align:middle line:84%
May God bless the soul of all
these very courageous firemen.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.220 align:middle line:90%
It really hurts every one of us.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.670 align:middle line:84%
During that very
precise time-- there

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.680 align:middle line:84%
is a planet called Mercury,
the messengers of the gods,

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.570 align:middle line:84%
that rules the sign of
Gemini, George Noory.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.070 align:middle line:90%
They are born in June like you.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And this planet is
currently going retrograde,

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.697 align:middle line:84%
and this means
people of the past

00:05:37.697 --> 00:05:39.530 align:middle line:84%
are going to be brought
back into your life.

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.946 align:middle line:84%
That's why we are connecting
after so many months I've not

00:05:41.946 --> 00:05:42.860 align:middle line:90%
seen you.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.810 align:middle line:84%
This planet rules
transportation.

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.760 align:middle line:84%
That's why we have
trains that crash.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.130 align:middle line:84%
That's why we have
plane that crashes.

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's why if
you have a plane,

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.600 align:middle line:84%
you can be sure it's
going to be messed up.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you probably
already have experienced

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.530 align:middle line:84%
what Mercury retrograde
is all about,

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:58.970 align:middle line:90%
not necessarily on a good side.

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.500 align:middle line:84%
Like we did enjoy ourselves
today with the beautiful public

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.300 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.130 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of
your private life,

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.400 align:middle line:84%
you have to ask yourself, you
have to [INAUDIBLE] and say,

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.250 align:middle line:84%
what did happen to
me last few days?

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.870 align:middle line:84%
Have I seen some people I
haven't seen for a long time?

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.490 align:middle line:90%
Did my washer-dryer mess up?

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:14.470 align:middle line:90%
Did my car break down?

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:15.980 align:middle line:90%
Did I get a flat tire?

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.600 align:middle line:90%
Suddenly, you are the lucky one.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.940 align:middle line:84%
Because look how many people
died in those two plane crash

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.029 align:middle line:90%
and those two train crash.

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:25.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In Canada, yeah.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>>TURI: Not to forget, of
course, the miscommunication

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.350 align:middle line:84%
involving this guy
on top of a mountain,

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:32.420 align:middle line:84%
did not know that when
Mercury is retrograde,

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.920 align:middle line:84%
the wind change in a matter
of a second. [SNAPS FINGERS]

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.640 align:middle line:84%
The next thing you know maybe
his talkie-walkie didn't work.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.157 align:middle line:90%
There is so many element.

00:06:39.157 --> 00:06:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And again, if you don't
have cosmic consciousness,

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.062 align:middle line:84%
if you're not prepared, George,
you are going to pay the price.

00:06:45.062 --> 00:06:46.270 align:middle line:90%
And this is why I'm here for.

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:47.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it's funny.

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:50.510 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned two things,
planes and a washer and dryer.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.720 align:middle line:84%
In my particular
case, as insignificant

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.150 align:middle line:84%
as it might be compared
to what has been going on

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:00.750 align:middle line:84%
in this planet, I was at an
event some time ago in Toronto,

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.950 align:middle line:84%
and it took me 10
hours to get back home.

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:07.700 align:middle line:84%
Mechanical problems on the
plane, they had to take us off.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.580 align:middle line:84%
You had 150 people
trying to change

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:14.690 align:middle line:84%
their planes with one ticket
teller in a foreign country.

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:15.850 align:middle line:90%
It was a disaster.

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:18.460 align:middle line:84%
I finally got home
after 10 hours.

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.340 align:middle line:84%
And my son and his
wife and his two kids

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.980 align:middle line:84%
are living in my St.
Louis home right now.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.300 align:middle line:90%
And you know the way it is.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.520 align:middle line:90%
Parents help their kids, right?

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And so the laundry was
piled up, and I decided,

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.580 align:middle line:84%
well, I've got to do
some washing for myself.

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.280 align:middle line:84%
I've been traveling
for a couple of weeks.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.190 align:middle line:90%
The dryer didn't work.

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:44.200 align:middle line:84%
This thing has worked for
12 years like clockwork.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.390 align:middle line:84%
How would you mention
that all of a sudden?

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:48.170 align:middle line:84%
>>TURI: George, again,
I repeat myself.

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:51.060 align:middle line:84%
There are no accidents,
only cosmic circumstances.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:52.660 align:middle line:84%
You'll suffer on it
if you don't build

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.320 align:middle line:90%
enough cosmic consciousness.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:08:00.170 align:middle line:84%
In fact, imagine me in 1912
screaming to Captain Smith,

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:02.390 align:middle line:90%
don't get into the "Titanic!"

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:04.320 align:middle line:90%
You guys are going to sink!

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They'd lock you up.

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:06.430 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: Exactly.

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:09.640 align:middle line:84%
The fact of the matter
is this exact same cosmic

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.860 align:middle line:90%
[? predictions ?] were in place.

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:14.290 align:middle line:84%
Exactly the same thing
was that Italian ship also

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:16.900 align:middle line:90%
that sank not long ago.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:21.160 align:middle line:84%
If people could just stop
being skeptical-- because we're

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:25.570 align:middle line:84%
building a society of
agnostics, skeptic, critics.

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:29.620 align:middle line:84%
If we could stop these
attitudes and open up

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.510 align:middle line:84%
to the understanding of how
God speaks to his children

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:33.650 align:middle line:90%
through the sign--

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:36.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you look at the
Bible, in the Bible it is said,

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:37.370 align:middle line:90%
I will talk to you.

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:38.419 align:middle line:90%
You won't see me.

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:40.400 align:middle line:90%
I will present myself to you.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.350 align:middle line:90%
You won't see me.

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:42.520 align:middle line:90%
You won't hear me.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.190 align:middle line:84%
That means you have to
raise your awareness

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:47.620 align:middle line:90%
to the cosmic design.

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:51.340 align:middle line:84%
The magic, and the beauty
of the universal mind

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.670 align:middle line:84%
is that it's interacting
directly with your mind.

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:57.010 align:middle line:84%
But scientists do
not understand that.

00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:58.944 align:middle line:84%
They think everything
start and finish

00:08:58.944 --> 00:09:00.360 align:middle line:84%
within the conception
of the mind.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.050 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no, excuse me.

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:04.990 align:middle line:84%
There is no difference between
George's beautiful mind,

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:08.770 align:middle line:84%
my mind, the one of the killer,
or yours-- same density,

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:10.240 align:middle line:90%
same wiring, same weight.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.560 align:middle line:90%
What's different?

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:15.200 align:middle line:84%
the UCI, a term that
I have developed

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:20.670 align:middle line:84%
with my student, which stands
for Unique Celestial Identity.

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:23.170 align:middle line:84%
At the very moment you
re-integrated yourself

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:24.720 align:middle line:84%
on this dense,
physical world, you

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.940 align:middle line:84%
inherited a set of stars
that make you who you are.

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And even though you are
extraordinary DNA-wise,

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.770 align:middle line:84%
100% connected with
your family member--

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:36.190 align:middle line:84%
your mother, your
sister, your brother--

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:38.360 align:middle line:90%
you're bigger strangers.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:42.040 align:middle line:84%
Because he, she doesn't
have the same UCI.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.580 align:middle line:84%
He hasn't been computerized
by the universal mind for you

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:48.302 align:middle line:84%
to think, to behave, or
to have the same fate.

00:09:48.302 --> 00:09:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I'm
coming from, George.

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:54.070 align:middle line:84%
Like you-- do you think it's
an accident for you to be right

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:56.660 align:middle line:90%
here, right now, like Art Bell?

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.620 align:middle line:84%
When both of you
were born in June,

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:04.620 align:middle line:84%
the messengers of the God,
to represent communication.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:08.712 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Mayan, a
disappeared civilization,

00:10:08.712 --> 00:10:11.970 align:middle line:84%
always views their
life through the stars.

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And in Greek mythology
specifically, they

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.100 align:middle line:84%
have a God called
Mercury is the god who

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:23.680 align:middle line:84%
had some wings on his heels,
and he is a messenger of God.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.110 align:middle line:84%
That's what God
wishes you to do.

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:27.690 align:middle line:84%
He wants you to be a
messenger, a mediator,

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:30.337 align:middle line:84%
to check into everybody's
values and gifts

00:10:30.337 --> 00:10:31.920 align:middle line:84%
and share it to the
rest of the world.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.860 align:middle line:84%
That's why you're here,
George-- no accident.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:37.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you see
things in the future,

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.630 align:middle line:90%
can they be changed?

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:41.400 align:middle line:84%
Because you've been
on our program.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:45.300 align:middle line:84%
You've given people months'
warnings about events,

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.090 align:middle line:90%
and they happen.

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:48.290 align:middle line:90%
Why can't they change them?

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:49.740 align:middle line:90%
Why can't they stop them?

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:53.960 align:middle line:84%
>>TURI: Now, that's again--
let me point out something.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.620 align:middle line:84%
The future is nothing else
than the reincarnations

00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:58.860 align:middle line:90%
of your thought.

00:10:58.860 --> 00:10:59.780 align:middle line:90%
I repeat myself.

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:01.880 align:middle line:84%
Your future is nothing
else than the reincarnation

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.010 align:middle line:90%
of your thought, OK?

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:08.900 align:middle line:84%
So if you understand
the cosmic code

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.000 align:middle line:84%
and understand
you're on a program,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.130 align:middle line:84%
you won't be at the wrong
time or the wrong place.

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:14.850 align:middle line:84%
You will be at the right
time at the right place.

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:16.308 align:middle line:84%
So that's what
makes the difference

00:11:16.308 --> 00:11:19.100 align:middle line:84%
between suffering the
price of cosmic ignorance

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.770 align:middle line:90%
or being educated cosmically.

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:23.750 align:middle line:90%
So you do have the potential.

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:27.440 align:middle line:84%
In fact, our thought process
is like a laser beam that

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.830 align:middle line:84%
can alter not only your
own atomic structure, which

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:32.570 align:middle line:84%
is part of the medical
aspect of my work,

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:35.450 align:middle line:84%
but you can also alter
the direction of humanity.

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:38.660 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't educate
people on the power

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.330 align:middle line:84%
of the superconscious in
time and space, how can

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.010 align:middle line:90%
they get somewhere?

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:44.630 align:middle line:90%
You've got religious fears.

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:46.040 align:middle line:90%
You've got skepticism.

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.800 align:middle line:84%
You've got all
sorts of wars that

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.370 align:middle line:84%
are there to stop
humanity to increase

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.260 align:middle line:90%
his own cosmic consciousness.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.390 align:middle line:84%
As I said earlier,
we are building,

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:59.770 align:middle line:84%
George, a society of
agnostic, atheists, skeptics,

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:02.750 align:middle line:84%
and scientists, and they're
all distancing themselves

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:06.080 align:middle line:84%
from the spirit and from the
face and the truth of God.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:06.890 align:middle line:90%
And that's wrong.

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:10.310 align:middle line:84%
You cannot let go
of the creator.

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:14.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So if we're
aware of these events,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.270 align:middle line:84%
we can alter things
within ourselves.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:21.110 align:middle line:84%
>>TURI: On a personal
level, indeed.

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:22.970 align:middle line:84%
I wrote a book called
"Beyond the Secret,"

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:25.900 align:middle line:84%
where I gave all these
little trick on how to--

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:27.120 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't say "manipulate."

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.130 align:middle line:90%
It's not the right word.

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:29.250 align:middle line:90%
But to--

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:30.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Alter?

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:32.930 align:middle line:84%
>>TURI: Alter the
energy and make

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:34.320 align:middle line:84%
a good use of your
superconscious

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.120 align:middle line:90%
in time and space.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.290 align:middle line:90%
It's all about education.

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:39.600 align:middle line:84%
You got people from all
over history, George,

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.340 align:middle line:84%
that have tried to save
the world with love.

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:44.200 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't work.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.000 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: Gandhi.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:45.800 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't work.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.570 align:middle line:84%
You've got to have the very
serious laws of education

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:49.370 align:middle line:90%
with it.

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:51.830 align:middle line:84%
And there is only
such a limited amount

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:54.700 align:middle line:84%
of people who have
cosmic consciousness.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:57.890 align:middle line:84%
I'd say only my
students. [LAUGHING]

00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And [INAUDIBLE] to have
trust me in my line of work.

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:07.040 align:middle line:84%
But my mission is
to prepare humanity

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.440 align:middle line:84%
for the incredible changes
that are taking place

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.290 align:middle line:84%
right now in reconnecting
with the creator

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:15.380 align:middle line:84%
and understand that God created
the stars in the heavens

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:17.350 align:middle line:84%
for much more than the
sake of beauty, George.

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:19.610 align:middle line:84%
He gave it to us
for interpretation

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:23.220 align:middle line:84%
so that we may lead a
safer, more productive life.

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.970 align:middle line:84%
But unless we cast
down, cast the way

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:29.180 align:middle line:84%
the fears, the religious
poisoning, the skepticism,

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:32.060 align:middle line:84%
and we start to bring back
into our college, university,

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:35.450 align:middle line:84%
astral psychology and having
accepted as a [? solid ?]

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:38.680 align:middle line:84%
discipline, the change
will be taking place,

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.784 align:middle line:90%
but in a much longer time.

00:13:40.784 --> 00:13:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's
take some questions

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.900 align:middle line:90%
for Dr. Louis Turi, the psychic.

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.100 align:middle line:90%
Who's got one?

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:47.180 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir.

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:50.960 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Many physicists
and neurophysiologists

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:58.220 align:middle line:84%
believe that we're living in
a holographic universe, which

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:03.140 align:middle line:84%
might be part of a
program playing out, which

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:06.130 align:middle line:84%
could include
mystical experiences,

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:11.390 align:middle line:84%
out-of-body experiences,
and telepathy, for example.

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:12.410 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:16.940 align:middle line:84%
>>TURI: You have to be born
with the UCI, Unique Celestial

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.880 align:middle line:84%
Identity, in order to
enter the archetypal realm

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.940 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:24.560 align:middle line:84%
If you were a
student of mine, you

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:27.410 align:middle line:84%
would know that Nostradamus,
Edgar Cayce, Madame Blavatsky,

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:29.690 align:middle line:84%
which are top
prophets and healers,

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:32.420 align:middle line:84%
all have the same dragon
into the sign of Pisces that

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:34.220 align:middle line:90%
regulate the subconscious.

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:36.815 align:middle line:84%
So you gotta have--
there are people,

00:14:36.815 --> 00:14:38.690 align:middle line:84%
you can do anything you
want, you would never

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:40.239 align:middle line:90%
teach them how to think.

00:14:40.239 --> 00:14:41.780 align:middle line:84%
You could do anything
you want, there

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:44.363 align:middle line:84%
are no schools that are going
to produce an Einstein or Mozart

00:14:44.363 --> 00:14:45.530 align:middle line:90%
or Beethoven.

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:48.170 align:middle line:84%
You've got to have
it, and it's already

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:52.760 align:middle line:84%
within your spiritual
DNA, or your UCI,

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.040 align:middle line:84%
that you will be
able to uncover this.

00:14:55.040 --> 00:15:00.664 align:middle line:84%
Another thing I'd like clarify,
George is calling me a psychic.

00:15:00.664 --> 00:15:03.080 align:middle line:84%
Even though that my mother
says that I'm more of a psychic

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:06.050 align:middle line:84%
than I want to
believe, I actually

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:09.330 align:middle line:84%
use a software, the
same type of software

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:13.042 align:middle line:84%
that NASA uses to send the
shuttle into the universe,

00:15:13.042 --> 00:15:15.500 align:middle line:84%
with the only difference, of
course, that I plot the stars.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.499 align:middle line:84%
Because the stars are
much more than dead rocks

00:15:17.499 --> 00:15:19.040 align:middle line:84%
hanging there for
the sake of beauty.

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:22.460 align:middle line:84%
They have an inner
life and inner values

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:24.480 align:middle line:90%
that you need to understand.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:28.314 align:middle line:84%
It's just it's just a
miracle that nowadays

00:15:28.314 --> 00:15:31.640 align:middle line:90%
curiosity override education.

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.130 align:middle line:84%
So you need to take
a chance on yourself

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:36.660 align:middle line:84%
and to challenge
yourself in doing things

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:37.910 align:middle line:90%
that you've never done before.

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:40.340 align:middle line:84%
If I ask how many of you
in the audience today--

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:44.180 align:middle line:84%
how many of you have
been under their stars

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:47.510 align:middle line:84%
to see how they stand
under those stars?

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:50.540 align:middle line:84%
In other word, how
do you understand?

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:53.260 align:middle line:84%
The very word
"understand" came from.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:54.830 align:middle line:84%
Would you please
raise your hand?

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:57.460 align:middle line:84%
How many of you have done
an astrological chart?

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:58.260 align:middle line:90%
Shame.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:15:59.468 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not a lot of people.

00:15:59.468 --> 00:16:02.440 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: One, two, three, four.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.620 align:middle line:90%
Don't be shy.

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:09.510 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at it,
George, what do they have left?

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:13.630 align:middle line:84%
Religious material, archaic
religious material, I may add,

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:19.359 align:middle line:84%
that kill people last
2,000, or science.

00:16:19.359 --> 00:16:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And if you try to look
for the keys of what

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:23.550 align:middle line:84%
it means to be human, digging
into religion and science,

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:24.600 align:middle line:90%
you will never get it.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:25.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You won't
get your answers.

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:26.520 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: It's not there.

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.227 align:middle line:90%
It's in the cosmic code.

00:16:28.227 --> 00:16:30.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take another
question for Dr. Louis Turi.

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:31.552 align:middle line:90%
Sure, right over here.

00:16:31.552 --> 00:16:32.760 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm just curious.

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.660 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
different-- like you

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:37.800 align:middle line:84%
can go online and see so many
different astrology charts.

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.460 align:middle line:90%
There's the Chinese astrology.

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:40.660 align:middle line:90%
There's Western astrology.

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:43.640 align:middle line:84%
There's your astrology as
far as the Nostradamus.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.700 align:middle line:84%
Why are they so
different if you're

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:48.730 align:middle line:84%
trying to find out information
about yourself and your chart?

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:50.280 align:middle line:90%
They can be so different.

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:55.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand like which
one is the most accurate.

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:57.490 align:middle line:84%
How do you find the correct
one to just help you out

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:01.290 align:middle line:84%
if you're trying to learn more
knowledge about the subject?

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:03.040 align:middle line:84%
>>TURI: I got that a
lot from my students.

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.780 align:middle line:84%
Basically, you
have only 12 energy

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:07.609 align:middle line:84%
that represent the
12 hours of the day,

00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:10.280 align:middle line:84%
the 12 months of the year,
the 12 apostles, the 12

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.500 align:middle line:84%
signs, the 12 jury, the
12 tribes of Israel,

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.710 align:middle line:84%
the 12 notes of
music, the year 2012.

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:17.079 align:middle line:84%
So would it be
[INAUDIBLE] or oriental,

00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:19.750 align:middle line:84%
astrology is based upon
those 12 specific energy,

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:27.069 align:middle line:84%
which is the essence of Jesus'
ministers, or the apostles.

00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:32.740 align:middle line:84%
So in my case, I have studied
Nostradamus' 16th century

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:33.640 align:middle line:90%
methodology.

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And Nostradamus 500
years ago, George,

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.630 align:middle line:84%
didn't have a watch
or a computer.

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:39.190 align:middle line:90%
Astrology is an art.

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:42.700 align:middle line:84%
So if you start to get
lost, missing the forest

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.360 align:middle line:84%
for the trees because
you're into mathematics,

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.310 align:middle line:90%
good luck to you.

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:48.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, the way I
teach my students is

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:51.880 align:middle line:84%
all about metaphor,
symbolism, intuition.

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to
have the right UCI.

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:55.570 align:middle line:84%
If you don't, there
is a very specific way

00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:58.540 align:middle line:90%
to reach you and educate you.

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:01.180 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately,
in different areas

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:04.000 align:middle line:84%
of the world is
different philosophy,

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.520 align:middle line:84%
but when it comes down to
it, it's the same thing.

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:09.160 align:middle line:84%
You're just referring
to 12 energy.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.860 align:middle line:84%
Again, I repeat
myself-- the 12 hours

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:17.170 align:middle line:84%
of the day, the 12 months of
the year, the 12 apostle, the 12

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:19.310 align:middle line:84%
signs, the 12 jury,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:25.870 align:middle line:84%
In fact, on my website, I do
have pictures of the popes--

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:28.570 align:middle line:84%
every one of them--
being taught astrology

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:30.329 align:middle line:90%
by the Vatican Council.

00:18:30.329 --> 00:18:32.245 align:middle line:84%
Do you expect them to
give you that knowledge?

00:18:32.245 --> 00:18:33.045 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:18:33.045 --> 00:18:33.850 align:middle line:90%
Knowledge is power.

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:35.170 align:middle line:90%
Ignorance is evil.

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:38.480 align:middle line:84%
If they keep you down there
with your fears and whatever

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:42.340 align:middle line:84%
it is to stop you progressing,
physically, psychically,

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:44.620 align:middle line:84%
gathering cosmic
consciousness, good for them,

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:47.077 align:middle line:84%
because they can control
your wallet at the same time.

00:18:47.077 --> 00:18:48.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's go to
our "Beyond Belief" cam

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:51.380 align:middle line:84%
for a question for
Dr. Louis Turi.

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:52.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Dr. Turi.

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:54.670 align:middle line:84%
My name is Jason, and
I'm from Los Angeles.

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:57.230 align:middle line:84%
My question for you is,
does the cosmic code

00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:59.622 align:middle line:84%
determine a person's good
and bad luck in life?

00:18:59.622 --> 00:19:02.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The cosmic code, does
it determine your good luck,

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:02.650 align:middle line:90%
your bad luck?

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:03.608 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: Indeed, indeed.

00:19:03.608 --> 00:19:07.070 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I developed the top of
the top, the latest discovery

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:07.870 align:middle line:90%
in astrology.

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:08.760 align:middle line:90%
I own it.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:13.390 align:middle line:84%
Is called your cosmic rhythm,
your lucky, unlucky window

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:14.260 align:middle line:90%
dates.

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.150 align:middle line:84%
There are days when
you're going to get up,

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:18.969 align:middle line:84%
and anything you
try and do-- bang--

00:19:18.969 --> 00:19:20.260 align:middle line:90%
you're going to have a problem.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:23.080 align:middle line:84%
And there is days
where everything works.

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:26.530 align:middle line:84%
You know, when something
happens dramatic on television,

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:28.420 align:middle line:84%
especially when it's
a famous person,

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:31.150 align:middle line:84%
I can always refer
or ask my students

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:33.940 align:middle line:84%
to give me the date of birth
of the person in question.

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And each time without
failure, the person

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:41.470 align:middle line:84%
is on the lower
side of the month.

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:44.140 align:middle line:84%
Remember, up and down; black
and white; the front, the back;

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:46.330 align:middle line:90%
God, devil; the yin and yang.

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:47.992 align:middle line:84%
You've got to
understand that you're

00:19:47.992 --> 00:19:49.450 align:middle line:84%
going to have days
where you're up,

00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:51.449 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to have
days where you're down.

00:19:51.449 --> 00:19:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And I can plot all this
through my software.

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:55.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:58.390 align:middle line:90%
Did you create the software?

00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:01.390 align:middle line:84%
>>TURI: I created the
first page of the software.

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:04.570 align:middle line:84%
It's already a software that
is used by any astrologers

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:05.830 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And it has every
single option for you

00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:10.840 align:middle line:84%
to dig into astrology,
the astrology you learn.

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:15.010 align:middle line:84%
But in this software, you have
the astropsychology software,

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:17.046 align:middle line:90%
which involves the dragon.

00:20:17.046 --> 00:20:18.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
Nostradamus was digging

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:21.460 align:middle line:90%
most into to do his prediction.

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.800 align:middle line:90%
And that is the main difference.

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:29.170 align:middle line:84%
It's an updated, arranged,
Dr. Turi [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:30.190 align:middle line:90%
type of energy.

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:31.880 align:middle line:90%
So I'm only the first page.

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:35.140 align:middle line:84%
If you ever have a reading
or I would say consultation

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:37.240 align:middle line:84%
through Skype,
face-to-face, with me,

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.500 align:middle line:90%
boy, you better be ready.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:40.750 align:middle line:84%
Because everything is taped,
and I don't spare nobody.

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:43.060 align:middle line:90%


00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:44.620 align:middle line:90%
You will see the old software.

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:47.920 align:middle line:84%
You will see the snapshot of
all the stars above your head

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:50.680 align:middle line:84%
when you reintegrated
and where the dragon is

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:54.010 align:middle line:90%
and where the hidden dragon is.

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:57.040 align:middle line:84%
So in fact, there
is a possibility

00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:00.430 align:middle line:84%
with your cosmic rhythm or
your lucky-unlucky window date

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:03.460 align:middle line:84%
to know when you're going to
have a good time, when it's

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:06.610 align:middle line:84%
time for you to sign a contract,
to travel safely, or do

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:08.492 align:middle line:84%
anything, or pay the
price of your ignorance.

00:21:08.492 --> 00:21:10.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've talked
about the dragon before.

00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:14.090 align:middle line:90%
Exactly what does that mean?

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>TURI: This is-- the
dragon is an energy coming

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:19.520 align:middle line:90%
from the constellation of Draco.

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:20.900 align:middle line:90%
How do you explain the dragon?

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.210 align:middle line:84%
Have you heard of the word
lunatic, moody, and crabby?

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:23.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah, yes.

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:24.200 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: All right.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.180 align:middle line:84%
So we all know that
during the full moon,

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:27.530 align:middle line:90%
people are losing it.

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:31.500 align:middle line:84%
The emergency services
are going out of order.

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:34.040 align:middle line:84%
So we are all under
the power of the moon.

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And the dragon is the
south and north node

00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:40.860 align:middle line:84%
of the moon on modern
astrology methodology.

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:42.620 align:middle line:84%
But the way I use is
totally different.

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:44.680 align:middle line:90%
Again, it's intuitive.

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And this dragon, that's
the words that's many,

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:54.400 align:middle line:84%
many disappeared civilization
give it to the dragon.

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:57.460 align:middle line:84%
Even in Christian theology,
they talk about a dragon.

00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:00.700 align:middle line:84%
The only thing is, you only
see its tail, the night,

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:02.960 align:middle line:84%
when I talk about the
head, which is light.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.180 align:middle line:90%
I talk about both.

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:06.880 align:middle line:84%
So it's your option
how to apply your will.

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:10.480 align:middle line:84%
Because the human will is
much stronger than the moon,

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.910 align:middle line:84%
than Pluto, than the dragon,
and anything you want,

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:15.156 align:middle line:84%
the part of you,
the part of God.

00:22:15.156 --> 00:22:17.530 align:middle line:84%
That's why you cannot separate
yourself from the creator.

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:19.930 align:middle line:84%
Because you're part of
this humongous design.

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:23.110 align:middle line:84%
This cosmic design
regulates your life.

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:26.492 align:middle line:84%
As I said, it's insane that you
go out every day not knowing.

00:22:26.492 --> 00:22:28.450 align:middle line:84%
It's like, OK, today I'm
going to go out there.

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:30.699 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to ignore completely
every single red light,

00:22:30.699 --> 00:22:32.650 align:middle line:84%
every single stop
sign, and then you

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:34.960 align:middle line:84%
wonder why you're
going to end up dead.

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.670 align:middle line:90%
That's what it comes down to it.

00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:38.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the dragon
or good or bad thing?

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:40.550 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: He goes both ways.

00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:43.660 align:middle line:84%
If you have the dragon--
for example, like you and I,

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:46.015 align:middle line:90%
we're both born in 1950.

00:22:46.015 --> 00:22:47.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sh!

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:49.740 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: 63 years old.

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:53.620 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHING] You and I,
we have the same dragon.

00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:58.600 align:middle line:84%
This Aries dragon wants you to
become a leader of the mind.

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.356 align:middle line:84%
So you are going
to have things that

00:23:00.356 --> 00:23:01.730 align:middle line:84%
are going to happen
in your life,

00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:05.210 align:middle line:84%
where you're going to be put
in a position of leadership.

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And this dragon also in
my case help me in terms

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:12.220 align:middle line:84%
of scientifical discovery to
breach the limitation of what

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:14.710 align:middle line:84%
science cannot perceive,
providing, of course,

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:16.530 align:middle line:90%
they gave me a shot.

00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:19.860 align:middle line:90%
And let me prove to them.

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:23.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You interpret
your software.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
the gift you have.

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:27.270 align:middle line:84%
Because how many people
could look at that

00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:31.490 align:middle line:84%
and make the same
predictions that you do?

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:35.250 align:middle line:84%
>>TURI: I don't know about this,
because if any of my students

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:39.090 align:middle line:84%
who took my home cause
or physical course

00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:41.540 align:middle line:84%
are able to actually
do what I'm doing.

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:44.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm not genius.

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:45.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm just like you.

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:47.975 align:middle line:84%
The only thing is, my forte
is to dig into the stars.

00:23:47.975 --> 00:23:50.100 align:middle line:84%
And I have been digging
through that since forever,

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:51.930 align:middle line:84%
because it's all
written in the stars.

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:52.980 align:middle line:90%
I blame my grandmother.

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:55.200 align:middle line:84%
I blame my UFO
experiences that led

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.830 align:middle line:90%
me to become Dr. Turi today.

00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:00.920 align:middle line:84%
But again, anybody
can do it-- anybody.

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.260 align:middle line:90%
Every one of you can do it.

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:03.499 align:middle line:90%
Just take the time.

00:24:03.499 --> 00:24:05.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
seen things, Louis,

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:07.490 align:middle line:90%
that have even scared you?

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:10.740 align:middle line:90%


00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:12.030 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: Yes.

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:12.830 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:15.900 align:middle line:84%
Especially when it comes
to extraterrestrials.

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:21.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, oh, gosh,
even today I still

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:28.030 align:middle line:84%
have-- facing three ETs above
6 feet tall in the middle

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:31.690 align:middle line:84%
of nowhere in the French Alps--
you know my story, George.

00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And then ending
up with a headache

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:35.200 align:middle line:84%
that I would never
wish to my worst enemy

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.930 align:middle line:84%
and then disappeared the entire
night will get you scared.

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:40.636 align:middle line:84%
And to this day,
I'm still upset.

00:24:40.636 --> 00:24:41.760 align:middle line:90%
Where the hell have I been?

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:42.580 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:43.600 align:middle line:90%
What did they do to me?

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:44.849 align:middle line:90%
What happened to my head?

00:24:44.849 --> 00:24:46.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's just one of
the-- you know I had four.

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:47.155 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:24:47.155 --> 00:24:48.130 align:middle line:90%
You've had four episodes.

00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:49.254 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: And it's not light.

00:24:49.254 --> 00:24:51.910 align:middle line:84%
It's not a [? walking. ?]
It's actually

00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:56.800 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials talking to me,
dragging me in a flying saucer.

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:59.590 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of people out
there that talk about UFOs

00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:03.800 align:middle line:84%
and talk about-- but when
you're the real thing

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.010 align:middle line:84%
and you have the
legacy-- because this

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:08.250 align:middle line:84%
is the legacy of all the
extraterrestrials' brother

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:11.670 align:middle line:84%
that I'm referring
at and offering you.

00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:12.684 align:middle line:90%
It is pretty scary.

00:25:12.684 --> 00:25:14.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
make your predictions,

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:16.760 align:middle line:84%
you make them during
certain date periods.

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:17.560 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: Correct.

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.652 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Explain that
and how that works.

00:25:20.652 --> 00:25:22.360 align:middle line:84%
>>TURI: OK, let me
bring you back to what

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:24.940 align:middle line:90%
happened to me a few weeks ago.

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:33.490 align:middle line:84%
Somebody went in my work and
put the date of July 7, 8, and 9

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:35.920 align:middle line:84%
and were expecting
the end of the world.

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And what I said is,
during those days,

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:42.850 align:middle line:84%
expect earthquake above 6.0
that could create a tsunami.

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:47.449 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we had
the 6.3 and the 7.2

00:25:47.449 --> 00:25:48.490 align:middle line:90%
on that date that I gave.

00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:49.448 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which was big.

00:25:49.448 --> 00:25:50.770 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: And you can trace that.

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:53.830 align:middle line:90%
I have it all very documented.

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:58.120 align:middle line:84%
So the people who did not
read the rest of the story

00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.490 align:middle line:84%
do not understand
that I use quatrain,

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:02.920 align:middle line:84%
that I use various
obvious keywords.

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.350 align:middle line:84%
Their expectation
didn't match what

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:07.984 align:middle line:84%
this guy did without my
permission and saying

00:26:07.984 --> 00:26:09.400 align:middle line:84%
that I got all
this from the Bible

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.140 align:middle line:90%
when I use actually a software.

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:14.900 align:middle line:84%
So it's understandable that
these people think I'm a loser,

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:16.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
I'm talking about,

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.483 align:middle line:90%
I'm crazy, whatever it is.

00:26:17.483 --> 00:26:18.640 align:middle line:90%
You know how it is.

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.140 align:middle line:84%
But the fact of
the matter is I'm

00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:23.140 align:middle line:84%
going to give you a set of dates
right now if you want me to,

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:25.170 align:middle line:84%
George, and I want
you to remember.

00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:25.970 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:28.670 align:middle line:90%


00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:33.190 align:middle line:84%
July 22, and 23,
and 24, in August--

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:37.860 align:middle line:84%
going to go all the way
to August 20, 21, and 22.

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:40.467 align:middle line:84%
Now, way ahead of time, I
give you those ahead of time.

00:26:40.467 --> 00:26:43.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what could happen
during those what time periods?

00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:44.425 align:middle line:84%
>>TURI: What could
happen to you,

00:26:44.425 --> 00:26:47.200 align:middle line:84%
what could happen--
the dragon is

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:49.642 align:middle line:84%
going to show a lot
of his nasty tail.

00:26:49.642 --> 00:26:51.225 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're talking
about earthquake--

00:26:51.225 --> 00:26:52.391 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The bad part, then.

00:26:52.391 --> 00:26:54.760 align:middle line:84%
>>TURI: The key words
will be surprise.

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:57.000 align:middle line:84%
The same type of
energy that took place

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.330 align:middle line:84%
when President Obama was
elected-- the entire world was

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:02.880 align:middle line:90%
shocked-- is coming back.

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:06.000 align:middle line:84%
So the keywords are
surprise, shocking news,

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.610 align:middle line:84%
of course, large earthquake,
the possibility of tsunami,

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:10.560 align:middle line:90%
volcano.

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:13.790 align:middle line:84%
All the details are on
my website at drturi.com.

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:15.240 align:middle line:84%
If you click on
my posts, you can

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.760 align:middle line:84%
read all that or if you
become a cosmic coder

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:20.070 align:middle line:84%
and join the thousands of
people that follow my work.

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:21.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I never
liked surprises.

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:22.420 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: No.

00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:23.520 align:middle line:90%
Who does?

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:24.810 align:middle line:90%
Who does?

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And immediately, the
next three or four days,

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:33.180 align:middle line:84%
because of the judgment
that took place with Mr.

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:36.605 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE], I'm expecting
some problems with the police.

00:27:36.605 --> 00:27:39.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm expecting some
problem with the Mob.

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:43.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm expecting some dramatic
news and famous people to die.

00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:48.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm being very clear, and I
use those very strong words

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.920 align:middle line:90%
so that I get your attention.

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And all this is going
to happen because nobody

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:54.480 align:middle line:84%
has cosmic consciousness,
and they do things

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.790 align:middle line:90%
when they feel like.

00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:59.790 align:middle line:84%
Let me refer to one
of my compatriots

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:01.470 align:middle line:84%
who does the same
work that I do.

00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:05.932 align:middle line:84%
I think yesterday he
was released from jail.

00:28:05.932 --> 00:28:08.220 align:middle line:90%
I can't remember his name.

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:14.174 align:middle line:84%
But three people died in Sedona
in one of these meetings.

00:28:14.174 --> 00:28:15.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure you remember.

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah. yeah.

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:18.300 align:middle line:84%
>>TURI: What I'm trying
to say is even though

00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:20.130 align:middle line:84%
that this gentleman
is very knowledgeable

00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:24.180 align:middle line:84%
and he ended up on Oprah
and is very successful,

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:26.880 align:middle line:84%
he didn't have any
cosmic consciousness.

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:30.330 align:middle line:84%
And he led people under a
very negative set of stars,

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:32.200 align:middle line:90%
and three of them died.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.750 align:middle line:84%
So if you mess up with
the laws of the universe,

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:37.560 align:middle line:84%
regardless who you are--
you can be the president,

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:39.190 align:middle line:84%
you could be Dr.
Turi, George Noory,

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:41.760 align:middle line:84%
or you-- you are going to
pay the price at the end.

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.410 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's
very, very important

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:45.910 align:middle line:84%
to understand your
relationship with the divine.

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:49.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would it be smart,
Louis, for someone, a leader,

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:52.560 align:middle line:84%
to tap into someone
like you and say, look,

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:55.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be doing this
over the next week or two.

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:56.149 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:57.690 align:middle line:84%
>>TURI: This is
exactly what I didn't

00:28:57.690 --> 00:28:59.400 align:middle line:90%
want to hear from you, George.

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:02.090 align:middle line:84%
The date of August
20, 21, and 22

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:05.890 align:middle line:84%
will also be related
to President Obama.

00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:07.600 align:middle line:90%
OK, it is a must.

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look at the
wise German people.

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:13.000 align:middle line:84%
They did not know that
Hitler had terrible UCI

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.280 align:middle line:90%
and so was Saddam Hussein.

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:17.720 align:middle line:84%
The next thing you know,
they put these guys in power.

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:18.520 align:middle line:90%
Look what happened.

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:19.730 align:middle line:90%
Look at the price.

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:20.530 align:middle line:90%
Look at the tears.

00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:21.370 align:middle line:90%
Look at the death.

00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:22.750 align:middle line:90%
Look at the drama.

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:25.300 align:middle line:84%
The entire world had to suffer
because they put someone

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:27.550 align:middle line:90%
who had the wrong stars.

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And you get in power--
whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:30.760 align:middle line:90%
Wait a minute here.

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:32.570 align:middle line:90%
You don't do that.

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:36.670 align:middle line:84%
Or if the president of any
country, not necessarily

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:40.550 align:middle line:84%
President Obama, doesn't have
any cosmic consciousness,

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:43.060 align:middle line:84%
but he becomes the
father of the country,

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:44.710 align:middle line:84%
and you are under
his jurisdiction,

00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:47.500 align:middle line:84%
his decision is what's going
to come to you in terms

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:49.747 align:middle line:90%
of karma or suffering and pain.

00:29:49.747 --> 00:29:51.580 align:middle line:84%
>> He doesn't like to
talk about this a lot,

00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:54.220 align:middle line:84%
but I think it's one of
the most remarkable things,

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:56.360 align:middle line:90%
is a cancer survivor.

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.160 align:middle line:90%
You fought cancer.

00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.140 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:59.140 --> 00:29:59.630 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: Thank you.

00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:00.505 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And beat it.

00:30:00.505 --> 00:30:01.620 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: Thank you.

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:02.440 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, God.

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:05.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You did it with the
power of your mind, didn't you?

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:08.110 align:middle line:90%
You did something.

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:09.850 align:middle line:10%
>>TURI: Can I tell
you something, George?

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:13.090 align:middle line:10%
When you face your
mortality, a lot of things

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:14.590 align:middle line:10%
go through your head.

00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And when this happened
to me, I was in Thailand.

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:21.319 align:middle line:84%
Nobody was with me-- not
my sweet, beautiful wife,

00:30:21.319 --> 00:30:22.610 align:middle line:90%
not my parents, not my friends.

00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:23.410 align:middle line:90%
I was just alone.

00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:26.030 align:middle line:90%
It was terrible, terrible.

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:29.450 align:middle line:84%
But I said, God, my
mission is not over.

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:35.172 align:middle line:84%
My mission to introduce you,
your spirits to humanity

00:30:35.172 --> 00:30:37.130 align:middle line:84%
and how you speak to his
children in this world

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:38.270 align:middle line:90%
is not over.

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:40.190 align:middle line:90%
Just don't let me go just now.

00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:44.280 align:middle line:84%
Then I went back home, and I did
my universal blood transfusion.

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:46.370 align:middle line:84%
It's something I teach
my students for those who

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:49.120 align:middle line:90%
are into homeopathic healing.

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:50.618 align:middle line:90%
And it's all gone.

00:30:50.618 --> 00:30:53.372 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:53.372 --> 00:30:54.749 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:30:54.749 --> 00:30:58.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Louis, when we
talk about the cosmic code,

00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:00.040 align:middle line:84%
for anybody out
here, for anybody

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:02.530 align:middle line:84%
watching this program
right now, what

00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:04.960 align:middle line:84%
can they do to affect
their own lives,

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.650 align:middle line:90%
to create their own timing?

00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:12.590 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's a relationship or
a new job or health matters,

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:16.394 align:middle line:84%
how can they use this
to better themselves?

00:31:16.394 --> 00:31:18.310 align:middle line:84%
>>TURI: First of all,
as I said earlier, there

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:21.880 align:middle line:84%
are no accidents, only
cosmic circumstances at work

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:25.360 align:middle line:84%
that you do not
know and do not use.

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:29.370 align:middle line:84%
You are pre-set,
and you're going

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:36.600 align:middle line:84%
to be led, even protected,
if you follow your nativity.

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:40.350 align:middle line:84%
That's why those three wise
men were following the stars

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:42.510 align:middle line:90%
to watch the birth of Christ.

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:45.930 align:middle line:84%
They were not just
kings, wise men.

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:47.220 align:middle line:90%
They were astrologers.

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:52.970 align:middle line:84%
And what they did is taught
Jesus the cosmic codes.

00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And from there, Jesus had his
apostles, the Twelve Apostles,

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.940 align:middle line:84%
the 12th signs, the 12 months,
the 12 years, et cetera,

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:04.430 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, to lead
on to his mission.

00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:09.470 align:middle line:84%
Sad enough, the Illuminati,
the greedy Illuminati in power,

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:12.280 align:middle line:84%
do not want you to know,
because knowledge is power.

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:13.550 align:middle line:90%
Ignorance is evil.

00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:19.530 align:middle line:84%
So if you understand the sign
that you were born under,

00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:22.420 align:middle line:84%
if you understand your
natal and hidden dragon;

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:25.020 align:middle line:84%
the 10th house of career;
the second house of money

00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:26.690 align:middle line:84%
and self-esteem;
if you understand

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:29.270 align:middle line:84%
your third house, which
regulate your mental process;

00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:31.670 align:middle line:84%
your fourth house, which
is your domesticity;

00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:33.830 align:middle line:84%
your fifth house, which
is the seat of attraction

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:35.537 align:middle line:84%
between human being
and your creativity;

00:32:35.537 --> 00:32:38.120 align:middle line:84%
if you understand your service
to the world, your sixth house;

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:40.700 align:middle line:84%
if you understand your seventh
house and so forth, which

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:43.370 align:middle line:84%
is the house of
marriage and contract,

00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:45.530 align:middle line:84%
you'll know exactly
what's ahead of you.

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:46.970 align:middle line:90%
And you can move.

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:50.420 align:middle line:84%
You are allowed to
know your future.

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:53.150 align:middle line:84%
Because this is
how God set it up.

00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:55.670 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he has [? enslaved ?]
every one of you

00:32:55.670 --> 00:33:00.000 align:middle line:84%
to uncover how he speaks
to you through the signs.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.510 align:middle line:84%
That's where I can help you
to go to the goldmine-- put

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:06.380 align:middle line:90%
it this way.

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:08.754 align:middle line:84%
Because when I arrived in this
country, George, you know,

00:33:08.754 --> 00:33:11.360 align:middle line:84%
in 1984, I only had
50 bucks in my pocket.

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:14.340 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know nobody, nothing.

00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:17.390 align:middle line:84%
But I knew what my grandmother
told me, to never move

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:18.560 align:middle line:90%
after the full moon.

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And I touched this
wonderful, blessed ground

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:24.950 align:middle line:84%
of the United States after the
new moon on my dragon's head.

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And everything I've touched
since then turned gold.

00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:32.270 align:middle line:84%
If I can do it and enjoy the
American dream, why can't you?

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:34.980 align:middle line:90%
It's all a matter of knowledge.

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:36.530 align:middle line:90%
Knowledge is power.

00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:37.884 align:middle line:90%
Ignorance is wisdom.

00:33:37.884 --> 00:33:39.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you know
what some people say--

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:41.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm not having a good day.

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:44.690 align:middle line:84%
Things aren't
going right my way.

00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:47.570 align:middle line:84%
Are these influences that
are out of his control

00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:50.290 align:middle line:90%
or in his control?

00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:53.750 align:middle line:84%
>>TURI: Again, like you
mentioned earlier, you're

00:33:53.750 --> 00:34:00.620 align:middle line:84%
trying to go from A to B. And
regardless how much you plan,

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:03.500 align:middle line:90%
you've got to have a problem.

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:06.830 align:middle line:84%
When a plane crash,
we had two of those,

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:10.610 align:middle line:84%
when train crashes, two of
those during this timing,

00:34:10.610 --> 00:34:12.810 align:middle line:84%
how much control do you
really have over the stars?

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:13.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not much.

00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:13.699 align:middle line:90%
Not much.

00:34:13.699 --> 00:34:14.750 align:middle line:84%
>>TURI: This is what
I'm trying to say.

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:15.889 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You just
don't want to be there.

00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:16.760 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: Exactly.

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:20.909 align:middle line:84%
So you can control
your own destiny.

00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:23.900 align:middle line:90%
But you're a part of a grid.

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:26.779 align:middle line:84%
If the grid is
not at your level,

00:34:26.779 --> 00:34:28.070 align:middle line:90%
you're going to have a problem.

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:29.900 align:middle line:90%
You see, science is up here.

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:33.350 align:middle line:84%
We have made an incredible
technological advancement.

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:34.320 align:middle line:90%
We will go on the moon.

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:35.120 align:middle line:90%
We have GPS.

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:36.020 align:middle line:90%
We have the internet.

00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:39.980 align:middle line:84%
We're up here on the physical
realm of consciousness.

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:42.290 align:middle line:84%
But in the spirit, we
are still 2,000 years ago

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:45.380 align:middle line:84%
in deceptive, dogmatic
religious teaching.

00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:48.590 align:middle line:90%
The gap needs to be adjusted.

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And that can be accomplished
with cosmic consciousness,

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:54.719 align:middle line:84%
where not only you, but
the grid, that people that

00:34:54.719 --> 00:34:58.530 align:middle line:84%
are in power, the people that
are in charge of your life,

00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:00.290 align:middle line:84%
once they become cosmic
conscious, now we

00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:03.690 align:middle line:84%
are talking about a very,
very big difference.

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:07.610 align:middle line:84%
It does not mean that
accidents will never happen,

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:10.040 align:middle line:84%
because you will
never really know

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:12.260 align:middle line:84%
the end of the story
on how to control it.

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:14.330 align:middle line:84%
But you're going to
be given an option.

00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:16.470 align:middle line:84%
If I tell you the
"Titanic" is going

00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:19.940 align:middle line:84%
to sink that night
because I know

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:22.070 align:middle line:84%
why, I looked
through my software,

00:35:22.070 --> 00:35:24.090 align:middle line:84%
you now have an option
to say, you're crazy,

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:27.320 align:middle line:84%
you're going to jail, you're
a lunatic and laugh at me.

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.917 align:middle line:90%
Or you can say, ah, guess what?

00:35:28.917 --> 00:35:30.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take
another plane ticket

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:34.310 align:middle line:84%
or I'm going to wait
another, better auspices.

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:35.930 align:middle line:90%
The choice will be given to you.

00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:38.060 align:middle line:84%
At that point, you
have no choice.

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:40.070 align:middle line:84%
You're part of the
grid that control you.

00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:42.980 align:middle line:90%
You're part of that structure.

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:48.260 align:middle line:84%
You're part of a lack
of cosmic consciousness

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:51.692 align:middle line:84%
that is terribly
costly to all of us.

00:35:51.692 --> 00:35:53.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
people understand

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:54.920 align:middle line:90%
this, the cosmic code?

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:56.450 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: My students.

00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:57.579 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Your students.

00:35:57.579 --> 00:35:59.370 align:middle line:84%
Not a lot of people on
the outside, though.

00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:00.170 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: No.

00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:05.350 align:middle line:90%
We are a very, very rare breed.

00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:11.580 align:middle line:84%
My students are made of anybody,
I mean, doctors, attorneys.

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:15.375 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I had the psychiatrist
that told me, Dr. Turi, I

00:36:15.375 --> 00:36:18.000 align:middle line:84%
have learned more in
your crash course in one

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.280 align:middle line:84%
week than seven
years in college.

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:22.560 align:middle line:84%
That is a nice compliment
when you hear that.

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:25.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they run their
life, Louis, based on the code?

00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:29.670 align:middle line:84%
For example, will
the surgeon say,

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:31.260 align:middle line:90%
this is not the day to operate.

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:34.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to cancel things.

00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:36.570 align:middle line:84%
>>TURI: Look at the
Farmer's Almanac, George.

00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:37.660 align:middle line:90%
You heard of a Farmer's Almanac.

00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:38.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:39.944 align:middle line:84%
>>TURI: They don't plant
when they feel like.

00:36:39.944 --> 00:36:44.580 align:middle line:84%
When the moon is waxing,
you add that to the body.

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:46.170 align:middle line:84%
When the mood is
waning, that's when

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:48.090 align:middle line:84%
you want to try to
cut the cancer out

00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:50.640 align:middle line:84%
of a breast of a
woman, for example.

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:52.290 align:middle line:84%
Because the moon
regulates women.

00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:54.060 align:middle line:90%
The moon regulates the breast.

00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:56.970 align:middle line:84%
But traditionally
educated doctors

00:36:56.970 --> 00:36:58.770 align:middle line:90%
do not know about those rules.

00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And they do things
any time they like.

00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:03.500 align:middle line:84%
It's like you, again, taking
your car at red light-- phooey.

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:04.520 align:middle line:90%
A stop sign?

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:05.320 align:middle line:90%
Forget it.

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:11.310 align:middle line:84%
No, you cannot-- you must
not omit the universal laws.

00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:14.080 align:middle line:84%
Because nobody taught you
doesn't give you the right mess

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:17.040 align:middle line:84%
those laws, because you got
to pay the penalty at the end.

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And as I said
earlier, the matrix

00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:23.220 align:middle line:84%
is set, where you're a
part of that humongous

00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:24.690 align:middle line:90%
lack of cosmic consciousness.

00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:28.020 align:middle line:84%
So you will be in control
of your own decision,

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:31.410 align:middle line:84%
your own life, your own
making, your own fate.

00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:33.360 align:middle line:84%
But you're still
within the matrix.

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:38.040 align:middle line:84%
So you need to literally
educate everybody.

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:40.710 align:middle line:90%
And that's what's next.

00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:44.040 align:middle line:84%
Because you like it or not,
life is a constant process

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:44.960 align:middle line:90%
of changes.

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And we are moving forward--
a little bit too slow,

00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:48.820 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE].

00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:50.030 align:middle line:90%
But we are moving there.

00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:51.660 align:middle line:84%
So all the people
that are dealing

00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:53.220 align:middle line:84%
with me and all my
students are going

00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:55.170 align:middle line:90%
to be teaching their children.

00:37:55.170 --> 00:37:56.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Apostles everywhere.

00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:58.650 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: You got it.

00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:01.570 align:middle line:84%
That's basically my
hope, my mission.

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:06.622 align:middle line:84%
My mission is to free humanity
from fear and cosmic ignorance.

00:38:06.622 --> 00:38:08.580 align:middle line:84%
That's what I know from
the bottom of my heart.

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:11.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But there are forces
out there, as you said,

00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:12.810 align:middle line:90%
the Illuminati.

00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:17.560 align:middle line:84%
There are groups out there
who want to keep us down.

00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:18.360 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: Yes.

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:19.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do we battle that?

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:22.956 align:middle line:90%


00:38:22.956 --> 00:38:26.640 align:middle line:84%
>>TURI: We are a very,
very powerful force

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:29.090 align:middle line:90%
to be accounted for.

00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:32.240 align:middle line:84%
If everybody here in the studio
had cosmic consciousness,

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:34.460 align:middle line:84%
imagine when they
start to talk and teach

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:35.840 align:middle line:90%
their children or their friends.

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:37.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Powerful.

00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:38.827 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: You can change things.

00:38:38.827 --> 00:38:40.910 align:middle line:84%
That's what life is, a
constant process of change.

00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:45.380 align:middle line:84%
Right now, the forces of
evil is leading this world.

00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is due
to the current dragon

00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:49.520 align:middle line:90%
in the sign of Scorpio.

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:53.150 align:middle line:84%
This is why I predict the
restructure of the FBI.

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:57.440 align:middle line:84%
I predict the IRS imploding
and auditing itself.

00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:59.169 align:middle line:84%
All this was predicted
a year before.

00:38:59.169 --> 00:39:00.710 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't
know my work, if you

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:02.334 align:middle line:84%
don't have cosmic
consciousness, you're

00:39:02.334 --> 00:39:04.040 align:middle line:84%
not going to know
about what I'm doing.

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:06.590 align:middle line:84%
But that's why you need to
be curious and take a chance.

00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:08.850 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a lot of
people who do what I do.

00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:11.930 align:middle line:84%
The only difference with me
is that is on TV with George.

00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:13.990 align:middle line:84%
It's, and you're there,
and you have the dates.

00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:14.260 align:middle line:90%
And now--

00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:15.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There's a record.

00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:16.573 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: That's what it is.

00:39:16.573 --> 00:39:18.750 align:middle line:84%
And all I have is
all well documented.

00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And I did signed, certified
mail to USGS, the Seismology

00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:27.800 align:middle line:84%
Institute in Pasadena, giving
exact date of earthquake

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:30.290 align:middle line:90%
above 7.0.

00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:31.800 align:middle line:90%
Did they ever return my call?

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:33.926 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:39:33.926 --> 00:39:35.550 align:middle line:84%
>>TURI: I give very
specific prediction

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:38.360 align:middle line:84%
on your show about how w can
undo-- or whatever it is.

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:39.160 align:middle line:90%
I can't remember.

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:41.160 align:middle line:84%
I even mentioned you would
be working on television,

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:41.360 align:middle line:90%
remember?

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:41.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Katrina.

00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:42.260 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>>TURI: I said you'd be
working in television.

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:44.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>>TURI: What I'm
saying is we have

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:49.470 align:middle line:84%
developed the relationship,
and we communicate.

00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:51.360 align:middle line:90%
So you know me, I know you.

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:53.460 align:middle line:84%
But there's so many
people out there,

00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:56.210 align:middle line:84%
and that's where your mission
as a messenger of the God

00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:57.230 align:middle line:90%
comes to play.

00:39:57.230 --> 00:40:01.230 align:middle line:84%
Because now you are on a
road, you are an opening,

00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:06.320 align:middle line:84%
you are an option for
me to reach the media.

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:08.060 align:middle line:90%
And to that, I say thank you.

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: 2014-- how does it
look for all of us in general?

00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:13.840 align:middle line:90%


00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:15.100 align:middle line:90%
Give us some good news, huh?

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:16.100 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: I want to.

00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:16.900 align:middle line:90%
I want to.

00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:19.441 align:middle line:84%
There is a full restructure of
the legal system ahead of you.

00:40:19.441 --> 00:40:25.240 align:middle line:84%
Sad enough, there is the
Arian dragon coming up,

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:29.320 align:middle line:84%
which means the Aries
energy, the Mars energy,

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:30.520 align:middle line:90%
is going to lead the world.

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:33.400 align:middle line:84%
Mars is called in Greek
mythology the lord of war.

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:37.000 align:middle line:84%
It regulates anything that
is the animal instinct.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:44.320 align:middle line:84%
It regulates the war,
machinery, construction, fire.

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:47.330 align:middle line:84%
It regulates anything
to do with identity.

00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:53.230 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to have a lot
of fights, separatism, race.

00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:56.420 align:middle line:84%
People have to learn, the world
has to learn we are bleed red.

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:59.440 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter the
color of our skin, OK?

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:03.602 align:middle line:84%
So this Arian dragon is
going to-- Aries was war.

00:41:03.602 --> 00:41:04.810 align:middle line:90%
That's what it comes down to.

00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:06.310 align:middle line:90%
It's at many, many levels.

00:41:06.310 --> 00:41:10.480 align:middle line:84%
So I see an incredible
restructure of the entire Navy

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:11.300 align:middle line:90%
and the Army.

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:12.130 align:middle line:90%
That's serious.

00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:13.450 align:middle line:90%
When I say the restructure--

00:41:13.450 --> 00:41:14.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's big.

00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:14.680 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: Yeah.

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:16.054 align:middle line:84%
When I say it--
you remember when

00:41:16.054 --> 00:41:19.570 align:middle line:84%
I said restructure of the US
economy back in 2007 in June

00:41:19.570 --> 00:41:20.740 align:middle line:90%
on your last show with me?

00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:22.660 align:middle line:90%
I think that was it.

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:24.010 align:middle line:90%
Nobody heard me.

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:25.450 align:middle line:90%
They understood me now.

00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:26.740 align:middle line:90%
They really got me.

00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:29.230 align:middle line:84%
When I talk about the
restructure of the FBI,

00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:33.240 align:middle line:84%
the CIA, and the IRS,
when I wrote this,

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:36.730 align:middle line:84%
this type of important news must
be passed on to the media to be

00:41:36.730 --> 00:41:39.550 align:middle line:84%
prepared what's next, because
with things like Benghazi going

00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:43.570 align:middle line:84%
on, you cannot keep anything
secret for another year.

00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:45.670 align:middle line:84%
Anything and everything
that's under the table

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:47.320 align:middle line:90%
will have to come to the light.

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:50.590 align:middle line:84%
Because the current dragon is
called the Scorpius dragon.

00:41:50.590 --> 00:41:51.920 align:middle line:90%
It regulates metaphysics.

00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:54.640 align:middle line:84%
This is why there is
a tremendous interest

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:57.670 align:middle line:84%
in metaphysics, a
tremendous drive

00:41:57.670 --> 00:42:01.150 align:middle line:84%
to understand what those who
are in power are doing to us.

00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:03.489 align:middle line:84%
So the dragon is
saying, OK, everything

00:42:03.489 --> 00:42:05.530 align:middle line:84%
that is under the blanket
will come to the light.

00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:07.863 align:middle line:84%
Does that include, of course,
the manipulation involving

00:42:07.863 --> 00:42:09.970 align:middle line:84%
in the financial
situation with the Vatican

00:42:09.970 --> 00:42:11.580 align:middle line:84%
or his right hand
showing up, all sort

00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:13.246 align:middle line:84%
of paperwork that
should be kept hidden.

00:42:13.246 --> 00:42:16.440 align:middle line:84%
That's why they fired the
old one and got a new pope.

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:19.540 align:middle line:84%
The Illuminati are having fun,
and I believe the Illuminati

00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:22.780 align:middle line:84%
to a certain level have
[? lost ?] also [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:24.760 align:middle line:90%
of cosmic consciousness.

00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:29.870 align:middle line:84%
So this next dragon, George,
is all about identity.

00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:32.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to put some
friction to those that are

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:35.491 align:middle line:90%
the core white supremacists.

00:42:35.491 --> 00:42:37.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We'll
watch it all unfold.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.790 align:middle line:84%
Let's take some more
questions for Dr. Louis Turi,

00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:41.790 align:middle line:90%
we talk about the cosmic code.

00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:43.885 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm an
osteopathic medical student,

00:42:43.885 --> 00:42:45.760 align:middle line:84%
and I was hoping you
could talk-- you touched

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:46.690 align:middle line:84%
on this a little
bit before, but I

00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:49.060 align:middle line:84%
was hoping you could talk
a little more about how

00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:51.490 align:middle line:84%
we can use the
cosmic consciousness

00:42:51.490 --> 00:42:54.500 align:middle line:84%
in the field of medicine and
the healing arts in general.

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:55.958 align:middle line:84%
>>TURI: That's a
very good question

00:42:55.958 --> 00:42:57.820 align:middle line:84%
I get a lot from
a medical student.

00:42:57.820 --> 00:43:00.280 align:middle line:84%
Each part of your body
is controlled by a sign,

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:03.520 align:middle line:84%
starting with the head
that regulates the blood

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:06.700 align:middle line:84%
flow, the amount of oxygen
going through the ramifications

00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:08.692 align:middle line:84%
of all these veins
holding your brain.

00:43:08.692 --> 00:43:10.400 align:middle line:84%
If you have the tail
of the dragon there,

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:12.080 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
chronic headaches.

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:13.120 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
have eye problems.

00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:14.500 align:middle line:90%
You're going to have migraine.

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:17.010 align:middle line:84%
If you have it on the heart,
you're prone to heart attack.

00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And it goes all the
way down from Aries,

00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:19.810 align:middle line:84%
which is your head,
to Taurus, which

00:43:19.810 --> 00:43:22.476 align:middle line:84%
is the neck, all the way down to
your lungs and your arms, which

00:43:22.476 --> 00:43:24.700 align:middle line:84%
is Gemini, down to the
elimination principle,

00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:27.740 align:middle line:84%
which is Virgo, to the
reproductive area, which

00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:30.310 align:middle line:84%
is Scorpio, all the
way down to Pisces,

00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:33.264 align:middle line:84%
which is where every
human being regenerates

00:43:33.264 --> 00:43:34.930 align:middle line:84%
through the magnetic
field of the Earth.

00:43:34.930 --> 00:43:37.305 align:middle line:84%
So when you spend a lot of
time on carpet, on wood floor,

00:43:37.305 --> 00:43:39.910 align:middle line:84%
on concrete floor, when your car
and your tire on the highway,

00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:41.740 align:middle line:84%
you are not connecting
with Mother Earth,

00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:43.120 align:middle line:90%
and that brings a lot of stress.

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.911 align:middle line:84%
So you need to reconnect
with Mother Earth.

00:43:44.911 --> 00:43:47.820 align:middle line:84%
So you can also take the--
like I do, I have two big dogs.

00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:49.570 align:middle line:84%
But if you have a
horse, it's even better.

00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:50.486 align:middle line:90%
They don't wear shoes.

00:43:50.486 --> 00:43:52.660 align:middle line:84%
So you can hug them,
and they recharge you.

00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:55.540 align:middle line:84%
There is so much
information that

00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:57.700 align:middle line:84%
was used by disappeared
civilizations

00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:01.430 align:middle line:84%
before medicine started to
challenge the cosmic code

00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:03.160 align:middle line:90%
and God's creation.

00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:05.890 align:middle line:84%
All the disappeared
civilizations used the stars.

00:44:05.890 --> 00:44:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And this wisdom
should be available

00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:11.180 align:middle line:90%
to all medical students.

00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:11.980 align:middle line:90%
And [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:13.855 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to say,
oh, this is ridicule,

00:44:13.855 --> 00:44:15.580 align:middle line:84%
this is [INAUDIBLE],
this is bull.

00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:16.380 align:middle line:90%
Uh-uh.

00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:17.230 align:middle line:90%
It is very real.

00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:19.313 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take another
question for Dr. Turi.

00:44:19.313 --> 00:44:20.870 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir, way in the back.

00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:24.310 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, is it possible
to use cosmic consciousness

00:44:24.310 --> 00:44:28.680 align:middle line:84%
for financial gain, like the
stock market or sports betting?

00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:30.570 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: Ah, good one.

00:44:30.570 --> 00:44:33.140 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I do work with
large corporations.

00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's not the one who's
going to bring the $150 million

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:39.040 align:middle line:84%
that's going to be the most
beneficial for the corporation.

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:41.415 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this person
may have the worst stars

00:44:41.415 --> 00:44:44.560 align:middle line:84%
and end up swallowing or
killing the corporation.

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:45.700 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you can.

00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:48.670 align:middle line:84%
But as a rule--
as a rule-- you're

00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:52.480 align:middle line:84%
not supposed to use metaphysical
information for personal gain.

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:54.100 align:middle line:90%
That's what I teach.

00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:56.380 align:middle line:84%
But you have to have
integrity, knowing

00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:59.350 align:middle line:90%
how to use it intelligently.

00:44:59.350 --> 00:45:01.600 align:middle line:84%
But again, if you
have the dragons set

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:04.750 align:middle line:84%
on your eighth house
of corporate endeavors

00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:06.340 align:middle line:84%
in the sign of
Cancer, for example,

00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:09.800 align:middle line:84%
that will allow you to invest
in commodity, in estate,

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:12.010 align:middle line:90%
and become the next Trump.

00:45:12.010 --> 00:45:14.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if you wanted
to make money to help people?

00:45:14.590 --> 00:45:15.490 align:middle line:90%
Is that different?

00:45:15.490 --> 00:45:16.960 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: That's typical, George.

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:21.770 align:middle line:84%
This is very, very
honorable indeed.

00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:22.570 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:45:22.570 --> 00:45:25.090 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you have to
give in order to receive.

00:45:25.090 --> 00:45:27.220 align:middle line:84%
And I'm offering two
of my books right now.

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:29.980 align:middle line:84%
If you go to my
website, drturi.com,

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:32.580 align:middle line:84%
you can download two
of my books for free.

00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:42.250 align:middle line:84%
So yes, you can use the stars to
plan in accordance to the rites

00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:44.260 align:middle line:84%
and ceremonies of
the cosmic code

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:47.450 align:middle line:84%
to attract more people
in your mission.

00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:48.610 align:middle line:90%
It's all about planning.

00:45:48.610 --> 00:45:51.100 align:middle line:90%
Your life is all about planning.

00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:54.670 align:middle line:84%
The only question is, are you
planning with a cosmic code?

00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:56.050 align:middle line:90%
No, because nobody taught you.

00:45:56.050 --> 00:45:58.210 align:middle line:90%
That's why I'm here, right?

00:45:58.210 --> 00:46:01.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Our friend Glynis
McCants, the Numbers Lady,

00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:03.550 align:middle line:84%
she says put a number
eight in your wallet ,

00:46:03.550 --> 00:46:05.240 align:middle line:90%
and you'll get financial gain.

00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:07.060 align:middle line:90%
So a friend of mine did that.

00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And he went to a casino,
and he won $1,000.

00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:12.640 align:middle line:90%
And he was just in shock.

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:16.750 align:middle line:84%
So he decided he wanted to go
back the next day and do it,

00:46:16.750 --> 00:46:17.830 align:middle line:90%
and he lost it all.

00:46:17.830 --> 00:46:18.630 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:24.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And she said,
greed will do that to you.

00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:25.984 align:middle line:90%
You can't really do it that way.

00:46:25.984 --> 00:46:27.400 align:middle line:84%
>>TURI: Yeah,
mostly what happened

00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:31.000 align:middle line:84%
is that he went there during
one of these lucky dragon dates.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:31.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:32.560 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: That's what happened.

00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:33.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And went the
wrong day he went back.

00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:34.690 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: Exactly.

00:46:34.690 --> 00:46:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And he came back under his
negative and lost everything.

00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:38.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You got to be careful.

00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:40.311 align:middle line:84%
>>TURI: You have to
understand your cosmic rhythm

00:46:40.311 --> 00:46:41.170 align:middle line:90%
and play with it.

00:46:41.170 --> 00:46:43.882 align:middle line:84%
And at that point when I
offer this service, which

00:46:43.882 --> 00:46:45.340 align:middle line:84%
is on the internet
just very fast--

00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:47.680 align:middle line:84%
you can have it for
the next 12 months.

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:50.230 align:middle line:84%
I give you your cosmic
cycle, when you're up

00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:51.190 align:middle line:90%
and when you're down.

00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:53.648 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not telling you when
you're up or when you're down,

00:46:53.648 --> 00:46:54.740 align:middle line:90%
because I cannot do that.

00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:56.740 align:middle line:84%
I give you the date that
all I can guarantee you

00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:58.824 align:middle line:84%
that is not going to be a
very normal day at work.

00:46:58.824 --> 00:47:00.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You give
them the window.

00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:02.650 align:middle line:84%
Let's take one of our
"Beyond Belief" Cam questions

00:47:02.650 --> 00:47:04.200 align:middle line:90%
for Dr. Louis Turi.

00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:05.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, Dr. Turi.

00:47:05.410 --> 00:47:07.240 align:middle line:90%
This is Adam from Washington.

00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:08.830 align:middle line:84%
I was just wondering,
is your work

00:47:08.830 --> 00:47:12.316 align:middle line:84%
with the dragon and the cosmic
code always come easy to you?

00:47:12.316 --> 00:47:13.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
you studied a lot.

00:47:13.690 --> 00:47:17.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this hasn't come
easy to you, has it?

00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:19.010 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: No, it is easy.

00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:19.810 align:middle line:90%
It's a reflex.

00:47:19.810 --> 00:47:20.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it?

00:47:20.350 --> 00:47:21.360 align:middle line:84%
>>TURI: When I
teach my students,

00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:22.693 align:middle line:90%
they don't even know they learn.

00:47:22.693 --> 00:47:24.240 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm a terrible teacher.

00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:25.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like
driving a car.

00:47:25.650 --> 00:47:27.520 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: Exactly.

00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:29.770 align:middle line:84%
The only problem is,
I see these people

00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:32.120 align:middle line:84%
being like a brand-new Ferrari
and a 15-year-old driving

00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:32.920 align:middle line:90%
the car.

00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:34.240 align:middle line:90%
That's what I see.

00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:36.680 align:middle line:84%
Because they have no
cosmic consciousness.

00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:40.810 align:middle line:84%
But when I teach my student,
George, six or seven hours

00:47:40.810 --> 00:47:42.970 align:middle line:90%
a day, I don't let him breathe.

00:47:42.970 --> 00:47:44.460 align:middle line:84%
I don't want nobody
to make notes.

00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:45.460 align:middle line:90%
I want them to listen.

00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:48.670 align:middle line:84%
Because subconsciously-- and
I have my artwork, of course.

00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:50.910 align:middle line:84%
I have the visual, because
some people are visual,

00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:51.730 align:middle line:90%
not just audible.

00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And they are imprinting
the belt of the zodiac.

00:47:56.890 --> 00:47:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And I ask question, and
I lead them in a way

00:47:59.350 --> 00:48:01.460 align:middle line:90%
that they build a cosmic reflex.

00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:02.780 align:middle line:90%
Takes about a week.

00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:04.572 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you don't want
to do it physically,

00:48:04.572 --> 00:48:06.405 align:middle line:84%
you can take the home
course, but you end up

00:48:06.405 --> 00:48:08.800 align:middle line:84%
with the same result. It might
take a little bit longer.

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:10.570 align:middle line:90%
It is not difficult at all.

00:48:10.570 --> 00:48:11.680 align:middle line:90%
It's like driving.

00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:14.740 align:middle line:84%
It becomes, like anything
else, a subconscious reflex.

00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:16.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take
another question

00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:18.040 align:middle line:84%
from the audience
for Dr. Louis Turi.

00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:18.841 align:middle line:90%
Yes, ma'am.

00:48:18.841 --> 00:48:20.423 align:middle line:84%
Most Most of my life,
people have said

00:48:20.423 --> 00:48:21.910 align:middle line:90%
that I've been very intuitive.

00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:24.760 align:middle line:84%
I've been able to predict
things before they happen,

00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:28.330 align:middle line:84%
or I've been able to meet people
and know right away I either

00:48:28.330 --> 00:48:30.040 align:middle line:90%
like them or I don't like them.

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:32.885 align:middle line:84%
Does that have anything to do
with my cosmic consciousness?

00:48:32.885 --> 00:48:34.010 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: Oh, indeed, indeed.

00:48:34.010 --> 00:48:35.526 align:middle line:84%
What month were
you born, if I may?

00:48:35.526 --> 00:48:36.400 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: February.

00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:37.200 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: Like me.

00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:38.560 align:middle line:90%
I was born in February.

00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:39.370 align:middle line:90%
February when?

00:48:39.370 --> 00:48:39.750 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: 12th.

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:40.550 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: 12th.

00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:41.920 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:43.510 align:middle line:84%
Again, I do not
know your dragon,

00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:45.510 align:middle line:84%
because I don't want to
go into asking your age.

00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:46.770 align:middle line:90%
You don't ask that to a lady.

00:48:46.770 --> 00:48:48.620 align:middle line:90%
So I [INAUDIBLE] ask that.

00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:49.530 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm 52.

00:48:49.530 --> 00:48:50.130 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:48:50.130 --> 00:48:50.410 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: OK.

00:48:50.410 --> 00:48:51.826 align:middle line:84%
So you have the
head of the dragon

00:48:51.826 --> 00:48:53.350 align:middle line:90%
in Aquarius like Einstein.

00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:56.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's why Einstein
was able to psychically get

00:48:56.290 --> 00:48:59.400 align:middle line:84%
the answers of the
law of relativity.

00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:06.070 align:middle line:84%
So you are pre-set to
be-- you have a UCI,

00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:10.240 align:middle line:84%
and when the UCI is
not advanced-- I call

00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:12.000 align:middle line:84%
these guys the
skeptic, the atheist,

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:17.320 align:middle line:84%
the agnostic, young souls-- then
your natural reaction will be,

00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:18.560 align:middle line:90%
anh!

00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:19.920 align:middle line:90%
Bull!

00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:22.010 align:middle line:90%
Pseudoscience!

00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:24.320 align:middle line:84%
They use the ridicule to
hide behind their stupidity

00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:25.280 align:middle line:90%
and their ignorance.

00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:26.710 align:middle line:90%
They're young souls.

00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:30.200 align:middle line:84%
But in your case, looking
at your chart right now,

00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:33.455 align:middle line:84%
you definitely have it all
as far as investigating

00:49:33.455 --> 00:49:34.255 align:middle line:90%
the cosmic codes.

00:49:34.255 --> 00:49:35.750 align:middle line:84%
With your dragon
set in Aquarius,

00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:37.540 align:middle line:84%
you are going to be
led into television

00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:38.962 align:middle line:90%
if you aim in that direction.

00:49:38.962 --> 00:49:40.420 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
channel information

00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:42.060 align:middle line:90%
from the cosmic code.

00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:44.705 align:middle line:84%
And because you are an Aquarius,
you belong to the future.

00:49:44.705 --> 00:49:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you have
to challenge yourself

00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:49.210 align:middle line:84%
from the past, especially the
affairs of love and romance

00:49:49.210 --> 00:49:51.830 align:middle line:84%
that can drag you
down a little bit.

00:49:51.830 --> 00:49:54.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Louis, when someone
is born, when a baby is born,

00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:58.420 align:middle line:84%
can you basically tell
what that person's future

00:49:58.420 --> 00:50:02.320 align:middle line:84%
will be like based on that
time period that they're born?

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:05.200 align:middle line:84%
>>TURI: This is where
I wish you could

00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:08.530 align:middle line:84%
talk to some of my
friends and clients

00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:12.040 align:middle line:84%
that I did the chart of the
children before they were born,

00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:15.520 align:middle line:84%
and they are going exactly where
I said they were going to go.

00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'm still
guiding these people

00:50:17.770 --> 00:50:21.250 align:middle line:90%
who are 18, 19, and 20 today.

00:50:21.250 --> 00:50:23.028 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you can.

00:50:23.028 --> 00:50:25.570 align:middle line:90%
You can.

00:50:25.570 --> 00:50:27.760 align:middle line:84%
As I said earlier, you
are related to your family

00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:30.390 align:middle line:84%
and to your children
genetically only.

00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:32.110 align:middle line:84%
But in the world of
the spirits, they

00:50:32.110 --> 00:50:34.640 align:middle line:90%
are not programmed like you.

00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:36.490 align:middle line:84%
They're not going
to think, create,

00:50:36.490 --> 00:50:38.740 align:middle line:84%
or be helped by God,
by the cosmic code,

00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:40.630 align:middle line:84%
to end up where
they're supposed to be.

00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:43.830 align:middle line:84%
So knowing all this, it's like
saving a hell of a lot of time

00:50:43.830 --> 00:50:46.450 align:middle line:90%
and that's where you belong.

00:50:46.450 --> 00:50:48.464 align:middle line:84%
Providing the matrix
works in your favor,

00:50:48.464 --> 00:50:50.380 align:middle line:84%
you will be at the right
time and right place.

00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:52.150 align:middle line:84%
So you may just end
up having a miserable

00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:56.136 align:middle line:84%
life when you can actually own
and enjoy an incredible life.

00:50:56.136 --> 00:50:57.510 align:middle line:84%
But if you're not
curious, you're

00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:59.218 align:middle line:84%
going to pay the price
of that ignorance.

00:50:59.218 --> 00:51:00.490 align:middle line:90%
You need to take chances.

00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are so
many people fascinated

00:51:02.350 --> 00:51:06.972 align:middle line:84%
with cosmic codes, astrology,
the planets, the alignments?

00:51:06.972 --> 00:51:09.430 align:middle line:84%
>>TURI: We are moving towards
the end of the age of Pisces,

00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:12.610 align:middle line:84%
the end of religion, the
end of dogmatic teaching.

00:51:12.610 --> 00:51:15.280 align:middle line:84%
Humanity is raising his
own spiritual vibration

00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:17.770 align:middle line:84%
to a higher speed,
which is the promotion

00:51:17.770 --> 00:51:18.979 align:middle line:90%
of the age of Aquarius.

00:51:18.979 --> 00:51:20.395 align:middle line:84%
That's why I was
born in February.

00:51:20.395 --> 00:51:23.560 align:middle line:90%


00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:27.910 align:middle line:84%
The cycle, the cosmic
code cycle, is eternal.

00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:30.100 align:middle line:84%
I can work, like
I give you dates,

00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:33.860 align:middle line:84%
for weeks and months or years
or centuries of millennia.

00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:36.310 align:middle line:90%
It's mathematics.

00:51:36.310 --> 00:51:38.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When a comet
enters the solar system,

00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:41.410 align:middle line:90%
does that affect any of this?

00:51:41.410 --> 00:51:43.990 align:middle line:84%
>>TURI: What I know directly
from the extraterrestrial

00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:47.200 align:middle line:84%
is that when they built
our solar system, George,

00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:49.090 align:middle line:84%
they put in place the
biggest planet of all.

00:51:49.090 --> 00:51:50.620 align:middle line:90%
It's called Jupiter.

00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And its gravitational
forces will always, always

00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:57.140 align:middle line:84%
attract debris before
they hit Earth.

00:51:57.140 --> 00:51:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And you can verify this
with the Shoemaker comet.

00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:01.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:02.401 align:middle line:90%
We lucked out on that one.

00:52:02.401 --> 00:52:03.400 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: This is too far.

00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:05.080 align:middle line:90%
We have a solar system.

00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:07.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have NASA, you
have all the scientists

00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:10.210 align:middle line:84%
trying to send somebody
on Mars or to deal

00:52:10.210 --> 00:52:11.170 align:middle line:90%
with all these things.

00:52:11.170 --> 00:52:13.720 align:middle line:84%
I think Mother Earth
is depleting real fast.

00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:16.926 align:middle line:84%
We should concentrate
on our own spaceship.

00:52:16.926 --> 00:52:18.550 align:middle line:84%
We should concentrate
on Mother Nature.

00:52:18.550 --> 00:52:21.670 align:middle line:84%
We should concentrate
on educating humanity

00:52:21.670 --> 00:52:24.130 align:middle line:84%
to be responsible,
to be honorable,

00:52:24.130 --> 00:52:26.470 align:middle line:90%
to respect each other.

00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:30.650 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't worry about
planets or comets.

00:52:30.650 --> 00:52:33.040 align:middle line:84%
They discover a planet
every single day.

00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:35.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they would never
give you the exact timing

00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:36.850 align:middle line:90%
for an earthquake.

00:52:36.850 --> 00:52:38.950 align:middle line:84%
I do, and it's free,
not with all your tax.

00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:39.750 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:40.720 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:44.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you excited
about our future?

00:52:44.290 --> 00:52:47.197 align:middle line:90%
Ah, I didn't like that grimace.

00:52:47.197 --> 00:52:48.030 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:52:48.030 --> 00:52:51.290 align:middle line:90%


00:52:51.290 --> 00:52:52.840 align:middle line:84%
>>TURI: OK, my
wife and I, we have

00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:54.220 align:middle line:90%
decided not to have children.

00:52:54.220 --> 00:52:54.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:52:54.590 --> 00:52:55.390 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: All right.

00:52:55.390 --> 00:52:59.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For a specific
reason because of the future?

00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:01.700 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: You're-- right.

00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:05.440 align:middle line:84%
You always come up with things
I don't want to talk about.

00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:07.404 align:middle line:90%
But it's OK.

00:53:07.404 --> 00:53:09.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I always come up with
things people want to hear.

00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:10.840 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: Yeah.

00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:12.130 align:middle line:90%
That goes with it, yeah.

00:53:12.130 --> 00:53:13.070 align:middle line:90%
Only you do that.

00:53:13.070 --> 00:53:18.220 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm saying, George,
we have such little time

00:53:18.220 --> 00:53:19.787 align:middle line:90%
of no return.

00:53:19.787 --> 00:53:20.870 align:middle line:90%
I mean, look at the facts.

00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:23.410 align:middle line:84%
Looks what's going on
with the rainforests.

00:53:23.410 --> 00:53:28.150 align:middle line:84%
Look what's going on with
the disaster, the intensity.

00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:29.820 align:middle line:90%
I mean, do you deny that?

00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:31.510 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:53:31.510 --> 00:53:34.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
saying that there's

00:53:34.090 --> 00:53:35.830 align:middle line:90%
a poor future for all of us?

00:53:35.830 --> 00:53:37.780 align:middle line:90%

00:53:53.948 --> 00:53:56.320 align:middle line:84%
She's like a big dog when
she's fed up with fleas.

00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:58.612 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm not talking about that.

00:53:58.612 --> 00:54:00.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
self-destruction,

00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:00.880 align:middle line:90%
humanity's self-destruction.

00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:02.505 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, I'm
convinced this planet

00:54:02.505 --> 00:54:05.320 align:middle line:84%

00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:06.790 align:middle line:90%
it has to do to do that.

00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:07.750 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: Exactly.

00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:13.320 align:middle line:84%
That's where now you're bringing
the superconscious in time

00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:16.960 align:middle line:84%
and space in reference to
what I was saying earlier.

00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:19.900 align:middle line:84%
The more we communicate,
the more we educate people,

00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:24.640 align:middle line:84%
the more we think positively,
then we are not doomed.

00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:28.240 align:middle line:84%
God didn't put us on Earth
to end a terrible life.

00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:32.590 align:middle line:84%
But as it stands now with
no cosmic consciousness,

00:54:32.590 --> 00:54:38.320 align:middle line:84%
the gap between science,
faith, metaphysics, spirits

00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:41.200 align:middle line:84%
and science, the
agnostic, the skeptic,

00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:43.940 align:middle line:90%
the atheist is widening.

00:54:43.940 --> 00:54:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's so very
important to bring me back

00:54:47.590 --> 00:54:49.330 align:middle line:84%
to college, university
and to start

00:54:49.330 --> 00:54:51.520 align:middle line:84%
to educate the children
and the parents

00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:54.220 align:middle line:84%
right away on the
spiritual values

00:54:54.220 --> 00:54:57.460 align:middle line:84%
so they don't start to
immediately think, eh,

00:54:57.460 --> 00:54:59.340 align:middle line:90%
what am I here for?

00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:03.070 align:middle line:84%
A child has to swallow 2,000
years of human evolution

00:55:03.070 --> 00:55:04.670 align:middle line:90%
in a few years.

00:55:04.670 --> 00:55:05.860 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot of stress.

00:55:05.860 --> 00:55:09.480 align:middle line:84%
But who is there to tell
them who am I, Dr. Turi?

00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:10.720 align:middle line:90%
Where I am I coming from?

00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:12.070 align:middle line:90%
What's ahead of me?

00:55:12.070 --> 00:55:14.002 align:middle line:84%
They don't regenerate
spiritually.

00:55:14.002 --> 00:55:15.460 align:middle line:84%
All they have in
the Bible, they're

00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:17.805 align:middle line:84%
going to end up in hell if
they don't fear their God.

00:55:17.805 --> 00:55:18.605 align:middle line:90%
Uh-uh.

00:55:18.605 --> 00:55:19.970 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work that way.

00:55:19.970 --> 00:55:22.510 align:middle line:90%
So we need to bring that back.

00:55:22.510 --> 00:55:25.420 align:middle line:90%
Then we have 50 years to do so.

00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:28.720 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not saying
we're all gone.

00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:30.730 align:middle line:84%
But the reason why
I don't want child

00:55:30.730 --> 00:55:34.270 align:middle line:84%
is I don't know if I'm going to
be able to fulfill my mission.

00:55:34.270 --> 00:55:36.514 align:middle line:90%
Because I'm already 63.

00:55:36.514 --> 00:55:37.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you
had an opportunity

00:55:37.930 --> 00:55:42.340 align:middle line:84%
to talk to the world
on television or radio,

00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:44.500 align:middle line:90%
what would you tell them?

00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:47.390 align:middle line:84%
>>TURI: I would tell
them [? possible ?]

00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:49.610 align:middle line:90%
not to lose faith.

00:55:49.610 --> 00:55:53.420 align:middle line:84%
I would tell them to reevaluate
Jesus' ministry, which

00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:56.090 align:middle line:84%
was to introduce our
Father in the heavens,

00:55:56.090 --> 00:55:58.310 align:middle line:90%
or the cosmic codes.

00:55:58.310 --> 00:56:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And I would tell
them to be prepared

00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:04.250 align:middle line:90%
to handle their own future.

00:56:04.250 --> 00:56:06.080 align:middle line:84%
Because again, we
are not doomed.

00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:08.720 align:middle line:84%
We just have a
certain time to do it.

00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:10.760 align:middle line:90%
And I see 50 years.

00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:13.460 align:middle line:84%
That's what I see through the
cosmic codes' [? readings, ?]

00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:14.330 align:middle line:90%
ceremonies.

00:56:14.330 --> 00:56:14.915 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A window.

00:56:14.915 --> 00:56:15.715 align:middle line:90%
>>TURI: Yeah.

00:56:15.715 --> 00:56:16.640 align:middle line:90%
We can do it, though.

00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:17.870 align:middle line:90%
We can do it.

00:56:17.870 --> 00:56:22.350 align:middle line:84%
But that's why, as I said, the
teachers is very, very rare.

00:56:22.350 --> 00:56:25.110 align:middle line:84%
The teachers who have cosmic
consciousness out there

00:56:25.110 --> 00:56:25.950 align:middle line:90%
are very, very rare.

00:56:25.950 --> 00:56:29.900 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the people that are
the expert in their fields,

00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:32.300 align:middle line:84%
will it be in UFOs or
anything else, very often

00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:33.470 align:middle line:90%
are the least knowledgeable.

00:56:33.470 --> 00:56:36.800 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the
pope, for example,

00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:39.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in respect
to the pope himself,

00:56:39.650 --> 00:56:42.290 align:middle line:84%
he doesn't have any
cosmic consciousness.

00:56:42.290 --> 00:56:43.820 align:middle line:84%
In talking about
President Obama,

00:56:43.820 --> 00:56:45.800 align:middle line:90%
I know all those leaders.

00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:48.050 align:middle line:84%
In every branch of
the human experience,

00:56:48.050 --> 00:56:49.970 align:middle line:84%
those leaders don't have
cosmic consciousness.

00:56:49.970 --> 00:56:53.890 align:middle line:84%
It's scary, very scary
to somebody like me

00:56:53.890 --> 00:57:01.940 align:middle line:84%
who knows how this energy can be
used to help us beat all hearts

00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:03.050 align:middle line:90%
or just self-destruct.

00:57:03.050 --> 00:57:05.030 align:middle line:90%
That's what it comes down to.

00:57:05.030 --> 00:57:09.577 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But the possibility
of self-destructing is there.

00:57:09.577 --> 00:57:10.410 align:middle line:90%

>>TURI: Yes, I do.

00:57:26.970 --> 00:57:30.990 align:middle line:10%
Evil is right in the world right
now because last few years,

00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:34.360 align:middle line:10%
the dragon was not
compatible to help progress.

00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:38.460 align:middle line:10%
Only this year, this dragon
is forcing people to wake up.

00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:41.520 align:middle line:84%
It's forcing the [? IRS ?]
to get his own wake-up call,

00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:44.195 align:middle line:84%
the government, the
FBI, things that I

00:57:44.195 --> 00:57:46.141 align:middle line:90%
have made him my prediction.

00:57:46.141 --> 00:57:47.890 align:middle line:84%

change easily, though.

00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:52.200 align:middle line:84%
Because the system
is set that way.

00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:58.050 align:middle line:84%

to [? recant ?] [? war. ?] And

of Marie Antoinette and King 16.

00:58:22.050 --> 00:58:26.160 align:middle line:84%
The 16 because they
were abusing them.

00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:29.070 align:middle line:84%
Do we have to do
that to make change?

00:58:29.070 --> 00:58:29.870 align:middle line:90%
