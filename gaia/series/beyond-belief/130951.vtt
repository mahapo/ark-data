>>GEORGE NOORY: Well, it's
healthy to be a skeptic,

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.890 align:middle line:10%
but it's even healthier
to be a believer

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.010 align:middle line:10%
after you've checked into facts.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.545 align:middle line:10%
You'll find that out on

The author or editor

Joe doesn't see
himself as a debunker.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.320 align:middle line:84%
But so far, he has yet
to uncover any truth

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.330 align:middle line:90%
miracles, ghosts, or monsters.

of Joe Nickell's

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.333 align:middle line:84%
books, of course, that he
wrote with Robert Bartholomew,

00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:13.110 align:middle line:84%
"American Hauntings,"
and we're going

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.930 align:middle line:84%
to get into that
in a big way today.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.162 align:middle line:90%
Joe, welcome to the program.

00:01:16.162 --> 00:01:17.620 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE NICKELL:
Pleasure being here.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
you, as a skeptic,

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.600 align:middle line:84%
get involved in investigating
paranormal issues?

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.020 align:middle line:10%
>>NICKELL: I grew up as a boy,
like every other boy or girl,

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.890 align:middle line:10%
interested in ghosts
and so forth, was

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.300 align:middle line:10%
fascinated by Houdini.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.050 align:middle line:84%
My father was an
amateur magician,

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.922 align:middle line:90%
so we had magic stuff all--

00:01:38.922 --> 00:01:40.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You love that stuff.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NICKELL: --from my
earliest memories.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.210 align:middle line:84%
I later would become
a resident magician

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.670 align:middle line:84%
at the Houdini Hall of
Fame and went on from there

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.680 align:middle line:84%
to work as a detective for a
world famous detective agency

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.430 align:middle line:84%
and somewhat later in life
got a master's and doctorate

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.460 align:middle line:84%
in English literature
and folklore.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.420 align:middle line:90%
So it's an odd mix.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You mixed
them all, though.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NICKELL: But it works for me.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a scientist,
but I've always

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.320 align:middle line:90%
been sort of a forensic buff.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'm co-author of the
book "Crime Science."

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.010 align:middle line:84%
So if I need a real scientist,
of course, I go get one.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.100 align:middle line:84%
But it's a great mix, and
it's all very interesting.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And I found out long
ago that it might

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.370 align:middle line:84%
be fun to believe
something, or it

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.770 align:middle line:84%
might be fun to make
fun of something silly.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.030 align:middle line:84%
What was really interesting
was to actually try

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.720 align:middle line:90%
to solve a mystery.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.210 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing that
even comes close to that

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.067 align:middle line:84%
as a satisfying
personal accomplishment.

00:02:40.067 --> 00:02:41.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That excites
you a lot, doesn't it?

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:42.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NICKELL: It does.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And I found out-- I've done
literary detective work,

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.450 align:middle line:84%
historical,
forensic, paranormal,

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.190 align:middle line:84%
and I don't care-- I don't
much care what the topic is.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.040 align:middle line:84%
If it's interesting,
mysterious, and if I

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.350 align:middle line:84%
think I might have a
chance to solve it, I'm in.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Joe, a lot of people
confuse the word skeptic.

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.290 align:middle line:84%
Because they think a
skeptic is a nonbeliever.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.900 align:middle line:84%
My definition of a
skeptic is someone

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.570 align:middle line:84%
who wants to find the
facts before he decides

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.120 align:middle line:90%
whether to believe or not.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.935 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:03:14.935 --> 00:03:15.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NICKELL: That's it.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.000 align:middle line:84%
You really have to-- I mean, you
could be skeptical of anything.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.130 align:middle line:84%
There are people with misplaced
skepticism about, let's say,

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.540 align:middle line:90%
the Holocaust or global warming.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.960 align:middle line:84%
What we need is we
need to have skepticism

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.460 align:middle line:84%
to those things to
which skepticism is due,

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.410 align:middle line:84%
meaning those things that
appear on the face of it

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.420 align:middle line:84%
to be far fetched or appear
to contradict science.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.630 align:middle line:84%
They may be legit, but
they're sort of warning signs

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.520 align:middle line:84%
or they kind of need
to be checked out.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.280 align:middle line:84%
And so if we're skeptical
of those things,

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.010 align:middle line:84%
that's just the natural
correct attitude of mind.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.510 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't prejudge.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.590 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't say that
something isn't

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.810 align:middle line:90%
true to question, oh, really?

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.210 align:middle line:84%
I remember Coleridge, the
famous literary figure,

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.470 align:middle line:84%
and he had this term he used
called "the willing suspension

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.247 align:middle line:90%
of disbelief."

00:04:09.247 --> 00:04:11.080 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you
don't sit in the theater

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.490 align:middle line:84%
and nudge your friend and say,
those aren't real bullets.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.580 align:middle line:90%
He didn't really kill her.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.060 align:middle line:90%
Because that's just annoying.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.680 align:middle line:90%
The same in the paranormal.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.550 align:middle line:84%
We need to put aside the sort
of belief-disbelief question

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.610 align:middle line:84%
for the time being, go to the
haunted house or whatever,

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.880 align:middle line:84%
and ask ourselves, what
really happened here?

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:34.790 align:middle line:90%
How do we know that?

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:35.640 align:middle line:90%
Are we sure?

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Is that a fact,
or is that a piece

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.920 align:middle line:84%
of false information
somebody made up?

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And then when we
can get the facts,

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.390 align:middle line:84%
we might have a chance to
find out what really happened.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Joe, if you
can't get the facts,

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.800 align:middle line:84%
because it's difficult--
let's talk about God for now.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.550 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult to
prove the existence of God

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:57.509 align:middle line:90%
with evidence and fact.

00:04:57.509 --> 00:04:58.424 align:middle line:90%
>>NICKELL: It is hard.

00:04:58.424 --> 00:05:00.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what do
you do about that?

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Do you stay a skeptic
and say there is no God?

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NICKELL: I tend
to take the position

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.770 align:middle line:84%
that if there is
not evidence for it,

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.380 align:middle line:84%
then I just remain
skeptical of it.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.040 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I wouldn't
try to convince you

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.410 align:middle line:90%
that there are no leprechauns.

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.130 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how would we do that?

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.470 align:middle line:84%
I have a standing offer if
somebody wants to finance--

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:20.915 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's go to Ireland.

00:05:20.915 --> 00:05:21.300 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NICKELL: Yeah, if they want
to finance my expedition,

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.363 align:middle line:90%
George and I will go.

00:05:24.363 --> 00:05:25.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We'll go.

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:26.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NICKELL: We'll go to Ireland,
and we'll beat the bushes,

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.804 align:middle line:84%
and we'll say, no,
no leprechauns.

00:05:28.804 --> 00:05:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And somebody will
say, ah, but don't you

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.090 align:middle line:84%
know that we creatures are
mostly around Blarney Castle,

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.050 align:middle line:90%
don't you know?

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.020 align:middle line:90%
OK, fine.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.830 align:middle line:90%
We'll go back.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.590 align:middle line:84%
We may have to have
a few more drinks.

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.790 align:middle line:84%
We'll have a good time,
no, no leprechauns.

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.780 align:middle line:84%
Ah, but don't you know
that we creatures have

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.310 align:middle line:84%
the power of invisibility,
don't you know?

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.290 align:middle line:90%
Well, at some point--

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:47.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: [INAUDIBLE] I'm
standing right next to you,

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:48.950 align:middle line:90%
man, right?

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NICKELL: [LAUGHING]
So what we have

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.420 align:middle line:84%
to do-- I can't prove
there are no leprechauns.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:57.250 align:middle line:84%
I just assume that until
somebody brings me--

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.360 align:middle line:84%
I hate to say this,
George-- a dead leprechaun--

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh!

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NICKELL: Oh, I
shouldn't have said that.

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.249 align:middle line:90%
I know I'll be hated now.

00:06:03.249 --> 00:06:04.290 align:middle line:90%
All the school children--

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:05.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I thought
they lived forever.

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.231 align:middle line:90%
>>NICKELL: Well, maybe they do.

00:06:07.231 --> 00:06:08.600 align:middle line:90%
But you see my point.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Unless we have some really
good evidence that science

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.880 align:middle line:90%
could really get into--

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:14.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And back it up.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.546 align:middle line:84%
>>NICKELL: --then we
just don't believe.

00:06:16.546 --> 00:06:18.630 align:middle line:84%
It's not a question of
proving there isn't a God

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.150 align:middle line:90%
or proving there aren't angels.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.770 align:middle line:90%
I just don't bother doing that.

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.810 align:middle line:84%
I say, well, we can
explain the world and most

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.370 align:middle line:84%
of the phenomena in the
world without recourse

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:30.560 align:middle line:90%
to any supernatural.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:35.390 align:middle line:84%
So I just have no belief
in the supernatural.

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.510 align:middle line:84%
But it would be folly
for me to attempt

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:38.797 align:middle line:90%
to disprove all those things.

00:06:38.797 --> 00:06:40.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's
talk a little bit

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.170 align:middle line:84%
about some of your
investigations

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.420 align:middle line:84%
into the paranormal world
that you highlight in the book

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.270 align:middle line:90%
"American Hauntings," of course.

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:51.600 align:middle line:84%

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:04.940 align:middle line:90%
exactly was happening.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And that case really
started out as a kind

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.690 align:middle line:84%
of poltergeist
case, some mischief,

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:12.790 align:middle line:84%
some odd things thrown
about or whatever.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And it gradually became more
of something sinister and--

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Evil.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.510 align:middle line:84%

and took on-- it evolved,

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:23.970 align:middle line:84%
in other words, which
makes me suspicious

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:26.920 align:middle line:84%
of it being a
genuine phenomenon.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.175 align:middle line:84%
The boy was at the
center for everything,

00:09:29.175 --> 00:09:31.730 align:middle line:84%
as is the case
with poltergeists.

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:37.120 align:middle line:84%
That is, nothing happened
if he wasn't around.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And he would produce
these markings.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.290 align:middle line:84%
Words would be
scratched on his body.

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, people thought,
he couldn't be doing this.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:51.080 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, he was actually
caught once doing it.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And then you see
the rationalizations

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:55.730 align:middle line:84%
of the believers, saying,
yeah, but he was just imitating

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:56.950 align:middle line:90%
what the real demons did.

00:09:56.950 --> 00:10:00.530 align:middle line:84%
No, see, when anybody's
caught faking something,

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:02.995 align:middle line:84%

close the case right there.

and you cut through all
the exaggerations, all

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:14.480 align:middle line:84%
the elaborations and stuff, and
look at what really happened,

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.790 align:middle line:84%
most of it was stuff
that a boy could

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:21.880 align:middle line:84%
and apparently did do,
nothing supernatural.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:26.080 align:middle line:84%
People were trying to impose
on that layers of claims

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.490 align:middle line:90%

better case if they

When I first heard the case
of the Amityville Horror,

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:02.140 align:middle line:84%
and I had by that point a lot
of experience with such cases,

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:04.820 align:middle line:84%
it sounded a little bit
like a traditional haunting,

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:08.390 align:middle line:84%
a little bit like a poltergeist,
a little bit like a demon.

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:11.480 align:middle line:84%
It was such a hodgepodge it
was like if you and I decided

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.620 align:middle line:90%
to make up a case.

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:14.640 align:middle line:84%
We put a little bit
of each ingredient

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.770 align:middle line:84%
in because it would make
it more interesting.

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:20.690 align:middle line:84%
I had never seen a case of
that type, that admixture.

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:22.460 align:middle line:90%
I'd never seen anything like it.

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:25.610 align:middle line:84%
Pretty quickly you could show
that some of the things that

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:27.370 align:middle line:90%
were claimed didn't happen.

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:30.739 align:middle line:84%
For example, the devil's
tracks in the snow

00:14:30.739 --> 00:14:32.280 align:middle line:84%
couldn't have
happened, because there

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:35.660 align:middle line:84%
was no snow on the
ground on those dates.

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And I knew Barbara Cromarty,
who lived in the house later,

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:42.710 align:middle line:84%
and she could take
you around the house

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:45.910 align:middle line:84%
and show you that some of
the windows and doors that

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:49.340 align:middle line:84%
were supposedly ripped off their
hinges by demonic forces, that

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:50.460 align:middle line:90%
never happened.

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:52.410 align:middle line:84%
The old hardware
was still there.

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:05.700 align:middle line:84%

they're convinced the police

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.476 align:middle line:84%
came and the priest
came and stuff.

00:15:07.476 --> 00:15:08.350 align:middle line:90%

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:10.141 align:middle line:84%

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:15.130 align:middle line:90%
Pretty much.

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:24.150 align:middle line:84%
Because Ronald DeFeo's attorney
William Weber testified.

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:26.360 align:middle line:84%
He came forward
and actually said

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:30.260 align:middle line:84%
that those horror
incidents were made up

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:35.280 align:middle line:84%
over several bottles of
wine in his law office, wine

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:37.770 align:middle line:90%
that George Lutz was drinking.

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:39.070 align:middle line:90%
And they were making this up.

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:40.710 align:middle line:90%
Now, why was Weber doing this?

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:45.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, he thought if there
was any kind of demonic story

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:49.340 align:middle line:84%
and people believed that demons
were kind of possessing people,

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:53.465 align:middle line:84%
maybe he could get a new trial
for his client, the murderer.

00:15:53.465 --> 00:15:55.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What lawyer would
want to get a client off

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:57.900 align:middle line:84%
when he knew they were--
well, that's another story.

>>NICKELL: It's just bizarre.

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.590 align:middle line:84%
But there is Weber
having confessed.

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:03.930 align:middle line:90%
It's well known.

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And the Cromartys
sued because they

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:09.180 align:middle line:90%
couldn't have peace of mind.

hodgepodge of stuff, much of it

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:24.450 align:middle line:84%

that most of this was made up.

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:30.950 align:middle line:84%

have a kid, or sometimes

Objects are thrown
about, people are amazed.

that parents are usually

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:48.030 align:middle line:84%

and tossed it over the guy's

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:23.080 align:middle line:84%
And the kids were all
looking to compete

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:25.700 align:middle line:84%
for their mother's attention
or for father's attention.

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:27.630 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to
outdo each other.

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:30.140 align:middle line:84%
You had a little bit
of mischief, I think.

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:33.560 align:middle line:84%
I would call it "poltergeists"
in quotation marks.

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:38.190 align:middle line:84%
You had, as you often
have, somebody wakes up,

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:42.059 align:middle line:84%
and they see some sinister
figure, having just woken.

00:28:42.059 --> 00:28:43.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A shadow or something.

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:45.487 align:middle line:84%
>>NICKELL: And they're
unable to move.

00:28:45.487 --> 00:28:46.820 align:middle line:90%
And this is a common phenomenon.

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:47.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's sleep paralysis.

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:48.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NICKELL: Yeah.

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:51.140 align:middle line:84%
It's a waking dream
with sleep paralysis.

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:52.980 align:middle line:90%
It's understood very, very well.

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And you can go through the
book and just check off

00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:58.932 align:middle line:84%
the incidents in which that
is just described perfectly

00:28:58.932 --> 00:29:00.390 align:middle line:84%
and must have been
the explanation.

00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:03.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It sounds to me,
Joe, that you do not believe

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:06.530 align:middle line:90%
in ghosts based on this.

00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:08.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NICKELL: I'm not in
the belief business.

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:11.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm in the
investigative business.

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And I've not seen any
evidence that I believe--

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:15.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:18.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NICKELL: --warrented-- right,
yet-- that warranted belief

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.430 align:middle line:90%
in ghosts.

00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:24.100 align:middle line:84%
Ghosts are really not
a very scientific idea.

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:27.630 align:middle line:84%
The idea that yes, we might have
some life energy that science

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:31.610 align:middle line:84%
can't quite find, but the
idea that some form of energy

00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:36.440 align:middle line:84%
leaves the body at death and
doesn't dissipate and continues

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:40.360 align:middle line:84%
after the source is gone
and continues for 100 years

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:42.060 align:middle line:90%
is scientific nonsense.

00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:45.370 align:middle line:84%
It's like thinking that that
light bulb somehow when you

00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:48.450 align:middle line:84%
turn the light off goes
to another dimension.

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:52.280 align:middle line:84%
No, it just turns into
heat energy and dissipates.

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:55.630 align:middle line:84%
The idea that a
ghost without a brain

00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:58.630 align:middle line:84%
would be able to walk,
talk, and say boo

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:00.190 align:middle line:90%
is not a scientific idea.

00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:02.495 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you believe
in life after death?

00:30:02.495 --> 00:30:05.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NICKELL: I'm not in the
belief business, George.

00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:07.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm gonna get you yet.

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:08.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NICKELL: I don't believe--

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:11.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what happens when
you die, in your opinion.

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:12.200 align:middle line:90%
You don't know.

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:14.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NICKELL: Everything stops.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.020 align:middle line:90%
I think it must stop.

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:15.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's it.

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:15.860 align:middle line:90%
Done.

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:17.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NICKELL: Because we are
brain-centered beings.

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:20.300 align:middle line:84%
I've dwelled on this a
lot in my own thinking.

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:21.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm a serious poet.

00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:25.900 align:middle line:84%
I would love to imagine
other worlds and so forth.

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:33.140 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, when our brain
is injured or not doing well,

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:34.890 align:middle line:90%
things happen to it.

00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:40.520 align:middle line:84%
If the brain malfunctions,
then there are consequences.

00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:45.120 align:middle line:84%
My mother had Alzheimer's, and
I watched the effects of that.

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:47.970 align:middle line:84%
To believe in ghosts
is almost to say, oh,

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:49.230 align:middle line:90%
you don't really need a brain.

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:50.560 align:middle line:90%
We don't need a brain.

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:54.200 align:middle line:84%
You just have this spirit, and
it has a sort of spirit brain,

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.690 align:middle line:84%
and the real brain
doesn't have-- no, that's

00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:57.490 align:middle line:90%
just nonsense.

00:30:57.490 --> 00:30:59.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Joe, have
you investigated

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:02.630 align:middle line:84%
anything-- anything--
that would lead

00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:06.020 align:middle line:84%
you to believe that maybe
there's some credence to some

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:07.840 align:middle line:90%
of the supernatural stuff.

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NICKELL: I have not.

00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:09.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing.

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:12.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NICKELL: And that doesn't mean
that I can explain everything.

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:14.170 align:middle line:84%
People always ask me,
is there anything you

00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:15.650 align:middle line:90%
haven't been able to explain?

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:16.790 align:middle line:90%
Well, lots of things.

00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:17.767 align:middle line:90%
And then they say, see?

00:31:17.767 --> 00:31:18.930 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:20.390 align:middle line:90%
As if they've got me.

00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:22.910 align:middle line:84%
No, because the
rest of that answer

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:27.960 align:middle line:84%
is I haven't
examined things where

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:31.790 align:middle line:84%
there is no evidence, where
people or their stories

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:35.240 align:middle line:84%
long ago, far away, not
very investigatable.

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:37.580 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea what
happened in those cases,

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:39.790 align:middle line:84%
because we really don't
have any evidence.

00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:43.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you like some
of these stories to be true?

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:45.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NICKELL: Like everybody
else, like everyone,

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:48.830 align:middle line:84%
I think we are
hopeful human beings.

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:51.690 align:middle line:84%
We want to believe
in wonderful things.

00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:54.910 align:middle line:84%
If we were voting, we would
raise our hands right now.

00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:56.030 align:middle line:90%
Are ghosts real?

00:31:56.030 --> 00:32:00.570 align:middle line:84%
Sure, because we would
vote for that because we

00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:03.300 align:middle line:90%
want to live on after we die.

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:05.040 align:middle line:90%
Almost everybody wants that.

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:07.130 align:middle line:84%
Or we want to believe
that extraterrestrials

00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:10.320 align:middle line:84%
are real because we don't want
to be alone in the universe.

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:12.400 align:middle line:90%
These are all wonderful ideas.

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:16.270 align:middle line:84%
It's just that the
evidence is not there yet.

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:20.210 align:middle line:84%
I suspect it's going to be a
long time coming and possibly

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:21.010 align:middle line:90%
never.

00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:22.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about faith?

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:23.510 align:middle line:90%
Where does faith fit in?

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:24.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NICKELL: Faith?

00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:25.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:29.940 align:middle line:84%
Let me give you an
example, a miracle story.

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:35.670 align:middle line:84%
A lady goes into her garage
and sees her son hanging

00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:37.080 align:middle line:90%
from a rope.

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:39.590 align:middle line:90%
He attempted suicide.

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:43.110 align:middle line:84%
She gets there with enough
time that he's still alive.

00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:45.490 align:middle line:90%
But what is she going to do?

00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:48.030 align:middle line:90%
The guy weighs 200 pounds.

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:51.070 align:middle line:90%
She's 110.

00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:54.812 align:middle line:90%
She screams for help from God.

00:32:54.812 --> 00:32:59.670 align:middle line:84%
Out of nowhere,
she says, she sees

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:04.700 align:middle line:84%
like an angel or
hands joining her,

00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:09.740 align:middle line:84%
lifting this 200-pound guy
up to release the stress

00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:12.210 align:middle line:90%
and the tension on the rope.

00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And as she screams,
a neighbor comes by

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:17.520 align:middle line:90%
and helps and gets him down.

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:19.610 align:middle line:90%
The guy lives.

00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:21.630 align:middle line:90%
How do you explain that?

00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:23.762 align:middle line:84%
>>NICKELL: First of all,
we skeptics have a saying.

00:33:23.762 --> 00:33:25.220 align:middle line:84%
Before we try to
explain something,

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:28.270 align:middle line:84%
we have to make sure it really,
really happened as described.

00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:32.524 align:middle line:84%
I take you that you've seen
a case somewhat like that.

00:33:32.524 --> 00:33:33.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have
to assume it did.

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:37.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NICKELL: But we can certainly
imagine a situation like that.

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:39.720 align:middle line:90%
It's reasonably credible.

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:43.650 align:middle line:84%
We're all able to summon
a great deal of strength

00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:45.410 align:middle line:90%
when we really need to.

00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:46.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Adrenalin rush.

00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:47.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NICKELL: Yeah.

00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:49.960 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:52.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like lifting a car
when it falls on somebody.

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:53.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NICKELL: We're able
to empower ourselves

00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:56.310 align:middle line:84%
in ways that are really
impressive, and good that we

00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:57.560 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:01.970 align:middle line:84%
But what happens
with miracle claims,

00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:05.670 align:middle line:84%
miracle claims
invariably are based

00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:08.571 align:middle line:84%
on what's called an
argument from ignorance.

00:34:08.571 --> 00:34:12.860 align:middle line:84%
The miracles are not
from positive evidence.

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:15.590 align:middle line:90%
They're from negative evidence.

00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:18.610 align:middle line:84%
Every miracle claim-- look
at a bunch of them-- weeping

00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:22.449 align:middle line:84%
statues, faith healing,
are all based on, well,

00:34:22.449 --> 00:34:24.370 align:middle line:84%
we don't know how that
could have happened.

00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:27.260 align:middle line:84%
The doctors say they don't know
why Mrs. Smith's cancer went

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:28.300 align:middle line:90%
into remission.

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:30.890 align:middle line:84%
It must be a miracle of
the Holy Virgin Mary.

00:34:30.890 --> 00:34:31.690 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:34.573 align:middle line:84%
When you say we don't know,
or doctors don't know,

00:34:34.573 --> 00:34:36.550 align:middle line:90%
that's where you stop.

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:39.980 align:middle line:84%
You don't say, therefore,
it's a miracle.

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the medical
bureau at Lourdes,

00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:46.920 align:middle line:84%
the famous healing shrine,
said a few years ago

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:49.300 align:middle line:84%
they were going to
quit playing that game.

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:50.949 align:middle line:84%
Because they were
willing to say,

00:34:50.949 --> 00:34:53.454 align:middle line:90%
OK, some cases are remarkable.

00:34:53.454 --> 00:34:54.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something happened.

00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:55.030 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:56.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NICKELL: They would say that.

00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:58.350 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to
use the word "miracle."

00:34:58.350 --> 00:35:00.210 align:middle line:84%
Because what's
happening is the people

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:02.510 align:middle line:84%
who are wanting to
sell you a miracle

00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:04.420 align:middle line:90%
are trying to trump science.

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:06.570 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
say, oh, yeah, sure.

00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:09.650 align:middle line:84%
Mrs. Smith may have had some
chemotherapy treatments,

00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:11.510 align:middle line:84%
but the doctors aren't
sure that was enough.

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:12.801 align:middle line:90%
There had to be something more.

00:35:12.801 --> 00:35:15.950 align:middle line:84%
They're wanting to sell you
something more, a mystery,

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:18.370 align:middle line:84%
and convince you that
there's a supernatural.

00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:19.786 align:middle line:84%
And there are
people who are going

00:35:19.786 --> 00:35:21.980 align:middle line:84%
to be in business to sell
you the supernatural.

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:25.970 align:middle line:84%
So what we have to do is
look for evidence everywhere

00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:31.100 align:middle line:84%
in every area, in
every miracle case.

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:35.050 align:middle line:84%
We have to look at it and
say, what do we really know,

00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:36.360 align:middle line:90%
and where's the evidence?

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And I've just not seen-- I've
seen a lot of miracle hoaxes.

00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:42.810 align:middle line:84%
I've seen a lot of
wishful thinking.

00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:45.760 align:middle line:84%
But I have not seen
anything I thought

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:48.090 align:middle line:90%
it was probably supernatural.

00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:49.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Our friend
Erich von Daniken

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:52.250 align:middle line:84%
wrote the book called
"Chariots of the Gods."

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:55.070 align:middle line:84%
And he is convinced
that we have been

00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:58.750 align:middle line:84%
visited from
extraterrestrials from above.

00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:03.560 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that he uses
as his source to believe this

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:07.810 align:middle line:84%
are the Nazca Lines in Peru,
where only from the air can

00:36:07.810 --> 00:36:11.050 align:middle line:84%
you figure out what the heck
you're looking at-- monkeys,

00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:13.140 align:middle line:90%
spiders, things like that.

00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:15.560 align:middle line:84%
You really can't make it out
when you're walking around

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:17.059 align:middle line:90%
on good old planet Earth.

00:36:17.059 --> 00:36:18.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NICKELL: They are remarkable.

00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:19.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you think of that?

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NICKELL: Those
figures are remarkable.

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And what I resent about von
Daniken is that he, over

00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:26.590 align:middle line:84%
and over, whether it's the
building of the pyramids

00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:29.920 align:middle line:84%
or the stone statues on Easter
Island or what have you,

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:33.670 align:middle line:84%
there's a kind of implied
racism in von Daniken's stuff,

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:36.650 align:middle line:84%
that ancient, nonwhite
people couldn't

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:39.430 align:middle line:84%
have done this because,
well, they're nonwhite.

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:42.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's there,
not expressly stated,

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:45.940 align:middle line:84%
but it's implicit in
all of his writings,

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:49.260 align:middle line:84%
that somehow they needed
higher beings to help them.

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think it demeans
the great accomplishments

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:54.252 align:middle line:84%
of the people who
built these things

00:36:54.252 --> 00:36:55.460 align:middle line:90%
and who created these things.

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think the Nazca lines
are remarkable and were created

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:02.840 align:middle line:84%
by the Nazca people who
flourished in the years

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:07.240 align:middle line:84%
before and after Jesus
over a long period of time.

00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:10.570 align:middle line:84%
What I tried to do, my
little contribution to that,

00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:12.650 align:middle line:84%
was that people were
saying that there

00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:17.240 align:middle line:84%
was no way those ancient peoples
could have made a drawing so

00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:21.080 align:middle line:84%
large that you can only
see it from an airplane

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:23.190 align:middle line:84%
and you can't see what
you're doing on the ground.

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that was
a legitimate point.

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:28.320 align:middle line:84%
Yes, OK, let's see
what could be done.

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And people assured
me, oh, you would

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:33.817 align:middle line:84%
have to have surveying equipment
or modern angle measurements.

00:37:33.817 --> 00:37:34.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't think so.

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:37.747 align:middle line:84%
>>NICKELL: Or you would have
to use something or other.

00:37:37.747 --> 00:37:39.830 align:middle line:84%
Some people thought maybe
they used a grid method.

00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:44.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, I had done a lot of work
as a kid as a sign painter

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:47.480 align:middle line:84%
and had painted billboards
on the sides of buildings

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:50.880 align:middle line:84%
with giant pictures, and I
knew it wasn't done with a grid

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:54.230 align:middle line:84%
system, because a grid system
would minimize errors to

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:55.330 align:middle line:90%
within a square.

00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:59.130 align:middle line:84%
You would not have, for
example, gross asymmetry,

00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:02.300 align:middle line:84%
mismatched wings, for example,
or that kind of thing.

00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:04.430 align:middle line:84%
So I was sure they
didn't do that.

00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:09.110 align:middle line:84%
I simply got a notion that
I could take a small drawing

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:12.930 align:middle line:84%
and mock it up to a big
drawing using a center

00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:14.709 align:middle line:90%
line and some reference points.

00:38:14.709 --> 00:38:16.250 align:middle line:84%
I won't go into
great detail with it,

00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:18.825 align:middle line:84%
but basically plotting
some dots and connecting

00:38:18.825 --> 00:38:22.610 align:middle line:84%
them, a very simple, no
measuring of angles, nothing.

00:38:22.610 --> 00:38:24.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They might have
done it with rope, too.

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:26.031 align:middle line:90%
>>NICKELL: Well, they may have.

00:38:26.031 --> 00:38:29.350 align:middle line:84%
They certainly probably
scribed their circles with rope

00:38:29.350 --> 00:38:32.020 align:middle line:90%
and made spirals using that.

00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:36.800 align:middle line:84%
So I decided that if I
made one, I couldn't get by

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.630 align:middle line:90%
with just making a small one.

00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:40.660 align:middle line:84%
Because I could hear the
people say, oh, yeah,

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:42.420 align:middle line:90%
sure, Nickell made a little one.

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:48.200 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, he could make the giant
condor, which is 440 feet long.

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, OK, I'll
make the giant condor.

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:55.730 align:middle line:84%
I got a landfill area and some
assorted cousins and nephews,

00:38:55.730 --> 00:39:00.650 align:middle line:84%
and we drove a post and
marked off the 440 feet

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:02.310 align:middle line:90%
for the giant condor.

00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:04.040 align:middle line:90%
And I honestly gulped.

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:07.540 align:middle line:84%
As confident as I was, and
I was sure I could do this,

00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:11.040 align:middle line:84%
to see on the ground
how absolutely huge

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:11.957 align:middle line:90%
this was going to be--

00:39:11.957 --> 00:39:12.756 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is big.

00:39:12.756 --> 00:39:14.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NICKELL: --was intimidating.

00:39:14.130 --> 00:39:18.130 align:middle line:84%
But we just proceeded, and in a
couple of days, we had done it,

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:19.465 align:middle line:90%
reproduced the giant condor.

00:39:19.465 --> 00:39:21.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you look
at it from above?

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:23.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NICKELL: We did later
fly over and film it.

00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:24.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did it look like one?

00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:27.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NICKELL: Scientific American
magazine said that my copy was,

00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:31.160 align:middle line:84%
quote-- I memorized
this because I was so

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:35.770 align:middle line:84%
flattered-- "remarkable in its
exactness to the original."

00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:40.000 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we were so
accurate in our method

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.420 align:middle line:84%
that in making a small drawing,
I had made one little error.

00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:47.470 align:middle line:84%
I had a line kind
of askew wrong.

00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:48.970 align:middle line:90%
And we copied that perfectly.

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:51.480 align:middle line:84%
So you could see
that you can actually

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:53.410 align:middle line:84%
pretty faithfully take
your small drawing

00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:55.640 align:middle line:90%
and make a big one.

00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:59.980 align:middle line:84%
I later decided that the
Nazcas probably didn't

00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:01.870 align:middle line:90%
plot as many points as I did.

00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:05.777 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I could do much
more freehand than I had done.

00:40:05.777 --> 00:40:06.985 align:middle line:90%
This is a little more daring.

00:40:06.985 --> 00:40:09.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, but there
is no doubt they made it.

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:12.890 align:middle line:84%
The question is, did they
make it for the gods?

00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NICKELL: Well, this
is the big question.

00:40:15.690 --> 00:40:18.570 align:middle line:84%
But I came out of retirement
to-- "National Geographic"

00:40:18.570 --> 00:40:19.950 align:middle line:90%
wanted me to make one for them.

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:23.040 align:middle line:84%
And I said, but I've done
that, been there, done that.

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:25.149 align:middle line:84%
And they said, yes,
but you didn't film it.

00:40:25.149 --> 00:40:26.440 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, you got me there.

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:27.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This time you did.

00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:28.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NICKELL: So I had to go
make one for them, made

00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:29.810 align:middle line:90%
the giant spider for them.

00:40:29.810 --> 00:40:32.650 align:middle line:84%
And they filmed it
from a cherry picker.

00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:33.780 align:middle line:90%
And it was great.

00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:37.500 align:middle line:84%
But what I've come
to-- at one point,

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:41.580 align:middle line:84%
I noticed that the
Nazca drawings are all

00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:43.310 align:middle line:90%
done with a continuous line.

00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:45.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm not the first to
have noticed this.

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:48.450 align:middle line:84%
But in other words,
on the Nazca pottery,

00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:51.970 align:middle line:84%
they would draw a body or a
wing, lift the brush or pen,

00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:56.164 align:middle line:84%
draw another feature, and it
was not done continuously.

00:40:56.164 --> 00:40:58.330 align:middle line:84%
But on the ground, it's a
whole different situation.

00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:02.660 align:middle line:84%
Once you start, you
make the entire figure

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:06.360 align:middle line:84%
without lifting the
imaginary pencil.

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And I thought when I first
started this, well, that's

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:13.360 align:middle line:84%
just because they're plotting
points like I'm doing,

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:15.030 align:middle line:84%
and they're just
connecting as they go,

00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:18.530 align:middle line:84%
which I think is a perfectly
reasonable hypothesis, just

00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:19.680 align:middle line:90%
completely reasonable.

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:23.780 align:middle line:84%
I think it's wrong, but
it made perfect sense.

00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:28.180 align:middle line:84%
We now know-- and my friend Tony
Aveni from Colgate University

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:30.215 align:middle line:90%
is a great Nazca expert.

00:41:30.215 --> 00:41:31.760 align:middle line:90%
He's done a lot of work on this.

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And he calls these figures
labyrinths in the desert.

00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is
that each of the figures

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:43.560 align:middle line:84%
has a couple of
extraneous lines,

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:47.680 align:middle line:84%
like the monkey has
two lines going up

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:50.120 align:middle line:84%
to the base of the
tail, or the spider

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:53.950 align:middle line:84%
has two lines going off at a
right angle to the bottom leg.

00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And those lines serve
no layout purposes

00:41:56.910 --> 00:42:01.340 align:middle line:84%
or anatomical purposes, nothing,
except that if you combine

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:03.650 align:middle line:84%
that with a
continuous line, what

00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:07.030 align:middle line:84%
you get is you walk
into one of those lines,

00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:09.080 align:middle line:84%
and on the ground--
I've been to Nazca--

00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:11.200 align:middle line:90%
they just look like footpaths.

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.820 align:middle line:84%
They've been made
by clearing gravel

00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:17.120 align:middle line:84%
so that where the line
is, the gravel is removed,

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:20.020 align:middle line:84%
and the rest has still got
the dark gravel on the ground.

00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:22.120 align:middle line:90%
So they look like footpaths.

00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:24.580 align:middle line:84%
If you walk in one of
the extraneous lines,

00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:27.130 align:middle line:84%
you will then continue to
walk the entire figure.

00:42:27.130 --> 00:42:29.160 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of them
have extra lines

00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:30.760 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of winding about.

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:32.510 align:middle line:84%
But you will come back
out the other line.

00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:34.135 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is
remarkable architecture.

00:42:34.135 --> 00:42:36.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NICKELL: And I think
that these are probably,

00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:42.040 align:middle line:84%
and so does Aveni-- we think
they're ritual walking paths,

00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:45.480 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily meant to be
seen by the gods in the sky.

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:47.700 align:middle line:84%
That may not have
been the main motive.

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:51.020 align:middle line:84%
But they were certainly
processional, mystical

00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:54.450 align:middle line:84%
walking paths, perhaps
to gain the power

00:42:54.450 --> 00:43:00.160 align:middle line:84%
of that particular condor or
spider, sort of like a totem.

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:01.980 align:middle line:90%
But we're guessing on that.

00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:05.020 align:middle line:84%
But if I'm sure
of very much, I'm

00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:09.120 align:middle line:84%
pretty sure that those
were ritual walking paths.

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And I think they're
amazing, and I

00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:16.630 align:middle line:84%
think we don't need von Daniken
to take their wonderful work

00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:19.540 align:middle line:84%
away from them and attribute
it to extraterrestrials.

00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:20.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm offended by it.

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:25.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Final question--
is there a God?

00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:28.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NICKELL: We don't know.

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:30.500 align:middle line:84%
I assume there is
not, because there

00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:35.360 align:middle line:84%
is nothing-- there is no
need to postulate a God.

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:41.490 align:middle line:84%
Once you know that evolution
is a reality, you could say,

00:43:41.490 --> 00:43:43.150 align:middle line:84%
well, God created
man, but you have

00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:46.880 align:middle line:84%
to say, yeah, first what he did
was he created the dinosaurs.

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And then He looked down and He
said, oh, my goodness, those

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:53.380 align:middle line:84%
gigantic, lumbering beasts
with the little brains-- what

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:54.650 align:middle line:90%
was I thinking?

00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:57.049 align:middle line:84%
I'll do better next--
I'll create man,

00:43:57.049 --> 00:43:58.590 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not going
to do it like that.

00:43:58.590 --> 00:44:01.772 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have
him evolve slowly.

00:44:01.772 --> 00:44:03.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if that
makes sense to you,

00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:06.120 align:middle line:90%
by all means get out your Bible.

00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:09.020 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't make sense to me.

00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think we need to
postulate a deity in order

00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:15.350 align:middle line:90%
to explain things.

00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:17.540 align:middle line:84%
I think there always
was something.

00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:18.880 align:middle line:90%
There never was nothing.

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:21.890 align:middle line:84%
I think nothingness is
an utter impossibility.

00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:24.380 align:middle line:84%
There never was nothing and
then something came out of it.

00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:25.529 align:middle line:90%
I may be wrong.

00:44:25.529 --> 00:44:27.570 align:middle line:84%
Physicists are divided
over some of these issues.

00:44:27.570 --> 00:44:29.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
it start, though?

00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:31.719 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I would agree with
you that there wasn't nothing.

00:44:31.719 --> 00:44:33.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NICKELL: It didn't start,
is what I'm thinking.

00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:34.230 align:middle line:90%
There always--

00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:35.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We'll never
get the answer.

00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:37.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NICKELL: There
always was something.

00:44:37.310 --> 00:44:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And the Big Bang was
just one more event.

00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:41.940 align:middle line:90%
And before that was--

00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:43.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something blew
up that was already here.

00:44:43.810 --> 00:44:45.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NICKELL: Something
before that and before that

00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:46.500 align:middle line:90%
and before that.

00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:47.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We'll never
get the answer, Joe.

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:49.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NICKELL: Well, maybe
not, but we're certainly--

00:44:49.310 --> 00:44:49.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't think so.

00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:51.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NICKELL: The more
we study our world,

00:44:51.850 --> 00:44:55.940 align:middle line:84%
the more-- for example, if we
had said what you just said,

00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:59.610 align:middle line:84%
we won't ever know, if we had
said that long before Darwin,

00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:02.020 align:middle line:84%
and people did, they
weren't on a track

00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:03.950 align:middle line:90%
to know as much as we know now.

00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:06.660 align:middle line:84%
But Darwin dared to
look for answers.

00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:08.780 align:middle line:90%
And we know so much more now.

00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:11.280 align:middle line:90%
We know that we evolved.

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:14.360 align:middle line:84%
Back to Galileo, we know we're
not the center of the universe.

00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:16.515 align:middle line:90%
We are learning constantly.

00:45:16.515 --> 00:45:18.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We know there are
other planets out there.

00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:21.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NICKELL: Exactly,
and other galaxies.

00:45:21.970 --> 00:45:23.520 align:middle line:90%
And it's wonderful.

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:28.480 align:middle line:84%
But yes, we will
never, ever know

00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:29.860 align:middle line:90%
everything that's out there.

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:33.710 align:middle line:10%
But we are learning much,
much more about ourselves

00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:37.790 align:middle line:10%
and our world, and
science is doing that.

00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:41.647 align:middle line:84%
And I hope to have played a
little, small role in that.

00:45:41.647 --> 00:45:43.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Joe, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief,"

00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:44.780 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:45.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NICKELL: My pleasure.

00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:48.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: OK, so you just
heard it from a skeptic.

00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:53.820 align:middle line:10%
He doesn't believe in
ghosts-- not yet, anyway.

00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:55.020 align:middle line:10%
Not yet.

00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:55.880 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:57.630 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
