00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.460 align:middle line:10%
Our special guest
today is Patrick Wood.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.380 align:middle line:10%
Patrick is an
author, lecturer who

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.570 align:middle line:10%
has studied elite globalization
policies since the late 1970s,

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.220 align:middle line:10%
and to this day
remains a leading

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.790 align:middle line:10%
expert on the elitist trilateral
commission-- their policies,

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.090 align:middle line:10%
their achievements,
and what they do.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.780 align:middle line:90%
Patrick, welcome to the program.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:47.190 align:middle line:90%
>>PATRICK WOOD: Hi, George.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.000 align:middle line:90%
Nice to be here with you.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.917 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long have
you been studying this?

00:00:49.917 --> 00:00:51.060 align:middle line:90%
Truly since the '70s?

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.920 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Truly since
the 1970s, George.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.100 align:middle line:90%
It's been a long trip.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.010 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And I'm not
done with my mission,

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.400 align:middle line:84%
apparently, because
I'm still here

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.330 align:middle line:90%
and I'm still talking about it.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're still
letting you talk about it.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.040 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: They're still letting
me talk about it as well.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
get involved in this?

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.785 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: I ran into a
gentleman-- a professor

00:01:07.785 --> 00:01:10.340 align:middle line:10%
that had just been separated
from the Hoover Institution

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.140 align:middle line:10%
at Stanford.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.900 align:middle line:10%
His name was Antony Sutton.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.730 align:middle line:10%
He was a research fellow.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And he was studying the
Trilateral Commission while

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.690 align:middle line:84%
at Hoover, not realizing that
the president of Stanford

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.560 align:middle line:84%
University was a member of
the Trilateral Commission.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.230 align:middle line:90%
They didn't want him studying--

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.720 align:middle line:84%
especially with the
Hoover Institution--

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.560 align:middle line:90%
this topic.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.570 align:middle line:90%
So they kind of forced him out.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:41.430 align:middle line:84%
And I ran into him at a gold
conference down in Louisiana,

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.060 align:middle line:90%
kind of by chance on one hand--

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.727 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it was
chance, personally.

00:01:44.727 --> 00:01:46.920 align:middle line:84%
But I ran into him
at a restaurant

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.500 align:middle line:84%
at a convention
we were attending.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.540 align:middle line:84%
We struck up a
conversation, realized

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.910 align:middle line:84%
that we were both kind of
looking at the same group.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.430 align:middle line:90%
This was 1977.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And before that
breakfast was done,

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.520 align:middle line:84%
we had shaken hands that
we needed to tell a story,

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.500 align:middle line:90%
that it was that big.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And so we started to
publish a newsletter.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.230 align:middle line:84%
We eventually
published two books--

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.090 align:middle line:90%
"Trilaterals Over Washington."

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And gosh, we spoke on
hundreds of radio programs

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.230 align:middle line:84%
around the country, and
in-person groups, and stuff,

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.500 align:middle line:84%
to try and elevate
the discussion.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.465 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
people believe it?

00:02:21.465 --> 00:02:23.340 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, you know,
pretty much everybody

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.170 align:middle line:84%
that heard us in person believed
our material, because it

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.680 align:middle line:90%
was very factual.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.970 align:middle line:84%
We only took the information
from the Trilateral Commission

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.100 align:middle line:90%
itself and their own people.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.660 align:middle line:84%
We analyzed it and
wrote about that.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.560 align:middle line:84%
But as far as people who
hadn't heard us in person,

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.060 align:middle line:84%
members of the
Trilateral Commission

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.310 align:middle line:84%
did a very good job
of marginalizing us

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.040 align:middle line:84%
as either the far
right or the far left.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or a conspiracy--

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:49.750 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: They didn't
know which we were.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:50.918 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --theorist, right?

00:02:50.918 --> 00:02:52.460 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: But it didn't
matter to them.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.243 align:middle line:84%
It left them always
in the modern middle.

00:02:54.243 --> 00:02:55.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.840 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And we were
always either swept

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.510 align:middle line:84%
off this way or
this way, as being

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.920 align:middle line:90%
irrelevant to the discussion.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, the folks who
are watching this program right

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.820 align:middle line:84%
now have probably heard of
the Trilateral Commission.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.250 align:middle line:84%
But they may not
know what it is.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.900 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.570 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, it was an
elite organization, for sure,

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.780 align:middle line:84%
founded by David Rockefeller
and Zbigniew Brzezinski in 1973.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.680 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: The membership was
drawn from Japan, North America,

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.610 align:middle line:84%
and Europe in roughly
equal numbers.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.150 align:middle line:84%
There were government officials
represented, lots of--

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Scholars.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Law firms, scholars,
multinational corporation

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.730 align:middle line:84%
directors, CEOs, stuff
like that-- very wealthy,

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.470 align:middle line:90%
moneyed people.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.400 align:middle line:84%
Those were kind of the
global merchants of the day.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.550 align:middle line:84%
And there was a few
press people as well,

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.620 align:middle line:84%
like Time Magazine,
Newsweek, and so on,

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.180 align:middle line:90%
that were part of it.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And they came
together, ostensibly,

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.020 align:middle line:84%
to create a new
international economic order.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.730 align:middle line:90%
That was on their literature.

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's ultimately
what piqued my interest.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.360 align:middle line:84%
We wrote a lot about
that back then.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.468 align:middle line:84%
What was the new
international economic order?

00:04:09.468 --> 00:04:10.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And what was the goal?

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.860 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: What was the goal of it?

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.810 align:middle line:84%
Sutton and I didn't
really get it back then,

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.529 align:middle line:84%
because we not understand
historic technocracy.

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:21.410 align:middle line:84%
Had we understood
it and studied it,

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure we would have put the
dots together at that point.

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.670 align:middle line:84%
But I really didn't discover
historic technocracy

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:33.620 align:middle line:84%
until after Professor
Sutton passed in 2002--

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.400 align:middle line:90%
and picked up the trail again.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.890 align:middle line:84%
OK, this is how-- this is what
they had in mind back then.

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:45.020 align:middle line:84%
But both Brzezinski
and Rockefeller

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.940 align:middle line:84%
were kind of the cream of the
crop, the Beauty and the Beast.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.398 align:middle line:84%
Brzezinski was the brains,
and Rockefeller had the money.

00:04:53.398 --> 00:04:55.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was the Carter
administration, right?

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.240 align:middle line:90%
At the time.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.390 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: He was very instrumental
throughout the Carter

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.070 align:middle line:90%
administration.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:08.970 align:middle line:84%
But during that administration,
Carter inducted almost a third

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.350 align:middle line:84%
of the US membership of
the Trilateral Commission

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.183 align:middle line:90%
into his cabinet at one time.

00:05:15.183 --> 00:05:17.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Based on
Brzezinski's recommendation.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Based on Brzezinski's
recommendation, exactly.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.120 align:middle line:84%
Brzezinski was the first
appointee, by the way.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.870 align:middle line:84%
And both Carter and Mondale
were members of the commission

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.440 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.860 align:middle line:84%
But Brzezinski was
the first appointee

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.068 align:middle line:90%
to national security advisor.

00:05:32.068 --> 00:05:33.693 align:middle line:84%
He was the gatekeeper
to the president.

00:05:33.693 --> 00:05:34.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was, exactly.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.040 align:middle line:90%
Now, what is technocracy?

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:44.120 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Technocracy was an
economic system developed

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.710 align:middle line:84%
in the 1930s by a group of
scientists and engineers

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.690 align:middle line:90%
at Columbia University.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.540 align:middle line:84%
There was talk about
technocracy during the '20s,

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:58.040 align:middle line:84%
but it kind of formally
got together officially,

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.052 align:middle line:84%
if you will, in 1932
at Columbia University.

00:06:01.052 --> 00:06:02.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it's been
around a long time.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.730 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: It was a long time ago.

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:06.710 align:middle line:84%
That was during the
Great Depression.

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.410 align:middle line:84%
Everybody thought
capitalism was dead.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And the scientists and
engineers at Columbia

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.830 align:middle line:84%
felt like it was up to
them to save the world.

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:22.980 align:middle line:84%
So they modeled an economic
system, from the ground up,

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:27.100 align:middle line:84%
to be a resource-based economic
system, controlled by energy.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
understand, this had never

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:30.910 align:middle line:84%
been attempted in the
history of the world.

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:34.652 align:middle line:84%
There had never been an economic
system developed from scratch.

00:06:34.652 --> 00:06:35.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For the world.

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.290 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: For the world.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:38.940 align:middle line:90%
But they did.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And it fizzled, I have to
say, by the end of the--

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:43.800 align:middle line:84%
certainly by the
mid-'40s, it fizzled.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.850 align:middle line:84%
World War II is well underway,
and capitalism revived.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now was the Federal
Reserve part of any of this?

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.030 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Oh, it was all there
during that period of time,

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:57.270 align:middle line:84%
still running the
capital system.

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.100 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
reasons, I suppose,

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:03.270 align:middle line:84%
that technocracy didn't quite
make it as far as they hoped.

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.070 align:middle line:90%
But it didn't.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:06.390 align:middle line:90%
That was a good thing.

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:09.450 align:middle line:84%
It went underground
for a period of time

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:14.490 align:middle line:84%
during the '40 and the '50s,
and even into the '60s.

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.430 align:middle line:10%
But when Brzezinski
wrote his seminal book,

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:18.840 align:middle line:10%
called, "Between Two Ages--

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.050 align:middle line:10%
America's Role in the
Technotronic Era,"

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:26.820 align:middle line:10%
Brzezinski was a professor
at Columbia University.

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:27.850 align:middle line:90%
Is that a coincidence?

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:29.160 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.363 align:middle line:84%
But the halls of academia
talk about stuff.

00:07:33.363 --> 00:07:35.280 align:middle line:84%
They talk about the
history of the university,

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.150 align:middle line:90%
and what happened, and so on.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.320 align:middle line:84%
So there's no doubt in
my mind that Brzezinski

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.260 align:middle line:84%
had an awareness of exactly
what technocracy was.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's take
a look at technocracy.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.530 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: You bet.

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:49.970 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR:
Technocracy advocates

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.670 align:middle line:10%
argue the democratic
system is unprofessional,

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:56.460 align:middle line:10%
overly politicized,
corrupt and ineffective.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:59.090 align:middle line:10%
A society managed by
scientists and engineers

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:01.880 align:middle line:10%
would be more rational
and productive.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.220 align:middle line:10%
Singaporeans handed
rule of their society

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.740 align:middle line:10%
to a one-party
technocracy, and it's

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:10.130 align:middle line:10%
an economic powerhouse with
the second-busiest port

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:14.510 align:middle line:10%
and the third-highest per
capita income in the world.

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:16.310 align:middle line:10%
Ukraine's outgoing
economy minister

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:19.940 align:middle line:10%
called technocracy "the only
hope for lasting change,"

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.870 align:middle line:10%
two years after the
2014 revolution,

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.972 align:middle line:10%
when people were growing tired
of the slow pace of reform.

00:08:25.972 --> 00:08:27.680 align:middle line:10%
>>AIVARAS ABROMAVICIUS:
I think we really

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.320 align:middle line:10%
need to use this
opportunity to bring

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:35.659 align:middle line:10%
in a completely different set
of people with a completely

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:37.265 align:middle line:10%
different mindset.

00:08:37.265 --> 00:08:40.130 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: In 2011,
both Rome and Athens

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:42.110 align:middle line:10%
installed prime
ministers with expertise

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:45.800 align:middle line:10%
in economics and finance to
drive through tough austerity

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.090 align:middle line:10%
measures.

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:49.460 align:middle line:10%
Technocracy does
have its proponents.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.150 align:middle line:10%
Pew Research shows
that while there's

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:53.960 align:middle line:10%
a global preference for
representative democracy,

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.090 align:middle line:10%
the next-best option
is a system where

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:59.300 align:middle line:10%
experts, not elected
politicians, call the shots.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.460 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:03.260 align:middle line:10%
Praised as the
answer to populism

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.930 align:middle line:10%
and political bickering,
more often than not,

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:09.020 align:middle line:10%
technocracies are
temporary solutions.

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:12.480 align:middle line:10%
Their skills complement whatever
crisis a nation is facing.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.100 align:middle line:10%
Or they act as a caretaker
until the next election.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:19.940 align:middle line:10%
But with democracy under
attack, can unelected experts

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:22.167 align:middle line:10%
rescue a faltering system?

00:09:22.167 --> 00:09:23.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Patrick,
this kind of reminds

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:25.370 align:middle line:90%
me of a New World Order.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:27.430 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, you
could call it that.

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:32.400 align:middle line:84%
It's been called that, in
fact, now, for 45 years.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.160 align:middle line:84%
The Trilateral
Commission started off

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.010 align:middle line:84%
by calling it the New
International Economic Order.

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:40.400 align:middle line:84%
In 1992, George HW
Bush-- who, by the way,

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.340 align:middle line:84%
was a member of the Trilateral
Commission, go figure--

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:47.218 align:middle line:84%
famously said, "the
New World Order."

00:09:47.218 --> 00:09:49.760 align:middle line:84%
That was the first time a member
of the Trilateral Commission

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:55.130 align:middle line:84%
had deviated from "New
International Economic Order."

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:58.160 align:middle line:84%
But ever since then, people
have referred to the New World

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.210 align:middle line:90%
Order.

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:03.320 align:middle line:84%
The idea is that the New
World Order is not just

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.380 align:middle line:84%
some kind of a new
political scheme,

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:08.930 align:middle line:84%
it's a new economic
system that they're

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:12.110 align:middle line:84%
trying to foist upon the
world that's not natural.

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:13.460 align:middle line:90%
It's not a natural thing at all.

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:16.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With the US dollar
being the staple of currency.

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:17.760 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, the
US dollar has been.

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:21.170 align:middle line:84%
But as we'll perhaps
cover a little bit later,

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:26.210 align:middle line:84%
the whole idea of
financing this new system,

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:29.030 align:middle line:84%
probably, financial
technology is

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:31.020 align:middle line:84%
going to have a big
part to play in that.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:31.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure will.

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:34.760 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And that means things
like blockchain currencies,

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:39.240 align:middle line:84%
blockchain technology, other
advanced forms of payment

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.040 align:middle line:90%
systems and so on.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And blockchain's having
a difficult time right now.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.060 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: That's right.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Patrick, what's going
to change with our 401(k)s?

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.470 align:middle line:90%
What will happen to them?

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:52.460 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: If technocracy
wins, private property

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:55.150 align:middle line:90%
is going to be out the window.

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:58.240 align:middle line:84%
That means, your
personal wealth--

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --gone.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.340 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: --gone.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:03.070 align:middle line:84%
The property that you
may own and title--

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:03.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --gone.

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:06.040 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: --the rights
have been taken away,

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.900 align:middle line:90%
where basically it's gone.

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:11.200 align:middle line:84%
Your right to save and
accumulate money in order

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.990 align:middle line:84%
to pass on to your
children and grandchildren,

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:17.880 align:middle line:90%
there'll be no inheritance.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:21.960 align:middle line:84%
Basically, each generation will
be kept by itself, if you will,

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:22.770 align:middle line:90%
cradle to cradle.

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:24.312 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What a
horrible way to live.

00:11:24.312 --> 00:11:25.740 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Not a good way to live.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:30.540 align:middle line:84%
This is certainly not the way
that America has been developed

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:34.620 align:middle line:84%
over the last 250 years, where
we value private property,

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:37.260 align:middle line:84%
and the ability
to create savings,

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.800 align:middle line:84%
and the ability to create an
inheritance for our children.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.000 align:middle line:84%
It's inconceivable that
any group of people

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.260 align:middle line:84%
would consciously work to
destroy private property

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:52.670 align:middle line:84%
in America that would deny
us all of those benefits

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:53.480 align:middle line:90%
and abilities.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And get away with it.

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:56.210 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: And get away with it.

00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:58.473 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: George Soros--
is he part of this group?

00:11:58.473 --> 00:12:00.890 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: He was never a member
of the Trilateral Commission

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:03.050 align:middle line:90%
directly.

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:06.455 align:middle line:84%
Many of his policies have
played into the policyies.

00:12:06.455 --> 00:12:08.185 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They seem to
be like his policy.

00:12:08.185 --> 00:12:09.060 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: That's right.

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.210 align:middle line:84%
But we could have said
that of a lot of people.

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:15.200 align:middle line:84%
Maurice Strong, for instance,
the famous or infamous Canadian

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.960 align:middle line:84%
that was very prominent
in the United Nations--

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.300 align:middle line:84%
a billionaire, but
he was very prominent

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:24.440 align:middle line:84%
with the 1992 Earth
Summit, for instance,

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.490 align:middle line:90%
that met in Rio de Janeiro.

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:30.200 align:middle line:84%
Maurice Strong was not a member
of the Trilateral Commission.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.060 align:middle line:90%
Did he play into the policies?

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:33.020 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely, positively.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if they were
like the puppet masters, where

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:38.390 align:middle line:84%
maybe they were
controlling the strings?

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:41.540 align:middle line:84%
They weren't part of the
Trilateral Commission directly,

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.520 align:middle line:84%
but they're up there
with the strings.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:46.880 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: They're certainly
all on the same train track.

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:50.060 align:middle line:90%
We can say that for sure.

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:53.540 align:middle line:84%
I've tried to think through
the idea of a puppet master,

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:54.920 align:middle line:84%
where somebody is
kind of pulling

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.120 align:middle line:90%
all the strings individually.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.710 align:middle line:84%
This is way bigger than
that, I think, George.

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:04.370 align:middle line:84%
It's been set in motion with
a philosophy behind it--

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:07.190 align:middle line:84%
a religious proposition,
almost, if you will--

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:10.340 align:middle line:84%
where this is the
standard that's set,

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:13.310 align:middle line:84%
this is the channel
that you operate within.

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:15.470 align:middle line:84%
Step out of it, we're
going to hammer you.

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:16.282 align:middle line:90%
Stay within it--

00:13:16.282 --> 00:13:17.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --you're fine.

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.110 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: --everything's
going to be good.

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:19.193 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And leaders, too.

00:13:19.193 --> 00:13:20.068 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: That's right.

00:13:20.068 --> 00:13:22.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then you have
someone like Saddam Hussein,

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.960 align:middle line:90%
who steps out of it.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:24.770 align:middle line:90%
Look what happens.

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:26.335 align:middle line:90%
Gaddafi steps out of it.

00:13:26.335 --> 00:13:27.210 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: That's right.

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:29.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know, Gaddafi was
not a Boy Scout by any means,

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:31.500 align:middle line:84%
but he did change
toward the end.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:32.300 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yes.

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:33.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And out he went.

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:34.250 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yes.

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:35.375 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's their goal?

00:13:35.375 --> 00:13:36.290 align:middle line:90%
What do they want?

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:38.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: As far as I
can tell, honestly,

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.640 align:middle line:84%
I've study this
back for a long way,

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:44.090 align:middle line:84%
even before I knew
about technocracy.

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:47.970 align:middle line:84%
The idea that the Trilateral
Commission first started with,

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:50.990 align:middle line:84%
which is fully in sync
with technocracy today,

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:54.980 align:middle line:84%
is to capture the
resources of the world,

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:56.990 align:middle line:84%
take them out of
yours and my hand,

00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:59.300 align:middle line:84%
and put them into a
global common trust,

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:03.200 align:middle line:84%
so that they can draw
from it themselves,

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:07.190 align:middle line:84%
but exclude-- for
themselves-- but exclude us

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:10.263 align:middle line:84%
from having any drawing rights,
if you will, to that property.

00:14:10.263 --> 00:14:11.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
would give us whatever

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:13.093 align:middle line:90%
they wanted, like crumbs.

00:14:13.093 --> 00:14:14.260 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: That's basically it.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.250 align:middle line:84%
It kind of looks a
little bit like feudalism

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:20.340 align:middle line:84%
from the dark ages, and I think
it would be as ugly as that.

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:21.770 align:middle line:90%
But here's the thing.

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:24.560 align:middle line:84%
Property rights, for
instance, with Agenda 21,

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:27.260 align:middle line:84%
starting out with the
Earth Summit in 1992,

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.530 align:middle line:84%
property rights have
been under massive attack

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:34.310 align:middle line:84%
around the world, and
especially in the United States.

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:37.420 align:middle line:84%
They wrote, plainly, in
the Agenda 21 document--

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:39.920 align:middle line:84%
that was the United Nations
that produced that-- sustainable

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:43.640 align:middle line:84%
development, that
private property

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:46.850 align:middle line:84%
was a concept that
needed to go away,

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:51.980 align:middle line:84%
that nobody needed or deserved
to own private property.

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what's
made America great.

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:55.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And emerging countries that have
duplicated what we're doing.

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:00.200 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Exactly right.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.760 align:middle line:90%
The war here is not political.

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.080 align:middle line:90%
It's economic.

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:06.730 align:middle line:84%
When you strip away the right
of people to own property,

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:07.730 align:middle line:90%
what are they left with?

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:10.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isn't that
a communistic state?

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.250 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: It's worse than
communism, in my opinion.

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:15.200 align:middle line:90%
It's been mislabeled communism.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:19.640 align:middle line:84%
Let's say both systems
are collectivist,

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.800 align:middle line:84%
in the sense that
nobody's really

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.300 align:middle line:84%
going to have any
say, individually,

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.467 align:middle line:90%
in what they're going to do.

00:15:24.467 --> 00:15:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yet these globalists
will own all kinds of property,

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:27.380 align:middle line:90%
won't they?

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:28.255 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: That's right.

00:15:28.255 --> 00:15:33.202 align:middle line:84%
They will own and control the
major resources of the world.

00:15:33.202 --> 00:15:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And we see this in
America, for instance.

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:37.100 align:middle line:84%
People say, well, how does
that apply in America?

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:40.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, 36%, right now,
of American landmass

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.985 align:middle line:90%
is owned by the government.

00:15:41.985 --> 00:15:42.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:43.820 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: That's huge.

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:45.737 align:middle line:84%
Why do they need to own
that kind of property?

00:15:45.737 --> 00:15:48.110 align:middle line:84%
The constitution
does not allow that.

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:49.370 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't permit it at all.

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:50.840 align:middle line:90%
But they own it.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, in the
West, it's even worse

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:55.410 align:middle line:90%
than it is in the East.

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And you look at a map of
Nevada, it's almost all red,

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.450 align:middle line:84%
where it's owned by
the federal government.

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:02.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if you go and
protest, you get arrested.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:03.260 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: That's right.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:04.717 align:middle line:90%
You can get arrested real quick.

00:16:04.717 --> 00:16:06.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's their game plan?

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:08.090 align:middle line:90%
What do they really want here?

00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:10.280 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: The resources
of the world, as I said.

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:14.090 align:middle line:84%
The way to get to it,
short of using force--

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:17.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which they
would if they had to.

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:19.470 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Bringing in the
tanks, and stuff like that.

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:20.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Get rid of guns.

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:22.625 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And the guns,
and that kind of stuff.

00:16:22.625 --> 00:16:25.610 align:middle line:84%
Short of that, it's
basically tricking nations

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:27.828 align:middle line:84%
into giving up their
resources voluntarily.

00:16:27.828 --> 00:16:29.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you call
the Trilateral Commission

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:32.900 align:middle line:84%
almost like a corporation,
in that these members are

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:34.520 align:middle line:90%
a board of directors?

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, David
Rockefeller himself

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:40.970 align:middle line:84%
called it a cabal in his
book, "Memoirs," his memoirs,

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:42.660 align:middle line:90%
his autobiography.

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:44.560 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's a good term.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:46.310 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't call a
corporation in the sense

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:50.810 align:middle line:84%
that it had an organization
chart, a balance sheet, stuff

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:51.820 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:52.620 align:middle line:90%
But it was a cabal.

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:54.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wait, is there
a chairman of the board?

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, you know,
the executive director

00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:59.120 align:middle line:84%
for many years was
Zbigniew Brzezinski.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.420 align:middle line:84%
And they've had
others since then.

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:03.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But he marched
to their tune, didn't he?

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:04.540 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Definitely.

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:07.609 align:middle line:84%
Well, he was instrumental in
forming the whole philosophy

00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:08.900 align:middle line:90%
from day one.

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:11.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Richard Gardner wrote
a book called "The Hard Road

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:14.270 align:middle line:90%
to the World Order."

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:16.010 align:middle line:90%
Was he right?

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:17.210 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: He was right.

00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:19.422 align:middle line:84%
Richard Gardner was an
original founding member

00:17:19.422 --> 00:17:20.630 align:middle line:90%
of the Trilateral Commission.

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:22.097 align:middle line:90%
He's a professor--

00:17:22.097 --> 00:17:23.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well-intentioned?

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:24.300 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: --of political science.

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:25.130 align:middle line:84%
I don't think he was
well-intentioned.

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:26.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: But he
came off that way.

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:29.270 align:middle line:90%
He came off being genteel.

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:30.395 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He tricked people.

00:17:30.395 --> 00:17:32.060 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: But he
wrote this article,

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:33.770 align:middle line:84%
called, "The Hard
Road to World Order,"

00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:35.630 align:middle line:84%
for Foreign Affairs
magazine, which

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:40.850 align:middle line:84%
was the official magazine of the
Council on Foreign Relations.

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote in this that the
old-fashioned frontal assault

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:51.550 align:middle line:84%
was just not effective on
changing the system of things.

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:53.170 align:middle line:84%
And there had been
frontal assaults

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:58.060 align:middle line:84%
during the '40s, '50s,
and '60s, that had failed,

00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:03.285 align:middle line:84%
where the global elite flat-out
came short, they were rejected,

00:18:03.285 --> 00:18:04.660 align:middle line:84%
and they had to
start over again,

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:05.480 align:middle line:90%
back to the drawing board.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:06.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
hated it, didn't they?

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:08.350 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Yeah, they
didn't like that.

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:12.460 align:middle line:84%
But when they finally woke
up and smell the coffee, what

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:16.810 align:middle line:84%
Gardner concluded was,
we need to do an end run

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:18.670 align:middle line:84%
around national
sovereignty rather than

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:20.500 align:middle line:90%
trying to confront it head-on.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:25.600 align:middle line:84%
The end-run would chip
away, little by little,

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:29.500 align:middle line:84%
over a period of time, to
degrade national sovereignty

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:32.320 align:middle line:84%
to the point where it would
just disappear, just dissolve

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.180 align:middle line:90%
into the ether, if you will.

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what happened.

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:38.675 align:middle line:90%
It's been death by 1,000 cuts.

00:18:38.675 --> 00:18:39.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:42.100 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And we've had so
many of these little things

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:44.260 align:middle line:84%
over the years
that have happened,

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.990 align:middle line:84%
that have just chiseled,
chiseled, chiseled away

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:49.030 align:middle line:90%
at national sovereignty.

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:53.860 align:middle line:84%
America does not look at
all like a 1970s America.

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:54.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not at all.

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:55.540 align:middle line:90%
And it's still changing.

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:57.540 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Did we have a
Constitutional Convention?

00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:58.930 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:01.570 align:middle line:84%
Did we have a brand
new political system?

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:03.420 align:middle line:90%
Not really.

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:06.330 align:middle line:84%
But it's changed,
and this is why.

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:09.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How realistic is
the application of control

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:14.970 align:middle line:84%
by taking control of resources
and things like that?

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:17.320 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: In my opinion, at
this point, the surprise--

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.900 align:middle line:90%
if there is a surprise--

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:25.450 align:middle line:84%
the element of control
is not direct control

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:29.660 align:middle line:84%
of people controlling
people, people over people.

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:34.520 align:middle line:84%
Technology has grown
up now around society

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:37.250 align:middle line:84%
to where society is
being controlled now

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:39.620 align:middle line:84%
by the technology
that's being used

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:43.700 align:middle line:84%
by these people, via artificial
intelligence, via algorithms,

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:48.830 align:middle line:84%
if you will, to make
decisions for you that you

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:51.120 align:middle line:90%
can't get loose from.

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:57.860 align:middle line:84%
And this whole idea, the idea
of globalization being a system,

00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:59.390 align:middle line:84%
is really the thing
that we should

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:00.830 align:middle line:90%
be focusing on right now.

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:02.370 align:middle line:90%
It is the system.

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:06.950 align:middle line:84%
It's not that there is a person
that's pulling the string,

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:12.200 align:middle line:84%
but the system that's being
built is globalization itself.

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Patrick, where
does China, for example,

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:16.790 align:middle line:90%
fit into the scheme of things?

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:21.390 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: China is a classic
example of technocracy.

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:22.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To itself.

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:23.030 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: To itself.

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:28.500 align:middle line:84%
China was brought back into the
global village, if you will,

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.490 align:middle line:90%
by Zbigniew Brzezinski.

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:32.140 align:middle line:84%
You can go back and
read the documents.

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:32.940 align:middle line:90%
It's very clear.

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:36.082 align:middle line:84%
Brzezinski was the point man
that brought China back in.

00:20:36.082 --> 00:20:37.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was Kissinger
part of that plan?

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:40.190 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Kissinger was a
little bit before that.

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:42.410 align:middle line:90%
He was instrumental.

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:44.745 align:middle line:84%
And Kissinger was a member
of the commission as well,

00:20:44.745 --> 00:20:46.100 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:48.500 align:middle line:84%
But Brzezinski was the
guy who single-handedly,

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.290 align:middle line:84%
almost, negotiated
to bring China back

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:53.780 align:middle line:90%
into the international fold.

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:57.890 align:middle line:84%
As he did that, the
initial investments,

00:20:57.890 --> 00:20:59.630 align:middle line:84%
the initial companies
that went to China

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:02.090 align:middle line:84%
to build infrastructure
for them,

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:04.400 align:middle line:84%
were all members, connected
one way or another,

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:06.320 align:middle line:90%
to the Trilateral Commission.

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:09.600 align:middle line:84%
It was their global companies
that went over there.

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:13.610 align:middle line:84%
It was their global consultants
that went over there and taught

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:17.360 align:middle line:90%
the Chinese how to do it.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.183 align:middle line:84%
Case in point,
Bechdel Engineering,

00:21:19.183 --> 00:21:20.600 align:middle line:84%
a private engineering
company, one

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:23.540 align:middle line:84%
of the biggest in the world,
based in San Francisco.

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:25.940 align:middle line:84%
When it was illegal to
do business in China

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:27.050 align:middle line:90%
for American companies--

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:29.160 align:middle line:90%
I mean illegal--

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:34.840 align:middle line:84%
Bechdel had already conducted
18 major infrastructure programs

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:35.640 align:middle line:90%
in China.

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:38.100 align:middle line:90%
How do they get away with that?

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:39.300 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: They skated.

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:41.462 align:middle line:84%
The chairman of
Bechdel was a member

00:21:41.462 --> 00:21:42.670 align:middle line:90%
of the Trilateral Commission.

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:43.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:44.460 align:middle line:90%
So they gave him the deal.

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:45.930 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: They gave him the deal.

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And he got deals
like that before it

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:49.500 align:middle line:90%
was even legal to have deals.

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Weren't they
also huge in Saudi Arabia?

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:53.190 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: They were, absolutely.

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:54.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lots of money
there with the King.

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:56.912 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: But here you have,
you say, well, how did China

00:21:56.912 --> 00:21:58.360 align:middle line:90%
become a technocracy?

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:01.770 align:middle line:84%
Did somehow they get a kick
start from the Trilateral

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:05.380 align:middle line:84%
crowd, and then they went
off on their own and said,

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:08.940 align:middle line:84%
oh, we have some new
ideas here, we'll do this.

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:10.830 align:middle line:84%
That's not the way
the world works.

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:14.830 align:middle line:84%
When companies put billions
of dollars into you,

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:16.750 align:middle line:90%
they expect results.

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:19.840 align:middle line:84%
They expect you to do
things their way, right?

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:24.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is our military
working for us or the Trilateral

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:25.120 align:middle line:90%
Commission?

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:26.440 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: That's been
questionable, George,

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:27.640 align:middle line:90%
for a very long time.

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:28.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:31.000 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: The neocon
establishment, you

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.140 align:middle line:84%
can trace it back well
into World War I, even.

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:38.380 align:middle line:84%
The people that have
promoted war and--

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:40.900 align:middle line:84%
because war is
profitable business.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:44.980 align:middle line:84%
And things get destroyed in
war that needs to be rebuilt.

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:47.770 align:middle line:90%
There's lots of money in war.

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't say automatically
that the Trilateral Commission

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:54.460 align:middle line:84%
is controlling the wars
in the current age.

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:59.080 align:middle line:84%
Although Robert
McNamara, for instance,

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:02.050 align:middle line:84%
who prosecuted the
Vietnam War, who was also

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:08.020 align:middle line:84%
called a technocrat of
the Ford whiz kids, right?

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:09.820 align:middle line:84%
McNamara was a member
an early member

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:11.028 align:middle line:90%
of the Trilateral Commission.

00:23:11.028 --> 00:23:12.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How about Dick Cheney?

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:13.290 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Absolutely.

00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:14.710 align:middle line:90%
He was a member.

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:15.670 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:17.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a club.

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:19.330 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: It's a
club beyond a club.

00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:21.160 align:middle line:90%
It's a club with a mission.

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:27.310 align:middle line:84%
As I said, Rockefeller
himself called it a cabal.

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And he said, if that's
the charge against me,

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:31.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm proud of it.

00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:32.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Then so be it.

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:33.880 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: So be it.

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:35.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are global cities?

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:37.870 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: A global
city is one that

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:42.280 align:middle line:84%
has global trading
status with other cities,

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.650 align:middle line:84%
other global cities
around the world.

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:46.900 align:middle line:84%
These are typically
the largest cities

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:51.550 align:middle line:84%
that we have, like
Tokyo, like London,

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:56.800 align:middle line:84%
like New York City, Los Angeles,
Seattle, and so on, Paris.

00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:00.262 align:middle line:84%
These are the
first-tier cities that

00:24:00.262 --> 00:24:02.470 align:middle line:84%
have created an infrastructure
where they're not only

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:06.670 align:middle line:84%
connected together, but at
multiple layers together.

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:09.490 align:middle line:84%
You have multiple industries
within those cities

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:11.140 align:middle line:84%
that are connecting
with each other

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:12.822 align:middle line:90%
and these other global cities.

00:24:12.822 --> 00:24:14.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take
another look at that.

00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:19.570 align:middle line:90%


00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:24.790 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: I am alive,
vibrant with possibility,

00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:27.610 align:middle line:10%
a magnet for young
creative talent,

00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:29.890 align:middle line:10%
the engine for a
knowledge economy.

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:31.960 align:middle line:10%
A river runs through me.

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:35.170 align:middle line:10%
There are many tributaries
to my capital flows.

00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:39.350 align:middle line:10%
I am an urban regenerator,
a startup incubator,

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:42.730 align:middle line:10%
a creator of new
opportunities, the catalyst

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:48.800 align:middle line:10%
for technological innovation, a
laboratory for creative ideas.

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.920 align:middle line:10%
I am ever-evolving,
fusing the ancient

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:56.200 align:middle line:10%
with the modern, transforming
digital infrastructure,

00:24:56.200 --> 00:25:00.160 align:middle line:10%
my social networks as
diverse as my population.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:04.225 align:middle line:10%
I am a host to opportunity,
a home to establishment,

00:25:04.225 --> 00:25:09.711 align:middle line:10%
a seat of academic learning,
a cultural hub, a tech city,

00:25:09.711 --> 00:25:14.820 align:middle line:10%
a de-zoned mixed-use melting
pot of people and ideas.

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:20.396 align:middle line:10%
I am a future, a millennial
possibility, a corporate HQ,

00:25:20.396 --> 00:25:24.364 align:middle line:10%
a growing business idea,
an Olympic destination,

00:25:24.364 --> 00:25:27.836 align:middle line:10%
an investment opportunity.

00:25:27.836 --> 00:25:32.070 align:middle line:10%
I am a global city.

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:36.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It sounds great, but--

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:37.080 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah, but.

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there's a big
but there, isn't there?

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.650 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, there
is a big but to this.

00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:43.740 align:middle line:84%
The core idea that's kind
of swimming underneath all

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:49.590 align:middle line:84%
of our preconceived ideas of
nationalism, the global elite

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:52.033 align:middle line:84%
believes that
nationalism is bad.

00:25:52.033 --> 00:25:52.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They hate it.

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:54.155 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: They don't like it.

00:25:54.155 --> 00:25:56.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Even though they reside
in this country, most of them.

00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:57.860 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well even though
they reside-- they

00:25:57.860 --> 00:25:58.890 align:middle line:90%
have to reside in some country.

00:25:58.890 --> 00:25:59.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:00.360 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Maybe it's Europe.

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.560 align:middle line:84%
But same thing over there,
they don't like the concept

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:03.393 align:middle line:90%
of the nation state.

00:26:03.393 --> 00:26:04.590 align:middle line:90%
Let me tell you why.

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:07.290 align:middle line:84%
You need to kind of think
down into their head.

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:12.270 align:middle line:84%
The business people, the
corporate masters, if you will,

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:16.710 align:middle line:84%
are seeking to create a perfect
supply chain around the world

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:18.990 align:middle line:90%
for them to conduct business.

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:22.230 align:middle line:84%
Supply chain is a concept that's
kind of matured in the last 25

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:23.400 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:26.070 align:middle line:10%
It's like gluing everything
together so that everything

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:27.720 align:middle line:10%
fits just perfect.

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:30.660 align:middle line:84%
When you are making a
car, you want that wheel

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:34.140 align:middle line:84%
to show up at your factory five
minutes before the installer

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:35.775 align:middle line:90%
puts it in, roll it right in--

00:26:35.775 --> 00:26:36.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Without any delay.

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:37.775 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: For anything.

00:26:37.775 --> 00:26:42.840 align:middle line:84%
So no delay, no inventory, no
warehouses, just get it there.

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:47.320 align:middle line:84%
The supply chain is the
mantra behind everything here.

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Everything's designed now
to go for the supply chain.

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:53.970 align:middle line:84%
National governments
stand in the way

00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:56.910 align:middle line:84%
of corporations doing
what they want to do

00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:58.740 align:middle line:90%
to create the supply chain.

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:01.500 align:middle line:84%
The nation state is
opposed, if you will.

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:03.180 align:middle line:84%
They want to
regulate everything.

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:06.570 align:middle line:84%
They want to get their
fingers into everything.

00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:09.030 align:middle line:84%
That's unacceptable
to the global elite.

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:10.050 align:middle line:90%
Answer?

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:14.340 align:middle line:84%
Do away with the concept of
the nation state, at least

00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:16.650 align:middle line:90%
effectively, for regulation.

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:19.680 align:middle line:84%
Turn it all back over
to the corporations,

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:22.830 align:middle line:84%
turn it back over to the
cities, turn the cities

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:25.590 align:middle line:84%
into smart cities, if you
will, where they're all

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:30.750 align:middle line:84%
controlled by sensors, by
algorithm, whatever and hook

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:34.890 align:middle line:84%
the cities together in order
to form the perfect supply

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:36.185 align:middle line:90%
chain between the cities.

00:27:36.185 --> 00:27:37.310 align:middle line:90%
Because that's where they--

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:38.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Worldwide.

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:38.980 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Worldwide.

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:41.340 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
business takes place--

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:47.850 align:middle line:84%
Paris, London, New
York, Hong Kong, Tokyo.

00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:50.210 align:middle line:84%
All these cities,
these global cities,

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:54.450 align:middle line:84%
is where the business
takes place in the world.

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:57.990 align:middle line:84%
So connecting them
together directly,

00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:02.152 align:middle line:84%
getting rid of all the federal
regulation along the way,

00:28:02.152 --> 00:28:04.110 align:middle line:84%
has been a goal since
the Trilateral Commission

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:04.560 align:middle line:90%
was formed.

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:06.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How close are
they getting to that goal?

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:07.530 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: They're very close.

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:09.480 align:middle line:84%
At this point, there's
nothing to stop them

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.400 align:middle line:84%
except for the
people themselves.

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say, anybody who's
been watching the news recently

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:20.460 align:middle line:84%
has seen the rather massive
riots taking place in Europe

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:23.190 align:middle line:90%
with the so-called yellow vests.

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:27.153 align:middle line:84%
The protests started
against carbon tax.

00:28:27.153 --> 00:28:28.570 align:middle line:84%
And the people
said, we've had it.

00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:29.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Enough is enough.

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:30.510 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: We've had
it with you people.

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:33.120 align:middle line:84%
Enough is enough, and you're
not going to get away with it.

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:36.300 align:middle line:84%
We've see this spreading to
other countries in Europe.

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:38.640 align:middle line:84%
We saw it a little
bit in Brexit.

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:41.190 align:middle line:84%
We saw a little bit in
the language and rhetoric

00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:43.980 align:middle line:84%
of our current administration,
with President Trump.

00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:47.015 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will the people
win in the long run?

00:28:47.015 --> 00:28:48.060 align:middle line:90%
It's a tough call, Pat.

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:50.720 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: This is the question,
because by and large,

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.260 align:middle line:84%
the people still
don't understand.

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:56.280 align:middle line:84%
But when it gets into
their pocketbook,

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:59.220 align:middle line:84%
and they start to feel the
noose around their neck,

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:02.520 align:middle line:84%
that's when they start
kicking back and resisting.

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.720 align:middle line:84%
The fact that anybody is
resisting is a good thing,

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:05.520 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.615 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As long as nobody dies.

00:29:06.615 --> 00:29:08.040 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: As long as nobody dies.

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:09.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that
could be the next step.

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:11.350 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: That's the problem.

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:14.880 align:middle line:84%
We don't-- heaven forbid that we
would have a civil war in this

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:16.890 align:middle line:84%
country, or anywhere
else, for that matter,

00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:19.360 align:middle line:90%
then more people would die.

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:21.360 align:middle line:84%
You know, we can complain
about war all we want,

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:22.620 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to
do away with war.

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:23.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:25.170 align:middle line:90%
What are smart cities?

00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:26.910 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Smart city,
by definition,

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:28.620 align:middle line:84%
is the application
of quote, unquote,

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:33.610 align:middle line:84%
smart technology on top
of society, within a city.

00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:35.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It appears
great, doesn't it?

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:36.875 align:middle line:90%
It makes you think it's good.

00:29:36.875 --> 00:29:39.000 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, it's like
the United Nations promises

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.260 align:middle line:90%
to end poverty.

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:43.070 align:middle line:84%
They have jobs for
everyone, with dignity.

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:44.820 align:middle line:84%
They have lifelong
learning opportunities.

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:45.990 align:middle line:90%
You see that kind of rhetoric.

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:47.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Medical
help for the world.

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:48.528 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Medical
help for the world.

00:29:48.528 --> 00:29:50.310 align:middle line:90%
It's promise of utopia.

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:51.690 align:middle line:90%
Can they deliver utopia?

00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:53.110 align:middle line:90%
No, they can't.

00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:55.860 align:middle line:84%
They've never been
able to deliver utopia.

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:58.800 align:middle line:84%
But the idea of
smart cities today

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:03.180 align:middle line:84%
is to take advanced
technology and turn the city

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:07.260 align:middle line:84%
into a living laboratory
that could be managed--

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:10.030 align:middle line:84%
again, by algorithm, by
artificial intelligence,

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:12.480 align:middle line:84%
that could be managed by the
people that run the city.

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:14.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now when you deal
with smart technology,

00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:16.590 align:middle line:84%
we're dealing with
what specifically?

00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:20.490 align:middle line:84%
Somebody in some computer room
somewhere, running lights?

00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Let me give
an example in China.

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:27.040 align:middle line:84%
China, now, has said, by 2020--
that's two years from now--

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:31.920 align:middle line:84%
they will have installed 600
million facial recognition

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:32.720 align:middle line:90%
cameras--

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:33.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, everywhere.

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:34.870 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: --throughout
the country.

00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:35.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everywhere.

00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:39.820 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: This is a country
that has 1.4 billion people.

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:42.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So almost a camera
for every two people.

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:45.070 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: That's one camera
for every 2 and 1/2 people.

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:48.520 align:middle line:84%
They could find you, from
the time the order is put out

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:51.280 align:middle line:84%
to say, find George Noory,
we want George Noory in here

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:53.020 align:middle line:90%
to ask him some questions.

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:55.380 align:middle line:84%
That usually is not
a good thing, right?

00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:56.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not there.

00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:57.500 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Not there.

00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:00.430 align:middle line:84%
But when they push the
button to find George Noory,

00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:03.520 align:middle line:84%
they can find you, they say,
within two to three minutes.

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:04.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:05.710 align:middle line:84%
They put my face
into the system?

00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:06.510 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yes.

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:08.093 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then
the camera finds me.

00:31:08.093 --> 00:31:09.010 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: That's right.

00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:11.075 align:middle line:84%
The cameras will identify
you around the country.

00:31:11.075 --> 00:31:11.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There he is.

00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:13.985 align:middle line:84%
He walked into his
apartment or his house.

00:31:13.985 --> 00:31:14.860 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: That's right.

00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:19.950 align:middle line:84%
So this kind of
complete surveillance

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:22.620 align:middle line:90%
is a system of control.

00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't just stop
there with cameras and China.

00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:30.310 align:middle line:84%
They now have this social
credit scoring system,

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:32.320 align:middle line:84%
where they're assigning
scores to people

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:36.747 align:middle line:84%
based on how good a citizen
you are to the state.

00:31:36.747 --> 00:31:38.080 align:middle line:90%
See, this is social engineering.

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.538 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As long
as you keep quiet,

00:31:39.538 --> 00:31:40.871 align:middle line:90%
you'll have a nice credit score.

00:31:40.871 --> 00:31:41.671 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Well, yeah.

00:31:41.671 --> 00:31:42.713 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Raise a little--

00:31:42.713 --> 00:31:44.380 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: If you're
friendly to the state,

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:47.967 align:middle line:84%
and we can count on you to
always say, yes, sir, yes,

00:31:47.967 --> 00:31:49.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We'll take care of you.

00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:50.350 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: That's right.

00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:51.940 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:53.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: If you rock the boat--

00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:56.890 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well you may not even
politically rock the boat.

00:31:56.890 --> 00:31:59.710 align:middle line:84%
But let's say you have
a habit of jaywalking,

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:02.200 align:middle line:84%
or you don't pay
your bills on time,

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:04.930 align:middle line:84%
or you got divorced
once or something.

00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:06.670 align:middle line:84%
All these things can
weigh against you.

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:08.212 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They'll
have a point system.

00:32:08.212 --> 00:32:10.810 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: The point system
is all done by computer.

00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:14.370 align:middle line:84%
There's not a man sitting there
figuring out that you and I are

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:15.800 align:middle line:90%
going to get a score.

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:17.680 align:middle line:84%
It's all done by
computer, by algorithm.

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:18.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can't buy a car--

00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:19.075 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Artificial intelligence.

00:32:19.075 --> 00:32:20.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --because
of your score,

00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:22.450 align:middle line:84%
you can't do this
because of your score.

00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:25.297 align:middle line:84%
You may not get hired
because of your score.

00:32:25.297 --> 00:32:27.130 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Not only that,
you might not travel.

00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:29.422 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you can't buy a plane
ticket or a train ticket.

00:32:29.422 --> 00:32:30.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Talking
about travel, I've

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:32.660 align:middle line:90%
been to Toronto several times.

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:33.850 align:middle line:90%
It's a gorgeous city.

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:38.502 align:middle line:84%
Microsoft wants to turn
Toronto into a smart city.

00:32:38.502 --> 00:32:40.210 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: Smart
cities are about making

00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:42.220 align:middle line:10%
each individual part
of a city smarter

00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:44.830 align:middle line:10%
through sensors,
infrastructure, and AI,

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:47.050 align:middle line:10%
then connecting them
altogether through the cloud

00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:48.970 align:middle line:10%
to operate seamlessly together.

00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:51.220 align:middle line:10%
>>CAMERON CARR: Once we do
that, we can solve problems

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:54.977 align:middle line:10%
before they start, which is
really the end goal here.

00:32:54.977 --> 00:32:56.560 align:middle line:10%
>>ERIKA BASHAM: There
really is no end

00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:59.440 align:middle line:10%
to what could be enabled
with a smart city.

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.630 align:middle line:10%
It's all connected
together to operate

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:04.510 align:middle line:10%
as one cohesive unit
aimed at improving

00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:07.127 align:middle line:10%
the lives of the
citizens of the city.

00:33:07.127 --> 00:33:09.460 align:middle line:10%
>>PHIL KORETZ: So you put
sensors in your traffic lights

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:12.140 align:middle line:10%
to help to optimize route
times and decrease congestion

00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:13.150 align:middle line:10%
at given hours.

00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:16.000 align:middle line:10%
Route optimization for your
trucks for waste disposal.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.020 align:middle line:10%
For water, you can use sensors
to measure water quality

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:19.990 align:middle line:10%
and flow.

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:22.240 align:middle line:10%
All of these different
technologies taken together

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:24.730 align:middle line:10%
make for a better experience
for you as a citizen,

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:26.200 align:middle line:10%
and make the city
government better

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:27.838 align:middle line:10%
able to accomplish their goals.

00:33:27.838 --> 00:33:31.120 align:middle line:90%


00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:33.190 align:middle line:10%
>>MIKELE BRACK: Uplift
is an urban pilot

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:37.140 align:middle line:10%
program that was developed
by Urban Living Futures.

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:40.440 align:middle line:10%
There are three major
elements to those programs.

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:44.400 align:middle line:10%
There are the cities and the
companies within those cities

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:47.490 align:middle line:10%
that have challenges or
aspirations around technology

00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:50.520 align:middle line:10%
that innovators can
help them to address.

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:53.190 align:middle line:10%
>>CHERYL GRAY: I think
the introduction of IoT,

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:56.790 align:middle line:10%
it really is around trying to
create an environment where

00:33:56.790 --> 00:33:59.760 align:middle line:10%
not only our
occupants, our tenants,

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:05.790 align:middle line:10%
our residents have an experience
that is far easier and far more

00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:09.719 align:middle line:10%
meaningful in ways that I think
we can't really even envision

00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:11.130 align:middle line:10%
today.

00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:13.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now it sounds
exciting, but in the hands

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:18.360 align:middle line:84%
of the wrong people, who knows
what they could do with this.

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:19.969 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: That's
exactly the point.

00:34:19.969 --> 00:34:24.960 align:middle line:84%
And privacy is completely
dissolved in a smart city.

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:25.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gone.

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:27.000 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Just gone.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.272 align:middle line:84%
They will know more
about you probably

00:34:29.272 --> 00:34:30.480 align:middle line:90%
than you know about yourself.

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:31.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's true.

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:34.350 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And they can use that
information to control you.

00:34:34.350 --> 00:34:35.460 align:middle line:90%
That's the problem.

00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:38.870 align:middle line:84%
That's where the resistance
kickback is coming.

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:44.909 align:middle line:84%
In Toronto, in particular,
the Microsoft and Google

00:34:44.909 --> 00:34:50.780 align:middle line:84%
project up there to create
a smart city has encountered

00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:53.000 align:middle line:84%
incredible problems
with people--

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:53.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Already?

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:56.500 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: --already that are
fighting back against it,

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:58.520 align:middle line:84%
on all kinds of
different levels that you

00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:01.130 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't expect, necessarily.

00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:04.380 align:middle line:84%
But see, the problem is,
these smart city designers,

00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:06.290 align:middle line:90%
where does this stuff come from?

00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:09.340 align:middle line:84%
Are these your city council
people that come up with this?

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:10.370 align:middle line:90%
you're mayor?

00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:11.900 align:middle line:90%
city manager?

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:13.670 align:middle line:90%
No, it's big data.

00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Even those
workers we just saw,

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:18.600 align:middle line:84%
Pat, seem well-intentioned,
those people.

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: But they
work for Microsoft,

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:22.220 align:middle line:84%
they work for Amazon,
they work for Google,

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:24.680 align:middle line:84%
they work for these
big tech companies--

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:26.060 align:middle line:90%
Microsoft and whatever.

00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:29.600 align:middle line:84%
These are not elected
representatives of the people,

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:33.350 align:middle line:84%
nor do they consult the
people on what people want

00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:35.180 align:middle line:90%
to do in their particular city.

00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:37.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What will
happen 20 years from now

00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:39.620 align:middle line:90%
if all this is implemented?

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:41.390 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Much of it
is going to fail.

00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:43.610 align:middle line:90%
I'll say that right up front.

00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:46.100 align:middle line:84%
The whole concept of
public-private partnerships,

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:50.860 align:middle line:84%
where you have a public entity
like Toronto combining together

00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:55.130 align:middle line:84%
with a private entity, whether
it be Google or Microsoft,

00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:58.190 align:middle line:84%
this is kind of a fascist
type of a blending, of state

00:35:58.190 --> 00:36:00.750 align:middle line:90%
into business.

00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:04.630 align:middle line:84%
When the business partnership
goes south, George,

00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:06.372 align:middle line:90%
the people can't leave.

00:36:06.372 --> 00:36:07.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're stuck.

00:36:07.330 --> 00:36:08.500 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: They're stuck.

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:11.830 align:middle line:84%
The corporations can waltz
away and go find somebody else

00:36:11.830 --> 00:36:13.630 align:middle line:90%
to take advantage.

00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:16.390 align:middle line:90%
They leave the city with hubris.

00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:21.310 align:middle line:84%
This has happened all over the
planet with these companies--

00:36:21.310 --> 00:36:23.900 align:middle line:84%
with these large
companies that do this.

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:25.540 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
examples that just

00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:27.250 align:middle line:90%
make your hair stand on end.

00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:30.100 align:middle line:84%
But this is basically-- the
whole concept of smart city

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:33.430 align:middle line:84%
is, we're going to come
in and save the day.

00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:35.830 align:middle line:84%
We're going to create this
great new thing that's

00:36:35.830 --> 00:36:39.010 align:middle line:84%
never been tested
before, never been tried.

00:36:39.010 --> 00:36:41.740 align:middle line:84%
We don't know if the people
are going to like it at all.

00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:44.530 align:middle line:84%
We don't know if it's
going to be successful.

00:36:44.530 --> 00:36:47.890 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to come in a
turn your world upside down.

00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:49.340 align:middle line:90%
We hope it's going to work.

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:52.008 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would George
Orwell have said about today?

00:36:52.008 --> 00:36:53.800 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: He would say
this is the end result

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.517 align:middle line:90%
of a scientific dictatorship.

00:36:55.517 --> 00:36:57.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, he
was right about '84.

00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:58.000 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: He was right.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe he was early.

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:03.240 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Orwell
understood technocracy.

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.550 align:middle line:90%
So did Huxley.

00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:07.410 align:middle line:10%
Huxley, by the way,
wrote his book,

00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:10.580 align:middle line:10%
"Brave New World," in 1932.

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:12.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Way before technology.

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, you'll
remember that 1932

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:20.880 align:middle line:84%
was the year that technocracy
was at Columbia University.

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And Huxley, a Brit,
had a connection

00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:28.007 align:middle line:84%
to the president of
Columbia University.

00:37:28.007 --> 00:37:29.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he knew
about this, then.

00:37:29.590 --> 00:37:31.150 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Absolutely.

00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:34.400 align:middle line:84%
So scientific dictatorship
has not been-- it's

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:36.410 align:middle line:90%
not a new concept.

00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:38.830 align:middle line:84%
But you go back and you read
some of the futuristic stuff

00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:40.990 align:middle line:84%
that Huxley wrote,
and you think, man,

00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:42.880 align:middle line:84%
how did this guy come
up with this stuff?

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:45.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Pat, what
are they afraid of?

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:49.300 align:middle line:84%
When I say "they,"
it's that big umbrella.

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:51.130 align:middle line:84%
What are they afraid
of with the people?

00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:53.230 align:middle line:90%
Why did they want this control?

00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: They're afraid
of you and me, George.

00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:57.260 align:middle line:90%
They're afraid of people.

00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:02.390 align:middle line:84%
Most of this crowd has
never had any direct contact

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:06.920 align:middle line:84%
with real people that
live in real cities

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:09.560 align:middle line:90%
and real communities.

00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And when they're confronted
by people who take exception--

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:19.030 align:middle line:84%
and I have confronted many
over the last 40 years.

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:21.560 align:middle line:84%
When they're
confronted, they go,

00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:24.210 align:middle line:90%
I can't believe you're upset.

00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:26.738 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- what
are you thinking?

00:38:26.738 --> 00:38:29.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, they think
they are developing a utopia.

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:29.830 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:32.730 align:middle line:84%
They think, well,
of course it's good.

00:38:32.730 --> 00:38:35.380 align:middle line:90%
Why would you protest?

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And for the most
part, most of them

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:39.490 align:middle line:84%
are like deer caught
in the headlights.

00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:42.550 align:middle line:84%
They just can't believe
that anybody would not

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:44.347 align:middle line:90%
go along with the program.

00:38:44.347 --> 00:38:46.180 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've never
quite figured this out,

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:48.670 align:middle line:90%
but I've seen it so many times.

00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:51.820 align:middle line:84%
Back in the early writings
of technocracy, in the '30s,

00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:54.640 align:middle line:84%
they wanted to convert North
America into a technate,

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:55.960 align:middle line:90%
they called it.

00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:57.460 align:middle line:90%
It was going to be Canada--

00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:58.630 align:middle line:90%
they had a map.

00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:03.700 align:middle line:84%
Canada, United States, Mexico,
all the Central America,

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:07.540 align:middle line:84%
and most of the northern
part of South America.

00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:12.080 align:middle line:84%
That was the technate that they
were going to put all together.

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:14.140 align:middle line:84%
There's not one word
I could find anywhere

00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:17.780 align:middle line:84%
and their original
information that

00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:20.030 align:middle line:84%
said how they were going to
talk these other countries

00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:22.242 align:middle line:90%
into doing it.

00:39:22.242 --> 00:39:24.200 align:middle line:84%
What, Canada's just going
to roll over and play

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:26.720 align:middle line:84%
dead, and say, hey sure,
we'll join your technate.

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:28.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right-- or Mexico.

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:28.890 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Mexico.

00:39:28.890 --> 00:39:29.780 align:middle line:90%
Are you kidding?

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:31.400 align:middle line:90%
South America?

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:36.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, are we going to go in
and conquer them militarily?

00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:37.550 align:middle line:90%
But they never brought that up.

00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:39.740 align:middle line:90%
They never talked about that.

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:43.550 align:middle line:84%
This is the problem
with Pollyanna dreamers.

00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:45.710 align:middle line:90%
They don't think things through.

00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:47.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you mentioned
one of the goals.

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:50.950 align:middle line:90%
The main goal is resources.

00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:52.660 align:middle line:84%
Is there another goal,
though, behind it

00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:53.800 align:middle line:90%
with these individuals?

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they put their
pants on like we do.

00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:59.740 align:middle line:90%
They cry, they eat, they sleep.

00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:01.360 align:middle line:90%
What's their end game?

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:04.060 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: You could kind of
guess from it, the end game,

00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:06.250 align:middle line:84%
you could say, is
control and power.

00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:07.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
bored, aren't they?

00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:09.790 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: But the power
comes through the control

00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:11.230 align:middle line:90%
of the resources.

00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:13.990 align:middle line:84%
This has always been the
case on Planet Earth.

00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:16.840 align:middle line:84%
You know, you go back
to Old Testament days

00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:19.450 align:middle line:84%
when Job was alive,
for instance.

00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:23.300 align:middle line:84%
Job was one of the richest
men, if not the richest man,

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:24.100 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:25.150 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:28.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, he had sheep, he
had cattle, he had herds,

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:30.070 align:middle line:90%
he had land, he had mines.

00:40:30.070 --> 00:40:31.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He had
thousands of them.

00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:33.730 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Thousands of them.

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:36.400 align:middle line:90%
And he was a rich man.

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.700 align:middle line:84%
He didn't have the Federal
Reserve in his back pocket

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:39.500 align:middle line:90%
back then.

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:41.350 align:middle line:90%
Just he had the resources.

00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:43.795 align:middle line:84%
That's always been
the measure of wealth.

00:40:43.795 --> 00:40:46.540 align:middle line:90%


00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:48.940 align:middle line:84%
The global elite that
wanted to get all the money

00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:51.320 align:middle line:84%
in the world-- like through
the Federal Reserve,

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:54.050 align:middle line:84%
and chiseling off with
inflation, and so on--

00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:55.810 align:middle line:90%
they've had success with that.

00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:57.130 align:middle line:90%
Let's be frank.

00:40:57.130 --> 00:41:01.330 align:middle line:84%
They've chiseled away about
99% of the value of the dollar

00:41:01.330 --> 00:41:04.930 align:middle line:84%
since 1913, when
the Fed was created.

00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:06.910 align:middle line:90%
What's left to rip off?

00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:08.410 align:middle line:90%
Not much.

00:41:08.410 --> 00:41:10.210 align:middle line:84%
At this point, the
only thing left

00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:12.910 align:middle line:84%
to go for are the
resources of the planet.

00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:15.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How could
this backfire on them?

00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:18.140 align:middle line:90%
What could go wrong for them?

00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:21.580 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, when, as,
and if people figure out

00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:23.560 align:middle line:90%
the magician's trick here--

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:28.360 align:middle line:84%
the fraud, if you will,
it could be game over.

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:31.480 align:middle line:84%
But that's a big if,
because most people

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:35.225 align:middle line:84%
still just absolutely don't
understand what's going on.

00:41:35.225 --> 00:41:36.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
may never understand.

00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:38.433 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And they may
never understand.

00:41:38.433 --> 00:41:41.560 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand, how
much do you need to know?

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:44.260 align:middle line:84%
In France, for instance,
the yellow vests

00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:48.550 align:middle line:84%
are upset because they
don't like the carbon tax.

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:50.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, the carbon tax
is directly related

00:41:50.530 --> 00:41:52.060 align:middle line:90%
to what we're talking about.

00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:54.610 align:middle line:84%
This has to do with
control over energy.

00:41:54.610 --> 00:41:57.670 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with sustainable
development, which

00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:58.820 align:middle line:90%
I believe is technocracy--

00:41:58.820 --> 00:41:59.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And money.

00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:00.810 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: And money.

00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And so they say,
no, enough of that.

00:42:03.250 --> 00:42:06.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, you could have any
number of choke points come up

00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:09.040 align:middle line:84%
in the next five to 10 years
around the world, where

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:10.960 align:middle line:84%
people say, we're
not going to do that.

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:12.790 align:middle line:84%
We're just simply
not going to do that.

00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:15.070 align:middle line:84%
One headline recently
about the yellow vests

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:19.730 align:middle line:84%
said that they have gone
out across the country

00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:26.087 align:middle line:84%
and broken 60% of the speed
trap meters on the highways.

00:42:26.087 --> 00:42:27.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That they put in.

00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:28.380 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: That they put in.

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:31.440 align:middle line:84%
This is a technocrat
control mechanism

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:33.360 align:middle line:84%
to read license plates
and stuff like that,

00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:34.830 align:middle line:84%
take your pictures
when you're driving.

00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:35.997 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Give you a ticket--

00:42:35.997 --> 00:42:37.457 align:middle line:90%
$100, $100.

00:42:37.457 --> 00:42:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Right, and they
send you a ticket by mail.

00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:43.590 align:middle line:84%
The yellow vest
people got an idea.

00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:45.630 align:middle line:90%
These things are spying on us.

00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:46.740 align:middle line:90%
We've had it.

00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:48.248 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
take it anymore.

00:42:48.248 --> 00:42:50.040 align:middle line:84%
They went out-- I don't
know what they did.

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:52.110 align:middle line:84%
They took hammers, or
duct tape, or something.

00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or whatever they did.

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:54.900 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Or whatever they did.

00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:58.050 align:middle line:90%
And they deep-sixed them.

00:42:58.050 --> 00:43:01.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm not necessarily
for the destruction

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:02.550 align:middle line:90%
of private property, believe me.

00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:04.320 align:middle line:90%
But you get the point.

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:06.810 align:middle line:84%
How much do people need
to know before they

00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:07.735 align:middle line:90%
can start to resist?

00:43:07.735 --> 00:43:09.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how far
can you push them?

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:09.780 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: That's right.

00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:12.090 align:middle line:84%
How far can you push
them before they say, no.

00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:13.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who pays for all this?

00:43:13.710 --> 00:43:15.860 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: We do.

00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:16.660 align:middle line:90%
We've paid for it.

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:18.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In taxes
and everything else.

00:43:18.130 --> 00:43:19.060 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: That's right.

00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:20.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's their plan, too?

00:43:20.650 --> 00:43:23.110 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Invariably--
well, let's face it,

00:43:23.110 --> 00:43:25.810 align:middle line:84%
cities in America today,
for a number of reasons,

00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:27.800 align:middle line:90%
are flat out of money.

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All of them.

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:30.310 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Almost all of them.

00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:32.890 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are that close
to bankruptcy right now.

00:43:32.890 --> 00:43:35.170 align:middle line:90%
It's scary.

00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:39.070 align:middle line:84%
But those cities are looking
for money to do stuff.

00:43:39.070 --> 00:43:41.230 align:middle line:84%
When a Microsoft comes
along, or a Google,

00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:44.740 align:middle line:84%
or an Amazon comes along, says,
hey, we'll help you out here.

00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:47.340 align:middle line:90%


00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:49.062 align:middle line:84%
You let us install
our high technology.

00:43:49.062 --> 00:43:51.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's going to cost
you this amount of money.

00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:52.230 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: We'll give you-- yeah.

00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:53.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Give you a deal.

00:43:53.550 --> 00:43:55.758 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: You know, we'll take
a little money from you,

00:43:55.758 --> 00:43:58.623 align:middle line:84%
but you'll give us just control
over these things, and--

00:43:58.623 --> 00:44:00.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We'll get our
fees out of the things.

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:03.020 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Yeah, we'll
charge the people.

00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:04.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, the cities
go along with it

00:44:04.890 --> 00:44:09.110 align:middle line:84%
because they figure,
nothing we can do anyway.

00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And they get into these unholy
relationships, most of which

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:17.100 align:middle line:84%
I think, in the
future, will fail,

00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:19.470 align:middle line:84%
and leave the cities
doubly destroyed.

00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:21.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think you're right.

00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:22.370 align:middle line:90%
I think you're right.

00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:25.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there will come
a time on this planet

00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:29.160 align:middle line:84%
that the people will
say, enough is enough.

00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:33.050 align:middle line:84%
Far beyond what's happening in
France, they will simply say,

00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:34.050 align:middle line:90%
enough is enough.

00:44:34.050 --> 00:44:36.060 align:middle line:90%
And then what happens?

00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:38.180 align:middle line:84%
Then we have a
worldwide-- of anarchy?

00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:39.450 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:44:39.450 --> 00:44:40.730 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: I know.

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:42.990 align:middle line:84%
That's a difficult scenario
to kind of think through.

00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:43.970 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:44:43.970 --> 00:44:48.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And would an
army turn on its people?

00:44:48.170 --> 00:44:49.280 align:middle line:90%
I really wonder.

00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:51.380 align:middle line:90%
I spent nine years in the Navy.

00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:55.500 align:middle line:84%
If I was given an unlawful
order, I wouldn't have done it.

00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:59.460 align:middle line:84%
But what do they do when you
go to your military, your Army,

00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:03.660 align:middle line:84%
your Marines, and say, we've
got uprising in the cities.

00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:04.770 align:middle line:90%
They're looting.

00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:06.660 align:middle line:90%
They're burning buildings.

00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:08.280 align:middle line:90%
Shoot to kill.

00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:10.800 align:middle line:90%
Would they do that?

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:13.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Some might,
some might not.

00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:17.190 align:middle line:84%
I think we've seen military all
over the world flip-flop back

00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:19.182 align:middle line:84%
and forth between
different forces.

00:45:19.182 --> 00:45:20.640 align:middle line:84%
Certainly in the
Mid East it's been

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:26.910 align:middle line:84%
the case, where one group is
fighting for this group today.

00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:30.750 align:middle line:84%
Next month, they represent
a different crowd.

00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:33.720 align:middle line:84%
Same military, same uniform
same guns, but they're

00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:35.160 align:middle line:90%
serving a different master.

00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:38.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You talked about
cryptocurrencies earlier.

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:41.490 align:middle line:84%
How prevalent do you
think they will become?

00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:43.740 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Sustainable
development and technocracy

00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:44.850 align:middle line:90%
have to be financed.

00:45:44.850 --> 00:45:47.820 align:middle line:84%
The United Nations has
written extensively on this.

00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:51.810 align:middle line:84%
They claim that
sustainable development

00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:58.860 align:middle line:84%
may take as much as $50
trillion dollars to implement

00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:01.390 align:middle line:90%
over the next 20, 25 years.

00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:03.680 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot of money.

00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:06.580 align:middle line:90%
Cities don't have that money.

00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:08.390 align:middle line:84%
Countries don't have
that kind of money.

00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:09.780 align:middle line:90%
Where's it going to come from?

00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:11.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's going
to come from us.

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, it's going to
come from some different source.

00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:14.373 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good point.

00:46:14.373 --> 00:46:16.670 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Either a different
monetary system altogether--

00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:18.670 align:middle line:84%
but something is going
to be different than what

00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:20.560 align:middle line:90%
it is today.

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:23.590 align:middle line:84%
Most of the people in the
know at the United Nations

00:46:23.590 --> 00:46:27.460 align:middle line:84%
and in the top financial world,
the Goldman Sachs of the world

00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:29.470 align:middle line:84%
the Bank for
International Settlements,

00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:34.930 align:middle line:84%
and so on, most of these
entities say that so-called

00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:36.490 align:middle line:90%
fintech--

00:46:36.490 --> 00:46:41.440 align:middle line:84%
financial technology, advanced
artificial intelligence working

00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:45.370 align:middle line:90%
within the financial area--

00:46:45.370 --> 00:46:50.200 align:middle line:84%
that fintech is going to be
the financial tool that's

00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:54.610 align:middle line:84%
used to finance
sustainable development.

00:46:54.610 --> 00:46:57.847 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's look
at what fintech really is.

00:46:57.847 --> 00:47:00.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: If you've ever paid
for something with your phone,

00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:03.013 align:middle line:84%
transferred money using an app,
or checked your bank statement

00:47:03.013 --> 00:47:05.740 align:middle line:84%
online, then you're already
part of a multi-billion dollar

00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:06.610 align:middle line:90%
industry.

00:47:06.610 --> 00:47:08.830 align:middle line:84%
It's called fintech, and
it's changing economies

00:47:08.830 --> 00:47:10.145 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:47:10.145 --> 00:47:12.045 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:47:12.045 --> 00:47:13.950 align:middle line:90%


00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:16.380 align:middle line:84%
Fintech is short for
"financial technology."

00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:17.670 align:middle line:90%
Seems simple, right?

00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:19.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, the term, fintech,
includes a huge range

00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:22.320 align:middle line:84%
of products, technologies,
and business models

00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:24.940 align:middle line:84%
that are changing the
financial services industry.

00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:27.270 align:middle line:84%
It refers to everything
from cashless payments,

00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:30.150 align:middle line:84%
to crowdfunding platforms,
to robo-advisors,

00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:31.980 align:middle line:90%
to virtual currencies.

00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:34.980 align:middle line:84%
So every time you donate to
someone's Kickstarter campaign,

00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:35.880 align:middle line:90%
that's fintech.

00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:38.250 align:middle line:84%
Or if you transfer money
to someone using Venmo,

00:47:38.250 --> 00:47:39.980 align:middle line:90%
that's also fintech.

00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:41.250 align:middle line:90%
And that's just the beginning.

00:47:41.250 --> 00:47:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Here at a major fintech
conference in Amsterdam,

00:47:43.770 --> 00:47:46.110 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of companies are
trying to disrupt the banking

00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:48.450 align:middle line:84%
and finance industries
by changing the way we

00:47:48.450 --> 00:47:50.430 align:middle line:90%
pay and borrow money.

00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:52.080 align:middle line:90%
And investors are buying it.

00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:54.240 align:middle line:84%
Global investment in
the fintech sector

00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:58.110 align:middle line:84%
has added up to nearly
$100 billion since 2010.

00:47:58.110 --> 00:48:02.130 align:middle line:84%
In 2017 alone, fintech
investment surged 18%.

00:48:02.130 --> 00:48:05.160 align:middle line:84%
Startups focusing on payment
and lending technologies

00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:07.590 align:middle line:84%
received the majority
of those funds.

00:48:07.590 --> 00:48:10.057 align:middle line:84%
It's not just startups that
are getting into fintech.

00:48:10.057 --> 00:48:11.640 align:middle line:84%
Some of the world's
biggest companies,

00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:14.920 align:middle line:84%
from Apple to Alibaba,
are going big on it, too.

00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:16.800 align:middle line:84%
Just think of Apple
Pay or Alipay.

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:19.560 align:middle line:84%
One reason for all of this
investment-- consumers

00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:21.480 align:middle line:90%
are adopting fintech fast.

00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:24.900 align:middle line:84%
One out of every three people
across 20 major economies

00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:27.480 align:middle line:84%
report using at least
two fintech services

00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:28.710 align:middle line:90%
in the last six months.

00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:31.740 align:middle line:84%
China and India are leading
the way, with more than half

00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:33.870 align:middle line:84%
of consumers using
services like money

00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:37.060 align:middle line:84%
transfers, financial planning,
borrowing, and insurance.

00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:39.300 align:middle line:84%
Financial technology has
filled a void for people

00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:42.360 align:middle line:84%
around the world who don't have
access to traditional banking

00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:43.410 align:middle line:90%
services.

00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:46.200 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's estimated nearly
2 billion people worldwide

00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:47.850 align:middle line:90%
are without bank accounts.

00:48:47.850 --> 00:48:49.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, thanks to
fintech, all you need

00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:52.470 align:middle line:84%
is your phone to take
out a loan or insurance.

00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:54.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's amazing,
and it's happening.

00:48:54.910 --> 00:48:55.710 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: It is.

00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:57.480 align:middle line:84%
China is a good
example of this today.

00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:01.360 align:middle line:84%
95% of all their
commerce today is

00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:05.270 align:middle line:84%
accomplished in a smartphone
and electronic payment.

00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:06.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I've used PayPal.

00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:08.040 align:middle line:90%
I've done that.

00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:11.280 align:middle line:84%
I bought things from
Amazon on my smartphone.

00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:14.420 align:middle line:84%
I never thought I
would, Pat, ever, ever.

00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:15.690 align:middle line:90%
And it's easy.

00:49:15.690 --> 00:49:16.735 align:middle line:90%
It's convenient.

00:49:16.735 --> 00:49:18.110 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: It's easy
and convenient.

00:49:18.110 --> 00:49:19.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's scary.

00:49:19.170 --> 00:49:21.860 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: But the last part of
this video that we heard here

00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:24.930 align:middle line:84%
is the key to what's
really driving this.

00:49:24.930 --> 00:49:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And this is a core part of
sustainable development slash

00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:31.310 align:middle line:90%
technocracy.

00:49:31.310 --> 00:49:36.890 align:middle line:84%
But the 1.7 billion unbanked
throughout the world that

00:49:36.890 --> 00:49:39.380 align:middle line:84%
are currently using
cash, or simply

00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:42.320 align:middle line:84%
just don't have enough money
to have a bank account, that's

00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:45.230 align:middle line:90%
a huge market for these people.

00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:51.110 align:middle line:84%
MasterCard, Visa, whatever
payment system you look at,

00:49:51.110 --> 00:49:56.780 align:middle line:84%
an average of anywhere
from 1.9% to 2.9%

00:49:56.780 --> 00:49:59.210 align:middle line:84%
is taken off of
every transaction

00:49:59.210 --> 00:50:00.530 align:middle line:90%
to service the transaction.

00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:01.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Service fees.

00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:02.390 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:04.223 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That they pass
on to us, of course.

00:50:04.223 --> 00:50:05.150 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: That's right.

00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:10.180 align:middle line:84%
Now if I buy a watch from you,
and I hand you a $100 bill--

00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:11.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There's no fee.

00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:12.330 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: There's no fee.

00:50:12.330 --> 00:50:13.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They don't want that.

00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:14.720 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: They don't want that.

00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:16.110 align:middle line:84%
You don't make
any money on that.

00:50:16.110 --> 00:50:16.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
can't track it.

00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:18.293 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: And they can't track it.

00:50:18.293 --> 00:50:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And even worse,
they can't track it.

00:50:19.970 --> 00:50:22.640 align:middle line:90%
So all of the unbanked world--

00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:27.510 align:middle line:84%
and it's huge in America, it's
huge in places like Africa,

00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:29.900 align:middle line:90%
and South America, and so on.

00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:34.160 align:middle line:84%
When they force these people
into the digital domain,

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:37.850 align:middle line:84%
the digital world, they
pick up not only control

00:50:37.850 --> 00:50:40.970 align:middle line:84%
over those people
because of the data,

00:50:40.970 --> 00:50:44.960 align:middle line:84%
they pick up massive
amounts of fees.

00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:48.030 align:middle line:84%
Because every time something
is done-- click, click, click,

00:50:48.030 --> 00:50:49.170 align:middle line:90%
click--

00:50:49.170 --> 00:50:51.620 align:middle line:90%
1%, 2%, 3%, whatever--

00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:54.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Times
billions of dollars.

00:50:54.350 --> 00:50:57.740 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: That's a machine
better than a casino.

00:50:57.740 --> 00:50:59.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:50:59.090 --> 00:51:00.060 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:01.560 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Every time
you pull a lever.

00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:04.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's why Jeff Bezos
is the world's richest man

00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:05.210 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:05.510 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: That's right.

00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:07.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was able to
utilize the internet.

00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:09.680 align:middle line:84%
It started off as
a book company,

00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:11.430 align:middle line:90%
selling books on the internet.

00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:15.680 align:middle line:84%
I know, because our
authors, guests on my show,

00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:18.576 align:middle line:84%
would say "you can get
my book on Amazon.com."

00:51:18.576 --> 00:51:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And you'd go there, and
that's all there were--

00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:21.800 align:middle line:90%
books.

00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:23.890 align:middle line:90%
And then he exploded.

00:51:23.890 --> 00:51:27.280 align:middle line:84%
And this Alibaba company
in China is huge.

00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:28.080 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yes, it is.

00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:29.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now tie
that into what we

00:51:29.930 --> 00:51:33.320 align:middle line:84%
talked about in the beginning,
the Trilateral Commission.

00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:35.750 align:middle line:84%
Talk about the
relationship between, like,

00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:38.900 align:middle line:84%
a fintech and the
Trilateral Commission.

00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:40.940 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Well, a lot of people--

00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:44.510 align:middle line:84%
the probably common view
of things like Bitcoin,

00:51:44.510 --> 00:51:46.310 align:middle line:84%
and blockchain
technology, and so on

00:51:46.310 --> 00:51:50.320 align:middle line:84%
is that it was a
consumer-driven, bottom-up sort

00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:51.120 align:middle line:90%
of a thing.

00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:52.790 align:middle line:90%
And that's really not the case.

00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:55.710 align:middle line:90%


00:51:55.710 --> 00:52:00.020 align:middle line:84%
The major players today
in blockchain technology

00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:03.260 align:middle line:84%
are the big banks,
the global banks.

00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:04.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:08.670 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Whether it would
be JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank.

00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:09.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Chase.

00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:11.570 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Chase.

00:52:11.570 --> 00:52:15.842 align:middle line:84%
Then the global institution,
like World Bank,

00:52:15.842 --> 00:52:17.300 align:middle line:84%
Bank for International
Settlements.

00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:18.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are the
hedging their bets?

00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:20.630 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: The IMF, right?

00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:24.200 align:middle line:84%
All of these institutions
are looking at ways

00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:28.410 align:middle line:84%
to use blockchain
technology to transform

00:52:28.410 --> 00:52:34.410 align:middle line:84%
the financial system of our
planet into a digital system.

00:52:34.410 --> 00:52:35.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And to
do away with cash.

00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:38.535 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And to do away
with cash altogether.

00:52:38.535 --> 00:52:40.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's frightening.

00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:44.520 align:middle line:84%
Because the one thing
they can do, at a whim,

00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:47.785 align:middle line:84%
is take your digital money
from you, just like that.

00:52:47.785 --> 00:52:48.660 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: That's right.

00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:50.880 align:middle line:84%
If you've got cash, you've got
a couple hundred bucks on you,

00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:51.930 align:middle line:90%
it's yours.

00:52:51.930 --> 00:52:54.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's yours, and I'm not
going to take it away from you.

00:52:54.750 --> 00:52:59.410 align:middle line:84%
But digitally, you've got
$200 in your bank account,

00:52:59.410 --> 00:53:01.440 align:middle line:90%
and tomorrow, it's gone.

00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:02.483 align:middle line:90%
They took it.

00:53:02.483 --> 00:53:03.900 align:middle line:84%
What are you going
to do about it?

00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:05.230 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Have no recourse.

00:53:05.230 --> 00:53:06.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing.

00:53:06.030 --> 00:53:07.120 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Nothing.

00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:09.170 align:middle line:90%
And that's the problem.

00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:12.300 align:middle line:84%
If I could take one
of those little thumb

00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:17.220 align:middle line:84%
drives, a little 32-gigabyte
plug-and-play things

00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:19.210 align:middle line:90%
into your computer.

00:53:19.210 --> 00:53:23.100 align:middle line:84%
If I could put an
electronic wallet on that,

00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:28.500 align:middle line:84%
and say, take all of the
Bitcoin in the world, all

00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:32.015 align:middle line:84%
of the Ethereum in the world,
and put it on that chip,

00:53:32.015 --> 00:53:34.140 align:middle line:84%
theoretically, I'd be the
richest man in the world.

00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:34.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No doubt.

00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:38.220 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: I have all
of this little thing.

00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:41.070 align:middle line:84%
How much more does
that thumb drive

00:53:41.070 --> 00:53:47.087 align:middle line:84%
weigh after I put all that
money on it versus before?

00:53:47.087 --> 00:53:48.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's all digital.

00:53:48.170 --> 00:53:49.030 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Nada.

00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:49.830 align:middle line:90%
There's no weight.

00:53:49.830 --> 00:53:51.290 align:middle line:90%
There's no substance to it.

00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:53.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
no expenses to it.

00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:57.820 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: It's just in
somebody's computer brain.

00:53:57.820 --> 00:54:00.270 align:middle line:84%
And you could be the
richest man in the world,

00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:03.940 align:middle line:84%
and if somebody had
the ability to flip

00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:05.500 align:middle line:90%
a switch on George Noory--

00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:06.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And take it all.

00:54:06.700 --> 00:54:09.580 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, not necessarily
take, but let's just say, turn

00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:10.960 align:middle line:90%
off your plastic.

00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:12.162 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:54:12.162 --> 00:54:14.370 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Just turn off your
ability to clear anything.

00:54:14.370 --> 00:54:15.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My cards
aren't working.

00:54:15.850 --> 00:54:17.030 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Your card goes in--

00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:18.110 align:middle line:90%
declined.

00:54:18.110 --> 00:54:19.740 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I've got another one--

00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:20.693 align:middle line:90%
declined.

00:54:20.693 --> 00:54:22.110 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I've got another one--

00:54:22.110 --> 00:54:23.610 align:middle line:90%
declined.

00:54:23.610 --> 00:54:24.570 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here?

00:54:24.570 --> 00:54:26.800 align:middle line:90%
I got all this money.

00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:28.000 align:middle line:90%
I can't do anything with it.

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:28.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gone.

00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:29.330 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: It's gone.

00:54:29.330 --> 00:54:30.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Control.

00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:33.342 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: So this kind of
thinking-- and by the way,

00:54:33.342 --> 00:54:35.300 align:middle line:84%
some people in the world
are waking up to this.

00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:39.590 align:middle line:84%
Even the Swedes-- and Sweden
started this whole idea

00:54:39.590 --> 00:54:40.787 align:middle line:90%
of cashless society--

00:54:40.787 --> 00:54:42.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They don't like it now.

00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: The Swedes themselves
have finally concluded, what

00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:48.450 align:middle line:90%
happens if the power goes out?

00:54:48.450 --> 00:54:50.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You've got it.

00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:50.840 align:middle line:90%
And it could.

00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:52.120 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: And it could.

00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:54.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: X-flare from
the sun, or an EMP attack

00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:55.080 align:middle line:90%
in the atmosphere.

00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:55.880 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: I know.

00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:58.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're power grid goes
down, your ATMs don't work,

00:54:58.380 --> 00:54:59.220 align:middle line:90%
nothing works.

00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:03.540 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And you want to say
to them, well, duh, of course.

00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:06.362 align:middle line:84%
What happens when
the power goes down?

00:55:06.362 --> 00:55:07.570 align:middle line:90%
You're all just out to lunch.

00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:09.195 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The great
line from the movie,

00:55:09.195 --> 00:55:12.960 align:middle line:84%
"Network," from the
anchorman Howard Beale,

00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:14.940 align:middle line:90%
"just leave us alone.

00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:17.230 align:middle line:84%
Give us our toaster,
and our television,

00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:18.680 align:middle line:90%
and our radial-cut tires.

00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:22.590 align:middle line:90%
Just please leave us alone."

00:55:22.590 --> 00:55:25.230 align:middle line:84%
That could happen,
too, where people just

00:55:25.230 --> 00:55:27.300 align:middle line:90%
want to be left alone.

00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:30.100 align:middle line:84%
So they can do anything
they want to us,

00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:32.100 align:middle line:84%
but let me stay in
my little house.

00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:34.680 align:middle line:90%
And please leave me alone.

00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:36.480 align:middle line:90%
Is that a real scenario--

00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:38.140 align:middle line:90%
leave me alone?

00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:40.680 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, this is
pretty much an art of man,

00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:42.930 align:middle line:90%
I think, just naturally.

00:55:42.930 --> 00:55:44.580 align:middle line:90%
Like, don't mess with me.

00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:46.590 align:middle line:90%
Don't mess with my money.

00:55:46.590 --> 00:55:50.310 align:middle line:10%
Don't mess with my family, my
kids, don't mess with my wife.

00:55:50.310 --> 00:55:52.710 align:middle line:90%
Just basically leave me alone.

00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:56.580 align:middle line:84%
I think that's hardwired
into the heart of man.

00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:59.820 align:middle line:84%
When enough pressure
comes from the outside,

00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:01.740 align:middle line:84%
where people are messing
with your wallet,

00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:03.660 align:middle line:84%
they are messing
with your family,

00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:05.423 align:middle line:84%
and they're messing
with your health,

00:56:05.423 --> 00:56:07.590 align:middle line:84%
there's going to come a
point where people just say,

00:56:07.590 --> 00:56:08.710 align:middle line:84%
we're not going
to do it anymore.

00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:10.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And Patrick,
of course, thank you

00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:11.280 align:middle line:90%
for being on Beyond Belief.

00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:13.470 align:middle line:84%
But as Howard Beale
ended that movie,

00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:16.490 align:middle line:84%
"Network," I'm not going
to leave you alone.

00:56:16.490 --> 00:56:18.490 align:middle line:10%
I'm not going to leave
you with your television,

00:56:18.490 --> 00:56:20.940 align:middle line:10%
and your radial tires,
and your toaster.

00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:23.730 align:middle line:84%
I want you to go to
your window and scream,

00:56:23.730 --> 00:56:25.740 align:middle line:84%
you're as mad as
hell, and you're not

00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:27.990 align:middle line:90%
going to take it anymore.

00:56:27.990 --> 00:56:31.940 align:middle line:90%
