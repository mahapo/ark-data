00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.602 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[THEME MUSIC] And I think
many people today don't

00:00:07.602 --> 00:00:08.810 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.802 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.802 --> 00:00:13.360 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.486 align:middle line:84%
>>It felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.486 --> 00:00:17.110 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.235 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.235 --> 00:00:25.424 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.424 --> 00:00:26.840 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY:
Well, welcome back

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.540 align:middle line:84%
to another edition
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:29.670 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.920 align:middle line:10%
And as you know,
watching this program

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.450 align:middle line:10%
or listening to me on
"Coast to Coast AM,"

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.260 align:middle line:10%
you know that I'm obsessed
with alternative medicine.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.520 align:middle line:84%
I think it's so
important that we

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.650 align:middle line:84%
have the abilities to
take care of ourselves,

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:44.770 align:middle line:90%
to treat ourselves.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.860 align:middle line:90%
OK, I like mainstream medicine.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.590 align:middle line:90%
Don't get me wrong.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.010 align:middle line:84%
But I think every
individual should

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.710 align:middle line:84%
be looking at
alternatives before they

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.970 align:middle line:84%
dive into Big Pharma and
other areas of medicine.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.200 align:middle line:84%
Our guest today is going to be
talking with us about subjects

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.770 align:middle line:84%
that, literally,
will curl your hair

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.440 align:middle line:84%
or scare the living
daylights out of you.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.960 align:middle line:90%
Erin Elizabeth is with us.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.440 align:middle line:84%
She, of course, is
the editor and founder

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.570 align:middle line:84%
of healthnutnews.com and also,
an investigative reporter.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.400 align:middle line:90%
You do a lot of stuff, Erin.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ERIN ELIZABETH:
Yes, definitely

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.690 align:middle line:90%
a jack-of-all-trades.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to
start with a story

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.060 align:middle line:84%
that we had you on
"Coast to Coast"

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.980 align:middle line:84%
some time ago that
is one of the most

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.200 align:middle line:84%
frightening, under-the-table
stories that's

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.700 align:middle line:90%
happening right now.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.850 align:middle line:84%
And that is the bizarre
disappearances and deaths

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.010 align:middle line:90%
of holistic doctors.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.770 align:middle line:84%
How many people are we
talking about to date?

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: The number now
is 10, George, right now.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.740 align:middle line:84%
The last-- just maybe
10, 11 days ago--

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.874 align:middle line:84%
was found stabbed to
death in her home.

00:01:53.874 --> 00:01:54.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unbelievable.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:55.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yeah.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And most of
them, or all of them,

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.690 align:middle line:84%
have died under
mysterious circumstances?

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.880 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: As
far as we know, all

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.350 align:middle line:90%
under mysterious circumstances.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And even the ones who just--
one was found dead in his car.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.940 align:middle line:84%
And they thought, well,
maybe he had a heart attack.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.640 align:middle line:84%
The family has come
forward on the news,

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.660 align:middle line:84%
saying they want
an investigation.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.810 align:middle line:10%
His loved ones saying that they
aren't accepting this answer.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.210 align:middle line:10%
That there's no
reason he should just

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.360 align:middle line:10%
drop dead in its vehicle
that wasn't running and was--

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.106 align:middle line:10%
so yeah.

00:02:23.106 --> 00:02:24.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And Erin,
some of these people

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.670 align:middle line:84%
were being investigated
by the federal government

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.400 align:middle line:84%
or their offices
had been raided.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.682 align:middle line:84%
So some strange things have
been happening to them.

00:02:32.682 --> 00:02:33.390 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yes.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.806 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that one
I just mentioned

00:02:34.806 --> 00:02:38.070 align:middle line:84%
had had some run-ins with
the feds in the past.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And then, Dr. Bradstreet,
just before he

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.150 align:middle line:84%
died-- the first
of the 10-- yes,

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.730 align:middle line:84%
he had just had his office
raided by the feds, by the FDA,

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:47.490 align:middle line:90%
just before.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These holistic
doctors, were any of them MDs?

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.957 align:middle line:84%
Or were they just
primarily holistic?

00:02:53.957 --> 00:02:56.540 align:middle line:10%
>>ELIZABETH: I think I'd almost
say the majority-- or at least

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.470 align:middle line:10%
a good amount-- were MDs.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.670 align:middle line:10%
And we had a few DOs,
and then a couple

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.520 align:middle line:10%
of chiropractors as well,
and one holistic, very

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.580 align:middle line:10%
outspoken dentist.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, so MDs
who decided, you know what?

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.620 align:middle line:90%
I got a degree in medicine.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.860 align:middle line:84%
I've had an opportunity
over the years

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.260 align:middle line:90%
to look at what's out there.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.801 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's
something wrong.

00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:19.300 align:middle line:84%
There's something
wrong with the way

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.960 align:middle line:90%
we're trying to treat people.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to start
practicing some other way.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell people that
they can change their life

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.280 align:middle line:84%
holistically, which might mean
supplements or alternative

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.630 align:middle line:90%
forms of medicine.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.850 align:middle line:90%
So they stuck their necks out.

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.829 align:middle line:84%
And most of them were pretty
vocal in their communities

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:40.120 align:middle line:90%
where they lived, weren't they?

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.286 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yes, they were.

00:03:41.286 --> 00:03:44.940 align:middle line:84%
Some even had radio shows or did
speaking at large conferences.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.860 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, and a few
were very well-known,

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.780 align:middle line:84%
like Suzanne Somers
doctor, Nick Gonzales,

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.640 align:middle line:84%
who said a number of times
before he died, including

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.620 align:middle line:84%
in his last interview, no
less than five times that Big

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.100 align:middle line:84%
Pharma-- he'd heard-- wanted
to have him hit by a bus.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.690 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
he said that he'd

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.254 align:middle line:90%
heard they wanted him dead.

00:04:05.254 --> 00:04:06.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My niece--
and I've never

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.240 align:middle line:84%
told anybody this-- has
been a holistic doctor

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.360 align:middle line:84%
and had a huge
practice in Atlanta.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.279 align:middle line:90%
And she has disappeared.

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:19.589 align:middle line:90%
We know where she is.

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:22.780 align:middle line:84%
She has disappeared on
her own, because she

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.050 align:middle line:84%
saw what was going on with
these holistic doctors

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.810 align:middle line:90%
and feared for her own life.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:34.310 align:middle line:84%
She told us several months ago
that something was happening.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
get you involved.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.320 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
tell you about it.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.580 align:middle line:90%
But I need to get out of dodge.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:42.820 align:middle line:90%
And she's gone!

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:48.650 align:middle line:84%
We think she's in another
country, but we're not sure.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:49.400 align:middle line:90%
But it's baffling.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.160 align:middle line:90%
So this has come home to us too.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.070 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Wow.

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.560 align:middle line:84%
I hope that's she's
all right and-- yeah.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And a great
holistic doctor.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she has
taken care of people.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.430 align:middle line:84%
You know, they can't
use that word "cure."

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.610 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what
gets them in trouble.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.030 align:middle line:84%
So I will say, she
has helped a lot

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.450 align:middle line:84%
of people out of their
own particular situations.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.980 align:middle line:84%
So I can feel for
these families,

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.450 align:middle line:84%
with some of these
people who have died now.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.420 align:middle line:84%
What about those
who have vanished?

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.600 align:middle line:90%
Has that happened yet?

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.130 align:middle line:84%
Are we getting reports at all
about these holistic doctors

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.027 align:middle line:90%
are disappearing?

00:05:26.027 --> 00:05:27.610 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Well,
there are the three

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.900 align:middle line:84%
in Mexico, who we're not
sure who are holistic.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.090 align:middle line:84%
And then, there were
the two in the US.

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.700 align:middle line:84%
Most of the ones who've been
found dead were holistic.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.499 align:middle line:84%
But out of the two
missing in the US,

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:38.290 align:middle line:84%
we're not sure that
those two are holistic.

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.120 align:middle line:84%
But they did
disappear, literally,

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.320 align:middle line:84%
on the day of a few
the others' deaths.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, we'd have more
than one found dead in a day.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.880 align:middle line:84%
So on one of those, Dr.
Jeffrey Whiteside, who

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.270 align:middle line:84%
treated cancer and
a number of things--

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.930 align:middle line:90%
he was found in Wisconsin.

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.462 align:middle line:90%
And it took three weeks.

00:05:56.462 --> 00:05:58.920 align:middle line:84%
Even though they'd searched
this little peninsula for three

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.040 align:middle line:84%
weeks, suddenly,
they found him--

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.030 align:middle line:84%
with bloodhounds
and drones-- they

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.350 align:middle line:84%
found him in the same area right
where he had just walked away.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.391 align:middle line:84%
And they said that there was
a .22 caliber by his body.

00:06:09.391 --> 00:06:09.890 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:10.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How bizarre.

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.406 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: --they
did officially

00:06:12.406 --> 00:06:13.470 align:middle line:90%
rule that one a suicide.

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.610 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people
are writing me

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.510 align:middle line:84%
from that community who
aren't buying it, some of whom

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:20.410 align:middle line:90%
knew him.

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:21.812 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, it's very strange.

00:06:21.812 --> 00:06:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And it took three
weeks to find the body.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a
common denominator,

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.289 align:middle line:84%
that you know of, between all
these people who are dying?

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:30.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Well, I
wouldn't say with all.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.160 align:middle line:84%
But a number of them--
besides being outspoken--

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.410 align:middle line:84%
did use alternative
methods, like cannabis oil.

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And then, the other link that
it appears more than one used

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:48.610 align:middle line:84%
was GcMAF, which is a natural
enzyme that Dr. Bradstreet,

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:49.574 align:middle line:90%
especially, was using.

00:06:49.574 --> 00:06:50.990 align:middle line:84%
I think they were
looking for that

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:52.290 align:middle line:90%
when they rated the office.

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:54.032 align:middle line:84%
That some believe can
help with autism--

00:06:54.032 --> 00:06:55.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And fight cancers
and stuff like that.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:57.489 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: --fight
cancer as well.

00:06:57.489 --> 00:06:58.930 align:middle line:90%
Cancer, autism, yeah.

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.915 align:middle line:84%
So it's been made
illegal here in the US,

00:07:00.915 --> 00:07:02.040 align:middle line:90%
though it used to be legal.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is your theory?

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.530 align:middle line:90%
What do you think is happening?

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: I don't
know if all are linked.

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can't say
definitively that any are.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.030 align:middle line:84%
But if there are
some that are linked,

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:16.270 align:middle line:84%
I bet there's not just one
smoking gun, like GcMAF

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:19.420 align:middle line:84%
or cannabis oil, but it could be
a combination of these things.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:22.970 align:middle line:84%
That maybe they
were too vocal to--

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:25.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And somebody wants them
out of the picture-- someone.

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:26.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yeah.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:28.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To me,
whenever anything

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:33.260 align:middle line:84%
happens, it's a greed
situation, it's a "who benefits"

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.560 align:middle line:90%
situation.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:38.660 align:middle line:84%
So let's analyze for a moment--
if these doctors are dying

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:40.900 align:middle line:84%
and they're holistic
and they're getting

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:47.530 align:middle line:84%
people helped with
alternative ideas, who

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:49.030 align:middle line:90%
would be upset about that?

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:49.882 align:middle line:90%
Big Pharma?

00:07:49.882 --> 00:07:51.340 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: I
would imagine that--

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:52.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Government?

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.778 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yes.

00:07:52.778 --> 00:07:54.336 align:middle line:90%
Both of those are possibilities.

00:07:54.336 --> 00:07:55.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they would be.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:59.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And so, you quickly
just eliminate these people one

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.940 align:middle line:84%
at a time, to the
point where you then

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:05.889 align:middle line:84%
start scaring off others--
like my niece-- to stop

00:08:05.889 --> 00:08:06.930 align:middle line:90%
doing what they're doing.

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:07.860 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yes.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:10.895 align:middle line:84%
There have been other doctors
who have come to me too,

00:08:10.895 --> 00:08:13.090 align:middle line:84%
who have said they're
afraid to practice.

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to
have everybody fearful.

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.800 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand,
they want to be safe.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were one of
the first in the country,

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.370 align:middle line:84%
on Health Nut News--
and you're going

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:27.820 align:middle line:84%
to have to tell me about that
name-- who broke this story.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.230 align:middle line:90%
That's how I found out about it.

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:32.780 align:middle line:84%
Somebody sent me an email with
a link to Health Nut News.

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:33.700 align:middle line:90%
And I looked at it.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, you
had reported on, maybe,

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:40.090 align:middle line:84%
two doctors that
had been killed.

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And I said, this
is a huge story.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And we had you on
"Coast to Coast."

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, I get continuous
emails from people

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:50.800 align:middle line:84%
wanting to know what's
going on with this thing.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.270 align:middle line:84%
But it seems to
be getting larger.

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:53.686 align:middle line:84%
I think when you
were on, we we're

00:08:53.686 --> 00:08:55.540 align:middle line:84%
talking about six
or seven doctors.

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:55.850 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yeah.

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:57.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So now
we're at 10 already?

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:57.918 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yes.

00:08:57.918 --> 00:08:59.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's amazing.

00:08:59.490 --> 00:08:59.990 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:00.990 align:middle line:90%
It's surreal.

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:04.434 align:middle line:84%
I kind of feel like I'm in
the Twilight Zone some days.

00:09:04.434 --> 00:09:06.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you know,
there's that fine line.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:10.220 align:middle line:84%
You know, I am sure that there
are some doctors out there who

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:14.680 align:middle line:84%
have crossed the line,
who have tried to benefit

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:19.970 align:middle line:90%
on people's situations.

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:22.640 align:middle line:90%
And they may not be ethical.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:26.630 align:middle line:90%
They may not be above-board.

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:29.490 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't mean
you kill them, at all.

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:33.490 align:middle line:84%
But I think, by and large,
most of these holistic doctors

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:34.862 align:middle line:90%
are well-intentioned people.

00:09:34.862 --> 00:09:36.320 align:middle line:84%
Have you found that
to be the case?

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.320 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Definitely.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some of them had
books out and were just

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:44.620 align:middle line:90%
so well-known, reputable.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.600 align:middle line:84%
From researching
them, they were some

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.620 align:middle line:84%
of the best doctors
ever, even the ones

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:49.790 align:middle line:90%
who weren't as well-known.

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:52.355 align:middle line:84%
One had a radio show
and was really helping--

00:09:52.355 --> 00:09:52.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-oh!

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:53.730 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yeah.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:56.050 align:middle line:84%
--and was helping
so many people.

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:59.210 align:middle line:84%
I just can't say enough
good things about them

00:09:59.210 --> 00:09:59.960 align:middle line:90%
with the research.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have any of
these cases been solved?

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:07.470 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Well, the
first one-- Dr. Bradstreet,

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:10.580 align:middle line:84%
who definitely used GcMAF--
is still under investigation.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:13.080 align:middle line:84%
He was the one found
with the gunshot

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.220 align:middle line:84%
to his chest in a
river, very mysterious.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
think it was suicide?

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:18.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Well,
they said it--

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:19.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who shoots
themself in the chest--

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:20.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: In the chest.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.300 align:middle line:90%
It has not been--

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:21.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --with a shotgun.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:22.890 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Oh yeah.

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:25.790 align:middle line:84%
I think a local somebody
said it might be.

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:29.874 align:middle line:84%
But no, I did an exclusive
interview with the family.

00:10:29.874 --> 00:10:31.040 align:middle line:90%
They've only talked with me.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.250 align:middle line:90%
We did put that online.

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:35.130 align:middle line:90%
And it has not been ruled yet.

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:37.240 align:middle line:90%
It is still under investigation.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.254 align:middle line:84%
And the person who
made the early call,

00:10:39.254 --> 00:10:40.420 align:middle line:90%
it was just kind of a guess.

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:41.520 align:middle line:90%
He said, may be apparent.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.770 align:middle line:84%
But it has not been
officially ruled on.

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:48.620 align:middle line:84%
With Teresa Sievers-- who
was murdered in her home with

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:50.897 align:middle line:84%
a hammer, is what
they're saying on CBS--

00:10:50.897 --> 00:10:51.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nice.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:52.188 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yes.

00:10:52.188 --> 00:10:56.170 align:middle line:84%
They were two arrests just in
the last matter of days, just

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:59.000 align:middle line:84%
a couple of days-- that
these men supposedly

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000 align:middle line:90%
knew her husband.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.570 align:middle line:84%
But one, literally, called
himself "The Hammer"

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:04.480 align:middle line:90%
on his Facebook profile.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:04.980 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I heard
about that case.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:06.820 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yes.

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:07.270 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:09.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One was apparently
a friend of the husband.

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: A friend of
the husband since childhood.

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:11.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a bizarre story.

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:12.578 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yes.

00:11:12.578 --> 00:11:15.420 align:middle line:84%
And one even had a few
hammer jokes on his site.

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.330 align:middle line:90%
Some feel that it's stage.

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:20.860 align:middle line:84%
Some feel-- they're hoping
they really caught the guys.

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:22.660 align:middle line:90%
But there's so many intricacies.

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.310 align:middle line:84%
The local sheriff said,
there's way more involved,

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.104 align:middle line:84%
and books and movies
will be made about it

00:11:27.104 --> 00:11:28.020 align:middle line:90%
when it all comes out.

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:28.760 align:middle line:90%
So we don't know.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:29.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where is that case?

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:31.440 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: That is in
Florida, where I live.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:31.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Yeah,
it's in Naples area.

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:36.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
scared personally?

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:37.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Well,
they did do this.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:42.600 align:middle line:84%
Somebody put out of fake--
this CIA hit list, which I

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.190 align:middle line:90%
know-- I don't think was real.

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:46.170 align:middle line:84%
But somebody took the
time to put it together.

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And my name was on
it with the doctors

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:50.970 align:middle line:84%
as well as a holistic doctor--
I won't mention his name-- who

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:52.090 align:middle line:90%
I've been with six years.

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:52.590 align:middle line:90%
We've been--

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:54.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was my name on there?

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.290 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: It wasn't.

00:11:55.290 --> 00:12:00.640 align:middle line:84%
I was one of the only people who
wasn't a doctor who was listed.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:04.330 align:middle line:84%
And I've had some strange--
not outright threats--

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:07.117 align:middle line:84%
but, I'm going to take you
down, and some strange threats

00:12:07.117 --> 00:12:07.700 align:middle line:90%
coming my way.

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:09.283 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: From, you
think, sick people?

00:12:09.283 --> 00:12:11.480 align:middle line:90%
Or "them"?

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.340 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: I wonder--
some I think are just--

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:14.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of
sick people out there.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:15.500 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: --sick people.

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.250 align:middle line:84%
A lot of sick people
write strange things.

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:21.400 align:middle line:84%
But I have that gut feeling
that, perhaps, someone

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:25.280 align:middle line:84%
or person or persons involved
may have contacted me

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:27.396 align:middle line:84%
or commented at some
point on my pages.

00:12:27.396 --> 00:12:28.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you going to
stop doing what you're doing?

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: I'm going to
keep telling the truth.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:34.300 align:middle line:84%
I just feel that it
was the right thing

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.819 align:middle line:84%
to do-- that's just how I
am-- to get the word out

00:12:37.819 --> 00:12:38.860 align:middle line:90%
there and tell the truth.

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:42.070 align:middle line:90%
But be cautious.

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:44.026 align:middle line:90%
But I'm going to keep doing it.

00:12:44.026 --> 00:12:46.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
gotten to the point

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:48.420 align:middle line:84%
yet where holistic
doctors-- and there must

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:51.790 align:middle line:84%
be hundreds of thousands of
them in this country-- are

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:57.280 align:middle line:84%
contacting you with stories
of possible involvement

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.739 align:middle line:90%
on their own lives?

00:12:58.739 --> 00:13:00.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: I have
had a few contact

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.230 align:middle line:84%
me that have had
strange things happen.

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:05.477 align:middle line:84%
One said, numerous times, their
computer systems went down

00:13:05.477 --> 00:13:07.560 align:middle line:84%
or their numbers were all
erased from their phone.

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And that actually
happened to my phone.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:13.700 align:middle line:84%
Which some it surprised me,
because it hit close to home.

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And some are little
fearful, or their spouses

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:17.880 align:middle line:90%
are fearful and contact me.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.210 align:middle line:84%
And they're taking
extra precautions,

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:21.455 align:middle line:90%
legally carrying a weapon.

00:13:21.455 --> 00:13:22.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I
actually thought

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:25.050 align:middle line:84%
that, when you were
on my radio show,

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:27.070 align:middle line:84%
your phone was going
to get clipped.

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:27.830 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yeah.

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:29.621 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because that's
happened, when I've

00:13:29.621 --> 00:13:31.090 align:middle line:90%
had controversial guests on.

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:33.075 align:middle line:90%
All of a sudden, they're gone.

00:13:33.075 --> 00:13:33.825 align:middle line:90%
They're just gone.

00:13:33.825 --> 00:13:34.783 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Wow, yeah.

00:13:34.783 --> 00:13:36.929 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's a
weird, weird situation.

00:13:36.929 --> 00:13:37.970 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Scary, yeah.

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:40.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got a phone call
for you from Cedric in New York

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:42.275 align:middle line:84%
who wants to ask
you a question--

00:13:42.275 --> 00:13:42.860 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Sure.

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:43.776 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --about this.

00:13:43.776 --> 00:13:44.965 align:middle line:90%
So let's listen in.

00:13:44.965 --> 00:13:46.340 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Erin,
can you tell me

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:48.150 align:middle line:84%
if your research has
determined anything

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:50.500 align:middle line:84%
that the dead doctors
might have in common?

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So there's that common
denominator question again,

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:53.460 align:middle line:90%
Erin.

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:54.412 align:middle line:90%
What's there?

00:13:54.412 --> 00:13:56.620 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Besides the
fact that they were holistic

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:58.530 align:middle line:84%
and-- I mean, we
knew several of them.

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And if we didn't
know them, we seem

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:01.430 align:middle line:90%
to have friends who know them.

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:07.100 align:middle line:84%
So besides this, they were in
a pretty small-knit community,

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:09.420 align:middle line:84%
a lot of them are
well-known holistic doctors.

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:12.840 align:middle line:10%
I would say that GcMAF
or the cannabis oil

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:15.360 align:middle line:10%
or some of their
methods that they

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:18.890 align:middle line:10%
used in their practice--
that might be the link.

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:23.070 align:middle line:10%
And the GcMAF-- and I can't
say this definitively,

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:26.060 align:middle line:10%
but-- was working.

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:28.570 align:middle line:84%
Parents have come
out by the droves,

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:31.510 align:middle line:84%
saying that their
child is better

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:34.150 align:middle line:84%
from diagnosed autism
because of that

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:36.140 align:middle line:84%
or that cannabis oil
or their treatments.

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:38.210 align:middle line:84%
So some of the
controversial treatments,

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:39.500 align:middle line:90%
I think that's the main thing.

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:39.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:42.275 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: And they were
similar or the same treatments

00:14:42.275 --> 00:14:43.108 align:middle line:90%
that more and more--

00:14:43.108 --> 00:14:44.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Explain the Gc.

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: With the GcMAF--
and I'm not a scientist,

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:48.395 align:middle line:90%
I'm a journalist.

00:14:48.395 --> 00:14:49.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: But
what it would do

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:53.850 align:middle line:84%
is it can go in--
we have nagalase

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:58.600 align:middle line:84%
in our body which, if you had
high levels could cause cancer.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:02.510 align:middle line:84%
They're saying could
increase the chance

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:04.755 align:middle line:84%
of autism of
children-- increased

00:15:04.755 --> 00:15:07.100 align:middle line:90%
the amount who have autism.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And the GcMAF goes in
there and, from my--

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:12.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It just
dissolves it away?

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:14.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: It has to
do with the macrophages--

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:15.610 align:middle line:90%
or some say "macro-phay-zhes."

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:19.755 align:middle line:84%
But whatever it does, it
kills those cells and--

00:15:19.755 --> 00:15:20.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is it though?

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:21.380 align:middle line:90%
Is it--

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:25.220 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: It's made from
either human blood or bovines.

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:27.600 align:middle line:84%
So I know, in the
past, when it was

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.930 align:middle line:84%
legal in the United States,
doctors who had used

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:31.469 align:middle line:90%
it to help, even on themselves.

00:15:31.469 --> 00:15:32.510 align:middle line:90%
There are a few doctors--

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:33.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it injectable?

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: --with cancer.

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:34.710 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it's injectable.

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:36.910 align:middle line:90%
So they would inject the GcMAF.

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And they had amazing results
with people getting better

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:42.270 align:middle line:84%
from cancer, with children
getting better from autism.

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:43.339 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:15:43.339 --> 00:15:44.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yeah, it's--

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:44.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What?

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:46.948 align:middle line:84%
Are they afraid that we're
going to have a cure for cancer?

00:15:46.948 --> 00:15:48.760 align:middle line:90%
--a cheap cure for cancer?

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.851 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yeah, yeah.

00:15:50.851 --> 00:15:52.850 align:middle line:84%
That could definitely be
a definite possibility.

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:54.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, I've
always thought,

00:15:54.940 --> 00:16:00.450 align:middle line:84%
they make more money in the
treatment than in the cure.

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:03.230 align:middle line:84%
Why cure a disease when you
can make billions treating it?

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:03.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yeah.

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:05.438 align:middle line:84%
And I think they're
getting scared.

00:16:05.438 --> 00:16:07.150 align:middle line:84%
Because even
mainstream is saying--

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:08.890 align:middle line:84%
there was a PBS
article, "Does chemo

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:11.560 align:middle line:84%
help us live longer
or a better life?"

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:13.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're
questioning it now.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
could definitely

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.390 align:middle line:90%
scaring some parties.

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:19.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you know
any of these doctors

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:22.640 align:middle line:84%
prior to them getting
killed or dying?

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: I knew of many
of them and had met a few

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:26.817 align:middle line:90%
at conferences, and--

00:16:26.817 --> 00:16:28.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They seemed
like nice people?

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:28.940 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Oh, they were--

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.231 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I mean, not depressed?

00:16:30.231 --> 00:16:30.814 align:middle line:90%
Not suicidal?

00:16:30.814 --> 00:16:31.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: No, not at all.

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:35.610 align:middle line:84%
Like with Dr. Bradstreet, it
came as a huge shock to people

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:37.260 align:middle line:90%
that that would happen.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:41.700 align:middle line:84%
Or Dr. Gonzales who just
suddenly dropped dead.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:45.280 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, he
was saying that he

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.346 align:middle line:84%
had heard Big Pharma
wanted him hit by a bus.

00:16:47.346 --> 00:16:49.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he was getting
that word out there up

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:52.180 align:middle line:84%
till his last interview he
did, saying that over and over.

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:55.430 align:middle line:84%
But it was not as mysterious,
except he dropped dead.

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:57.160 align:middle line:90%
And it was a shock.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And even his clinic said that
he was healthy, that it was just

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:02.470 align:middle line:90%
a complete shock.

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:07.530 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, the ones we knew were
not suffering a depression.

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
shocking to hear things.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.198 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Princess Diana
wrote that she believed

00:17:11.198 --> 00:17:13.740 align:middle line:84%
her husband was going to have
her killed in an automobile

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:14.450 align:middle line:90%
accident.

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:16.300 align:middle line:90%
Everybody laughed at that.

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:17.869 align:middle line:90%
Look what happened to her.

00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:18.780 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yeah.

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:20.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lots of strange
things going out there.

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:22.839 align:middle line:84%
We have another
call from Michelle,

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:24.599 align:middle line:90%
in an undisclosed location.

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:25.770 align:middle line:90%
Let's listen in.

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:28.145 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm wondering what
percentage of the deceased

00:17:28.145 --> 00:17:29.335 align:middle line:90%
are holistic doctors.

00:17:29.335 --> 00:17:30.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So what about that?

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Well,
definitely it's the majority.

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:34.700 align:middle line:84%
If I had to sit
and count, I could.

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:39.390 align:middle line:84%
But I could say it's definitely
the majority, over 50%.

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:41.540 align:middle line:84%
I think, off the
top of my head, 70%.

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:43.105 align:middle line:84%
But I'd have to
look to be certain.

00:17:43.105 --> 00:17:45.660 align:middle line:90%


00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:46.880 align:middle line:90%
But it is the majority.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:51.430 align:middle line:84%
We have a few, like the one
who was found in Wisconsin, who

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:52.750 align:middle line:90%
wasn't known to be holistic.

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And another one
murdered in his home

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.870 align:middle line:84%
who we're not sure if he was
holistic or not, in Florida.

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:00.440 align:middle line:90%
But the majority were holistic.

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.023 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there
was a dentist who's

00:18:02.023 --> 00:18:03.470 align:middle line:84%
decided to go
holistic too, right?

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:05.095 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: The
dentist was outspoken,

00:18:05.095 --> 00:18:07.650 align:middle line:84%
holistic, was only 41,
was in perfect health.

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And also, his best friend--
even his fraternity brother,

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:14.590 align:middle line:84%
had to know him 20 years--
had said it didn't add up.

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:18.660 align:middle line:84%
That he ate a perfect diet,
was very vocal, outspoken,

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:20.980 align:middle line:84%
and was training
for a half marathon

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:22.665 align:middle line:84%
and found dead on
the side of the road.

00:18:22.665 --> 00:18:23.665 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's bizarre.

00:18:23.665 --> 00:18:26.530 align:middle line:90%
That's really bizarre.

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:29.730 align:middle line:84%
What can the public
do to help someone

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:32.920 align:middle line:84%
like you, as we investigate
more of these cases?

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And there are probably
going to be more.

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:37.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Yeah,
that's a good question.

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:41.290 align:middle line:84%
I think that, as
far as the public,

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:45.920 align:middle line:84%
I always appreciate when
they alert me to articles

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:46.920 align:middle line:90%
or write me.

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.740 align:middle line:84%
Some of the family members
have written me of the doctors.

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:51.990 align:middle line:84%
But it's also for
the general public--

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:54.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't want them
to live in fear.

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:58.280 align:middle line:84%
But if they have a family
member who is a holistic doctor,

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.960 align:middle line:90%
just to--

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:01.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Be alert?

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:02.190 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: --be cautious.

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:02.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just be cautious.

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:04.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Just be
alert, cautious, be aware.

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:04.889 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:04.889 --> 00:19:05.762 align:middle line:90%
So I don't want--

00:19:05.762 --> 00:19:06.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hide, like my niece.

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:08.053 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yeah, I know.

00:19:08.053 --> 00:19:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think others are
probably doing that as well.

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to cause,
like, a pandemonium.

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:15.580 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand, I
want people to be cautious.

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:19.010 align:middle line:84%
Because even after I started
writing on Dr. Bradstreet,

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:21.861 align:middle line:84%
we had more doctors
that we knew die.

00:19:21.861 --> 00:19:22.360 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, I thought for
a moment she was paranoid.

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:28.500 align:middle line:84%
Because she was
doing this before we

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:29.986 align:middle line:84%
knew about all
these dead doctors.

00:19:29.986 --> 00:19:30.861 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Oh, wow.

00:19:30.861 --> 00:19:32.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then,
all of a sudden,

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:35.040 align:middle line:84%
she started talking
about a couple of them.

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.580 align:middle line:90%
And she knew.

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:40.790 align:middle line:84%
She knew what was going
on, and off she went.

00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:42.900 align:middle line:84%
These doctors, of
course, are looking

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:44.970 align:middle line:84%
for alternative
treatments for things

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:49.640 align:middle line:84%
that mainstream medicine
either doesn't try to solve

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:51.860 align:middle line:90%
or does it in a poor way.

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:55.900 align:middle line:84%
One of these, of course, is
called Morgellons disease--

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:59.140 align:middle line:84%
which we've done numerous
radio shows on-- which

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:02.910 align:middle line:84%
is an affliction
that the CDC says,

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:04.249 align:middle line:90%
it's up in people's heads.

00:20:04.249 --> 00:20:05.040 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Right.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And these
people say, no, there's

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:08.020 align:middle line:90%
something happening to me.

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:11.640 align:middle line:84%
I can feel things
crawling under my skin.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:16.490 align:middle line:84%
I can see fibers that are
growing out of my body.

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:18.140 align:middle line:84%
What's going on
with these people?

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:20.180 align:middle line:84%
What have you discovered
about Morgellons?

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:21.638 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Well,
I didn't realize

00:20:21.638 --> 00:20:27.040 align:middle line:84%
that the phrase hadn't been
coined until 2002, by a mother.

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.290 align:middle line:90%
So you probably know all that.

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:28.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very recently.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:30.878 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Yes, so it's
been in recent years.

00:20:30.878 --> 00:20:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered that her
husband was an internist.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And of course, since
their own child

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:41.210 align:middle line:84%
had this Morgellons syndrome
and all the symptoms,

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:44.917 align:middle line:84%
they did research and, then, had
laboratories testing the fibers

00:20:44.917 --> 00:20:47.250 align:middle line:84%
or the filaments that were
coming out of people's skins.

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And you know how they
just brush that away

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:50.750 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, it's
just the cotton

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:52.120 align:middle line:90%
fibers from their shirts.

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.960 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, they're
finding those are otherworldly.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.082 align:middle line:84%
They cannot figure out
what the fibers are.

00:20:57.082 --> 00:20:58.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What they are, yeah.

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:00.415 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Because I
didn't realize that the FBI,

00:21:00.415 --> 00:21:03.130 align:middle line:84%
they can tell you from this
carpet on the ground what--

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:05.210 align:middle line:90%
if I took a fiber home with me--

00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:05.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where it was made!

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:07.531 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Where it was
made, the manufacturer.

00:21:07.531 --> 00:21:11.390 align:middle line:84%
Yet, they have every fiber
listed and categorized.

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:13.970 align:middle line:84%
Yet, they cannot figure out
where these fibers are coming

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:14.470 align:middle line:90%
from.

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:17.410 align:middle line:84%
They're not fibers
from a cotton sweater.

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:19.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you imagine
creepy-crawly things

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:20.357 align:middle line:90%
under your skin?

00:21:20.357 --> 00:21:21.690 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yeah, it's really--

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:21.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yuck!

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:22.070 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: I know.

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.350 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:24.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These people
must be going crazy.

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:26.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Yeah, it's
pretty frightening.

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:28.680 align:middle line:84%
And then, you have
celebrities like Joni Mitchell

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.580 align:middle line:84%
who said that she
feels like it's

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.200 align:middle line:90%
a disease from outer space.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.310 align:middle line:90%
That was her quote on it.

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:33.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It may be.

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:34.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yeah, I know.

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:36.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's another theory.

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:37.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It may be.

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:41.680 align:middle line:84%
Is there are a big
organization for Morgellons?

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:46.650 align:middle line:84%
Are people able to
combine themselves

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:47.870 align:middle line:90%
and try to fight this?

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:49.036 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yeah, there is.

00:21:49.036 --> 00:21:51.800 align:middle line:84%
The woman who, in 2002 kind
of coined the phrase-- they

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.050 align:middle line:90%
have a site out there.

00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And I could get the
name for the viewers.

00:21:56.210 --> 00:22:00.300 align:middle line:84%
And there are
thousands-- I had read,

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:03.500 align:middle line:84%
at one count, a 1/4 million
people around the world who

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:07.820 align:middle line:84%
are experiencing
these challenges

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:09.026 align:middle line:90%
or say they have Morgellons.

00:22:09.026 --> 00:22:11.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's got to destroy
their lives, you know.

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:11.990 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yeah, I know.

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:12.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I mean, my god--

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:14.024 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Oh,
I feel for them.

00:22:14.024 --> 00:22:18.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --to have an affliction
that nobody takes care of.

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:20.515 align:middle line:84%
And then, to have them
say, it's in your head.

00:22:20.515 --> 00:22:21.390 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Oh yeah.

00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And yet, if they get
a Western blot line

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:28.260 align:middle line:84%
test to test for borrelia, which
are the spirochetes with Lyme--

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:30.170 align:middle line:84%
which also, it
used to be, people

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:32.940 align:middle line:84%
thought that was in
their head as well.

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:35.330 align:middle line:84%
This is even on
Mayo Clinic's site.

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:37.230 align:middle line:90%
They say that there is a tie.

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:39.280 align:middle line:84%
There is a link with
Lyme and Morgellons.

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And actually, the majority
of people who have Morgellons

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:43.787 align:middle line:90%
test positive for Lyme.

00:22:43.787 --> 00:22:44.620 align:middle line:90%
So that gives some--

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:45.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Hm, that's
an interesting clue.

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:47.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Yeah,
so we don't know.

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And some believe that
they're tied together

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:51.220 align:middle line:84%
and that it's a
manifestation of the Lyme

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:54.226 align:middle line:84%
that's coming through the skin,
or they could be connected.

00:22:54.226 --> 00:22:56.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's another
affliction out there

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:58.058 align:middle line:84%
that seems to be growing--
I don't want to say,

00:22:58.058 --> 00:22:59.312 align:middle line:90%
in popularity.

00:22:59.312 --> 00:23:00.020 align:middle line:90%
But it's growing.

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:02.445 align:middle line:84%
It's called
necrotizing fasciitis.

00:23:02.445 --> 00:23:04.270 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yes.

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:06.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that the
skin-eating disease

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:07.560 align:middle line:90%
that we hear so much about?

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:07.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yes.

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:08.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Somebody
goes into a lake--

00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:09.320 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: The skin-eating--

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:11.736 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --and all of a sudden,
they're being eaten alive.

00:23:11.736 --> 00:23:13.582 align:middle line:84%
They've lost their
arms, their legs.

00:23:13.582 --> 00:23:14.290 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yes.

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:15.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What the heck is this?

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:16.510 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yeah.

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:19.070 align:middle line:84%
It's also the skin-eating or
the flesh-eating bacteria.

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:20.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's caused by a
few different bacterias.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And one is strep and
one is the vibrio.

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And what I discovered
in my research

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:26.070 align:middle line:90%
was pretty interesting.

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:28.540 align:middle line:84%
I'd send it to a
scientist friend-- a few--

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:29.560 align:middle line:90%
and they said, wow!

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And what people don't realize--
it's not only caused by strep.

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:35.680 align:middle line:84%
Like, people will have a cut on
their leg and get it in a lake.

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:39.170 align:middle line:84%
But in Florida, we had
a couple, three people

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:41.650 align:middle line:84%
die in a year in
our small county.

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:47.194 align:middle line:84%
So they're also contracting
it from the ocean.

00:23:47.194 --> 00:23:47.860 align:middle line:90%
So that's scary.

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:48.135 align:middle line:90%
You know--

00:23:48.135 --> 00:23:49.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Primarily, it's
in the water, right?

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:50.238 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yes.

00:23:50.238 --> 00:23:53.620 align:middle line:84%
So in my research, I
discovered that it's not

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:55.220 align:middle line:90%
just the strep bacteria.

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:56.380 align:middle line:90%
It's also vibrio.

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:58.929 align:middle line:84%
But with the BP
oil disaster-- we

00:23:58.929 --> 00:24:01.220 align:middle line:84%
don't like to call it a spill,
since it was the biggest

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:01.900 align:middle line:90%
spill ever.

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:03.620 align:middle line:90%
It was a huge disaster.

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:05.630 align:middle line:84%
They had the tar balls
tested after that.

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And this vibrio bacteria was,
they said, 10 to 100 times

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:12.560 align:middle line:90%
higher in these tar balls.

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:15.396 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder, since five
years ago during that spill,

00:24:15.396 --> 00:24:16.770 align:middle line:84%
since there are
published studies

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:22.680 align:middle line:84%
that show that the tar balls
had huge amounts of vibrio.

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And since vibrio can lead
to necrotizing fasciitis--

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:27.930 align:middle line:84%
if people aren't
going in the ocean--

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:29.980 align:middle line:84%
like a man this year
said he went into--

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:30.124 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:24:30.124 --> 00:24:32.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's probably spread
all over the place.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:32.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yeah.

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:33.200 align:middle line:90%
He's gone into the Gulf.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:33.990 align:middle line:90%
He was healthy.

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And even adrenal insufficiency--
it doesn't have to be, like,

00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:40.550 align:middle line:90%
renal failure or anything.

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:42.670 align:middle line:84%
You could just have
adrenal insufficiency--

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:44.250 align:middle line:84%
according to the
published studies--

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:47.060 align:middle line:84%
and go into the
water, get the vibrio.

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And then, you could get
necrotizing fasciitis.

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And it has gone up
since the BP oil spill.

00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:55.954 align:middle line:84%
You wonder what we've
done to the ocean.

00:24:55.954 --> 00:24:57.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's be a
little graphic here.

00:24:57.620 --> 00:24:58.286 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: OK.

00:24:58.286 --> 00:25:00.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Somebody goes into
a lake, they have a cut.

00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Let's say that this
bacteria gets in.

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:06.330 align:middle line:90%
What happens to them?

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:10.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Well-- and again,
not a scientist-- but it

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:13.800 align:middle line:90%
attacks all the layers.

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.109 align:middle line:84%
So it will attack
the skin, the muscle,

00:25:16.109 --> 00:25:17.150 align:middle line:90%
all the different layers.

00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:18.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
get inflamed first?

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:18.980 align:middle line:90%
Or--

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: It'll start
to eat, literally--

00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:26.100 align:middle line:84%
there could always be some,
like, strep A in the water.

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:28.480 align:middle line:84%
But if they have a
reaction, then it

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.140 align:middle line:90%
will start to eat the skin.

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:30.780 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:33.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It thrives on skin?

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:35.760 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: I think
that's a good question.

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.407 align:middle line:84%
It just, for whatever
reason, it will eat--

00:25:38.407 --> 00:25:40.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm thinking of, like,
a little Pac-Man, just going--

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:42.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Yeah,
it's kind of like that.

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, if
someone doesn't get treatment

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:47.000 align:middle line:84%
right away-- and
even if they do--

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.642 align:middle line:84%
they can still have
limbs amputated.

00:25:48.642 --> 00:25:50.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there
treatment for it?

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:52.287 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Well,
there's a treatment

00:25:52.287 --> 00:25:53.870 align:middle line:84%
that they're still
not allowed to use,

00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:55.720 align:middle line:90%
that has been around for years.

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:59.130 align:middle line:84%
This is a medical treatment that
is used for wound-cleansing.

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:03.066 align:middle line:84%
And they're saying it's
having some luck with the NF.

00:26:03.066 --> 00:26:09.790 align:middle line:84%
But also, for many years,
they'd had natural treatments.

00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And some of these names of
some of the things sound

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:13.850 align:middle line:90%
like a witch's brew.

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:17.370 align:middle line:84%
But it makes sense that,
before hospitals, when maybe it

00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:19.280 align:middle line:84%
would be even back to
indigenous people--

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.340 align:middle line:84%
would get into the
water, have a cut,

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:23.120 align:middle line:84%
and they would have
a reaction-- they

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:28.867 align:middle line:84%
have a list of all sorts
of these natural treatments

00:26:28.867 --> 00:26:29.700 align:middle line:90%
that they would use.

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And they were getting
the people better

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:33.510 align:middle line:84%
without having to
amputate their limbs.

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:36.180 align:middle line:84%
So some people are looking
into those natural techniques.

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:37.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, there
was a case of a girl,

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:39.740 align:middle line:84%
I think, who had her
arms amputated, right?

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:40.490 align:middle line:90%
--because of this.

00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:41.906 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Yeah,
I saw that one.

00:26:41.906 --> 00:26:44.804 align:middle line:84%
I think she was a zip-lining
and fell, went into the water.

00:26:44.804 --> 00:26:46.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just fell
into the water.

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:46.710 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yeah, had a--

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:47.585 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Cut herself.

00:26:47.585 --> 00:26:49.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Yeah,
young healthy girl.

00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:50.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:51.755 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who would know?

00:26:51.755 --> 00:26:53.420 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yeah, it's scary.

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:57.680 align:middle line:84%
So I hope that they find an
alternative to the amputations,

00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.210 align:middle line:84%
so that maybe she could
have kept those limbs.

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And even if it was--
that's fine, like you said.

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:07.700 align:middle line:84%
I believe in certain elements
of Western medicine too,

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:11.170 align:middle line:84%
as well as alternative-- if this
wound-cleansing solution, which

00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:16.700 align:middle line:84%
is actually an acid, were
able to go in and stop the NF,

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:19.250 align:middle line:84%
stop it from spreading and
they could save their limbs.

00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:24.230 align:middle line:84%
Or go back to the ancient
remedies that could be used.

00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:26.465 align:middle line:84%
It's better than
losing multiple limbs.

00:27:26.465 --> 00:27:27.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean,
can you imagine,

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:33.280 align:middle line:84%
Erin, somebody coming home after
a little outing at the lake,

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:35.910 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden
getting sick with-- I

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:38.890 align:middle line:84%
assume it starts off
looking like a rash.

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:40.860 align:middle line:90%
And then, off it goes.

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And a doctor says, we
need to amputate your leg.

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:46.210 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:47.240 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yes.

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:49.770 align:middle line:84%
I came across several
cases where they actually

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:51.390 align:middle line:90%
amputated all four.

00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:52.517 align:middle line:90%
So there are no hands or--

00:27:52.517 --> 00:27:53.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Would you want to live?

00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:56.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Yeah, I
don't know that I would.

00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:56.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't think I would.

00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:58.465 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Yeah, I
don't know that I would.

00:27:58.465 --> 00:28:00.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sadly, I just
don't think I would.

00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:03.570 align:middle line:84%
If they cut your two legs
off and your two arms off,

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:07.940 align:middle line:84%
and you were so used
to living with them--

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:11.110 align:middle line:84%
I just wouldn't want to be in
bed somewhere, that somebody's

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:11.610 align:middle line:90%
nursing.

00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:12.190 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Right.

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:12.910 align:middle line:90%
You would definitely be--

00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:13.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I couldn't do it.

00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:14.490 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yeah.

00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:15.657 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So that's very sad.

00:28:15.657 --> 00:28:16.365 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yes.

00:28:16.365 --> 00:28:18.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's science
doing about this?

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Well, besides
the wound-cleansing,

00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:23.605 align:middle line:84%
it seems like that's the
only thing that I had seen.

00:28:23.605 --> 00:28:25.274 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
admit it's real?

00:28:25.274 --> 00:28:26.190 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Oh, yeah.

00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:26.650 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:26.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:28.290 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: At least with
the NF, oh yeah, they--

00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:28.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unlike Morgellons.

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:30.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Unlike
Morgellons, the CDC

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:33.019 align:middle line:84%
will list-- like, that's how I
found out, in our own county,

00:28:33.019 --> 00:28:35.410 align:middle line:84%
three had died, I think
it was just in one year.

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:39.304 align:middle line:84%
Last year, three had died in
our small, beach-side community.

00:28:39.304 --> 00:28:41.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it's in the
water there somewhere.

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:41.660 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yes.

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:43.110 align:middle line:90%
And it can be in brackish water.

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:48.720 align:middle line:84%
But what gets scary is if
it were in the salt water.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:51.870 align:middle line:84%
Because you could
avoid, maybe, the lakes.

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:53.560 align:middle line:84%
OK, you're not going
to go on the lakes.

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:53.860 align:middle line:90%
But you--

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:54.225 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's everywhere.

00:28:54.225 --> 00:28:54.540 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yeah.

00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And it can be young people,
young healthy people.

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:58.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Too bad you
can't bleach it to death

00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:59.170 align:middle line:90%
or something, you know?

00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:01.211 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Well, it's
interesting you say that.

00:29:01.211 --> 00:29:03.920 align:middle line:84%
Because the wound-cleanser--
and from what

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:06.030 align:middle line:84%
I could understand quickly
reading about this,

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:06.820 align:middle line:90%
that was an acid.

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:09.545 align:middle line:84%
They said, it's similar to
how chlorine reacts in water.

00:29:09.545 --> 00:29:10.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A-hah!

00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:12.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: So I think
it's funny you say that.

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:14.790 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what they're
trying to do with this.

00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:18.030 align:middle line:84%
But they can't get, I'm
sure, FDA permission yet

00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:19.300 align:middle line:90%
to use it for NF.

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:23.440 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's a better
alternative than amputation.

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:25.860 align:middle line:90%
And they should do that fast.

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:26.568 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yes.

00:29:26.568 --> 00:29:27.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My gosh.

00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:30.590 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk a little
bit about Health Nut News

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:31.800 align:middle line:90%
and what you do with that.

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:32.173 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yeah.

00:29:32.173 --> 00:29:32.923 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Go ahead.

00:29:32.923 --> 00:29:35.850 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: I'd started the
site not even two years ago.

00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And it was just to get
information out to the people,

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:42.500 align:middle line:84%
as far as weight loss or
new studies coming out,

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:45.755 align:middle line:84%
like, on fluoride, where they're
saying it causes obesity--

00:29:45.755 --> 00:29:46.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Smart, yeah.

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:47.588 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: --and ADD.

00:29:47.588 --> 00:29:53.180 align:middle line:84%
And it was really to not
talk about such, maybe,

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:55.109 align:middle line:84%
scary subjects as
we've discussed.

00:29:55.109 --> 00:29:55.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's real.

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:56.190 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yeah.

00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:57.148 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Life is scary.

00:29:57.148 --> 00:29:57.950 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yeah.

00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:00.970 align:middle line:84%
So I've just enjoyed--
now, I've been

00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:03.110 align:middle line:84%
forced to make more
YouTube videos,

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:04.160 align:middle line:90%
with the doctor stories.

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:05.460 align:middle line:90%
Because people want it.

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:08.620 align:middle line:84%
So now, I want to
have a nice balance

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:10.330 align:middle line:90%
and do more positive videos.

00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:13.690 align:middle line:84%
Because I realize that
people just need basic--

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:16.850 align:middle line:84%
they want basic
health information.

00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And even if they're
not a health nut--

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:20.950 align:middle line:84%
but they want to
know about, like, OK,

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:23.110 align:middle line:90%
how can I go more organic?

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:27.350 align:middle line:84%
How can I stop using chemicals
in my home or on my body?

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And so, I'm doing more
videos, which has been fun

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:32.370 align:middle line:84%
and, finally, gotten
over being camera shy.

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:34.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you starting
to get recognized?

00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:37.700 align:middle line:84%
Are you getting some
recognition wherever you go?

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:40.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: I hadn't
before these stories

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:42.440 align:middle line:84%
the last few
months, very rarely.

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:43.317 align:middle line:90%
But now, yes.

00:30:43.317 --> 00:30:43.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good.

00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:44.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Yeah,
that's interesting.

00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:45.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you're
doing a great job.

00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:46.170 align:middle line:90%
And you need--

00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:46.340 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Thank you.

00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:46.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --to do that.

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:48.330 align:middle line:84%
How did you come
up with the name?

00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:49.382 align:middle line:90%
Health Nut News.

00:30:49.382 --> 00:30:51.340 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: I figured
that I just would always

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:52.660 align:middle line:90%
call myself a health nut.

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'd made this parody
video about stuff.

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:57.750 align:middle line:84%
We called it something
else, another S-word

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:58.760 align:middle line:90%
that health nuts say.

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And it was kind of a
tongue-in-cheek video.

00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, you
know, I'm a health nut.

00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:03.800 align:middle line:84%
But I can't quite
come up with it.

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, I want to
bring them the latest breaking

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:06.840 align:middle line:90%
news too.

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:07.930 align:middle line:90%
And it was available.

00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:10.330 align:middle line:90%
So I thought it sounded--

00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:13.591 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And do you give
people newsletters or just

00:31:13.591 --> 00:31:14.090 align:middle line:90%
the website?

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:14.870 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:15.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: I have
the newsletters.

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:16.684 align:middle line:90%
And I give my book away free.

00:31:16.684 --> 00:31:17.850 align:middle line:90%
I've never charged from it--

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:19.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You give
your books away free?

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:20.129 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yeah.

00:31:20.129 --> 00:31:21.142 align:middle line:90%
I wrote a book on--

00:31:21.142 --> 00:31:21.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: E-books?

00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:22.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: I
have a e-book on--

00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:23.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good.

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: --significant
weight loss, overcoming Lyme.

00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:27.715 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because you'd go broke
if you published it and gave it

00:31:27.715 --> 00:31:28.779 align:middle line:90%
away on paper for free.

00:31:28.779 --> 00:31:29.570 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Right.

00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:30.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:33.060 align:middle line:84%
So I figured that
would-- it did get

00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:35.210 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people, every
day, that are signing up

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:38.160 align:middle line:84%
for the newsletter, because
they also want the book, which

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:39.080 align:middle line:90%
I give away for free.

00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And I'm happy-- I wasn't sure
what reaction I would get.

00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:43.812 align:middle line:90%
But i get a lot of letters.

00:31:43.812 --> 00:31:44.520 align:middle line:90%
That's the thing.

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.000 align:middle line:90%
The increase in letters, 1,000--

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:46.916 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's growing.

00:31:46.916 --> 00:31:49.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: --a week, which
is hard to keep up with,

00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:50.130 align:middle line:90%
with health questions.

00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:52.560 align:middle line:84%
But also thanking me that the
book has really helped them.

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:53.615 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: After you were
on "Coast to Coast,"

00:31:53.615 --> 00:31:54.672 align:middle line:90%
did you see an increase?

00:31:54.672 --> 00:31:55.880 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yes, definitely.

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:56.470 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah.

00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:56.970 align:middle line:90%
That was--

00:31:56.970 --> 00:31:58.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you were only
on just a brief moment.

00:31:58.850 --> 00:31:59.724 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Oh yeah.

00:31:59.724 --> 00:32:03.580 align:middle line:84%
I still, I think, every day
or week, have new people say,

00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:05.290 align:middle line:84%
hey, you know, that's
how they found me.

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:06.665 align:middle line:90%
So I appreciate that.

00:32:06.665 --> 00:32:08.040 align:middle line:84%
You have a lot of
fans out there.

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:10.803 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Outside of the doctors,
what's the hot topic right now?

00:32:10.803 --> 00:32:13.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: [SIGHS]
That's a good question.

00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:19.740 align:middle line:84%
With natural health, I would
say, off the top of my head--

00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:21.490 align:middle line:84%
I think with
autoimmune disorders.

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:25.240 align:middle line:84%
I think that, really, people
are-- and Morgellons aside--

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:29.240 align:middle line:84%
but whether it be
thyroid, adrenal fatigue.

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:32.670 align:middle line:84%
There's a movement where
people were, for so long,

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:35.480 align:middle line:84%
trying to-- if they have
a weight gain-- they

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:41.400 align:middle line:84%
want they want to work it off by
running so hard, going so fast.

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're trying
to get the point now

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:45.040 align:middle line:90%
where we're slowing down.

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:48.021 align:middle line:84%
And I'm doing videos on--
if people have any adrenal

00:32:48.021 --> 00:32:50.020 align:middle line:84%
fatigue, jogging and
running really fast isn't--

00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:51.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's pretty
common, by the way.

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:52.050 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Oh yeah.

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:53.010 align:middle line:90%
It's very common.

00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:55.770 align:middle line:84%
I get people every day who
write me, thyroid issues

00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:59.350 align:middle line:90%
or the hypothyroidism.

00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And so, they are saying,
look, I'm running and running.

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:04.617 align:middle line:90%
I'm not eating.

00:33:04.617 --> 00:33:05.950 align:middle line:90%
And I'm still not losing weight.

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:09.130 align:middle line:84%
And so, what I think the new
trend is, is eating healthy.

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:10.260 align:middle line:90%
You can still eat.

00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:11.490 align:middle line:90%
But also, slow down.

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:14.800 align:middle line:90%
Do yoga, Pilates, meditation.

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:18.450 align:middle line:84%
Find whatever your
spiritual beliefs are.

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And as you slow
down, you'll find--

00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:22.733 align:middle line:84%
and that's how it happened for
me-- that the weight comes off.

00:33:22.733 --> 00:33:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're
moving towards that,

00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:27.140 align:middle line:84%
instead of the
aerobics of the '80s

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:29.317 align:middle line:90%
and faster, quicker, harder.

00:33:29.317 --> 00:33:30.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you
be surprised, Erin,

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:36.549 align:middle line:84%
if tomorrow it's dead doctor
number 11 or 12 or 13?

00:33:36.549 --> 00:33:38.590 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Yeah, I wish
I could say I would be.

00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:40.900 align:middle line:84%
But it wouldn't
surprise me if we--

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:42.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you expect more?

00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:44.190 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: I'm
hoping-- every day,

00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:47.315 align:middle line:84%
I say and I write to people
that I hope there are no more.

00:33:47.315 --> 00:33:49.190 align:middle line:84%
So I don't want to say
that I'm expecting it.

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:51.560 align:middle line:84%
But it wouldn't
come as a surprise

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:56.050 align:middle line:84%
if there were more
added to the list.

00:33:56.050 --> 00:33:57.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wonder if
there's just, like,

00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:00.890 align:middle line:84%
a set group of hit
people who've been

00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:03.534 align:middle line:90%
hired to take these people out.

00:34:03.534 --> 00:34:05.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Yeah,
well even in the case

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.550 align:middle line:84%
of Teresa Sievers-- who
was an outspoken holistic

00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:09.170 align:middle line:90%
MD in Florida.

00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:10.667 align:middle line:84%
And we had many
friends in common.

00:34:10.667 --> 00:34:12.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a strange story.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:12.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yeah.

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:15.440 align:middle line:84%
The hammer man-- they say,
some called him a hit man.

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:17.219 align:middle line:84%
But the husband
hasn't been arrested.

00:34:17.219 --> 00:34:19.760 align:middle line:84%
So then the big
question is, why?

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:21.710 align:middle line:90%
If it was him, why?

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:22.710 align:middle line:90%
What was the motive?

00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:23.835 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's his motive?

00:34:23.835 --> 00:34:25.040 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yeah.

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:28.800 align:middle line:90%
So still researching.

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.260 align:middle line:90%
And it weighs heavy on my mind.

00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:33.021 align:middle line:84%
I'll sit up thinking
about it sometimes.

00:34:33.021 --> 00:34:35.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What can we do to
help publicize this for you

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:37.030 align:middle line:84%
beyond just these
kinds of interviews?

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:40.100 align:middle line:84%
Where you can get more and
more people contacting you,

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:44.090 align:middle line:84%
saying, hey, I think our
holistic doctor was just killed

00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:44.650 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:48.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what's the lag time in
hearing about these stories?

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:50.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Usually
within a day or so.

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:53.210 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes before it hits the
news, people will contact me.

00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:55.969 align:middle line:84%
And I was surprised that even
people from mainstream news

00:34:55.969 --> 00:35:00.130 align:middle line:84%
were writing me, that they have
a relative who follows my site.

00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:03.210 align:middle line:84%
That's when I knew that,
obviously, I had millions

00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:04.280 align:middle line:90%
in a month on the site.

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:08.030 align:middle line:84%
So even mainstream news was
contacting me and telling

00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:09.340 align:middle line:90%
me things before they happen.

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.410 align:middle line:90%
So there's not a long lag time.

00:35:11.410 --> 00:35:13.140 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's
just to be aware.

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:16.204 align:middle line:84%
If somebody sees that
a doctor has died,

00:35:16.204 --> 00:35:17.620 align:middle line:84%
especially if they
were holistic--

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:19.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Find out who they
were and how they died.

00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:20.140 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yeah.

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And they're welcome to contact
me with that information.

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think, again,
just to be aware.

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:29.890 align:middle line:84%
But to tell people
not to be frightened.

00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:32.370 align:middle line:84%
If they're a holistic
doctor, if they're

00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:35.000 align:middle line:84%
going to stay in practice, I
don't want to scare people out

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:35.840 align:middle line:90%
of the profession.

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:38.775 align:middle line:10%
But just to take precautions.

00:35:38.775 --> 00:35:41.770 align:middle line:10%
And as far as the general
public, again, just

00:35:41.770 --> 00:35:42.410 align:middle line:10%
to be aware.

00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:45.407 align:middle line:84%
And if they see more deaths
happening to let people

00:35:45.407 --> 00:35:45.990 align:middle line:90%
know about it.

00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:46.906 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a story.

00:35:46.906 --> 00:35:48.530 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to shake
your hand goodbye.

00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:50.820 align:middle line:84%
But with us talking
about Morgellons

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:52.907 align:middle line:90%
and necrotizing fasciitis--

00:35:52.907 --> 00:35:53.740 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: I know.

00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:54.430 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:55.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't
want to touch you.

00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:56.493 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: I know.

00:35:56.493 --> 00:35:57.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:57.050 --> 00:35:58.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Even though
I'm sure you're fine.

00:35:58.440 --> 00:35:59.231 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Right.

00:35:59.231 --> 00:36:00.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, no sores.

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:00.949 align:middle line:90%
Knock wood.

00:36:00.949 --> 00:36:01.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:03.090 align:middle line:90%
And give out the website again.

00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:04.510 align:middle line:10%
>>ELIZABETH: HealthNutNews.com.

00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:04.810 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:06.280 align:middle line:10%
Erin, thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:06.790 align:middle line:10%
>>ELIZABETH: Thank you, George.

00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:07.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm honored.

00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:07.860 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:08.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know,
we're going to continue

00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:11.130 align:middle line:84%
tracking these stories
of these doctors that

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:12.850 align:middle line:90%
are dying or disappearing.

00:36:12.850 --> 00:36:14.840 align:middle line:90%
Because it is truly a tragedy.

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:19.570 align:middle line:84%
We will always cover stories
on Morgellons and NF,

00:36:19.570 --> 00:36:23.050 align:middle line:84%
this new bacterial disease
that we're hearing about.

00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:25.420 align:middle line:10%
We're going to keep
our eyes on that too.

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:26.510 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:30.504 align:middle line:10%
And you be safe,
watching "Beyond Belief."
