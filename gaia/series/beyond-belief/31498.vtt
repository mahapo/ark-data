00:00:31.654 --> 00:00:34.057 align:middle line:84%
>> And now, the host of
the nationally syndicated,

00:00:34.057 --> 00:00:36.726 align:middle line:84%
Coast to Coast
A.M. and GAIAM TV,

00:00:36.726 --> 00:00:38.962 align:middle line:84%
bring you Beyond Belief
with George Noory.

00:00:38.962 --> 00:00:40.563 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, hello there.

00:00:40.563 --> 00:00:43.066 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:47.103 align:middle line:84%
All of us, everybody in this
studio, everybody watching us

00:00:47.103 --> 00:00:51.608 align:middle line:84%
at home, possesses the
ability of psychic power.

00:00:51.608 --> 00:00:53.349 align:middle line:90%
It's within us.

00:00:53.349 --> 00:00:54.766 align:middle line:84%
And tonight on
Beyond Belief we're

00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:57.514 align:middle line:84%
going to talk with a
very special person.

00:00:57.514 --> 00:01:01.718 align:middle line:84%
A spiritual teacher, a
clairvoyant counselor,

00:01:01.718 --> 00:01:03.740 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Lauren Cielo, with us!

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.540 align:middle line:90%
Lauren!

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.134 align:middle line:90%
[Applause] How are you?

00:01:07.134 --> 00:01:07.934 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:01:07.934 --> 00:01:09.159 align:middle line:90%
It's good to see you.

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:10.193 align:middle line:90%
>> It's good to be here.

00:01:10.193 --> 00:01:12.228 align:middle line:84%
>> I've talked with
you so many times.

00:01:12.228 --> 00:01:13.296 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:13.296 --> 00:01:14.675 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what are
these presents?

00:01:14.675 --> 00:01:16.633 align:middle line:84%
>> Well those are some
crystals that I brought.

00:01:16.633 --> 00:01:20.403 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to show everyone
how to swing a pendulum.

00:01:20.403 --> 00:01:22.939 align:middle line:84%
And it's probably one of the
easiest ways for everybody

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:24.974 align:middle line:84%
to tap into their
own psychic ability.

00:01:24.974 --> 00:01:27.744 align:middle line:84%
Of course I train people, but
that could take some time.

00:01:27.744 --> 00:01:30.280 align:middle line:84%
This, you can get yes/no
answers immediately.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.549 align:middle line:90%
>> I use it as a truth detector.

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.453 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you
a funny story later

00:01:34.453 --> 00:01:36.793 align:middle line:84%
that I did at a
party, which almost

00:01:36.793 --> 00:01:41.024 align:middle line:84%
ended in disaster for the guy
that was holding the pendulum.

00:01:41.024 --> 00:01:42.591 align:middle line:90%
It's an incredible story.

00:01:42.591 --> 00:01:45.537 align:middle line:84%
What's the difference between
a psychic and someone who's

00:01:45.537 --> 00:01:47.163 align:middle line:90%
clairvoyant, or is it the same?

00:01:47.163 --> 00:01:50.501 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think the term
psychic is kind of a broad

00:01:50.501 --> 00:01:51.301 align:middle line:90%
term.

00:01:51.301 --> 00:01:53.509 align:middle line:84%
Each chakra that we
have, the seven chakras

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:56.842 align:middle line:84%
that run down the midline
of the body, each of them

00:01:56.842 --> 00:01:57.774 align:middle line:90%
can read energy.

00:01:57.774 --> 00:02:01.711 align:middle line:84%
So psychics read energy
within any chakra.

00:02:01.711 --> 00:02:02.912 align:middle line:90%
I use this chakra.

00:02:02.912 --> 00:02:04.013 align:middle line:90%
This is clairvoyance.

00:02:04.013 --> 00:02:06.014 align:middle line:90%
This is clairaudience.

00:02:06.014 --> 00:02:07.417 align:middle line:90%
This is a gut feeling.

00:02:07.417 --> 00:02:11.054 align:middle line:90%
So each chakra can read energy.

00:02:11.054 --> 00:02:13.423 align:middle line:90%
This one reads energy as color.

00:02:13.423 --> 00:02:16.426 align:middle line:84%
>> So when we say we have this
gut feeling about something,

00:02:16.426 --> 00:02:19.162 align:middle line:84%
is it truly emanating from
down here in this region?

00:02:19.162 --> 00:02:19.996 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:02:19.996 --> 00:02:21.316 align:middle line:90%
>> How did they ever know that?

00:02:21.316 --> 00:02:23.733 align:middle line:84%
>> Well the thing that really
gets me is how did they know

00:02:23.733 --> 00:02:25.335 align:middle line:90%
about the third eye?

00:02:25.335 --> 00:02:31.574 align:middle line:84%
Because each chakra connects
in to an organ in our body.

00:02:31.574 --> 00:02:33.998 align:middle line:84%
So what fascinates me
is the sixth chakra,

00:02:33.998 --> 00:02:36.512 align:middle line:84%
in my technique, plugs
into the pineal gland.

00:02:36.512 --> 00:02:39.549 align:middle line:84%
The pineal gland has
photoreceptors on it.

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:41.117 align:middle line:90%
So that's why I see color.

00:02:41.117 --> 00:02:44.138 align:middle line:84%
And yet they knew that thousands
of years ago before they

00:02:44.138 --> 00:02:46.756 align:middle line:84%
ever knew that there were
photoreceptors on the pineal.

00:02:46.756 --> 00:02:50.437 align:middle line:84%
So that, to me, it
kind of shows you

00:02:50.437 --> 00:02:53.963 align:middle line:84%
that we know a lot
more, maybe in the past,

00:02:53.963 --> 00:02:56.035 align:middle line:84%
than we even do now
with our technology.

00:02:56.035 --> 00:02:58.368 align:middle line:84%
>> Lauren let's talk about a
little bit about the astral

00:02:58.368 --> 00:02:59.836 align:middle line:90%
plane first of all.

00:02:59.836 --> 00:03:04.240 align:middle line:84%
When I was 11 years
old, I missed school.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.575 align:middle line:90%
I never missed school.

00:03:05.575 --> 00:03:10.146 align:middle line:84%
I never miss work, but when
I do, very rarely, it's big.

00:03:10.146 --> 00:03:13.016 align:middle line:90%
And so, I had a fever.

00:03:13.016 --> 00:03:14.816 align:middle line:90%
I woke up.

00:03:14.816 --> 00:03:17.570 align:middle line:84%
But I was bouncing on
the ceiling looking down

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:18.488 align:middle line:90%
at my body.

00:03:18.488 --> 00:03:22.058 align:middle line:84%
11 years old and
I'm going, "Whoa!

00:03:22.058 --> 00:03:23.926 align:middle line:90%
What a dream is this!

00:03:23.926 --> 00:03:25.561 align:middle line:90%
Look at me!"

00:03:25.561 --> 00:03:30.233 align:middle line:84%
The moment I said that, it
rammed me back into the body,

00:03:30.233 --> 00:03:34.404 align:middle line:84%
jolted me, and I realized
this wasn't a dream.

00:03:34.404 --> 00:03:35.672 align:middle line:90%
This was all real.

00:03:35.672 --> 00:03:37.173 align:middle line:90%
I ran to the library.

00:03:37.173 --> 00:03:39.542 align:middle line:84%
In those days we
didn't have computers.

00:03:39.542 --> 00:03:40.877 align:middle line:90%
I go way back.

00:03:40.877 --> 00:03:44.313 align:middle line:84%
And I found a book
on astral projection

00:03:44.313 --> 00:03:45.548 align:middle line:90%
and I started reading it.

00:03:45.548 --> 00:03:48.851 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, that's
exactly what happened to me.

00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:51.354 align:middle line:90%
What is the astral plane?

00:03:51.354 --> 00:03:53.756 align:middle line:84%
>> Well to me the astral
plane is the real world.

00:03:53.756 --> 00:03:54.891 align:middle line:90%
This isn't real.

00:03:54.891 --> 00:03:56.732 align:middle line:84%
This is actually
a replica of about

00:03:56.732 --> 00:03:58.795 align:middle line:84%
the third and fourth
layer of the astral.

00:03:58.795 --> 00:04:00.396 align:middle line:90%
So there's really 12.

00:04:00.396 --> 00:04:05.068 align:middle line:84%
And if you like to hover near
the bottom of the astral plane,

00:04:05.068 --> 00:04:07.570 align:middle line:90%
it's kind of dense we might say.

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.305 align:middle line:90%
>> Algae dwellers.

00:04:09.305 --> 00:04:11.068 align:middle line:84%
[Laughing] >>
Right, right, right.

00:04:11.068 --> 00:04:13.443 align:middle line:84%
The top of the astral plane
you might think of as heaven.

00:04:13.443 --> 00:04:16.345 align:middle line:84%
So really, every single
night when we fall asleep,

00:04:16.345 --> 00:04:19.881 align:middle line:84%
our divine soul leaves the
Homosapien that we're stuck in

00:04:19.881 --> 00:04:22.251 align:middle line:84%
and it goes home to
the astral plane.

00:04:22.251 --> 00:04:25.088 align:middle line:84%
And if you remember
any of that trip home,

00:04:25.088 --> 00:04:26.356 align:middle line:90%
you'll call it a dream.

00:04:26.356 --> 00:04:28.191 align:middle line:84%
So I had somebody
call me one time

00:04:28.191 --> 00:04:30.626 align:middle line:84%
and said he'd been
bothered by nightmares.

00:04:30.626 --> 00:04:32.528 align:middle line:90%
And I said, go higher.

00:04:32.528 --> 00:04:35.198 align:middle line:84%
So literally program your
sleep to take you higher

00:04:35.198 --> 00:04:36.232 align:middle line:90%
onto the astral plane.

00:04:36.232 --> 00:04:37.472 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a good point.

00:04:37.472 --> 00:04:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>> So what's happening
with this reality,

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.451 align:middle line:84%
is we're getting ready to
move to the fifth astral,

00:04:42.451 --> 00:04:46.617 align:middle line:84%
like a replica of the fifth,
so basically all of the energy

00:04:46.617 --> 00:04:48.890 align:middle line:84%
that's hitting our planet,
that's making us really,

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.890 align:middle line:84%
really smart, our left brain,
you know, all our technology,

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.117 align:middle line:84%
it's also affecting
the right brain.

00:04:54.117 --> 00:04:55.821 align:middle line:84%
So I would say
that we're not only

00:04:55.821 --> 00:04:57.494 align:middle line:84%
becoming really,
really smart, we're

00:04:57.494 --> 00:04:59.155 align:middle line:90%
becoming really, really psychic.

00:04:59.155 --> 00:05:01.557 align:middle line:84%
I was an engineer
who moved into this.

00:05:01.557 --> 00:05:02.759 align:middle line:90%
>> You were an engineer?

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:03.185 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:03.185 --> 00:05:03.826 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely an engineer.

00:05:03.826 --> 00:05:04.743 align:middle line:90%
>> You gave it all up?

00:05:04.743 --> 00:05:05.862 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:05:05.862 --> 00:05:07.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, my parents are still
wondering why I did that.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.232 align:middle line:84%
[Laughing] >> Why
did she do that?

00:05:09.232 --> 00:05:12.903 align:middle line:84%
>> But for me, it's really like
the serpent is swallowing its

00:05:12.903 --> 00:05:13.703 align:middle line:90%
tail.

00:05:13.703 --> 00:05:15.977 align:middle line:84%
The religion and
science have now

00:05:15.977 --> 00:05:18.074 align:middle line:84%
come together in what
we call quantum physics.

00:05:18.074 --> 00:05:19.409 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay.

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:23.428 align:middle line:84%
>> So I consider myself to be
more of a, [pause] working with

00:05:23.428 --> 00:05:27.250 align:middle line:84%
quantum physics than I do, what
I would call, woo woo magic.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.728 align:middle line:84%
So, to me, it's left
brain hard science.

00:05:29.728 --> 00:05:31.020 align:middle line:90%
>> There's a science behind it.

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.155 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:05:32.155 --> 00:05:35.324 align:middle line:84%
So the astral plane is
where we really dwell.

00:05:35.324 --> 00:05:37.454 align:middle line:84%
And when we decide with
the help of our guides

00:05:37.454 --> 00:05:39.606 align:middle line:84%
that's it time to have
another incarnation,

00:05:39.606 --> 00:05:43.933 align:middle line:84%
we decide where we're going to
land, when we're going to land,

00:05:43.933 --> 00:05:47.162 align:middle line:84%
what kind of body, whether
it'll be male or female, who

00:05:47.162 --> 00:05:49.771 align:middle line:84%
our parents will be is
a huge consideration

00:05:49.771 --> 00:05:52.206 align:middle line:84%
and somebody told me
one time, "Well you

00:05:52.206 --> 00:05:54.402 align:middle line:84%
know I think I've worked
through my mom's death."

00:05:54.402 --> 00:05:56.944 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Well if you would
have worked through your mom's

00:05:56.944 --> 00:05:58.281 align:middle line:90%
death, you'd be dead."

00:05:58.281 --> 00:06:00.957 align:middle line:84%
Because you pick
your parents very,

00:06:00.957 --> 00:06:02.978 align:middle line:84%
very carefully so that
you can have the life

00:06:02.978 --> 00:06:04.020 align:middle line:90%
experience that you want.

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.155 align:middle line:84%
>> Well then I did a
good job picking mine.

00:06:06.155 --> 00:06:07.557 align:middle line:90%
Because they were best.

00:06:07.557 --> 00:06:10.725 align:middle line:84%
My mom's still alive, dad
isn't, but one of a kind,

00:06:10.725 --> 00:06:11.594 align:middle line:90%
both of them.

00:06:11.594 --> 00:06:13.863 align:middle line:84%
>> Well the thing about the
astral plane is you can,

00:06:13.863 --> 00:06:16.896 align:middle line:84%
like I said, you can program
your sleep and you can learn

00:06:16.896 --> 00:06:17.700 align:middle line:90%
whatever you want.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.269 align:middle line:84%
Because there's actually
classrooms up there.

00:06:20.269 --> 00:06:22.369 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to learn
to dance the flamenco,

00:06:22.369 --> 00:06:24.783 align:middle line:84%
you might want to ask
your guides to take you

00:06:24.783 --> 00:06:25.808 align:middle line:90%
to a flamenco master.

00:06:25.808 --> 00:06:26.609 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:06:26.609 --> 00:06:27.734 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what I'm missing!

00:06:27.734 --> 00:06:28.644 align:middle line:90%
>> [Laughter].

00:06:28.644 --> 00:06:30.727 align:middle line:84%
I understand it's a very
difficult dance to learn.

00:06:30.727 --> 00:06:32.782 align:middle line:84%
So like Mozart, we
all thought that he

00:06:32.782 --> 00:06:36.010 align:middle line:84%
was this child prodigy that
just sat down at the piano

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:37.420 align:middle line:90%
and plucked out a concerto.

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:38.220 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.858 align:middle line:84%
He did it first on
the astral and then

00:06:39.858 --> 00:06:42.191 align:middle line:84%
that made it really easy to
bring onto the Earth planet.

00:06:42.191 --> 00:06:43.459 align:middle line:84%
>> It was easy to
bring with him.

00:06:43.459 --> 00:06:45.667 align:middle line:84%
>> Think about when you're
trying to write something.

00:06:45.667 --> 00:06:48.130 align:middle line:84%
Like, for me, a new page
for my website or blog,

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.506 align:middle line:84%
I know if I've done it
on the astral the night

00:06:50.506 --> 00:06:52.902 align:middle line:84%
before because I just
type it out, you know?

00:06:52.902 --> 00:06:55.263 align:middle line:84%
If I haven't, it's like
[whispering] backspace,

00:06:55.263 --> 00:06:56.138 align:middle line:90%
backspace, backspace.

00:06:56.138 --> 00:06:58.841 align:middle line:84%
So that way you can
really start leveraging,

00:06:58.841 --> 00:07:02.245 align:middle line:84%
well you're experience here, by
understanding the real world,

00:07:02.245 --> 00:07:03.479 align:middle line:90%
which is the astral plane.

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:06.082 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what
I teach my students is

00:07:06.082 --> 00:07:09.630 align:middle line:84%
that this world isn't
real and once you

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:11.687 align:middle line:84%
learn what the real
world is about,

00:07:11.687 --> 00:07:13.522 align:middle line:84%
then you can
manipulate this world

00:07:13.522 --> 00:07:14.757 align:middle line:90%
into what you want it to be.

00:07:14.757 --> 00:07:16.158 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:07:16.158 --> 00:07:18.993 align:middle line:84%
Is it true that
when we go to sleep,

00:07:18.993 --> 00:07:21.651 align:middle line:84%
the astral body connected
to the physical body

00:07:21.651 --> 00:07:26.135 align:middle line:84%
by some silver cord, kind of
like floats above it originally

00:07:26.135 --> 00:07:29.238 align:middle line:84%
and energizes your
physical body that way?

00:07:29.238 --> 00:07:30.373 align:middle line:90%
>> That is absolutely true.

00:07:30.373 --> 00:07:32.060 align:middle line:84%
We have an astral
body that actually

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.543 align:middle line:84%
fits into our physical
body when we're awake.

00:07:34.543 --> 00:07:36.178 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you fall
asleep, have you,

00:07:36.178 --> 00:07:39.515 align:middle line:84%
you've probably felt
the falling asleep.

00:07:39.515 --> 00:07:42.051 align:middle line:84%
>> And the jarring affect
when it comes back in.

00:07:42.051 --> 00:07:43.386 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:07:43.386 --> 00:07:45.276 align:middle line:84%
So really where we
tend to want to ride

00:07:45.276 --> 00:07:47.457 align:middle line:84%
is in the center of our
head, although a lot of us

00:07:47.457 --> 00:07:48.257 align:middle line:90%
never go there.

00:07:48.257 --> 00:07:49.951 align:middle line:84%
But that's really
kind of the cockpit

00:07:49.951 --> 00:07:52.561 align:middle line:84%
or the driver's seat
of our Homosapien body.

00:07:52.561 --> 00:07:57.466 align:middle line:84%
So as we're falling asleep, we
fall down to our third chakra,

00:07:57.466 --> 00:07:59.602 align:middle line:84%
and that's the connection
between our astral body.

00:07:59.602 --> 00:08:01.631 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's the
infamous silver cord,

00:08:01.631 --> 00:08:03.506 align:middle line:84%
because once you're
silver cord gets severed.

00:08:03.506 --> 00:08:04.173 align:middle line:90%
>> You're dead.

00:08:04.173 --> 00:08:04.973 align:middle line:90%
>> You're dead.

00:08:04.973 --> 00:08:08.343 align:middle line:84%
[Laughter] >> Yet,
in the astral plane,

00:08:08.343 --> 00:08:11.957 align:middle line:84%
you could go to incredible
places, stretch that cord

00:08:11.957 --> 00:08:13.726 align:middle line:90%
and it won't break.

00:08:13.726 --> 00:08:14.526 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh no.

00:08:14.526 --> 00:08:16.085 align:middle line:84%
It'll never break
until you're ready.

00:08:16.085 --> 00:08:17.085 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:17.085 --> 00:08:17.885 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:08:17.885 --> 00:08:21.757 align:middle line:84%
And that's what scares the
living daylights out of people.

00:08:21.757 --> 00:08:24.427 align:middle line:84%
I have researched
astral projection

00:08:24.427 --> 00:08:26.762 align:middle line:84%
and there are these
planes of existence,

00:08:26.762 --> 00:08:28.998 align:middle line:84%
as you were mentioning,
you can stay at the bottom,

00:08:28.998 --> 00:08:30.699 align:middle line:90%
you can go to the top.

00:08:30.699 --> 00:08:34.337 align:middle line:84%
There are some areas that you
don't want to fool around with.

00:08:34.337 --> 00:08:37.973 align:middle line:84%
As Hereward Carrington and
Sylvan Muldoon once said,

00:08:37.973 --> 00:08:39.942 align:middle line:90%
"Get out of that plane."

00:08:39.942 --> 00:08:43.378 align:middle line:84%
Because these are entities
you don't want to be around.

00:08:43.378 --> 00:08:44.947 align:middle line:90%
Is that health?

00:08:44.947 --> 00:08:47.484 align:middle line:84%
>> Well I think that's where
we get the concept of a heaven

00:08:47.484 --> 00:08:48.284 align:middle line:90%
and hell.

00:08:48.284 --> 00:08:50.741 align:middle line:84%
But it's really
not heaven and hell

00:08:50.741 --> 00:08:52.868 align:middle line:84%
and you'll be
attracted to whatever

00:08:52.868 --> 00:08:54.657 align:middle line:90%
layer resinates with you more.

00:08:54.657 --> 00:08:57.194 align:middle line:84%
It's not that you're forced
into one if you're bad

00:08:57.194 --> 00:08:57.994 align:middle line:90%
or you're good.

00:08:57.994 --> 00:09:01.032 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like what
you're, like your friends.

00:09:01.032 --> 00:09:03.032 align:middle line:84%
Like your friends are
your friends for a reason.

00:09:03.032 --> 00:09:04.500 align:middle line:90%
You kind of, you know, have.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.369 align:middle line:84%
>> And they might have
been in many lives.

00:09:06.369 --> 00:09:07.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:10.658 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're more attracted to
the layers of the astral that

00:09:10.658 --> 00:09:12.675 align:middle line:84%
we kind of have the
same vibration with.

00:09:12.675 --> 00:09:14.499 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, what
we're trying to do

00:09:14.499 --> 00:09:15.644 align:middle line:90%
is work our way up.

00:09:15.644 --> 00:09:18.247 align:middle line:84%
If we actually go to the
highest level of the astral

00:09:18.247 --> 00:09:20.149 align:middle line:84%
when we're sleeping,
we won't remember it.

00:09:20.149 --> 00:09:23.152 align:middle line:84%
This is where, what I call,
the supreme being, archangels,

00:09:23.152 --> 00:09:25.488 align:middle line:90%
and a suited master reside.

00:09:25.488 --> 00:09:29.376 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you, as I did
when I was 11 years old,

00:09:29.376 --> 00:09:32.628 align:middle line:84%
can you wake up in
the astral plane?

00:09:32.628 --> 00:09:35.965 align:middle line:84%
Fully conscious and just
realize what you're doing

00:09:35.965 --> 00:09:37.900 align:middle line:90%
and then begin to control it.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:40.272 align:middle line:84%
And then you might
say, "Hey, I'm

00:09:40.272 --> 00:09:42.432 align:middle line:84%
going to take this
astral body and I'm

00:09:42.432 --> 00:09:44.607 align:middle line:84%
going to see what
Mars looks like?

00:09:44.607 --> 00:09:47.810 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm going to go and explore
the far side of the moon?

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:51.580 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm going to go
beyond this solar system,

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:54.517 align:middle line:84%
into the Milky Way
Galaxy in a deep way?

00:09:54.517 --> 00:09:55.885 align:middle line:90%
Can you do that?

00:09:55.885 --> 00:09:58.921 align:middle line:84%
>> Well what it really is is
since this reality is a replica

00:09:58.921 --> 00:10:03.692 align:middle line:84%
of like three and four, as
far as you go in this reality;

00:10:03.692 --> 00:10:06.128 align:middle line:84%
it's the replica
of three and four.

00:10:06.128 --> 00:10:09.628 align:middle line:84%
So, when you incarnate,
you can actually

00:10:09.628 --> 00:10:13.189 align:middle line:84%
incarnate on a world in a
completely different creation

00:10:13.189 --> 00:10:15.609 align:middle line:84%
that might be vibrating
on the seventh plane

00:10:15.609 --> 00:10:17.669 align:middle line:84%
where you would
be, have a, you'd

00:10:17.669 --> 00:10:20.042 align:middle line:84%
live in a completely
different kind of animal,

00:10:20.042 --> 00:10:24.814 align:middle line:84%
so really it's not that
you can go from this layer

00:10:24.814 --> 00:10:26.734 align:middle line:90%
to another in this body.

00:10:26.734 --> 00:10:28.651 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to get out
into your astral body

00:10:28.651 --> 00:10:29.485 align:middle line:90%
like you mentioned.

00:10:29.485 --> 00:10:30.586 align:middle line:90%
>> You must.

00:10:30.586 --> 00:10:32.421 align:middle line:84%
>> But it's way farther
than the Milky Way.

00:10:32.421 --> 00:10:33.589 align:middle line:90%
The Milky Way is still.

00:10:33.589 --> 00:10:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>> It's endless.

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:35.190 align:middle line:90%
>> It's endless.

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:36.025 align:middle line:90%
It absolutely is.

00:10:36.025 --> 00:10:38.734 align:middle line:84%
And, by the way, if
you go higher than 12,

00:10:38.734 --> 00:10:41.063 align:middle line:90%
you end up back at 1.

00:10:41.063 --> 00:10:43.732 align:middle line:90%
So it's a circle, a cycle.

00:10:43.732 --> 00:10:47.236 align:middle line:84%
>> How comes some people, I've
not had one since 11 years old,

00:10:47.236 --> 00:10:49.168 align:middle line:84%
I have tried,
Lauren, as you know,

00:10:49.168 --> 00:10:54.034 align:middle line:84%
I've had a number of guests on
to try to teach me how to redo

00:10:54.034 --> 00:10:55.878 align:middle line:90%
it, I have a block somewhere.

00:10:55.878 --> 00:10:57.012 align:middle line:90%
I can't do it.

00:10:57.012 --> 00:10:59.915 align:middle line:84%
Yet some people, like
the late Robert Monroe,

00:10:59.915 --> 00:11:01.717 align:middle line:90%
they were able to do it at will.

00:11:01.717 --> 00:11:03.786 align:middle line:90%
How come they can do that?

00:11:03.786 --> 00:11:06.508 align:middle line:84%
>> Well that's where energy
comes in and I think that's why

00:11:06.508 --> 00:11:09.144 align:middle line:84%
my background as an engineer
made it so easy for me to make

00:11:09.144 --> 00:11:11.686 align:middle line:84%
this jump, which other people
think that it's like, you know,

00:11:11.686 --> 00:11:14.764 align:middle line:84%
180 degrees out, where to me,
it's just around the corner.

00:11:14.764 --> 00:11:16.098 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:16.098 --> 00:11:18.868 align:middle line:84%
>> Because there's a little
bit of energy that might be

00:11:18.868 --> 00:11:22.705 align:middle line:84%
in your space that you got from
your childhood, from the TV,

00:11:22.705 --> 00:11:25.327 align:middle line:84%
maybe you even brought it in
from a past life where you were

00:11:25.327 --> 00:11:28.284 align:middle line:84%
really psychic and maybe it
didn't work out so well for you

00:11:28.284 --> 00:11:29.311 align:middle line:90%
in that lifetime George?

00:11:29.311 --> 00:11:30.111 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:11:30.111 --> 00:11:31.180 align:middle line:90%
>> No!

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:34.183 align:middle line:84%
>> So what I teach is how to
move the energy out of the way.

00:11:34.183 --> 00:11:35.684 align:middle line:90%
So everyone is psychic.

00:11:35.684 --> 00:11:38.420 align:middle line:84%
We all are getting psychic
impression all the time,

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:39.889 align:middle line:90%
we just don't realize it.

00:11:39.889 --> 00:11:41.809 align:middle line:84%
If I could walk around
like little Jiminy

00:11:41.809 --> 00:11:43.713 align:middle line:84%
Cricket on your shoulder
and go [whispering],

00:11:43.713 --> 00:11:46.123 align:middle line:84%
"George," that thought
was a psychic impulse

00:11:46.123 --> 00:11:47.196 align:middle line:90%
from someone else.

00:11:47.196 --> 00:11:49.265 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't your stream
of consciousness;

00:11:49.265 --> 00:11:51.084 align:middle line:84%
you got that as
a psychic impulse

00:11:51.084 --> 00:11:52.334 align:middle line:90%
that was sent by someone else.

00:11:52.334 --> 00:11:53.836 align:middle line:84%
>> Has that been you
on my little shoulder?

00:11:53.836 --> 00:11:54.603 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes it has.

00:11:54.603 --> 00:11:55.538 align:middle line:90%
>> Doing your thing, huh?

00:11:55.538 --> 00:11:56.772 align:middle line:90%
Just pushing me, guiding me.

00:11:56.772 --> 00:11:57.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Pushing you forward.

00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:58.641 align:middle line:90%
>> In that direction.

00:11:58.641 --> 00:12:01.778 align:middle line:84%
But it's an amazing ability if
you're able to do it at will,

00:12:01.778 --> 00:12:02.578 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:12:02.578 --> 00:12:03.713 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes it is.

00:12:03.713 --> 00:12:04.513 align:middle line:90%
>> How about you?

00:12:04.513 --> 00:12:05.574 align:middle line:90%
Can you do it?

00:12:05.574 --> 00:12:06.949 align:middle line:84%
>> You know I do
it all the time.

00:12:06.949 --> 00:12:08.771 align:middle line:84%
Especially when I'm
reading, I'm not

00:12:08.771 --> 00:12:11.187 align:middle line:84%
reading I'm not really
in this reality.

00:12:11.187 --> 00:12:13.891 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, the
center of our head

00:12:13.891 --> 00:12:16.073 align:middle line:84%
is really where
we're meant to ride,

00:12:16.073 --> 00:12:17.760 align:middle line:84%
and from the center
of your head,

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.862 align:middle line:84%
you can see all of
the astral plane.

00:12:19.862 --> 00:12:22.097 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm reading,
that's what I'm reading,

00:12:22.097 --> 00:12:24.567 align:middle line:84%
is the astral plane, as
well as the akashic records,

00:12:24.567 --> 00:12:27.469 align:middle line:84%
people's spirit guides,
those that have passed over.

00:12:27.469 --> 00:12:31.029 align:middle line:84%
So, I really read energy and
since everything is made out

00:12:31.029 --> 00:12:32.531 align:middle line:90%
of energy, I can read anything.

00:12:32.531 --> 00:12:33.331 align:middle line:90%
>> Super.

00:12:33.331 --> 00:12:34.443 align:middle line:90%
Let's take some questions.

00:12:34.443 --> 00:12:36.412 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Lauren Cielo.

00:12:36.412 --> 00:12:39.615 align:middle line:84%
Let's restrict it, on this
segment, to astral projection.

00:12:39.615 --> 00:12:40.850 align:middle line:90%
Yes sir?

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:44.152 align:middle line:84%
>> Hi, have you always been able
to astral project and how would

00:12:44.152 --> 00:12:48.090 align:middle line:84%
someone, like one of us normal
people, learn how to do that?

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:50.926 align:middle line:84%
>> Well you know, when I
started my psychic training,

00:12:50.926 --> 00:12:53.762 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really
consider myself psychic,

00:12:53.762 --> 00:12:55.310 align:middle line:84%
I was more of an an
athlete engineer.

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:56.110 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:58.359 align:middle line:84%
And all my classmates
are telling everybody

00:12:58.359 --> 00:12:59.734 align:middle line:84%
about all these
great experiences

00:12:59.734 --> 00:13:02.338 align:middle line:84%
they had as a child, you know,
seeing fairies or something

00:13:02.338 --> 00:13:03.138 align:middle line:90%
like.

00:13:03.138 --> 00:13:04.306 align:middle line:90%
I had nothing like that.

00:13:04.306 --> 00:13:06.875 align:middle line:84%
So, once we got
to the point where

00:13:06.875 --> 00:13:10.331 align:middle line:84%
we were visiting the astral
plane, I was like, oh my gosh,

00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:12.348 align:middle line:90%
I used to do this as a child.

00:13:12.348 --> 00:13:14.850 align:middle line:90%
You call it daydreaming, right?

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:17.597 align:middle line:84%
So that is astral
projection, literally.

00:13:17.597 --> 00:13:19.722 align:middle line:84%
SO I would say yes, I've
always been able to do it,

00:13:19.722 --> 00:13:22.224 align:middle line:84%
but nobody told me
that's what it was named.

00:13:22.224 --> 00:13:24.231 align:middle line:84%
And I'll even go further,
I'll say that you

00:13:24.231 --> 00:13:25.761 align:middle line:90%
may be more psychic than I am.

00:13:25.761 --> 00:13:28.297 align:middle line:90%
You know, like, innately.

00:13:28.297 --> 00:13:30.599 align:middle line:84%
If I were to sit down and
give you a few little tips

00:13:30.599 --> 00:13:34.370 align:middle line:84%
and techniques, you could
do what I do in a heartbeat.

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:36.972 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's unbelievable
once you do it.

00:13:36.972 --> 00:13:38.159 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's exciting!

00:13:38.159 --> 00:13:40.242 align:middle line:84%
>> The places you go, the
knowledge you come back.

00:13:40.242 --> 00:13:43.312 align:middle line:84%
I actually believe it's a
little like remote viewing,

00:13:43.312 --> 00:13:45.914 align:middle line:84%
but it helps people in their
day to day life, doesn't it?

00:13:45.914 --> 00:13:47.316 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, absolutely.

00:13:47.316 --> 00:13:49.820 align:middle line:84%
I think that's really,
you know, maybe what

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:51.387 align:middle line:90%
my work is all about.

00:13:51.387 --> 00:13:53.109 align:middle line:84%
Is to show everybody
that you don't

00:13:53.109 --> 00:13:56.908 align:middle line:84%
have to believe what the person
behind the pulpit or the podium

00:13:56.908 --> 00:13:58.387 align:middle line:84%
is telling you,
that you really do

00:13:58.387 --> 00:14:00.262 align:middle line:84%
have access to all this
information yourself?

00:14:00.262 --> 00:14:00.594 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:00.594 --> 00:14:01.394 align:middle line:90%
Just go do it.

00:14:01.394 --> 00:14:02.898 align:middle line:90%
How about some more questions?

00:14:02.898 --> 00:14:04.827 align:middle line:90%
Yes sir, right in the back.

00:14:04.827 --> 00:14:06.869 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you believe they're
using astral projection

00:14:06.869 --> 00:14:11.507 align:middle line:84%
as a government type to find
people or find anything,

00:14:11.507 --> 00:14:13.208 align:middle line:90%
you know, in this world?

00:14:13.208 --> 00:14:14.343 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:14:14.343 --> 00:14:17.313 align:middle line:84%
And I think governments
have always done that.

00:14:17.313 --> 00:14:19.791 align:middle line:84%
I think even better,
scandalers do

00:14:19.791 --> 00:14:24.953 align:middle line:84%
that, people that want to win
the lottery or pass big tests.

00:14:24.953 --> 00:14:26.055 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm going to Vegas!

00:14:26.055 --> 00:14:27.723 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter] >> Going to Vegas.

00:14:27.723 --> 00:14:28.625 align:middle line:90%
Right, right.

00:14:28.625 --> 00:14:29.458 align:middle line:90%
>> But you're right.

00:14:29.458 --> 00:14:30.592 align:middle line:90%
I think they've used it.

00:14:30.592 --> 00:14:32.259 align:middle line:84%
You know, the government
had, of course,

00:14:32.259 --> 00:14:34.384 align:middle line:84%
the Stargate Program, where
they did remote viewing

00:14:34.384 --> 00:14:37.633 align:middle line:84%
on an active way, they
said they disbanded it,

00:14:37.633 --> 00:14:40.636 align:middle line:84%
they're not using the
original people who did it,

00:14:40.636 --> 00:14:42.671 align:middle line:84%
but I suspect it's
still ongoing.

00:14:42.671 --> 00:14:44.139 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh I absolutely think so.

00:14:44.139 --> 00:14:45.441 align:middle line:90%
And think about Vegas.

00:14:45.441 --> 00:14:47.176 align:middle line:90%
Think about the pit boss.

00:14:47.176 --> 00:14:50.639 align:middle line:84%
That is a psychic warrior
there to defeat you.

00:14:50.639 --> 00:14:52.514 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you start
winning big the pit boss

00:14:52.514 --> 00:14:54.784 align:middle line:84%
and gives you the hairy
eyeball and all of a sudden

00:14:54.784 --> 00:14:55.584 align:middle line:90%
your luck changes.

00:14:55.584 --> 00:14:56.585 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:14:56.585 --> 00:14:58.253 align:middle line:84%
Or remember the
movie, "The Cooler?"

00:14:58.253 --> 00:14:59.621 align:middle line:90%
William Macy.

00:14:59.621 --> 00:15:03.334 align:middle line:84%
Where energy literally
could make or break

00:15:03.334 --> 00:15:05.027 align:middle line:90%
somebody on a winning streak?

00:15:05.027 --> 00:15:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And William Macy was
a psychic vampire.

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:12.134 align:middle line:84%
The poor guy just drained
people wherever he was

00:15:12.134 --> 00:15:17.239 align:middle line:84%
and he was hired, in the
movie, to go to hot tables,

00:15:17.239 --> 00:15:20.376 align:middle line:84%
people who were winning
money, and sit next to them.

00:15:20.376 --> 00:15:21.677 align:middle line:90%
And they'd lose.

00:15:21.677 --> 00:15:23.011 align:middle line:90%
They'd lose.

00:15:23.011 --> 00:15:25.381 align:middle line:84%
Tom and I had a story, we
went to Vegas a long time ago,

00:15:25.381 --> 00:15:27.549 align:middle line:90%
and we were playing blackjack.

00:15:27.549 --> 00:15:29.785 align:middle line:84%
And there's a little,
it was an unusual game

00:15:29.785 --> 00:15:31.913 align:middle line:84%
because they had a
wheel of fortune wheel

00:15:31.913 --> 00:15:33.550 align:middle line:84%
with it, which
they don't normally

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:34.923 align:middle line:90%
have at a blackjack table.

00:15:34.923 --> 00:15:38.293 align:middle line:84%
And a little circle where you
could put a dollar down there.

00:15:38.293 --> 00:15:42.498 align:middle line:84%
If you got a blackjack,
you got to spin the wheel

00:15:42.498 --> 00:15:44.787 align:middle line:84%
and wherever it
landed, you would also

00:15:44.787 --> 00:15:46.101 align:middle line:90%
get that extra money.

00:15:46.101 --> 00:15:49.171 align:middle line:84%
And it was from a dollar
to a thousand dollars.

00:15:49.171 --> 00:15:51.073 align:middle line:90%
For a dollar down on the table.

00:15:51.073 --> 00:15:53.203 align:middle line:84%
So Tom and I are there
playing and there's

00:15:53.203 --> 00:15:55.110 align:middle line:90%
a guy sitting between us.

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:57.246 align:middle line:84%
I got a little dollar
in the little circle

00:15:57.246 --> 00:15:58.947 align:middle line:90%
and I get a blackjack.

00:15:58.947 --> 00:16:00.048 align:middle line:90%
So I go, "Tommy!

00:16:00.048 --> 00:16:01.350 align:middle line:90%
We get to spin the wheel.

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:04.186 align:middle line:84%
Let's concentrate on
the thousand dollars,

00:16:04.186 --> 00:16:06.088 align:middle line:90%
we can move this wheel."

00:16:06.088 --> 00:16:08.090 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Alright,
I'm all for it."

00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:09.992 align:middle line:84%
And the guy in
the middle I said,

00:16:09.992 --> 00:16:11.760 align:middle line:84%
"We need three
people to do this."

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:15.798 align:middle line:84%
And he went, "This won't
work, I'm not doing it."

00:16:15.798 --> 00:16:17.266 align:middle line:90%
So I said, "Fine."

00:16:17.266 --> 00:16:20.869 align:middle line:84%
We spin the wheel, and Tommy
and I are concentrating.

00:16:20.869 --> 00:16:23.205 align:middle line:84%
You know, this is a huge
wheel and its going click,

00:16:23.205 --> 00:16:24.540 align:middle line:90%
click, click, click, click.

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:27.609 align:middle line:84%
And it's getting closer
to the thousand dollars.

00:16:27.609 --> 00:16:29.645 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at Tom
and we're concentrating,

00:16:29.645 --> 00:16:31.313 align:middle line:84%
and we're going
we're going do it.

00:16:31.313 --> 00:16:35.017 align:middle line:84%
Yet the guy in the middle
continues with his negativity.

00:16:35.017 --> 00:16:38.988 align:middle line:84%
This thing stopped one click
from the thousand dollars.

00:16:38.988 --> 00:16:40.155 align:middle line:90%
I ended up winning a dollar.

00:16:40.155 --> 00:16:41.290 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter]

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:42.991 align:middle line:90%
It really works.

00:16:42.991 --> 00:16:46.562 align:middle line:84%
The energy really works, and
I'm convinced, as you are,

00:16:46.562 --> 00:16:51.166 align:middle line:84%
government continues to
experiment and to try

00:16:51.166 --> 00:16:53.602 align:middle line:84%
and people can use it
in their everyday lives.

00:16:53.602 --> 00:16:54.937 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, absolutely.

00:16:54.937 --> 00:16:58.159 align:middle line:84%
I had one gentleman
contact me and he wanted

00:16:58.159 --> 00:17:00.751 align:middle line:84%
to know how to access
the astral plane

00:17:00.751 --> 00:17:03.479 align:middle line:84%
and he was trying
to send an e mail,

00:17:03.479 --> 00:17:05.583 align:middle line:84%
he was a hard
science guy, and he

00:17:05.583 --> 00:17:08.251 align:middle line:84%
was trying to send an e
mail to the astral plane.

00:17:08.251 --> 00:17:09.051 align:middle line:90%
>> Perfect.

00:17:09.051 --> 00:17:10.385 align:middle line:90%
>> I'd loved it of course.

00:17:10.385 --> 00:17:12.468 align:middle line:84%
And so we were talking
and he goes, "Yeah, I just

00:17:12.468 --> 00:17:15.305 align:middle line:84%
want to build a machine
that can send messages

00:17:15.305 --> 00:17:16.524 align:middle line:90%
to the astral plane."

00:17:16.524 --> 00:17:19.144 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "We already have
one." >> This is the machine.

00:17:19.144 --> 00:17:20.561 align:middle line:84%
>> [Laughter] We
already have one.

00:17:20.561 --> 00:17:21.430 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:22.865 align:middle line:90%
Let's take some more questions.

00:17:22.865 --> 00:17:24.532 align:middle line:90%
Yes ma'am?

00:17:24.532 --> 00:17:27.913 align:middle line:84%
>> Could you explain the natural
paralysis that happens with

00:17:27.913 --> 00:17:30.138 align:middle line:84%
astral projection
that scares people?

00:17:30.138 --> 00:17:31.206 align:middle line:90%
>> Good question.

00:17:31.206 --> 00:17:32.006 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:17:32.006 --> 00:17:34.376 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is your
body has to turn itself off.

00:17:34.376 --> 00:17:35.711 align:middle line:90%
It does when you sleep anyway.

00:17:35.711 --> 00:17:38.080 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise you'd be thrashing
around as you're dreaming.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:42.160 align:middle line:84%
So really it's kind of a,
like a biological mechanism

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.320 align:middle line:84%
to keep you from thrashing
while you're sleeping, I guess,

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:49.496 align:middle line:84%
so as you're astral
projecting, if you come back

00:17:49.496 --> 00:17:51.026 align:middle line:90%
before that mechanism.

00:17:51.026 --> 00:17:52.005 align:middle line:90%
>> It's jarring.

00:17:52.005 --> 00:17:52.805 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:52.805 --> 00:17:53.962 align:middle line:90%
And you can't move.

00:17:53.962 --> 00:17:54.133 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:17:54.133 --> 00:17:55.330 align:middle line:84%
You wake up and
you're like, "Ah!

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:56.632 align:middle line:90%
I can't move!" >> It's scary.

00:17:56.632 --> 00:17:57.566 align:middle line:90%
>> It is scary, right.

00:17:57.566 --> 00:17:58.867 align:middle line:90%
So that's what it really is.

00:17:58.867 --> 00:18:01.503 align:middle line:84%
It's more of a thing about
our animal that we live in.

00:18:01.503 --> 00:18:03.160 align:middle line:84%
The most important
thing to remember

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.806 align:middle line:90%
is you're not that animal.

00:18:04.806 --> 00:18:07.353 align:middle line:84%
You're the divine soul
that comes in and out

00:18:07.353 --> 00:18:08.210 align:middle line:90%
of that animal.

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:10.244 align:middle line:84%
And as you can go
to the astral plane

00:18:10.244 --> 00:18:12.189 align:middle line:84%
to learn, you want
to talk to Jesus,

00:18:12.189 --> 00:18:15.272 align:middle line:84%
you want to talk to Buddha,
whoever you want to talk to,

00:18:15.272 --> 00:18:16.251 align:middle line:90%
you want to talk to me.

00:18:16.251 --> 00:18:18.667 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to meet me on
the astral plane anytime

00:18:18.667 --> 00:18:19.721 align:middle line:90%
and we can talk.

00:18:19.721 --> 00:18:22.533 align:middle line:84%
Really while you're
gone, you can also

00:18:22.533 --> 00:18:24.226 align:middle line:90%
get a healing on your animal.

00:18:24.226 --> 00:18:27.796 align:middle line:84%
You can ask your guides,
"Hey, reprogram me."

00:18:27.796 --> 00:18:31.667 align:middle line:84%
Let's use the example of
dancing the flamenco again.

00:18:31.667 --> 00:18:34.336 align:middle line:84%
So I might tell
my healing master,

00:18:34.336 --> 00:18:35.830 align:middle line:84%
I have this big
guide I work with,

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:37.205 align:middle line:84%
his name is Onky
Yaya [phonetic],

00:18:37.205 --> 00:18:38.907 align:middle line:90%
people call him Uncle Yaya, but.

00:18:38.907 --> 00:18:40.309 align:middle line:90%
>> Onka yaya?

00:18:40.309 --> 00:18:41.243 align:middle line:90%
>> Onka yaya.

00:18:41.243 --> 00:18:42.778 align:middle line:84%
He's half Egyptian
and half Mayan.

00:18:42.778 --> 00:18:44.813 align:middle line:90%
So he's really my go-to guy.

00:18:44.813 --> 00:18:46.725 align:middle line:84%
He's one that whenever
I have a question,

00:18:46.725 --> 00:18:49.451 align:middle line:84%
he's the one that
says, "Okay, sit down.

00:18:49.451 --> 00:18:50.686 align:middle line:90%
I got to lay it out to you."

00:18:50.686 --> 00:18:52.527 align:middle line:84%
I've chewed his
ear so many times,

00:18:52.527 --> 00:18:54.456 align:middle line:84%
you know, my mom
doesn't love me.

00:18:54.456 --> 00:18:56.003 align:middle line:84%
My, you know, blah
blah, he's like,

00:18:56.003 --> 00:18:58.060 align:middle line:84%
"Okay, let's get to
the bottom of this."

00:18:58.060 --> 00:18:59.861 align:middle line:90%
So he's really my go-to guy.

00:18:59.861 --> 00:19:01.461 align:middle line:84%
So when I fall
asleep, if I wanted

00:19:01.461 --> 00:19:03.951 align:middle line:84%
to learn to dance the
flamenco, I would ask him,

00:19:03.951 --> 00:19:06.779 align:middle line:84%
"Take me to a level
of the astral plane

00:19:06.779 --> 00:19:09.805 align:middle line:84%
where I can talk to
a flamenco master

00:19:09.805 --> 00:19:15.110 align:middle line:84%
and also while I'm gone, detail
this monkey, detail my car,

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:16.960 align:middle line:84%
take all the clumsiness
out of its feet."

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:17.760 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.289 align:middle line:84%
So that when I get
back I know how

00:19:20.289 --> 00:19:22.751 align:middle line:84%
to dance the flamenco
and this body can do it.

00:19:22.751 --> 00:19:26.088 align:middle line:84%
So that's a two, I
call it astral healing,

00:19:26.088 --> 00:19:29.524 align:middle line:84%
and once my students learn
that, it changes their life.

00:19:29.524 --> 00:19:32.531 align:middle line:84%
Don't let another night go by
where you're not programming

00:19:32.531 --> 00:19:35.708 align:middle line:84%
what it is that you'll
learn, what you'll heal,

00:19:35.708 --> 00:19:40.202 align:middle line:84%
what you'll shift, both as
soul and then also your animal.

00:19:40.202 --> 00:19:42.904 align:middle line:90%
Because we're eternal spirits.

00:19:42.904 --> 00:19:46.575 align:middle line:84%
When you come back into your
body, after being asleep,

00:19:46.575 --> 00:19:50.246 align:middle line:84%
the only way you know who you
are and what incarnation you're

00:19:50.246 --> 00:19:52.969 align:middle line:84%
having is by the
information that you've

00:19:52.969 --> 00:19:54.816 align:middle line:90%
gathered in your chakras.

00:19:54.816 --> 00:19:57.319 align:middle line:84%
And each chakra has a
different vibration.

00:19:57.319 --> 00:19:59.521 align:middle line:84%
It holds different
types of information.

00:19:59.521 --> 00:20:02.491 align:middle line:84%
So, for me, to move
out of engineering

00:20:02.491 --> 00:20:04.192 align:middle line:84%
and to become a
professional psychic,

00:20:04.192 --> 00:20:07.362 align:middle line:84%
I had to reprogram a lot of the
information in my third chakra,

00:20:07.362 --> 00:20:10.666 align:middle line:84%
because that's where the
chakras that hold career.

00:20:10.666 --> 00:20:14.202 align:middle line:84%
So I had to take out all that
engineering and put in psychic.

00:20:14.202 --> 00:20:15.802 align:middle line:84%
So every night I
would go to sleep,

00:20:15.802 --> 00:20:19.107 align:middle line:84%
I would wake up more
psychic and less engineer.

00:20:19.107 --> 00:20:22.097 align:middle line:84%
>> And you'll find when you
are going to sleep that jarring

00:20:22.097 --> 00:20:25.453 align:middle line:84%
feeling that we all feel
right before we fall asleep,

00:20:25.453 --> 00:20:29.518 align:middle line:84%
is the astral body either
coming in or going out

00:20:29.518 --> 00:20:33.003 align:middle line:84%
and our consciousness is still
awake and it [smacking sound]

00:20:33.003 --> 00:20:34.756 align:middle line:90%
comes back in real fast.

00:20:34.756 --> 00:20:35.757 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:20:35.757 --> 00:20:39.129 align:middle line:84%
>> The astral body really only
comes out when you can truly

00:20:39.129 --> 00:20:40.195 align:middle line:90%
meditate it out.

00:20:40.195 --> 00:20:41.296 align:middle line:90%
Or you fall asleep.

00:20:41.296 --> 00:20:42.257 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:20:42.257 --> 00:20:44.132 align:middle line:84%
>> Lets take one more
question for Dr. Cielo.

00:20:44.132 --> 00:20:45.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes sir?

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:48.677 align:middle line:84%
>> Hi, I was really interested
in the guide that you were

00:20:48.677 --> 00:20:49.705 align:middle line:90%
talking about.

00:20:49.705 --> 00:20:52.774 align:middle line:84%
Is he waiting for you when
you leave your astral plane?

00:20:52.774 --> 00:20:54.076 align:middle line:90%
Who is he?

00:20:54.076 --> 00:20:55.343 align:middle line:90%
Where does he come from?

00:20:55.343 --> 00:20:57.846 align:middle line:90%
Just explain about him.

00:20:57.846 --> 00:20:59.981 align:middle line:84%
>> I think he asked
you to ask that.

00:20:59.981 --> 00:21:02.951 align:middle line:84%
Because he seems to work his
way into every single time

00:21:02.951 --> 00:21:04.319 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking to somebody.

00:21:04.319 --> 00:21:06.734 align:middle line:84%
So in the technique
I'm trained in,

00:21:06.734 --> 00:21:10.492 align:middle line:84%
each healer gets contracted in
what's called a healing master.

00:21:10.492 --> 00:21:12.627 align:middle line:84%
And the healing master
is specifically trained

00:21:12.627 --> 00:21:14.730 align:middle line:90%
on the astral plane to heal.

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And what we call
a healing, doesn't

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:19.370 align:middle line:84%
mean to make you better,
doesn't mean to cure you;

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:21.503 align:middle line:84%
it only means to
shift and change you.

00:21:21.503 --> 00:21:24.693 align:middle line:84%
So, to him, he's
been trained, he's

00:21:24.693 --> 00:21:27.642 align:middle line:84%
been sitting there
waiting for, my teacher,

00:21:27.642 --> 00:21:30.345 align:middle line:84%
to hook us together
in a contract.

00:21:30.345 --> 00:21:33.148 align:middle line:84%
Once that contract
was struck, I met him,

00:21:33.148 --> 00:21:34.950 align:middle line:90%
I started working with him.

00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:38.523 align:middle line:84%
His valance, in other
words what he looks like,

00:21:38.523 --> 00:21:41.946 align:middle line:84%
is a huge, muscular,
scantily clothed black man,

00:21:41.946 --> 00:21:45.186 align:middle line:84%
which was a little bit
hard for me to get used to.

00:21:45.186 --> 00:21:46.728 align:middle line:84%
[Laughter] I was
kind of like, "Whoa!

00:21:46.728 --> 00:21:49.831 align:middle line:84%
You look more like a
warrior than a healer."

00:21:49.831 --> 00:21:53.468 align:middle line:84%
And the two lifetimes that he
pulls the information from,

00:21:53.468 --> 00:21:56.772 align:middle line:84%
is his Mayan lifetime and
his Egyptian lifetime.

00:21:56.772 --> 00:21:58.366 align:middle line:90%
>> Two separate lifetimes?

00:21:58.366 --> 00:21:59.741 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, two
separate lifetimes.

00:21:59.741 --> 00:22:01.409 align:middle line:84%
And so when I first
met him, I said,

00:22:01.409 --> 00:22:03.745 align:middle line:90%
"Well why are you so muscular?"

00:22:03.745 --> 00:22:06.748 align:middle line:84%
And, it's the most
interesting, he's fantastic.

00:22:06.748 --> 00:22:09.818 align:middle line:84%
He's got all of this
crazy information.

00:22:09.818 --> 00:22:12.570 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Back in
Egypt, when they picked

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:15.311 align:middle line:84%
who would be put
into the priesthood,

00:22:15.311 --> 00:22:18.026 align:middle line:84%
they would pick
really big guys."

00:22:18.026 --> 00:22:19.788 align:middle line:84%
Because it was all
about production,

00:22:19.788 --> 00:22:21.830 align:middle line:84%
so you had to look good
standing in front of the,

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:22.864 align:middle line:90%
you know, big pyramid.

00:22:22.864 --> 00:22:25.333 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you had to
big and muscular.

00:22:25.333 --> 00:22:26.935 align:middle line:90%
So that's what he looks like.

00:22:26.935 --> 00:22:31.027 align:middle line:84%
Once I graduated, you know and
I know longer have that teacher,

00:22:31.027 --> 00:22:32.474 align:middle line:90%
he became my teacher.

00:22:32.474 --> 00:22:34.802 align:middle line:84%
So, really the way
my work goes is

00:22:34.802 --> 00:22:39.781 align:middle line:84%
I'm not really above my clients
or students, I'm before them.

00:22:39.781 --> 00:22:43.552 align:middle line:84%
So the things that I've
struggled with, with his help,

00:22:43.552 --> 00:22:46.288 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden become my
workshops and my classes.

00:22:46.288 --> 00:22:49.591 align:middle line:84%
So I'll take a question to him
and then the next couple weeks,

00:22:49.591 --> 00:22:52.494 align:middle line:84%
things start to align
for me, I figure it out,

00:22:52.494 --> 00:22:55.169 align:middle line:84%
write the workshop, and put
it up on my website to sell.

00:22:55.169 --> 00:22:55.969 align:middle line:90%
>> Super.

00:22:55.969 --> 00:22:58.099 align:middle line:84%
Lauren let's talk a little
bit about the pendulum.

00:22:58.099 --> 00:22:58.954 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay.

00:22:58.954 --> 00:23:00.496 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell us about it
and how it works,

00:23:00.496 --> 00:23:03.219 align:middle line:84%
and then I'm going to tell
my story of how I used it,

00:23:03.219 --> 00:23:05.740 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to do a little
demonstration, as well.

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:06.808 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay, perfect.

00:23:06.808 --> 00:23:08.076 align:middle line:90%
>> How does it work?

00:23:08.076 --> 00:23:11.389 align:middle line:84%
>> Well one of the things that
people get frustrated when they

00:23:11.389 --> 00:23:14.576 align:middle line:84%
try to learn the pendulum, and
I think that's really where

00:23:14.576 --> 00:23:15.684 align:middle line:90%
my work comes in.

00:23:15.684 --> 00:23:17.719 align:middle line:90%
To me it's not magic.

00:23:17.719 --> 00:23:19.187 align:middle line:90%
It's science.

00:23:19.187 --> 00:23:23.049 align:middle line:84%
So the pendulum really picks
up on little subtle energy

00:23:23.049 --> 00:23:24.860 align:middle line:90%
shifts in your space.

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:27.495 align:middle line:84%
So, of course, if you've ever
tried to swing a pendulum,

00:23:27.495 --> 00:23:30.465 align:middle line:84%
the first thing you're going to
tell me is, I don't trust it.

00:23:30.465 --> 00:23:33.068 align:middle line:84%
How do I trust that
it's working right?

00:23:33.068 --> 00:23:36.137 align:middle line:84%
So I have a fool proof
way, a scientific way,

00:23:36.137 --> 00:23:38.073 align:middle line:84%
to teach you how to
swing a pendulum.

00:23:38.073 --> 00:23:39.975 align:middle line:84%
The first thing,
and it's probably

00:23:39.975 --> 00:23:42.495 align:middle line:84%
the most difficult part
of this whole exercise,

00:23:42.495 --> 00:23:44.379 align:middle line:90%
is you have to find out.

00:23:44.379 --> 00:23:45.614 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's do this.

00:23:45.614 --> 00:23:47.582 align:middle line:84%
George, would you
take one of your hands

00:23:47.582 --> 00:23:50.145 align:middle line:84%
and feel these crystals and
decide which one you like best?

00:23:50.145 --> 00:23:51.978 align:middle line:84%
>> I like this one,
I've been admiring this,

00:23:51.978 --> 00:23:53.811 align:middle line:84%
because it looks like
a diamond, doesn't it?

00:23:53.811 --> 00:23:54.723 align:middle line:90%
>> Perfect.

00:23:54.723 --> 00:23:57.292 align:middle line:84%
So you see George picked
the stone with this hand.

00:23:57.292 --> 00:24:00.075 align:middle line:84%
We're going to call
that his receiving hand.

00:24:00.075 --> 00:24:01.742 align:middle line:84%
So that's the hardest
part to figure out

00:24:01.742 --> 00:24:04.165 align:middle line:84%
is which is your receiving hand
and which is your sending hand.

00:24:04.165 --> 00:24:06.388 align:middle line:84%
>> Now generally is your
receiving hand your strong

00:24:06.388 --> 00:24:07.353 align:middle line:90%
hand, your arm?

00:24:07.353 --> 00:24:08.603 align:middle line:90%
>> No I don't really think so.

00:24:08.603 --> 00:24:09.938 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay.

00:24:09.938 --> 00:24:12.374 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's pretty, I
think it's pretty individual.

00:24:12.374 --> 00:24:14.954 align:middle line:84%
So you have to fake
yourself out and figure out

00:24:14.954 --> 00:24:16.187 align:middle line:90%
which is your receiving hand.

00:24:16.187 --> 00:24:17.479 align:middle line:90%
>> Just to be on the safe side.

00:24:17.479 --> 00:24:18.113 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:24:18.113 --> 00:24:18.747 align:middle line:90%
>> Accurate side.

00:24:18.747 --> 00:24:19.681 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:24:19.681 --> 00:24:21.080 align:middle line:90%
So, try to fake yourself out.

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:21.880 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.786 align:middle line:84%
Maybe put some runes down
or some tarot cards or maybe

00:24:24.786 --> 00:24:27.746 align:middle line:84%
like these gemstones, and
just kind of unconsciously

00:24:27.746 --> 00:24:30.625 align:middle line:84%
just reach up and go,
"Oh, oh I like this one.

00:24:30.625 --> 00:24:32.248 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I was doing it
with this hand."

00:24:32.248 --> 00:24:33.048 align:middle line:90%
Okay?

00:24:33.048 --> 00:24:37.265 align:middle line:84%
Then, take a pin, like
I've got one right here,

00:24:37.265 --> 00:24:41.102 align:middle line:90%
and put a big 'R' on that palm.

00:24:41.102 --> 00:24:42.604 align:middle line:90%
R. Receiving.

00:24:42.604 --> 00:24:47.309 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
put a P. Pendulum.

00:24:47.309 --> 00:24:48.983 align:middle line:84%
That's the hand
you're always going

00:24:48.983 --> 00:24:51.713 align:middle line:84%
to put your pendulum in,
always, always, always, always.

00:24:51.713 --> 00:24:52.513 align:middle line:90%
Okay?

00:24:52.513 --> 00:24:56.344 align:middle line:84%
And then take a marker and put
on your hand, a negative sign,

00:24:56.344 --> 00:25:00.187 align:middle line:84%
on your index finger, positive
on your middle finger,

00:25:00.187 --> 00:25:04.228 align:middle line:84%
negative on ring, and positive
on pinky, and then a zero

00:25:04.228 --> 00:25:07.457 align:middle line:84%
on your thumb, and now you're
ready to swing the pendulum.

00:25:07.457 --> 00:25:08.257 align:middle line:90%
Okay?

00:25:08.257 --> 00:25:09.057 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:25:09.057 --> 00:25:13.281 align:middle line:84%
[Pause] The pluses and
minus equal polarity

00:25:13.281 --> 00:25:17.038 align:middle line:84%
on my hands and that's
how everybody's hand is.

00:25:17.038 --> 00:25:18.873 align:middle line:84%
Positive, negative,
positive, negative.

00:25:18.873 --> 00:25:20.442 align:middle line:90%
Both hands, right?

00:25:20.442 --> 00:25:25.146 align:middle line:84%
So knowing that, when you hold
the pendulum in your P hand,

00:25:25.146 --> 00:25:27.849 align:middle line:84%
you have to hold it
with a negative charge.

00:25:27.849 --> 00:25:30.385 align:middle line:84%
So it has to be a positive,
a negative, and a neutral.

00:25:30.385 --> 00:25:33.521 align:middle line:84%
So you have to hold it with
three fingers, only three.

00:25:33.521 --> 00:25:34.655 align:middle line:90%
Not two.

00:25:34.655 --> 00:25:35.790 align:middle line:90%
Always three.

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:36.590 align:middle line:90%
Okay?

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:37.892 align:middle line:90%
So this is how you do it.

00:25:37.892 --> 00:25:40.268 align:middle line:84%
Now that you've got the
positive and negative

00:25:40.268 --> 00:25:43.032 align:middle line:84%
on your other hand, you'll
know how this pendulum says yes

00:25:43.032 --> 00:25:43.832 align:middle line:90%
and no.

00:25:43.832 --> 00:25:46.134 align:middle line:84%
Because that's all it can
tell you is yes, no, or maybe.

00:25:46.134 --> 00:25:46.935 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:25:46.935 --> 00:25:47.802 align:middle line:90%
>> To questions or thoughts.

00:25:47.802 --> 00:25:48.468 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:48.468 --> 00:25:49.137 align:middle line:90%
To questions.

00:25:49.137 --> 00:25:50.047 align:middle line:84%
Once you've gotten
to this point you're

00:25:50.047 --> 00:25:52.574 align:middle line:84%
well on your way to swinging
the pendulum accurately.

00:25:52.574 --> 00:25:56.044 align:middle line:84%
Each pendulum will
swing different for you.

00:25:56.044 --> 00:25:57.779 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's remarkable
how it works.

00:25:57.779 --> 00:25:59.571 align:middle line:84%
[Dr. Cielo laughter]
It's scary remarkable.

00:25:59.571 --> 00:26:00.715 align:middle line:90%
>> It is weird.

00:26:00.715 --> 00:26:02.845 align:middle line:84%
So this pendulum I was
playing with in the back

00:26:02.845 --> 00:26:06.254 align:middle line:84%
and it swings like the pendulum
I use at home, so just hold it,

00:26:06.254 --> 00:26:09.062 align:middle line:84%
remember you have to have
three fingers to cancel out

00:26:09.062 --> 00:26:11.259 align:middle line:90%
any charge on the pendulum.

00:26:11.259 --> 00:26:14.295 align:middle line:84%
And then you open your hand,
this is only for the first time

00:26:14.295 --> 00:26:17.032 align:middle line:84%
to figure out how that
pendulum talks to me.

00:26:17.032 --> 00:26:19.000 align:middle line:84%
It was always talk
to me the same way,

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.080 align:middle line:90%
once I learn a pendulum.

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:20.880 align:middle line:90%
Okay?

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.592 align:middle line:84%
So this is how you finally
learn positive and negative

00:26:23.592 --> 00:26:25.306 align:middle line:84%
the first time
you play with one.

00:26:25.306 --> 00:26:28.149 align:middle line:84%
You hold your hand that's got
the positive and negative and

00:26:28.149 --> 00:26:30.055 align:middle line:90%
neutral written on it.

00:26:30.055 --> 00:26:32.347 align:middle line:84%
You take the pendulum and
you hold it over the negative

00:26:32.347 --> 00:26:34.416 align:middle line:90%
and it starts to swing No.

00:26:34.416 --> 00:26:37.385 align:middle line:84%
You move it over the positive
and it starts to swing Yes.

00:26:37.385 --> 00:26:39.729 align:middle line:84%
Over the negative it
instantly switches to No

00:26:39.729 --> 00:26:42.424 align:middle line:84%
and back to positive
it goes Yes.

00:26:42.424 --> 00:26:44.826 align:middle line:84%
And if you hold it over
this one, it's a maybe.

00:26:44.826 --> 00:26:46.795 align:middle line:90%
So that's it.

00:26:46.795 --> 00:26:47.595 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:26:47.595 --> 00:26:48.631 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it.

00:26:48.631 --> 00:26:51.131 align:middle line:84%
>> Always swings the same, but
you have to remember which is

00:26:51.131 --> 00:26:53.686 align:middle line:84%
your pendulum hand, because
if you hold it in this hand,

00:26:53.686 --> 00:26:55.136 align:middle line:90%
it'll be exactly opposite.

00:26:55.136 --> 00:26:57.338 align:middle line:84%
No will be yes and
yes will be no.

00:26:57.338 --> 00:27:00.349 align:middle line:84%
>> Let me show you something
and you be our teacher here,

00:27:00.349 --> 00:27:01.242 align:middle line:90%
for a second.

00:27:01.242 --> 00:27:03.945 align:middle line:90%
I've done this all my life.

00:27:03.945 --> 00:27:07.512 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how I learned
it or how I stumbled into it,

00:27:07.512 --> 00:27:08.483 align:middle line:90%
but I did.

00:27:08.483 --> 00:27:12.353 align:middle line:84%
And the technique that
I use is like you said.

00:27:12.353 --> 00:27:16.157 align:middle line:84%
This is remarkable, because
I didn't know any of this

00:27:16.157 --> 00:27:20.146 align:middle line:84%
as a science, as you do, yet
it matches up to everything

00:27:20.146 --> 00:27:21.196 align:middle line:90%
I've done with this.

00:27:21.196 --> 00:27:22.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Sweet.

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:26.366 align:middle line:84%
>> So when I was a kid I took
a piece of paper and wrote

00:27:26.366 --> 00:27:27.469 align:middle line:90%
yes/no, right?

00:27:27.469 --> 00:27:29.838 align:middle line:84%
When you say yes to
someone, what do you do?

00:27:29.838 --> 00:27:31.673 align:middle line:90%
You nod your head, up and down.

00:27:31.673 --> 00:27:33.875 align:middle line:90%
And no, you do this.

00:27:33.875 --> 00:27:35.844 align:middle line:90%
So this is what I made.

00:27:35.844 --> 00:27:37.518 align:middle line:84%
And so I said to
myself, "Okay, now I'm

00:27:37.518 --> 00:27:39.747 align:middle line:84%
going to start
asking questions."

00:27:39.747 --> 00:27:42.851 align:middle line:84%
And I would hold the
pendulum like this,

00:27:42.851 --> 00:27:47.822 align:middle line:84%
with my three fingers,
and I would think Maybe.

00:27:47.822 --> 00:27:51.125 align:middle line:84%
And you did the circle
and look what happens

00:27:51.125 --> 00:27:52.961 align:middle line:90%
to me, when I'm thinking maybe.

00:27:52.961 --> 00:27:55.497 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm not doing this
consciously, at all.

00:27:55.497 --> 00:27:56.965 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what's doing it.

00:27:56.965 --> 00:28:01.069 align:middle line:84%
And then I would think yes,
it would go back and forth,

00:28:01.069 --> 00:28:04.101 align:middle line:84%
and I would think
no and it would

00:28:04.101 --> 00:28:09.354 align:middle line:84%
go [pause] once it figures out
where no is, back and forth.

00:28:09.354 --> 00:28:10.154 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:28:10.154 --> 00:28:16.451 align:middle line:84%
And I would ask myself questions
and get answers for myself.

00:28:16.451 --> 00:28:20.555 align:middle line:84%
I don't do this much
at parties anymore.

00:28:20.555 --> 00:28:22.991 align:middle line:90%
Let me tell you what I did.

00:28:22.991 --> 00:28:25.126 align:middle line:84%
I had a, we were at a
party once, years ago,

00:28:25.126 --> 00:28:27.589 align:middle line:84%
and my buddy was there and
he was there with his wife,

00:28:27.589 --> 00:28:29.297 align:middle line:84%
and there must have
been 10 people there.

00:28:29.297 --> 00:28:31.733 align:middle line:84%
And old George pulls
out his pendulum.

00:28:31.733 --> 00:28:36.547 align:middle line:84%
And I did much like Dr.
Cielo has told us, find out

00:28:36.547 --> 00:28:38.039 align:middle line:90%
the hand that works.

00:28:38.039 --> 00:28:40.942 align:middle line:84%
I used both hands, they
seemed to work for me,

00:28:40.942 --> 00:28:44.712 align:middle line:84%
but in this particular
case we used his right hand

00:28:44.712 --> 00:28:47.782 align:middle line:84%
and I would do the yes or
no thing, I wrote it down,

00:28:47.782 --> 00:28:50.701 align:middle line:84%
and I'd start asking him
questions, about his job,

00:28:50.701 --> 00:28:51.953 align:middle line:90%
about his business.

00:28:51.953 --> 00:28:54.622 align:middle line:84%
And everybody was
laughing and drinking wine

00:28:54.622 --> 00:28:56.024 align:middle line:90%
and having a great time.

00:28:56.024 --> 00:28:57.992 align:middle line:84%
And he was saying, "My
god, that's right."

00:28:57.992 --> 00:29:00.461 align:middle line:84%
Or, "We're working
on a new product,"

00:29:00.461 --> 00:29:03.531 align:middle line:90%
and it just told you yes we are.

00:29:03.531 --> 00:29:07.461 align:middle line:84%
And then, out of the
blue, I said, "Have you

00:29:07.461 --> 00:29:09.771 align:middle line:84%
ever had an affair
on your wife?"

00:29:09.771 --> 00:29:14.542 align:middle line:84%
And it starts going like
this, just like that!

00:29:14.542 --> 00:29:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And she sees this and I think
they almost got a divorce.

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:23.251 align:middle line:84%
It was a disaster of
biblical proportions.

00:29:23.251 --> 00:29:24.063 align:middle line:90%
It works.

00:29:24.063 --> 00:29:25.687 align:middle line:90%
It works too well.

00:29:25.687 --> 00:29:28.156 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes being a
psychic at a cocktail part.

00:29:28.156 --> 00:29:30.491 align:middle line:84%
[Laughter] >> So sometimes
when people say, "Hold this,

00:29:30.491 --> 00:29:31.866 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to ask
you a question."

00:29:31.866 --> 00:29:32.994 align:middle line:90%
I just drop it.

00:29:32.994 --> 00:29:36.297 align:middle line:84%
[Laughter] >> Well see once you
know how to use your pendulum,

00:29:36.297 --> 00:29:37.938 align:middle line:90%
you can start divining right?

00:29:37.938 --> 00:29:40.188 align:middle line:84%
So if I wanted to know which
of these healing crystals

00:29:40.188 --> 00:29:42.337 align:middle line:84%
I should meditate
with right now?

00:29:42.337 --> 00:29:44.706 align:middle line:84%
So I would just, and this
is how I ask the questions.

00:29:44.706 --> 00:29:46.107 align:middle line:90%
And this helps too.

00:29:46.107 --> 00:29:49.955 align:middle line:84%
The very first question I always
ask is, "Are we communicating?"

00:29:49.955 --> 00:29:50.755 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:29:50.755 --> 00:29:55.044 align:middle line:84%
Now, this one, "Do you know
the answer to the question

00:29:55.044 --> 00:29:56.618 align:middle line:90%
I'm about to ask?"

00:29:56.618 --> 00:29:57.418 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:29:57.418 --> 00:29:58.753 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, I'm like done.

00:29:58.753 --> 00:29:59.553 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:29:59.553 --> 00:30:02.257 align:middle line:84%
It's not communicating with me
and it doesn't know the answer.

00:30:02.257 --> 00:30:03.558 align:middle line:84%
>> Alright, let me ask
you a couple of questions.

00:30:03.558 --> 00:30:05.126 align:middle line:84%
I won't embarrass you, I
won't put you on the spot.

00:30:05.126 --> 00:30:06.227 align:middle line:90%
>> [Laughter] Okay.

00:30:06.227 --> 00:30:07.328 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, don't ask me if
I've had an affair.

00:30:07.328 --> 00:30:09.036 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it truly
is a truth mechanism.

00:30:09.036 --> 00:30:10.098 align:middle line:90%
You can't stop it.

00:30:10.098 --> 00:30:11.933 align:middle line:84%
Are you enjoying
this television show?

00:30:11.933 --> 00:30:12.733 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:30:12.733 --> 00:30:14.469 align:middle line:90%
It's a huge yes.

00:30:14.469 --> 00:30:17.697 align:middle line:84%
Were you nervous before
you came out here?

00:30:17.697 --> 00:30:18.497 align:middle line:90%
Whoa!

00:30:18.497 --> 00:30:20.375 align:middle line:90%
A huge yes.

00:30:20.375 --> 00:30:21.609 align:middle line:90%
[Dr. Cielo laughing].

00:30:21.609 --> 00:30:25.346 align:middle line:84%
Am I not the best television
host you've ever met?

00:30:25.346 --> 00:30:28.216 align:middle line:90%
It better say yes!

00:30:28.216 --> 00:30:30.485 align:middle line:84%
[Laughter] It's
amazing how that works.

00:30:30.485 --> 00:30:32.754 align:middle line:84%
Where do people get little
pendulums like that?

00:30:32.754 --> 00:30:33.821 align:middle line:90%
>> On my website.

00:30:33.821 --> 00:30:35.156 align:middle line:90%
>> Perfect, and that is?

00:30:35.156 --> 00:30:38.159 align:middle line:90%
>> Goldenrosepsychic.com.

00:30:38.159 --> 00:30:39.633 align:middle line:90%
>> Super.

00:30:39.633 --> 00:30:44.675 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk a little
bit about demons.

00:30:44.675 --> 00:30:46.467 align:middle line:84%
[Pause] I've seen a
lot of possessed people

00:30:46.467 --> 00:30:49.971 align:middle line:90%
in my life who shape shift.

00:30:49.971 --> 00:30:54.642 align:middle line:84%
They go from one person
to the next, instantly.

00:30:54.642 --> 00:30:57.178 align:middle line:84%
What is a demon, as far
as you're concerned?

00:30:57.178 --> 00:31:00.581 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, in my technique we
have three types of beings.

00:31:00.581 --> 00:31:03.061 align:middle line:84%
Beings with bodies,
that's everybody

00:31:03.061 --> 00:31:04.419 align:middle line:90%
that's seated right now.

00:31:04.419 --> 00:31:06.547 align:middle line:84%
Beings without bodies,
that's everybody that's

00:31:06.547 --> 00:31:07.789 align:middle line:90%
floating around up there.

00:31:07.789 --> 00:31:09.595 align:middle line:84%
And then the supreme
being, what you

00:31:09.595 --> 00:31:11.285 align:middle line:84%
might think of God,
Buddha, whatever

00:31:11.285 --> 00:31:12.860 align:middle line:90%
your religious background is.

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:18.199 align:middle line:84%
So beings with bodies love to
channel beings without bodies.

00:31:18.199 --> 00:31:20.868 align:middle line:84%
When I was in college,
I was an athlete.

00:31:20.868 --> 00:31:25.073 align:middle line:84%
Oh my gosh, I have a
competition being that will win.

00:31:25.073 --> 00:31:25.940 align:middle line:90%
>> You have to win.

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:27.175 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:31:27.175 --> 00:31:29.977 align:middle line:84%
And, and, you know,
cutthroat, do anything to win.

00:31:29.977 --> 00:31:31.846 align:middle line:90%
Then I became an engineer.

00:31:31.846 --> 00:31:34.182 align:middle line:84%
In the board room with
the VP of engineering,

00:31:34.182 --> 00:31:37.069 align:middle line:84%
it's a little embarrassing when
your competition being comes in

00:31:37.069 --> 00:31:38.152 align:middle line:90%
and you're just like blah.

00:31:38.152 --> 00:31:39.520 align:middle line:90%
>> And you have to beat him.

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:40.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:43.725 align:middle line:84%
And so, what happens
is some people tend

00:31:43.725 --> 00:31:45.660 align:middle line:90%
to channel more than others.

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:48.596 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm working with
someone who you might consider

00:31:48.596 --> 00:31:50.598 align:middle line:84%
to be split
personality, what we do

00:31:50.598 --> 00:31:52.392 align:middle line:84%
is we start canceling
those contracts

00:31:52.392 --> 00:31:55.269 align:middle line:84%
with all of those beings
that they're channeling.

00:31:55.269 --> 00:31:56.971 align:middle line:84%
And usually beings
plug right in.

00:31:56.971 --> 00:31:58.915 align:middle line:84%
If you're an opera
singer, I bet you've

00:31:58.915 --> 00:32:01.542 align:middle line:84%
got a being that plugs
into your throat, right?

00:32:01.542 --> 00:32:04.467 align:middle line:84%
Or if you're a talk
show host, you probably

00:32:04.467 --> 00:32:06.681 align:middle line:84%
have a being that
plugs into your throat.

00:32:06.681 --> 00:32:07.648 align:middle line:84%
>> [Speaking in a high
voice] Well mine has left me

00:32:07.648 --> 00:32:08.448 align:middle line:90%
for awhile.

00:32:08.448 --> 00:32:12.470 align:middle line:84%
[Laughter] >> So
when it gets out

00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:15.106 align:middle line:84%
of control, that's
when you start

00:32:15.106 --> 00:32:17.773 align:middle line:84%
seeing people who, like
instantaneous, switch

00:32:17.773 --> 00:32:19.861 align:middle line:90%
from one energy to the other.

00:32:19.861 --> 00:32:21.796 align:middle line:90%
It's because they're channeling.

00:32:21.796 --> 00:32:24.365 align:middle line:84%
But these beings
that we channel,

00:32:24.365 --> 00:32:25.770 align:middle line:90%
they don't know good from bad.

00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:26.570 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:30.606 align:middle line:84%
That's only a construct of this
replica of the third and fourth

00:32:30.606 --> 00:32:31.406 align:middle line:90%
astral plane.

00:32:31.406 --> 00:32:32.453 align:middle line:90%
We're in duality.

00:32:32.453 --> 00:32:33.253 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:32:33.253 --> 00:32:36.611 align:middle line:84%
Good, bad, male,
female, yes, no, right?

00:32:36.611 --> 00:32:38.646 align:middle line:90%
Republican, democrat, right?

00:32:38.646 --> 00:32:41.516 align:middle line:84%
But in the real world,
there is no good or evil.

00:32:41.516 --> 00:32:44.485 align:middle line:84%
So if you keep saying, "I don't
have enough money to pay rent.

00:32:44.485 --> 00:32:46.988 align:middle line:84%
I don't have enough
money to pay rent."

00:32:46.988 --> 00:32:49.388 align:middle line:84%
All of the beings that
you have contracts

00:32:49.388 --> 00:32:51.647 align:middle line:84%
with go, "Oh, cat
bill, flat tire,

00:32:51.647 --> 00:32:54.028 align:middle line:84%
we can't have
money to pay rent."

00:32:54.028 --> 00:32:55.797 align:middle line:90%
It's not that they're bad.

00:32:55.797 --> 00:32:56.798 align:middle line:90%
They're listening to me.

00:32:56.798 --> 00:32:58.199 align:middle line:90%
I'm the boss.

00:32:58.199 --> 00:33:03.971 align:middle line:84%
So people who, so what I say is
there aren't really bad beings,

00:33:03.971 --> 00:33:05.706 align:middle line:90%
there's bad contracts.

00:33:05.706 --> 00:33:07.256 align:middle line:84%
So if you've got,
you know, maybe

00:33:07.256 --> 00:33:09.944 align:middle line:90%
you lose your train of thought.

00:33:09.944 --> 00:33:12.713 align:middle line:84%
You walk into a room and
you're like, "Why am I here?"

00:33:12.713 --> 00:33:15.349 align:middle line:90%
Chances are you're channeling.

00:33:15.349 --> 00:33:16.317 align:middle line:90%
>> And confused.

00:33:16.317 --> 00:33:17.418 align:middle line:90%
>> And confused.

00:33:17.418 --> 00:33:19.721 align:middle line:84%
>> But these demons, so you
say that they're not bad,

00:33:19.721 --> 00:33:20.521 align:middle line:90%
they're not evil.

00:33:20.521 --> 00:33:20.769 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:33:20.769 --> 00:33:23.257 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen anything in
a reading that scared me.

00:33:23.257 --> 00:33:26.111 align:middle line:84%
Now if I were to look at
your protection being,

00:33:26.111 --> 00:33:27.361 align:middle line:90%
it wouldn't look like a fairy.

00:33:27.361 --> 00:33:29.530 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't look like
a, you know, butterfly.

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:32.501 align:middle line:84%
It would be like a big bear
or a big monster or something

00:33:32.501 --> 00:33:33.301 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:33:33.301 --> 00:33:36.471 align:middle line:84%
But once I ask it to drop
its valence, you know,

00:33:36.471 --> 00:33:37.738 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't really have a body.

00:33:37.738 --> 00:33:41.092 align:middle line:84%
Once I ask it to drop that,
it looks like an angel.

00:33:41.092 --> 00:33:41.892 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:33:41.892 --> 00:33:45.046 align:middle line:84%
So there's no bad beings,
there's only bad contracts

00:33:45.046 --> 00:33:47.596 align:middle line:84%
that we're the ones
that create them and ask

00:33:47.596 --> 00:33:48.716 align:middle line:90%
the beings to sign them.

00:33:48.716 --> 00:33:52.328 align:middle line:84%
>> Well what about exorcisms,
where the Catholic Church truly

00:33:52.328 --> 00:33:56.157 align:middle line:84%
believes that they are
exorcising people to get these

00:33:56.157 --> 00:33:57.825 align:middle line:90%
bad spirits out of their system?

00:33:57.825 --> 00:34:00.482 align:middle line:84%
>> Well in my technique that
would be cancelling a bad

00:34:00.482 --> 00:34:00.761 align:middle line:90%
contract.

00:34:00.761 --> 00:34:01.596 align:middle line:90%
>> A bad contract.

00:34:01.596 --> 00:34:02.396 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep, you bet.

00:34:02.396 --> 00:34:03.965 align:middle line:90%
>> That you cut with?

00:34:03.965 --> 00:34:06.234 align:middle line:84%
>> Well I actually
had psychic tools.

00:34:06.234 --> 00:34:08.002 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to
hear how it works?

00:34:08.002 --> 00:34:08.855 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:08.855 --> 00:34:10.438 align:middle line:84%
>> So basically when
I read contracts,

00:34:10.438 --> 00:34:11.906 align:middle line:90%
I see them as scrolls.

00:34:11.906 --> 00:34:14.275 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of what
my technique teaches.

00:34:14.275 --> 00:34:16.772 align:middle line:84%
Those little teeny
metaphors that connect

00:34:16.772 --> 00:34:18.345 align:middle line:90%
your right and left brain.

00:34:18.345 --> 00:34:20.705 align:middle line:84%
So, for me, if I were
to read your contract,

00:34:20.705 --> 00:34:24.385 align:middle line:84%
I would see it as a scroll and
I can see what's written on it.

00:34:24.385 --> 00:34:26.454 align:middle line:84%
We call these the
terms and conditions.

00:34:26.454 --> 00:34:29.156 align:middle line:84%
If it's a contract for you
to play on a baseball team,

00:34:29.156 --> 00:34:31.526 align:middle line:84%
they'll be nine
signatures, right?

00:34:31.526 --> 00:34:35.129 align:middle line:84%
So, everyone who's part
of the contract signs it.

00:34:35.129 --> 00:34:38.064 align:middle line:84%
So basically all I do, if
everybody's in agreement

00:34:38.064 --> 00:34:41.011 align:middle line:84%
to cancel the contract, I
just void it, destroy it,

00:34:41.011 --> 00:34:42.769 align:middle line:90%
and the being leaves.

00:34:42.769 --> 00:34:44.873 align:middle line:84%
I've never had one
say, "I'm staying,"

00:34:44.873 --> 00:34:47.040 align:middle line:84%
because they're like, "Oh,
I'm free of the contract,

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:49.276 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go sign more." >>
And they go to the next one.

00:34:49.276 --> 00:34:50.076 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes!

00:34:50.076 --> 00:34:51.112 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:34:51.112 --> 00:34:53.581 align:middle line:84%
Could you pick someone
out of the audience

00:34:53.581 --> 00:34:55.917 align:middle line:84%
and do something
like that with them?

00:34:55.917 --> 00:34:56.717 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:34:56.717 --> 00:34:57.285 align:middle line:90%
>> You could?

00:34:57.285 --> 00:34:58.219 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:34:58.219 --> 00:34:58.953 align:middle line:84%
>> Does somebody
want to volunteer?

00:34:58.953 --> 00:34:59.954 align:middle line:90%
>> You.

00:34:59.954 --> 00:35:01.355 align:middle line:90%
>> You want to volunteer?

00:35:01.355 --> 00:35:03.758 align:middle line:90%
>> Alright, come stand up here.

00:35:03.758 --> 00:35:05.494 align:middle line:90%
Walk right up here.

00:35:05.494 --> 00:35:06.294 align:middle line:90%
What's your name?

00:35:06.294 --> 00:35:06.994 align:middle line:90%
>> Amanda.

00:35:06.994 --> 00:35:07.911 align:middle line:90%
>> And where you from?

00:35:07.911 --> 00:35:08.829 align:middle line:90%
>> I am from Longmont.

00:35:08.829 --> 00:35:10.231 align:middle line:90%
>> Alright, so.

00:35:10.231 --> 00:35:11.766 align:middle line:84%
[Inaudible background
conversation].

00:35:11.766 --> 00:35:12.566 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:35:12.566 --> 00:35:16.871 align:middle line:84%
Do you need to ask her like
a question about herself

00:35:16.871 --> 00:35:17.939 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that?

00:35:17.939 --> 00:35:18.739 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:35:18.739 --> 00:35:20.114 align:middle line:84%
>> Okay, so what
do you see here?

00:35:20.114 --> 00:35:22.143 align:middle line:84%
>> So basically you have
a transformative being.

00:35:22.143 --> 00:35:23.644 align:middle line:90%
And it vibrates to orange.

00:35:23.644 --> 00:35:25.975 align:middle line:84%
So it's, and it's
not really orange

00:35:25.975 --> 00:35:29.684 align:middle line:84%
but it's a vibration of energy
that my sixth chakra reads

00:35:29.684 --> 00:35:30.484 align:middle line:90%
as orange.

00:35:30.484 --> 00:35:32.653 align:middle line:84%
So it's right over your
shoulder right now,

00:35:32.653 --> 00:35:35.256 align:middle line:84%
so anytime you're ready
to make a big shift,

00:35:35.256 --> 00:35:37.325 align:middle line:84%
you call in this being
and she's a little female,

00:35:37.325 --> 00:35:38.492 align:middle line:90%
she's kind of a little girl.

00:35:38.492 --> 00:35:40.461 align:middle line:84%
You probably hooked up
with her as a child.

00:35:40.461 --> 00:35:41.696 align:middle line:90%
Her name is Maria.

00:35:41.696 --> 00:35:43.642 align:middle line:84%
So basically anytime
you're ready to make

00:35:43.642 --> 00:35:46.901 align:middle line:84%
a, like, a left turn or
right turn, call in Maria

00:35:46.901 --> 00:35:48.131 align:middle line:90%
and she works on your feet.

00:35:48.131 --> 00:35:50.339 align:middle line:84%
She stands over your shoulder,
but she gets your feet

00:35:50.339 --> 00:35:52.006 align:middle line:90%
moving in the right direction.

00:35:52.006 --> 00:35:53.741 align:middle line:84%
So you have a little
girl named Maria.

00:35:53.741 --> 00:35:54.976 align:middle line:90%
>> A little girl named Maria.

00:35:54.976 --> 00:35:56.477 align:middle line:90%
>> Is Maria helpful to her?

00:35:56.477 --> 00:35:58.879 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh absolutely, I get that
this is a great contract.

00:35:58.879 --> 00:36:00.559 align:middle line:84%
So talk to her
when you're looking

00:36:00.559 --> 00:36:04.785 align:middle line:84%
at Craig's List or online,
yeah, just kind of her plug in.

00:36:04.785 --> 00:36:06.955 align:middle line:84%
Especially because she
plugs in, you know,

00:36:06.955 --> 00:36:10.224 align:middle line:84%
she's a guide, a real
guide, and not all things

00:36:10.224 --> 00:36:13.160 align:middle line:84%
that we call spirit
guides are really guides.

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:14.528 align:middle line:90%
This one is.

00:36:14.528 --> 00:36:16.130 align:middle line:84%
You can trust her, she'll point
you in the right direction.

00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:16.864 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, thank you.

00:36:16.864 --> 00:36:17.739 align:middle line:90%
>> You're so welcome!

00:36:17.739 --> 00:36:18.633 align:middle line:90%
>> Good luck Amanda!

00:36:18.633 --> 00:36:19.433 align:middle line:90%
Good to see you.

00:36:19.433 --> 00:36:20.534 align:middle line:90%
>> Good to see you.

00:36:20.534 --> 00:36:24.305 align:middle line:84%
>> Now when you said,
"You can trust her."

00:36:24.305 --> 00:36:25.706 align:middle line:90%
Are there some tricksters here?

00:36:25.706 --> 00:36:26.641 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh absolutely.

00:36:26.641 --> 00:36:28.175 align:middle line:84%
And they're not
so much tricksters

00:36:28.175 --> 00:36:30.211 align:middle line:90%
as they are unevolved beings.

00:36:30.211 --> 00:36:32.435 align:middle line:84%
So I've got this
little girl, as well,

00:36:32.435 --> 00:36:35.650 align:middle line:84%
that was with me when my mom
taught me how to tie my shoe.

00:36:35.650 --> 00:36:37.685 align:middle line:90%
I can remember it, that moment.

00:36:37.685 --> 00:36:39.687 align:middle line:84%
>> And you only have
one with us or many?

00:36:39.687 --> 00:36:40.653 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh no.

00:36:40.653 --> 00:36:41.622 align:middle line:90%
Many, many, many.

00:36:41.622 --> 00:36:45.326 align:middle line:84%
So this little being, I
wouldn't ask her, you know,

00:36:45.326 --> 00:36:47.261 align:middle line:90%
should I cash out my 401K?

00:36:47.261 --> 00:36:48.663 align:middle line:90%
She has no idea.

00:36:48.663 --> 00:36:52.633 align:middle line:84%
She was with me to learn how to
tie the shoe, not to teach me,

00:36:52.633 --> 00:36:54.735 align:middle line:84%
but for my mom to
teach her, as well.

00:36:54.735 --> 00:36:56.237 align:middle line:90%
But she still hangs out with me.

00:36:56.237 --> 00:36:58.793 align:middle line:84%
So you can see she
is my spirit guide,

00:36:58.793 --> 00:37:01.260 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not going to
follow her, she watches

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:03.110 align:middle line:90%
me tie my shoes in the morning.

00:37:03.110 --> 00:37:06.247 align:middle line:84%
>> Do these little helpers,
like her little Maria,

00:37:06.247 --> 00:37:08.583 align:middle line:84%
do they influence
her personality?

00:37:08.583 --> 00:37:09.383 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:37:09.383 --> 00:37:10.651 align:middle line:90%
>> They do.

00:37:10.651 --> 00:37:13.320 align:middle line:84%
>> And you can allow it to
be more so if you want to.

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:16.524 align:middle line:84%
By bringing your contracts
into present time,

00:37:16.524 --> 00:37:17.792 align:middle line:90%
which is really important.

00:37:17.792 --> 00:37:20.294 align:middle line:84%
Like think about a relationship
contract which I read,

00:37:20.294 --> 00:37:23.064 align:middle line:84%
every reading I read
relationship contracts.

00:37:23.064 --> 00:37:25.499 align:middle line:84%
What you thought you wanted
to do with that person

00:37:25.499 --> 00:37:28.836 align:middle line:84%
when you first met them or
even before you incarnated,

00:37:28.836 --> 00:37:31.172 align:middle line:84%
may not be what
you want to do now.

00:37:31.172 --> 00:37:33.741 align:middle line:84%
So by bringing your
contracts into present time,

00:37:33.741 --> 00:37:37.578 align:middle line:84%
they're more potent and
they work better, I guess.

00:37:37.578 --> 00:37:39.747 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that why sometimes
love fizzles out?

00:37:39.747 --> 00:37:41.482 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that is, you bet.

00:37:41.482 --> 00:37:43.299 align:middle line:84%
>> And in some cases
it goes on forever.

00:37:43.299 --> 00:37:44.099 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:37:44.099 --> 00:37:45.786 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens
with our contracts,

00:37:45.786 --> 00:37:48.422 align:middle line:84%
it's a really easy concept,
this idea of contracts

00:37:48.422 --> 00:37:50.522 align:middle line:84%
because we have
contracts in this replica

00:37:50.522 --> 00:37:53.594 align:middle line:84%
of the third and
fourth astral plane.

00:37:53.594 --> 00:37:55.696 align:middle line:84%
But it's not like
contracts here.

00:37:55.696 --> 00:37:59.333 align:middle line:84%
They're being negotiated
every beat of your heart,

00:37:59.333 --> 00:38:01.402 align:middle line:90%
you renegotiate your contracts.

00:38:01.402 --> 00:38:04.405 align:middle line:84%
So we create them,
renegotiate them,

00:38:04.405 --> 00:38:06.574 align:middle line:90%
and destroy them on the fly.

00:38:06.574 --> 00:38:10.526 align:middle line:84%
Again, as long as everyone
whose name is on that contract

00:38:10.526 --> 00:38:11.946 align:middle line:90%
is in agreement.

00:38:11.946 --> 00:38:13.047 align:middle line:90%
That's freewill.

00:38:13.047 --> 00:38:14.648 align:middle line:90%
So I, it's not magic.

00:38:14.648 --> 00:38:16.951 align:middle line:84%
It's not like I can, you
know, dink a dink a dink

00:38:16.951 --> 00:38:18.385 align:middle line:90%
and make him love you.

00:38:18.385 --> 00:38:19.320 align:middle line:90%
That's not it.

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:21.222 align:middle line:84%
We can attempt to
write a contract

00:38:21.222 --> 00:38:23.057 align:middle line:90%
and get him to sign it, but.

00:38:23.057 --> 00:38:24.859 align:middle line:84%
>> You can't cast
a spell on him?

00:38:24.859 --> 00:38:25.659 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:38:25.659 --> 00:38:26.093 align:middle line:90%
>> That's not what you do.

00:38:26.093 --> 00:38:26.894 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:38:26.894 --> 00:38:28.095 align:middle line:90%
>> Yet some witches do that.

00:38:28.095 --> 00:38:29.363 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes I know, they do.

00:38:29.363 --> 00:38:32.833 align:middle line:84%
And that's really, if you
think of what a spell is,

00:38:32.833 --> 00:38:35.169 align:middle line:90%
it's creating a contract.

00:38:35.169 --> 00:38:39.073 align:middle line:84%
>> It is amazing
how all of this,

00:38:39.073 --> 00:38:42.155 align:middle line:84%
whether it's clairvoyancy,
psychic ability, healing,

00:38:42.155 --> 00:38:45.979 align:middle line:84%
which we'll get into,
witchcraft, you name it,

00:38:45.979 --> 00:38:48.249 align:middle line:90%
all deals with the same thing.

00:38:48.249 --> 00:38:51.285 align:middle line:90%
And that's dealing with energy.

00:38:51.285 --> 00:38:53.354 align:middle line:90%
And it just focuses itself in.

00:38:53.354 --> 00:38:56.023 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think that's why this
is such a great time for us all

00:38:56.023 --> 00:39:00.965 align:middle line:84%
to be able to understand what
used to seem like magic or, you

00:39:00.965 --> 00:39:05.566 align:middle line:84%
know, the unexplained, is
because both sides of our brain

00:39:05.566 --> 00:39:07.836 align:middle line:84%
are being stimulated by the
energy that's hitting this

00:39:07.836 --> 00:39:08.636 align:middle line:90%
planet.

00:39:08.636 --> 00:39:10.547 align:middle line:84%
One of the techniques
that we teach

00:39:10.547 --> 00:39:13.556 align:middle line:84%
is actually how to pull
more of that energy

00:39:13.556 --> 00:39:15.743 align:middle line:90%
to the planet to change it.

00:39:15.743 --> 00:39:18.479 align:middle line:84%
So as I'm reading, I'm running
energy through my body,

00:39:18.479 --> 00:39:22.497 align:middle line:84%
I'm pulling energy down out
of the cosmos that was never

00:39:22.497 --> 00:39:24.039 align:middle line:90%
going to hit this planet.

00:39:24.039 --> 00:39:26.164 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine, and
there's hundreds, thousands

00:39:26.164 --> 00:39:28.283 align:middle line:84%
of people that are
doing what I'm doing,

00:39:28.283 --> 00:39:29.356 align:middle line:90%
the exact same technique.

00:39:29.356 --> 00:39:32.059 align:middle line:84%
So every time we plug
in to meditate or read,

00:39:32.059 --> 00:39:33.961 align:middle line:84%
we are bringing
energies down that

00:39:33.961 --> 00:39:36.629 align:middle line:84%
are making us smarter and
more psychic, and really,

00:39:36.629 --> 00:39:39.366 align:middle line:84%
are leading to the ascension
that you see on the planet.

00:39:39.366 --> 00:39:41.571 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's take some of
your questions with Dr.

00:39:41.571 --> 00:39:44.729 align:middle line:84%
Lauren Cielo as we talk about
demonology, astral projection,

00:39:44.729 --> 00:39:45.659 align:middle line:90%
you name it.

00:39:45.659 --> 00:39:46.459 align:middle line:90%
Yes sir?

00:39:46.459 --> 00:39:47.341 align:middle line:90%
Right over here.

00:39:47.341 --> 00:39:49.508 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you know what
kind of contracts you're in?

00:39:49.508 --> 00:39:51.045 align:middle line:90%
>> That was a great question.

00:39:51.045 --> 00:39:53.848 align:middle line:84%
Mostly the way you know
what contracts you have,

00:39:53.848 --> 00:39:55.449 align:middle line:90%
is by how people treat you.

00:39:55.449 --> 00:39:56.650 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that funny?

00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:57.980 align:middle line:90%
I call it the kick me side.

00:39:57.980 --> 00:39:58.780 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:01.654 align:middle line:84%
If you're a person
that, "Oh, you know life

00:40:01.654 --> 00:40:02.857 align:middle line:90%
has treated me bad.

00:40:02.857 --> 00:40:05.125 align:middle line:84%
You know, mom died
when I was young.

00:40:05.125 --> 00:40:07.494 align:middle line:84%
You know, money isn't
in the bank account."

00:40:07.494 --> 00:40:09.720 align:middle line:84%
These show you that
you've got contracts

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:11.762 align:middle line:84%
with beings that make all
of that happen for you.

00:40:11.762 --> 00:40:13.178 align:middle line:84%
>> They pull you
down, don't they?

00:40:13.178 --> 00:40:14.001 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:40:14.001 --> 00:40:15.536 align:middle line:84%
Because you keep
telling them to.

00:40:15.536 --> 00:40:18.239 align:middle line:84%
You know, your
voice, your thoughts,

00:40:18.239 --> 00:40:20.628 align:middle line:84%
are the marching
orders and that's

00:40:20.628 --> 00:40:22.209 align:middle line:90%
what creates the contracts.

00:40:22.209 --> 00:40:25.279 align:middle line:84%
So basically, go take
it to the astral.

00:40:25.279 --> 00:40:28.044 align:middle line:84%
Now that you know how to do
astral healings, when you fall

00:40:28.044 --> 00:40:29.650 align:middle line:84%
asleep tonight,
tell your guides,

00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:34.088 align:middle line:84%
"Renegotiate my contracts
for my highest and best good,

00:40:34.088 --> 00:40:36.423 align:middle line:84%
and the good of all
in the creation."

00:40:36.423 --> 00:40:39.223 align:middle line:84%
And every single morning
when you wake up, check in,

00:40:39.223 --> 00:40:42.463 align:middle line:84%
and go, "Gosh, I do
think I can get that job.

00:40:42.463 --> 00:40:46.079 align:middle line:84%
I do think I can pass that
test." >> How much of it,

00:40:46.079 --> 00:40:49.858 align:middle line:84%
Lauren, is dealing with
those other entities

00:40:49.858 --> 00:40:53.841 align:middle line:84%
or just building that
confidence in yourself?

00:40:53.841 --> 00:40:56.043 align:middle line:84%
>> Well I think it's
really the same thing.

00:40:56.043 --> 00:41:01.081 align:middle line:84%
As a clairvoyant, besides
seeing color, I see pictures.

00:41:01.081 --> 00:41:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
in those chakras.

00:41:02.850 --> 00:41:03.650 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:07.521 align:middle line:84%
So if you were to have looked
in my third chakra 10 years ago,

00:41:07.521 --> 00:41:10.357 align:middle line:84%
the only thing you would have
saw were engineering pictures.

00:41:10.357 --> 00:41:11.157 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:41:11.157 --> 00:41:12.985 align:middle line:84%
My math teacher in
high school, "Oh, you

00:41:12.985 --> 00:41:14.780 align:middle line:84%
did really good on
that test, you should

00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:15.863 align:middle line:90%
go into the technologies."

00:41:15.863 --> 00:41:18.465 align:middle line:84%
You know, my dad, he's like he
really wanted to be an engineer

00:41:18.465 --> 00:41:20.401 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to make
dad proud, right?

00:41:20.401 --> 00:41:23.437 align:middle line:84%
So all of that lined
up as pictures.

00:41:23.437 --> 00:41:25.958 align:middle line:84%
And what the definition
of a picture is

00:41:25.958 --> 00:41:27.942 align:middle line:90%
is a charged bit of information.

00:41:27.942 --> 00:41:31.045 align:middle line:84%
So, if you want to
change who you are,

00:41:31.045 --> 00:41:34.815 align:middle line:84%
you start to release those
images from your space.

00:41:34.815 --> 00:41:37.432 align:middle line:84%
And you start to bring new
ones in, because you actually

00:41:37.432 --> 00:41:38.585 align:middle line:90%
look at them.

00:41:38.585 --> 00:41:38.791 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:41:38.791 --> 00:41:40.854 align:middle line:84%
So when I look at my
third chakra right now,

00:41:40.854 --> 00:41:42.600 align:middle line:84%
I don't wake up and
get on the freeway

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:45.459 align:middle line:84%
to go to a high tech
startup like I used to.

00:41:45.459 --> 00:41:47.428 align:middle line:84%
I move into my meditation
room and clean out

00:41:47.428 --> 00:41:48.495 align:middle line:90%
and get ready to read.

00:41:48.495 --> 00:41:52.739 align:middle line:84%
The only reason is because the
information in my third chakra

00:41:52.739 --> 00:41:55.301 align:middle line:84%
has changed those
pictures that I

00:41:55.301 --> 00:41:57.032 align:middle line:84%
remember who I am
in this lifetime

00:41:57.032 --> 00:41:58.339 align:middle line:90%
and what I'm here to do.

00:41:58.339 --> 00:42:00.240 align:middle line:90%
So, you want to change yourself?

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:04.712 align:middle line:84%
Change the information that's
encoded in your energy system.

00:42:04.712 --> 00:42:05.546 align:middle line:90%
>> Perfect.

00:42:05.546 --> 00:42:06.880 align:middle line:90%
How about some more questions?

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:09.049 align:middle line:90%
Yes, right here.

00:42:09.049 --> 00:42:12.921 align:middle line:84%
>> You mention to ask your
guides to help you renegotiate

00:42:12.921 --> 00:42:13.721 align:middle line:90%
contracts.

00:42:13.721 --> 00:42:16.375 align:middle line:84%
Is it just enough to believe
that you have guides or is

00:42:16.375 --> 00:42:18.653 align:middle line:84%
there an exercise or
a way to figure out

00:42:18.653 --> 00:42:20.294 align:middle line:90%
who our guides are or?

00:42:20.294 --> 00:42:21.514 align:middle line:90%
How do we do that?

00:42:21.514 --> 00:42:23.097 align:middle line:84%
How do we communicate
with our guides?

00:42:23.097 --> 00:42:26.289 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, well basically the
way I teach my students is once

00:42:26.289 --> 00:42:28.836 align:middle line:84%
they know how to run that
energy that I was talking about,

00:42:28.836 --> 00:42:31.620 align:middle line:84%
the one that pulls that
cosmic energy down,

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:35.393 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to giggle, but
what we do is we just ground

00:42:35.393 --> 00:42:37.595 align:middle line:84%
a platform, you know,
create a space for them,

00:42:37.595 --> 00:42:40.165 align:middle line:84%
put a grounding cord on it,
and ask them to step up.

00:42:40.165 --> 00:42:41.248 align:middle line:90%
And you just talk to them.

00:42:41.248 --> 00:42:42.282 align:middle line:90%
You just say, "Hey!

00:42:42.282 --> 00:42:43.684 align:middle line:90%
What do you do for me?"

00:42:43.684 --> 00:42:45.495 align:middle line:84%
And they might be
like, "Well, I help

00:42:45.495 --> 00:42:46.620 align:middle line:90%
you win athletic contests."

00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:48.828 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, "Well, I don't
really need you anymore,

00:42:48.828 --> 00:42:50.714 align:middle line:84%
I'm too old to compete,
so I don't really

00:42:50.714 --> 00:42:52.932 align:middle line:84%
need you anymore, let
me cancel that contract

00:42:52.932 --> 00:42:55.735 align:middle line:84%
and let me bring in
maybe a guide that

00:42:55.735 --> 00:42:57.431 align:middle line:90%
helps me be more psychic."

00:42:57.431 --> 00:42:58.985 align:middle line:84%
So once you start
to realize what

00:42:58.985 --> 00:43:01.066 align:middle line:84%
it is that you
want to accomplish,

00:43:01.066 --> 00:43:03.971 align:middle line:84%
just that, starts
shifting the contracts.

00:43:03.971 --> 00:43:07.184 align:middle line:84%
But what we're doing
is we're becoming

00:43:07.184 --> 00:43:11.276 align:middle line:84%
conscious humans, which means
that that elusive other side is

00:43:11.276 --> 00:43:13.313 align:middle line:90%
now in grasp, it's in reach.

00:43:13.313 --> 00:43:16.337 align:middle line:84%
Because of the two
hemispheres of our brain

00:43:16.337 --> 00:43:18.752 align:middle line:84%
taking that step
up and integrating.

00:43:18.752 --> 00:43:21.964 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, when
you look at us, we're

00:43:21.964 --> 00:43:25.392 align:middle line:84%
no longer really running just
male or just female energy,

00:43:25.392 --> 00:43:27.261 align:middle line:90%
we're all integrating those.

00:43:27.261 --> 00:43:29.363 align:middle line:84%
Like when I think about
my great grandfather,

00:43:29.363 --> 00:43:32.633 align:middle line:84%
he couldn't have helped my great
grandmother with the children,

00:43:32.633 --> 00:43:35.836 align:middle line:84%
it's not that he didn't
want to, he couldn't.

00:43:35.836 --> 00:43:39.607 align:middle line:84%
And she couldn't go to
work, because they just

00:43:39.607 --> 00:43:40.774 align:middle line:90%
weren't running that energy.

00:43:40.774 --> 00:43:43.644 align:middle line:84%
But as we're integrating, as
we're doing this ascension,

00:43:43.644 --> 00:43:45.756 align:middle line:84%
you can do whatever
you want to do

00:43:45.756 --> 00:43:47.915 align:middle line:84%
and it's getting easier
and easier and easier.

00:43:47.915 --> 00:43:51.379 align:middle line:84%
Especially as you learn
to read energy, to me,

00:43:51.379 --> 00:43:52.870 align:middle line:90%
I'll say I was bored.

00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:53.670 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:55.795 align:middle line:84%
I had already been really
successful as an athlete,

00:43:55.795 --> 00:43:58.158 align:middle line:84%
very successful as an
engineer, and I thought,

00:43:58.158 --> 00:44:00.282 align:middle line:84%
and my grandmother lived
to be 95 years old,

00:44:00.282 --> 00:44:01.925 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, "Oh
my gosh, what I am I

00:44:01.925 --> 00:44:04.600 align:middle line:84%
going to do for the next, you
know, 60 years!" >> 60 years.

00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:05.933 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, over the next 50 years.

00:44:05.933 --> 00:44:08.417 align:middle line:84%
So then I learned to
read energy and now I

00:44:08.417 --> 00:44:09.837 align:middle line:90%
can see the real world.

00:44:09.837 --> 00:44:13.786 align:middle line:84%
So, to me, every reading, the
best way that I can describe it

00:44:13.786 --> 00:44:15.126 align:middle line:90%
is like a foreign movie.

00:44:15.126 --> 00:44:16.751 align:middle line:84%
Like part of its a
little bit familiar,

00:44:16.751 --> 00:44:20.747 align:middle line:84%
but the more you're like what
is that, and I pull at threads,

00:44:20.747 --> 00:44:23.050 align:middle line:84%
you'll show me something and
I'll start pulling on it.

00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:23.850 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:27.154 align:middle line:84%
And the more I pull,
the more you'll show me.

00:44:27.154 --> 00:44:30.151 align:middle line:84%
And I do another thing I call
nibbling around the edges.

00:44:30.151 --> 00:44:32.359 align:middle line:84%
You'll show me something
and I'll start talking about

00:44:32.359 --> 00:44:34.609 align:middle line:84%
and I'll start nibbling, and
then you'll show me more,

00:44:34.609 --> 00:44:35.729 align:middle line:90%
and you'll show me more.

00:44:35.729 --> 00:44:38.398 align:middle line:84%
It's very interesting and
it's very stimulating.

00:44:38.398 --> 00:44:39.649 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot of fun.

00:44:39.649 --> 00:44:41.066 align:middle line:84%
And I'll have to
say that reading,

00:44:41.066 --> 00:44:44.438 align:middle line:84%
in the technique that I
use, is never exhausting.

00:44:44.438 --> 00:44:46.273 align:middle line:90%
It is exhilarating.

00:44:46.273 --> 00:44:48.308 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say maybe even
a little addictive.

00:44:48.308 --> 00:44:52.026 align:middle line:84%
I mean the way the left and
right brain merge together

00:44:52.026 --> 00:44:54.819 align:middle line:84%
is a very interesting
energy to run

00:44:54.819 --> 00:44:57.666 align:middle line:84%
and I think more and more
of us are trying to get out

00:44:57.666 --> 00:45:00.756 align:middle line:84%
of that dichotomy of good
and bad and, you know,

00:45:00.756 --> 00:45:03.660 align:middle line:84%
and really kind of
put it together and be

00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:04.958 align:middle line:90%
senior in our lives.

00:45:04.958 --> 00:45:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's, once you
can read your contracts

00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:09.963 align:middle line:84%
and once you can see who your
guides are, now you're senior.

00:45:09.963 --> 00:45:12.800 align:middle line:84%
You're on the forward,
leading edge of your life.

00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:15.435 align:middle line:84%
You're not on your heels going,
"Oh what's around that corner."

00:45:15.435 --> 00:45:16.235 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:45:16.235 --> 00:45:18.405 align:middle line:84%
You're actively creating
out in front of yourself.

00:45:18.405 --> 00:45:21.842 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't want to use money
as a barometer of success,

00:45:21.842 --> 00:45:25.713 align:middle line:84%
but Bill Gates obviously had
a better contract than I did.

00:45:25.713 --> 00:45:26.513 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:45:26.513 --> 00:45:27.581 align:middle line:90%
>> Why the difference?

00:45:27.581 --> 00:45:29.683 align:middle line:84%
Are his people working
harder than mine?

00:45:29.683 --> 00:45:31.971 align:middle line:84%
[Laughter] >> Well it
has to do with what

00:45:31.971 --> 00:45:32.553 align:middle line:90%
the reason that you're here.

00:45:32.553 --> 00:45:32.953 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:45:32.953 --> 00:45:33.754 align:middle line:90%
Sole's purpose.

00:45:33.754 --> 00:45:37.558 align:middle line:84%
So you, as you're coming
from any incarnation

00:45:37.558 --> 00:45:39.426 align:middle line:84%
like I mentioned, you're
on the other side,

00:45:39.426 --> 00:45:41.682 align:middle line:84%
you're on the
astral plane, you're

00:45:41.682 --> 00:45:43.730 align:middle line:84%
vibrating at the level
you're most comfortable,

00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:46.126 align:middle line:84%
and then all of a sudden your
guides start to nudge ya.

00:45:46.126 --> 00:45:46.926 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:45:46.926 --> 00:45:48.101 align:middle line:90%
Time to go back.

00:45:48.101 --> 00:45:50.255 align:middle line:84%
I call myself a
reluctant incarnater.

00:45:50.255 --> 00:45:51.838 align:middle line:84%
Like in other words,
there's not going

00:45:51.838 --> 00:45:54.374 align:middle line:84%
to be any near death
experiences for me.

00:45:54.374 --> 00:45:56.911 align:middle line:84%
Once I graduate, I'm done,
cut that silver cord,

00:45:56.911 --> 00:45:57.711 align:middle line:90%
I'm going home.

00:45:57.711 --> 00:45:58.845 align:middle line:90%
I call it graduation.

00:45:58.845 --> 00:45:59.645 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:45:59.645 --> 00:46:02.082 align:middle line:90%
This is just a laboratory.

00:46:02.082 --> 00:46:04.351 align:middle line:84%
And it's a painful one,
it can be very painful.

00:46:04.351 --> 00:46:07.027 align:middle line:84%
So basically, once
you decide what

00:46:07.027 --> 00:46:09.381 align:middle line:84%
it is that you'll
learn this time,

00:46:09.381 --> 00:46:12.759 align:middle line:84%
and it seems to be a good enough
reason for you to come back,

00:46:12.759 --> 00:46:14.995 align:middle line:84%
then you start signing
those contracts.

00:46:14.995 --> 00:46:18.028 align:middle line:84%
You sign contracts with
other beings who are also

00:46:18.028 --> 00:46:20.850 align:middle line:84%
going to incarnate and
you also sign contracts

00:46:20.850 --> 00:46:22.463 align:middle line:84%
with beings that
are not going to,

00:46:22.463 --> 00:46:24.938 align:middle line:84%
that will be like your
spirit guides, right?

00:46:24.938 --> 00:46:27.708 align:middle line:84%
The beings who are going
to incarnate with you,

00:46:27.708 --> 00:46:30.142 align:middle line:84%
and I guess even the ones
that aren't, the reason

00:46:30.142 --> 00:46:32.880 align:middle line:84%
they sign your contracts
is because you have karma

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:33.680 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:36.917 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that you keep doing this
thing over and over and over.

00:46:36.917 --> 00:46:41.255 align:middle line:84%
And karma isn't that you
stole my goat 2,000 years ago

00:46:41.255 --> 00:46:43.824 align:middle line:84%
and now I'm going to steal
your cat, that's not karma.

00:46:43.824 --> 00:46:46.960 align:middle line:84%
Karma is a contract that
hasn't been fulfilled.

00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:50.397 align:middle line:84%
So if in a past life I was
going to give you a healing

00:46:50.397 --> 00:46:52.101 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't do
that, guess what,

00:46:52.101 --> 00:46:54.643 align:middle line:84%
you're going to find my website,
you're going to book with me

00:46:54.643 --> 00:46:56.435 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to get
it done this lifetime.

00:46:56.435 --> 00:46:57.235 align:middle line:90%
>> Super.

00:46:57.235 --> 00:46:59.039 align:middle line:84%
Let's take one more
question for Dr. Cielo.

00:46:59.039 --> 00:47:00.507 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:47:00.507 --> 00:47:04.378 align:middle line:84%
>> I find your concept of
replica really intriguing.

00:47:04.378 --> 00:47:06.346 align:middle line:84%
Lately a lot of people
have been telling me

00:47:06.346 --> 00:47:08.401 align:middle line:84%
that they're
experiencing, that they're

00:47:08.401 --> 00:47:10.050 align:middle line:90%
living in two realities.

00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:14.154 align:middle line:84%
One is very material and
dense and not so much fun.

00:47:14.154 --> 00:47:16.035 align:middle line:84%
And the other one
is extraordinary.

00:47:16.035 --> 00:47:16.835 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:47:16.835 --> 00:47:20.398 align:middle line:84%
What I want to say
about that is as we're

00:47:20.398 --> 00:47:22.731 align:middle line:84%
making this shift from a
replica of three and four,

00:47:22.731 --> 00:47:24.564 align:middle line:84%
and let me tell you
what three and four are,

00:47:24.564 --> 00:47:25.699 align:middle line:90%
I never even told you.

00:47:25.699 --> 00:47:27.801 align:middle line:90%
Three is really dense.

00:47:27.801 --> 00:47:30.804 align:middle line:84%
Okay, like, if you fall asleep
and you go to the astral plane

00:47:30.804 --> 00:47:34.541 align:middle line:84%
and you lodge yourself in
three, the third level,

00:47:34.541 --> 00:47:36.877 align:middle line:84%
you'll be trying to
scream and you can't.

00:47:36.877 --> 00:47:39.106 align:middle line:84%
You'll be trying to
punch, you can't.

00:47:39.106 --> 00:47:40.814 align:middle line:84%
>> You'll be trying
to run and you can't.

00:47:40.814 --> 00:47:41.772 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, you can't run.

00:47:41.772 --> 00:47:44.618 align:middle line:90%
So that's a very dense plane.

00:47:44.618 --> 00:47:47.454 align:middle line:84%
Different parts of this
planet are denser, right?

00:47:47.454 --> 00:47:49.723 align:middle line:84%
If I would have been
incarnated in the Middle East,

00:47:49.723 --> 00:47:52.726 align:middle line:84%
it probably would have
been a hard time for me.

00:47:52.726 --> 00:47:53.526 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:47:53.526 --> 00:47:55.877 align:middle line:84%
[Laughing] But then
another part of this planet

00:47:55.877 --> 00:47:59.433 align:middle line:84%
vibrates to four, and four
is friends and family.

00:47:59.433 --> 00:48:02.123 align:middle line:84%
So if you are dreaming
about friends and family,

00:48:02.123 --> 00:48:03.704 align:middle line:90%
you're at level four.

00:48:03.704 --> 00:48:05.105 align:middle line:90%
And think about it.

00:48:05.105 --> 00:48:07.341 align:middle line:90%
We're in a homosapien.

00:48:07.341 --> 00:48:10.576 align:middle line:84%
The homosapien is the most
aggressive and yet social

00:48:10.576 --> 00:48:11.912 align:middle line:90%
animal on the planet.

00:48:11.912 --> 00:48:14.481 align:middle line:90%
It makes total sense.

00:48:14.481 --> 00:48:17.718 align:middle line:84%
Aggressive, third layer,
and friends and family,

00:48:17.718 --> 00:48:18.518 align:middle line:90%
fourth layer.

00:48:18.518 --> 00:48:18.692 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:48:18.692 --> 00:48:20.087 align:middle line:84%
We're all, how do
you learn the most?

00:48:20.087 --> 00:48:22.022 align:middle line:84%
You learn from your mom, you
learn from your boyfriend,

00:48:22.022 --> 00:48:23.623 align:middle line:90%
you learn from your kids, right?

00:48:23.623 --> 00:48:24.658 align:middle line:90%
Friends and family.

00:48:24.658 --> 00:48:27.761 align:middle line:84%
So as we're moving
to that fifth layer,

00:48:27.761 --> 00:48:30.097 align:middle line:84%
things are shifting
very quickly.

00:48:30.097 --> 00:48:32.299 align:middle line:84%
The best way to get
there effortlessly,

00:48:32.299 --> 00:48:35.135 align:middle line:84%
like you mentioned, its like,
"Ew, it's hard down here."

00:48:35.135 --> 00:48:36.327 align:middle line:90%
Your guides.

00:48:36.327 --> 00:48:37.127 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:48:37.127 --> 00:48:40.273 align:middle line:84%
Those contracts you
have with guides.

00:48:40.273 --> 00:48:43.232 align:middle line:84%
I think the term spirit guide
is a misnomer, that's why

00:48:43.232 --> 00:48:45.479 align:middle line:90%
I like to use the word being.

00:48:45.479 --> 00:48:49.817 align:middle line:84%
Because I've got over 300 beings
that I actively have contracts

00:48:49.817 --> 00:48:50.617 align:middle line:90%
with, right?

00:48:50.617 --> 00:48:52.052 align:middle line:90%
Of course I don't know them all.

00:48:52.052 --> 00:48:55.100 align:middle line:84%
I have actually 13 that I really
know well that are actually

00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:56.189 align:middle line:90%
right here, right now.

00:48:56.189 --> 00:48:58.925 align:middle line:84%
But, basically think
of it this way.

00:48:58.925 --> 00:49:02.429 align:middle line:84%
You have incarnated in a very
special time on the planet

00:49:02.429 --> 00:49:05.030 align:middle line:84%
where we're making that
quantum jump to the fifth,

00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:07.701 align:middle line:84%
to a replica of the
fifth astral plane.

00:49:07.701 --> 00:49:11.338 align:middle line:84%
So you're the one with
skin in the game, right?

00:49:11.338 --> 00:49:13.296 align:middle line:84%
Think of your great
grandmother being here now.

00:49:13.296 --> 00:49:14.096 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:49:14.096 --> 00:49:16.073 align:middle line:84%
Cell phone goes off;
she's under the desk

00:49:16.073 --> 00:49:17.078 align:middle line:90%
rocking back and forth.

00:49:17.078 --> 00:49:17.878 align:middle line:90%
"What was that?

00:49:17.878 --> 00:49:18.712 align:middle line:90%
It's the devil."

00:49:18.712 --> 00:49:19.512 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:49:19.512 --> 00:49:22.516 align:middle line:90%
So, talk to your guides.

00:49:22.516 --> 00:49:24.836 align:middle line:84%
If you want to create
something, give them,

00:49:24.836 --> 00:49:26.539 align:middle line:84%
you know, tell them
when you want it,

00:49:26.539 --> 00:49:28.622 align:middle line:84%
alright, give them some
time to create it for you.

00:49:28.622 --> 00:49:32.959 align:middle line:84%
Don't tell them how to create
it, tell them what to create.

00:49:32.959 --> 00:49:35.128 align:middle line:84%
Because you'll slow them
down if you tell them how.

00:49:35.128 --> 00:49:37.027 align:middle line:84%
If you want a new
car, don't ask them

00:49:37.027 --> 00:49:39.699 align:middle line:84%
for the money for a new car,
ask them for the new car.

00:49:39.699 --> 00:49:40.867 align:middle line:90%
People win one all the time.

00:49:40.867 --> 00:49:42.035 align:middle line:90%
You might inherit one.

00:49:42.035 --> 00:49:42.835 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:49:42.835 --> 00:49:45.625 align:middle line:84%
So tell you're guides what
you want and give them

00:49:45.625 --> 00:49:46.940 align:middle line:90%
whatever time you want to have.

00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:48.065 align:middle line:90%
>> You have to be specific.

00:49:48.065 --> 00:49:49.276 align:middle line:90%
>> You have to be specific.

00:49:49.276 --> 00:49:51.378 align:middle line:84%
The time comes up
and you don't get it,

00:49:51.378 --> 00:49:53.046 align:middle line:84%
and this is my
personal experience.

00:49:53.046 --> 00:49:54.714 align:middle line:84%
So I go to them
and I'm like, "Hey!

00:49:54.714 --> 00:49:56.316 align:middle line:90%
Why don't I have what I want?"

00:49:56.316 --> 00:49:57.430 align:middle line:90%
"You're in resistance."

00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:59.597 align:middle line:84%
That's the first thing they
always say and I'm like,

00:49:59.597 --> 00:50:00.397 align:middle line:90%
"Guess what?

00:50:00.397 --> 00:50:02.222 align:middle line:90%
Bring me out of resistance.

00:50:02.222 --> 00:50:03.389 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you another week."

00:50:03.389 --> 00:50:04.189 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:50:04.189 --> 00:50:06.033 align:middle line:84%
Another week goes by,
check in with them,

00:50:06.033 --> 00:50:07.994 align:middle line:84%
and I say, "Why didn't
I get what I wanted?

00:50:07.994 --> 00:50:10.798 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not in resistance
because you brought me out

00:50:10.798 --> 00:50:11.598 align:middle line:90%
of resistance."

00:50:11.598 --> 00:50:12.398 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:50:12.398 --> 00:50:15.053 align:middle line:84%
"It's not best for your brothers
and sisters on the planet."

00:50:15.053 --> 00:50:16.470 align:middle line:84%
That's the next
one I always hear.

00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:16.658 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:50:16.658 --> 00:50:18.538 align:middle line:84%
In other words it's not
for the good of all.

00:50:18.538 --> 00:50:20.907 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, "Okay,
I've got it now.

00:50:20.907 --> 00:50:23.343 align:middle line:84%
I am going to cancel
the contract with you.

00:50:23.343 --> 00:50:25.956 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get me a
better guide because this

00:50:25.956 --> 00:50:26.847 align:middle line:90%
is what I want.

00:50:26.847 --> 00:50:28.882 align:middle line:84%
I want what I want
when I want it.

00:50:28.882 --> 00:50:31.418 align:middle line:84%
If I'm in resistance,
get me out.

00:50:31.418 --> 00:50:35.755 align:middle line:84%
If it's not for the good of
all, make me not want it."

00:50:35.755 --> 00:50:38.075 align:middle line:84%
That's how to really
get great guides that

00:50:38.075 --> 00:50:41.027 align:middle line:84%
help you through this transition
into the fifth astral plane.

00:50:41.027 --> 00:50:43.831 align:middle line:84%
You're the one, that
when you do this, ouch!

00:50:43.831 --> 00:50:44.631 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:50:44.631 --> 00:50:47.501 align:middle line:84%
You're the one who's affected
by global warming or the world

00:50:47.501 --> 00:50:48.301 align:middle line:90%
economy.

00:50:48.301 --> 00:50:49.101 align:middle line:90%
Not them.

00:50:49.101 --> 00:50:50.309 align:middle line:90%
They're just floating around.

00:50:50.309 --> 00:50:52.559 align:middle line:84%
So be tough on them, tell
them what you want or you're

00:50:52.559 --> 00:50:53.607 align:middle line:90%
going to get rid of them?

00:50:53.607 --> 00:50:56.009 align:middle line:84%
>> Can greed
interfere with this?

00:50:56.009 --> 00:50:58.546 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know, again,
it depends on what you want

00:50:58.546 --> 00:50:59.346 align:middle line:90%
to learn.

00:50:59.346 --> 00:51:00.714 align:middle line:90%
Think of this.

00:51:00.714 --> 00:51:05.519 align:middle line:84%
One of my students asked me,
"So didn't the soul who we named

00:51:05.519 --> 00:51:08.288 align:middle line:84%
or whose mother
named him Hitler,

00:51:08.288 --> 00:51:11.358 align:middle line:84%
didn't he get all this karma
for the things that he did?

00:51:11.358 --> 00:51:15.563 align:middle line:84%
You know why would a soul
sign those contracts to incur

00:51:15.563 --> 00:51:16.363 align:middle line:90%
the karma?"

00:51:16.363 --> 00:51:17.364 align:middle line:90%
That was her question.

00:51:17.364 --> 00:51:18.131 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like a
great question right?

00:51:18.131 --> 00:51:19.199 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a great question.

00:51:19.199 --> 00:51:23.151 align:middle line:84%
>> The answer is the only reason
that the soul named Hitler

00:51:23.151 --> 00:51:27.807 align:middle line:84%
signed those contracts was
because he already had karma.

00:51:27.807 --> 00:51:28.708 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:51:28.708 --> 00:51:30.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Bad karma.

00:51:30.010 --> 00:51:32.245 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's like this.

00:51:32.245 --> 00:51:36.509 align:middle line:84%
If you run into a
serial killer, you

00:51:36.509 --> 00:51:39.986 align:middle line:84%
signed the contract to
run into a serial killer.

00:51:39.986 --> 00:51:42.923 align:middle line:84%
There wouldn't be serial killers
if we wouldn't sign contracts

00:51:42.923 --> 00:51:43.723 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:51:43.723 --> 00:51:45.959 align:middle line:90%
I'll go the big relationship.

00:51:45.959 --> 00:51:47.561 align:middle line:90%
Jesus and Judas.

00:51:47.561 --> 00:51:49.062 align:middle line:90%
I always go to that one.

00:51:49.062 --> 00:51:53.366 align:middle line:84%
If you wanted to be a martyr
and fulfill a biblical prophecy,

00:51:53.366 --> 00:51:56.336 align:middle line:84%
who's going to sign the
contract to betray you,

00:51:56.336 --> 00:51:59.438 align:middle line:84%
so that you can have that
experience on this replica

00:51:59.438 --> 00:52:01.041 align:middle line:90%
of the astral plane?

00:52:01.041 --> 00:52:03.677 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be the soul
that loves you the most.

00:52:03.677 --> 00:52:10.083 align:middle line:84%
So the big karma events are
marriage, birthing a body,

00:52:10.083 --> 00:52:11.985 align:middle line:90%
and killing someone.

00:52:11.985 --> 00:52:14.764 align:middle line:84%
And you continue to birth,
kill, and marry the same people

00:52:14.764 --> 00:52:15.722 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over.

00:52:15.722 --> 00:52:21.228 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm two for three.

00:52:21.228 --> 00:52:22.462 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter] Healing.

00:52:22.462 --> 00:52:25.365 align:middle line:90%
Son of God.

00:52:25.365 --> 00:52:29.202 align:middle line:84%
How did he do and how
does he do what he does?

00:52:29.202 --> 00:52:30.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Contracts.

00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:34.174 align:middle line:84%
And not so much the contracts
that he wanted to sign,

00:52:34.174 --> 00:52:36.476 align:middle line:84%
but the contracts of the
other brothers and sisters

00:52:36.476 --> 00:52:38.011 align:middle line:84%
and so he says,
"Okay, I'll do it."

00:52:38.011 --> 00:52:38.244 align:middle line:90%
Alright?

00:52:38.244 --> 00:52:39.879 align:middle line:90%
So that's kind of how it works.

00:52:39.879 --> 00:52:43.017 align:middle line:84%
Like when you see, like, Bill
Gates or, you know, Jesus.

00:52:43.017 --> 00:52:43.817 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:52:43.817 --> 00:52:47.642 align:middle line:84%
These big, big hitters of,
you know, on the earth plane

00:52:47.642 --> 00:52:48.588 align:middle line:90%
while they're here.

00:52:48.588 --> 00:52:52.104 align:middle line:84%
Usually these souls
and I'll, maybe

00:52:52.104 --> 00:52:54.212 align:middle line:84%
with, maybe this
isn't always true,

00:52:54.212 --> 00:52:55.984 align:middle line:84%
but usually the
reason that somebody

00:52:55.984 --> 00:52:58.711 align:middle line:84%
will sign those kind of
contracts isn't for themselves,

00:52:58.711 --> 00:53:00.667 align:middle line:90%
it's for all of us.

00:53:00.667 --> 00:53:02.669 align:middle line:84%
So next incarnation
who's going to be,

00:53:02.669 --> 00:53:05.271 align:middle line:84%
who's going to be the
prophet in this room?

00:53:05.271 --> 00:53:08.174 align:middle line:84%
One of us is going to be
the profit next time, right?

00:53:08.174 --> 00:53:09.376 align:middle line:90%
So that's how it works.

00:53:09.376 --> 00:53:12.112 align:middle line:84%
It's what you owe to the
other brothers and sisters

00:53:12.112 --> 00:53:14.914 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, that you think
you can pay back this lifetime

00:53:14.914 --> 00:53:16.282 align:middle line:90%
by signing the contract.

00:53:16.282 --> 00:53:18.284 align:middle line:84%
>> What about the
psychic vampires Lauren?

00:53:18.284 --> 00:53:22.122 align:middle line:84%
These people who probably
don't know what they're doing,

00:53:22.122 --> 00:53:24.124 align:middle line:84%
but they suck
energy from people.

00:53:24.124 --> 00:53:28.453 align:middle line:84%
I've been to places
where a person is sitting

00:53:28.453 --> 00:53:33.933 align:middle line:84%
at a bar at the Ritz Carlton
Hotel and nobody is around him,

00:53:33.933 --> 00:53:38.571 align:middle line:84%
and you can literally feel
this negativity coming from,

00:53:38.571 --> 00:53:43.243 align:middle line:84%
an obviously nice person, who
just can't put it together.

00:53:43.243 --> 00:53:44.177 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen?

00:53:44.177 --> 00:53:45.178 align:middle line:90%
Bad contracts?

00:53:45.178 --> 00:53:46.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Probably bad
contracts, especially

00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:48.675 align:middle line:84%
if they're completely
unconscious to it.

00:53:48.675 --> 00:53:50.383 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it's
not their intention.

00:53:50.383 --> 00:53:51.451 align:middle line:90%
>> He's not voided on purpose.

00:53:51.451 --> 00:53:52.452 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right, right.

00:53:52.452 --> 00:53:55.288 align:middle line:84%
And that's the danger
of a channeler.

00:53:55.288 --> 00:53:57.574 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not your
intention, you just zone out

00:53:57.574 --> 00:53:59.532 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden you're
acting a certain way

00:53:59.532 --> 00:54:00.860 align:middle line:90%
and you don't even realize it.

00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:04.764 align:middle line:84%
That is the opposite of
being a, a conscious human.

00:54:04.764 --> 00:54:06.733 align:middle line:84%
And by the time we're
living in a replica

00:54:06.733 --> 00:54:09.636 align:middle line:84%
of the fifth astral plane,
you will be conscious.

00:54:09.636 --> 00:54:11.926 align:middle line:84%
You will be able to go,
"Wait a second, I think

00:54:11.926 --> 00:54:13.672 align:middle line:84%
I've got a kick me
contract on my back,"

00:54:13.672 --> 00:54:15.489 align:middle line:84%
or, "Every single time
I want to, you know,

00:54:15.489 --> 00:54:18.469 align:middle line:84%
have a heart to heart with
my mom, all of a sudden I

00:54:18.469 --> 00:54:19.946 align:middle line:90%
can't even get to her house.

00:54:19.946 --> 00:54:21.915 align:middle line:90%
I take the wrong turn."

00:54:21.915 --> 00:54:24.351 align:middle line:84%
It's a being that
you're channeling.

00:54:24.351 --> 00:54:28.288 align:middle line:84%
>> In St. Louis, there was a
woman who was in broadcasting

00:54:28.288 --> 00:54:34.027 align:middle line:84%
and wherever I went; wherever
I went she had to be there.

00:54:34.027 --> 00:54:35.328 align:middle line:90%
And she'd follow me.

00:54:35.328 --> 00:54:38.732 align:middle line:84%
Not a stalker, but
she was always there.

00:54:38.732 --> 00:54:43.369 align:middle line:84%
And she had the most negative
energy I have ever felt.

00:54:43.369 --> 00:54:46.639 align:middle line:84%
She exhausted me
just standing there.

00:54:46.639 --> 00:54:49.136 align:middle line:84%
And I had a buddy of
mine who would routinely

00:54:49.136 --> 00:54:51.411 align:middle line:90%
see this and witness this.

00:54:51.411 --> 00:54:55.982 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I would try to
get away as often as I could.

00:54:55.982 --> 00:54:58.685 align:middle line:90%
One day, she came up to him.

00:54:58.685 --> 00:54:59.886 align:middle line:90%
Nice lady.

00:54:59.886 --> 00:55:01.488 align:middle line:90%
I feel sorry for her.

00:55:01.488 --> 00:55:03.912 align:middle line:84%
And she'd gone up
to my buddy, Rick,

00:55:03.912 --> 00:55:06.505 align:middle line:84%
and she said, "Rick, would
you thank George for me

00:55:06.505 --> 00:55:09.512 align:middle line:84%
for being so kind
to me even though I

00:55:09.512 --> 00:55:11.598 align:middle line:90%
know he doesn't like me."

00:55:11.598 --> 00:55:13.566 align:middle line:84%
And Rick said, which
was not the case,

00:55:13.566 --> 00:55:14.968 align:middle line:90%
it's not like I didn't like her.

00:55:14.968 --> 00:55:16.417 align:middle line:84%
But, and Rick
said, "Well what do

00:55:16.417 --> 00:55:17.670 align:middle line:90%
you mean he doesn't like you?

00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:19.539 align:middle line:90%
George thinks the world of you."

00:55:19.539 --> 00:55:21.207 align:middle line:90%
She says, "No.

00:55:21.207 --> 00:55:25.445 align:middle line:84%
Every time I'm with him, he
has to go to the bathroom."

00:55:25.445 --> 00:55:27.313 align:middle line:84%
[Dr. Cielo laughing]
And my friend said,

00:55:27.313 --> 00:55:30.216 align:middle line:90%
"He's got a bladder problem."

00:55:30.216 --> 00:55:33.356 align:middle line:84%
Bottom line is, there
are some people who

00:55:33.356 --> 00:55:35.541 align:middle line:84%
don't realize what
they're doing,

00:55:35.541 --> 00:55:38.604 align:middle line:84%
yet the negativity,
the draining,

00:55:38.604 --> 00:55:41.227 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely uncanny.

00:55:41.227 --> 00:55:43.163 align:middle line:90%
How do they change?

00:55:43.163 --> 00:55:45.632 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one thing, the
reason you felt so depleted is

00:55:45.632 --> 00:55:47.952 align:middle line:84%
because she kept looking
for a healing from you.

00:55:47.952 --> 00:55:49.202 align:middle line:90%
>> She was draining my energy.

00:55:49.202 --> 00:55:50.535 align:middle line:90%
>> She was draining your energy.

00:55:50.535 --> 00:55:53.773 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of the
old paradigm of healing.

00:55:53.773 --> 00:55:57.022 align:middle line:84%
When our earth was even
lower, a lower replica,

00:55:57.022 --> 00:56:01.632 align:middle line:84%
like maybe two and three,
if a healer was incarnated,

00:56:01.632 --> 00:56:06.205 align:middle line:84%
chances are the way that
we healed was either

00:56:06.205 --> 00:56:09.974 align:middle line:84%
by taking your disease
into our energetic space

00:56:09.974 --> 00:56:13.483 align:middle line:84%
and healing it, or,
throwing energy up on you

00:56:13.483 --> 00:56:15.028 align:middle line:90%
so that you'd feel great.

00:56:15.028 --> 00:56:17.618 align:middle line:84%
But now, the fact
that the planet

00:56:17.618 --> 00:56:19.992 align:middle line:84%
is rising in vibration,
those healing

00:56:19.992 --> 00:56:22.684 align:middle line:84%
masters, the archangels,
the ascended masters,

00:56:22.684 --> 00:56:24.938 align:middle line:90%
they can get here now.

00:56:24.938 --> 00:56:26.239 align:middle line:90%
So I don't do anything.

00:56:26.239 --> 00:56:27.240 align:middle line:90%
I just sit back.

00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:29.909 align:middle line:84%
I'm a neutral observer
to your energy.

00:56:29.909 --> 00:56:33.646 align:middle line:84%
If there looks an energy needs
to move, first I'll read it.

00:56:33.646 --> 00:56:36.749 align:middle line:84%
And then if you're like, "Ew,
I did not want that" I'm like,

00:56:36.749 --> 00:56:38.818 align:middle line:90%
"Oh, can I offer you a healing?"

00:56:38.818 --> 00:56:42.488 align:middle line:84%
If you say yes, then my big
Egyptian guy, Onka Yaya,

00:56:42.488 --> 00:56:45.925 align:middle line:84%
is going to come to you
and move your energy.

00:56:45.925 --> 00:56:47.160 align:middle line:90%
So I don't get depleted.

00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:47.960 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:49.963 align:middle line:84%
He's the one that's
giving you the healing.

00:56:49.963 --> 00:56:53.022 align:middle line:84%
So in cases like
this, when George

00:56:53.022 --> 00:56:55.380 align:middle line:84%
was discussing about
that woman, she's

00:56:55.380 --> 00:56:59.305 align:middle line:84%
actively pulling his energy for
her own, to use it for herself.

00:56:59.305 --> 00:57:00.139 align:middle line:90%
It'll never help.

00:57:00.139 --> 00:57:02.003 align:middle line:84%
It'll only, it's
almost like putting

00:57:02.003 --> 00:57:03.910 align:middle line:90%
unleaded in a diesel engine.

00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:06.376 align:middle line:84%
You might get around the block,
but pretty soon the engine

00:57:06.376 --> 00:57:07.347 align:middle line:90%
is going to crap out.

00:57:07.347 --> 00:57:08.147 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:57:08.147 --> 00:57:11.359 align:middle line:84%
So now more than ever,
run your own energy.

00:57:11.359 --> 00:57:12.159 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:57:12.159 --> 00:57:14.087 align:middle line:84%
If somebody, if you're
talking to a friend

00:57:14.087 --> 00:57:17.156 align:middle line:84%
and they're like, "Oh yeah,
I'm having a really hard time."

00:57:17.156 --> 00:57:19.359 align:middle line:84%
Send your guide to
help them instead

00:57:19.359 --> 00:57:21.861 align:middle line:84%
of you pushing your
energy through the phone.

00:57:21.861 --> 00:57:25.231 align:middle line:84%
It's only going to give them
a temporary little buzz,

00:57:25.231 --> 00:57:26.799 align:middle line:90%
and you're going to be depleted.

00:57:26.799 --> 00:57:28.601 align:middle line:84%
>> The worst thing to
happen is you ask a friend,

00:57:28.601 --> 00:57:29.684 align:middle line:90%
"How are you doing today?"

00:57:29.684 --> 00:57:31.371 align:middle line:90%
And they go, "Oh, not good.

00:57:31.371 --> 00:57:33.039 align:middle line:84%
This is," and then
you go why did I ask?

00:57:33.039 --> 00:57:33.773 align:middle line:90%
>> Why did I ask!

00:57:33.773 --> 00:57:34.574 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:57:34.574 --> 00:57:35.875 align:middle line:90%
>> Which is amazing.

00:57:35.875 --> 00:57:37.844 align:middle line:90%
A few moments to go here.

00:57:37.844 --> 00:57:40.680 align:middle line:84%
These crystals, do they
all do different things?

00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:43.238 align:middle line:84%
>> Well these are actually my
personal healing crystals that

00:57:43.238 --> 00:57:44.350 align:middle line:90%
I play with every morning.

00:57:44.350 --> 00:57:46.452 align:middle line:84%
And, like I mentioned
with the pendulum,

00:57:46.452 --> 00:57:47.954 align:middle line:90%
I can determine which one.

00:57:47.954 --> 00:57:49.255 align:middle line:90%
>> Something like this.

00:57:49.255 --> 00:57:50.356 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that's one of my
favorites, I just got that.

00:57:50.356 --> 00:57:51.981 align:middle line:84%
>> But they all do
something different?

00:57:51.981 --> 00:57:55.091 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I absolutely use them
for different meditations might

00:57:55.091 --> 00:57:55.895 align:middle line:90%
be the way.

00:57:55.895 --> 00:57:57.931 align:middle line:84%
So this is how I
decide which one.

00:57:57.931 --> 00:57:59.232 align:middle line:90%
So are we communicating?

00:57:59.232 --> 00:57:59.460 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:57:59.460 --> 00:58:00.418 align:middle line:90%
Do you know the answer?

00:58:00.418 --> 00:58:01.218 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:58:01.218 --> 00:58:03.536 align:middle line:84%
Would this be the stone I
should meditate with today?

00:58:03.536 --> 00:58:06.205 align:middle line:90%
[Pause] >> No.

00:58:06.205 --> 00:58:07.707 align:middle line:90%
>> And this is malachite.

00:58:07.707 --> 00:58:08.908 align:middle line:90%
I love that stone.

00:58:08.908 --> 00:58:10.043 align:middle line:90%
This is Tiger's Eye.

00:58:10.043 --> 00:58:11.311 align:middle line:90%
Tiger's Eye?

00:58:11.311 --> 00:58:13.012 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:58:13.012 --> 00:58:15.014 align:middle line:90%
>> Rose quartz?

00:58:15.014 --> 00:58:16.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Undecided.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.417 align:middle line:84%
>> Oop, it looks
like it wants it.

00:58:17.417 --> 00:58:18.217 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:58:18.217 --> 00:58:21.087 align:middle line:84%
So right now today, rose
quartz is a great stone for me.

00:58:21.087 --> 00:58:24.167 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the necklace that
I'm wearing, I have a million

00:58:24.167 --> 00:58:25.625 align:middle line:84%
of these, all
different gem stones.

00:58:25.625 --> 00:58:28.428 align:middle line:84%
I pick a necklace for
everyday by my pendulum.

00:58:28.428 --> 00:58:29.629 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing.

00:58:29.629 --> 00:58:33.366 align:middle line:84%
>> So basically what its reading
is how the energy of the stone

00:58:33.366 --> 00:58:35.702 align:middle line:90%
mixes with my energy today.

00:58:35.702 --> 00:58:36.655 align:middle line:90%
In present time.

00:58:36.655 --> 00:58:38.738 align:middle line:84%
That's another really
important thing to remember.

00:58:38.738 --> 00:58:40.807 align:middle line:84%
You're not who you
were last moment

00:58:40.807 --> 00:58:42.175 align:middle line:90%
or who you'll be next moment.

00:58:42.175 --> 00:58:43.409 align:middle line:90%
You're who you are right now.

00:58:43.409 --> 00:58:45.244 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you use the
pendulum every day?

00:58:45.244 --> 00:58:46.446 align:middle line:90%
>> Everyday.

00:58:46.446 --> 00:58:48.748 align:middle line:84%
>> For getting you out
of any kind of situation?

00:58:48.748 --> 00:58:50.016 align:middle line:90%
>> You know, not that much.

00:58:50.016 --> 00:58:53.319 align:middle line:84%
But the great thing about
using a divination device

00:58:53.319 --> 00:58:55.221 align:middle line:84%
like the pendulum is
you can hold things

00:58:55.221 --> 00:58:56.456 align:middle line:90%
in your receiving hand.

00:58:56.456 --> 00:58:59.459 align:middle line:84%
I've seen people at some
of the co op markets, like,

00:58:59.459 --> 00:59:00.860 align:middle line:90%
does body want a banana?

00:59:00.860 --> 00:59:02.395 align:middle line:90%
Does body want a tangerine?

00:59:02.395 --> 00:59:03.195 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:59:03.195 --> 00:59:06.235 align:middle line:84%
So it's a great way to
find out what you're

00:59:06.235 --> 00:59:08.468 align:middle line:90%
energetic system really wants.

00:59:08.468 --> 00:59:12.472 align:middle line:84%
>> Did I almost not make
it because of a snow storm

00:59:12.472 --> 00:59:13.272 align:middle line:90%
in L.A.?

00:59:13.272 --> 00:59:14.314 align:middle line:90%
[Dr. Cielo laughing] See?

00:59:14.314 --> 00:59:16.275 align:middle line:90%
Does it snowstorm here?

00:59:16.275 --> 00:59:17.844 align:middle line:90%
Truly amazing how this works.

00:59:17.844 --> 00:59:18.678 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it is fun.

00:59:18.678 --> 00:59:20.079 align:middle line:90%
>> Is it the subconscious mind?

00:59:20.079 --> 00:59:21.080 align:middle line:90%
What's doing that?

00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:23.362 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel myself
moving it, so I

00:59:23.362 --> 00:59:26.085 align:middle line:84%
know I'm not physically
doing it on purpose.

00:59:26.085 --> 00:59:26.953 align:middle line:90%
What's doing it?

00:59:26.953 --> 00:59:27.787 align:middle line:90%
>> Energy.

00:59:27.787 --> 00:59:28.621 align:middle line:90%
>> Energy.

00:59:28.621 --> 00:59:29.989 align:middle line:90%
Through me, through the body.

00:59:29.989 --> 00:59:30.958 align:middle line:90%
Doing whatever it does.

00:59:30.958 --> 00:59:31.758 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:59:31.758 --> 00:59:32.692 align:middle line:90%
>> It is scary though.

00:59:32.692 --> 00:59:33.993 align:middle line:84%
You've got to drop
that sometimes.

00:59:33.993 --> 00:59:35.294 align:middle line:90%
But everybody should do that.

00:59:35.294 --> 00:59:36.829 align:middle line:90%
I think its well worth it.

00:59:36.829 --> 00:59:37.629 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:59:37.629 --> 00:59:39.921 align:middle line:84%
>> And whether you use the
yes/no technique like you do

00:59:39.921 --> 00:59:40.800 align:middle line:90%
or like I do.

00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:42.304 align:middle line:90%
It works either way you do it.

00:59:42.304 --> 00:59:44.137 align:middle line:84%
Would you get out your
website for us again?

00:59:44.137 --> 00:59:45.787 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:59:45.787 --> 00:59:47.440 align:middle line:90%
It's goldenrosepsychic.com.

00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:48.441 align:middle line:90%
>> And your book?

00:59:48.441 --> 00:59:50.309 align:middle line:84%
>> My book is "The
Power of Energy".

00:59:50.309 --> 00:59:52.979 align:middle line:84%
So like you could be
just like me, well, maybe

00:59:52.979 --> 00:59:54.457 align:middle line:84%
you don't want to
be just like me.

00:59:54.457 --> 00:59:56.082 align:middle line:84%
But you can read
energy just like I do.

00:59:56.082 --> 00:59:58.231 align:middle line:84%
The book is, The
Power of Energy:

00:59:58.231 --> 01:00:01.320 align:middle line:84%
Harness the Universe for
Clarity, Peace and Love."

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:02.321 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it.

01:00:02.321 --> 01:00:03.956 align:middle line:84%
Let's hear it for
Dr. Lauren Cielo.

01:00:03.956 --> 01:00:06.092 align:middle line:90%
[Applause] Thank you Lauren.

01:00:06.092 --> 01:00:08.930 align:middle line:84%
Hey the next time
you're at a party

01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:10.763 align:middle line:84%
and somebody gives you
a pendulum and what's

01:00:10.763 --> 01:00:14.407 align:middle line:84%
to ask you some personal
questions, just do what I do,

01:00:14.407 --> 01:00:15.835 align:middle line:90%
drop it and run!

01:00:15.835 --> 01:00:17.770 align:middle line:90%
Thanks!

01:00:17.770 --> 01:00:20.955 align:middle line:90%
[Applause] [Music_]

01:00:20.955 --> 01:00:37.590 align:middle line:90%
