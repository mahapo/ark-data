00:00:04.446 --> 00:00:19.172 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.172 --> 00:00:20.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to Beyond Belief.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.690 align:middle line:10%
Maria Martinez is with us,
an ET contactee and channel

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.230 align:middle line:10%
who has worked with the
luminous beings of light

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.040 align:middle line:10%
since an early childhood.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.479 align:middle line:84%
Through shamanic training,
spirit retrievals

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:36.230 align:middle line:84%
and galactic missions,
she helps others reconnect

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.920 align:middle line:90%
their divine blueprint.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.333 align:middle line:90%
Maria, welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:40.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MARIA MARTINEZ: Thank you.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.520 align:middle line:90%
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.790 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.165 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
get involved in this?

00:00:43.165 --> 00:00:44.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Well, it
started very young.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.780 align:middle line:10%
I started working and actually
doing my missions very early,

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.310 align:middle line:10%
five, six years old.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.650 align:middle line:10%
I was visited by
many beings of light.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Some of them I recognized
as angels, archangels.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.400 align:middle line:10%
Others were ascended
masters and guides.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.190 align:middle line:10%
And it started very early
where they would take me

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.420 align:middle line:10%
to different places to
retrieve small particles

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.110 align:middle line:10%
or small fragments
of other beings

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.720 align:middle line:10%
or other souls or other humans.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did they visit you?

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Many times
they would show up

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.730 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the night.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.100 align:middle line:84%
They would wake me
up, and it was almost

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.400 align:middle line:90%
like going into a trance.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.460 align:middle line:84%
I remember specifically
waking me up

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.160 align:middle line:84%
because they would make sort
of like a tapping sound,

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.060 align:middle line:84%
or they would gently touch
me and I would wake up.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And then we would go into sort
of like trance, bilocating,

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.275 align:middle line:84%
and travel through other
dimensions times and spaces.

00:01:39.275 --> 00:01:40.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did they scare you?

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: No.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.090 align:middle line:90%
It was very familiar to me.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.450 align:middle line:84%
I believe because
I came in knowing

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.550 align:middle line:84%
and I came in
remembering who I was

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.630 align:middle line:84%
and the work that I did
in previous lifetimes,

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.550 align:middle line:90%
so it felt very familiar.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.850 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't afraid of them or
the work that we were doing.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And especially going
into lower dimensions

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.480 align:middle line:84%
and rescuing or retrieving
soul particles from places

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.180 align:middle line:84%
like-- that were very
demonic, having them

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.610 align:middle line:90%
around felt very comfortable.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.349 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you were
just a little kid.

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you tell
your parents about this?

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.600 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: I did.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.960 align:middle line:84%
I did, and they
weren't surprised

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.950 align:middle line:84%
because I come from a lineage of
healers, lightworkers, shamans,

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.960 align:middle line:84%
my mother, several of her
siblings, my grandfather.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.350 align:middle line:84%
So it was sort of
normal for us to be

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.820 align:middle line:84%
able to see, to feel, to
experience beyond this dimension

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.220 align:middle line:90%
and work with other beings.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The luminous
beings of light,

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.325 align:middle line:84%
at what point did you realize
what they were, who they were?

00:02:41.325 --> 00:02:43.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: It
wasn't until later.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:49.660 align:middle line:84%
I would say probably early
30s, going into my 40s.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.238 align:middle line:84%
The reason I recognized
who they were

00:02:51.238 --> 00:02:52.780 align:middle line:84%
is because they were
different from--

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.555 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So much
later in your life.

00:02:54.555 --> 00:02:58.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: And it almost
felt like a journey to--

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.790 align:middle line:84%
my own journey of
elevating my own frequency,

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.300 align:middle line:84%
elevating my
consciousness, elevating

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.670 align:middle line:90%
and expanding my gifts.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.220 align:middle line:84%
Earlier on I worked
with beings, again,

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.810 align:middle line:84%
that were maybe a
little bit more dense.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.990 align:middle line:84%
And as I continue to
expand and evolve,

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.960 align:middle line:84%
then I was able to access higher
dimensions, hence the dimensions

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.590 align:middle line:90%
that they exist in.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You brought us
a artistic representation

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.290 align:middle line:84%
of these luminous
beings of light.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.880 align:middle line:90%
Explain to us what they are.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.900 align:middle line:84%
So this realm, I call it
beyond the 48th dimension.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.495 align:middle line:84%
It's a place where
when you're there--

00:03:38.495 --> 00:03:40.120 align:middle line:84%
and they take many
people there with me

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.540 align:middle line:84%
when we're doing spiritual work,
healing work, alchemical work.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.310 align:middle line:84%
When they show up,
they're pure essence.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.710 align:middle line:84%
You can sense their
consciousness,

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.310 align:middle line:84%
feel their consciousness
and their silhouette.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.070 align:middle line:84%
And they come in,
they have specialties.

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.280 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were blueprints,
some of them were architects,

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.950 align:middle line:84%
some of them are like
galactic doctors.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.160 align:middle line:84%
Depending on what we're working
on or who we're working with,

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.890 align:middle line:84%
several of them show up to
work with that individual.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.630 align:middle line:84%
These beings of light
are pure essence.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.230 align:middle line:84%
They're plasmic energy, and the
realm itself is very liquid.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.760 align:middle line:84%
So once you enter there,
you're aware of yourself,

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.177 align:middle line:84%
but you lose yourself in
the essence of this realm.

00:04:23.177 --> 00:04:24.635 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that
you in the middle?

00:04:24.635 --> 00:04:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: That's a
representation of what

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.360 align:middle line:90%
I look like when I'm traveling.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.402 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the light
beings are all around you.

00:04:30.402 --> 00:04:31.220 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's pretty much
looks like this.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.650 align:middle line:84%
It's a very open space,
lots of geometry,

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.950 align:middle line:84%
sacred geometry, different
beings of light showing up.

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.460 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like a
welcoming into the space.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And then once we decide what
we're going to be doing,

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.630 align:middle line:84%
some of them step
forward specifically

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.020 align:middle line:84%
to work with the individuals
that I bring to this realm.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And where
is this happening?

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.260 align:middle line:90%
In your bedroom?

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.125 align:middle line:90%
Where might it be?

00:04:57.125 --> 00:05:00.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: This
happens anywhere.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.140 align:middle line:90%
It happens like in this moment.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.690 align:middle line:84%
If I was working with
you, we'd go there.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.770 align:middle line:84%
We'd go to that dimension
and you have an opportunity

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.100 align:middle line:84%
to meet with them,
ask them questions,

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.550 align:middle line:84%
work on different things,
even download different things

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.270 align:middle line:90%
that you're ready to access.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.150 align:middle line:84%
So either in sessions
or in meditation

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.380 align:middle line:84%
or at any time in
the astral plane.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.896 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it physical
or non-physical?

00:05:25.896 --> 00:05:27.580 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: It's non-physical.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.110 align:middle line:90%
It's a non-physical plane.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.210 align:middle line:84%
The higher you go
up in dimensions,

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.845 align:middle line:84%
there's less density so
there it's less physical.

00:05:33.845 --> 00:05:35.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
these luminous beings

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.370 align:middle line:90%
of light trying to teach us?

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: These
luminous beings of light

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.900 align:middle line:84%
are teaching us, first of all,
true sovereignty, liberty,

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.770 align:middle line:84%
and the remembrance
and the knowing that's

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.190 align:middle line:90%
already within ourselves.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.070 align:middle line:84%
When we are in
communion with them,

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.770 align:middle line:84%
they're activating within
us our divine blueprint,

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.230 align:middle line:84%
they're activating
our DNA, that they're

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.820 align:middle line:84%
activating the crystalline
blueprint within ourselves.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.420 align:middle line:84%
They're helping us remember
and access who we truly

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.840 align:middle line:90%
are as divine beings ourselves.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At that age of five,
Maria, the angels came to you,

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.635 align:middle line:84%
how do you know
they were angels?

00:06:10.635 --> 00:06:14.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: I believe it was a
knowing from my previous work

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.980 align:middle line:84%
with the angels, especially
archangel Michael, the Seraphim,

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:19.880 align:middle line:90%
the Elohim.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.570 align:middle line:84%
When they came to me,
it was like somebody

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.290 align:middle line:84%
that I knew for
a very long time.

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:26.260 align:middle line:84%
Again, they seemed
very familiar.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.930 align:middle line:84%
The conversations that we
had also felt very familiar.

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you know
it was archangel Michael?

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:34.690 align:middle line:90%
Did he tell you that?

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:36.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: I
recognized his essence.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.760 align:middle line:84%
I recognize-- so when somebody
presents itself, even now,

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.280 align:middle line:90%
I recognize who they are.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.530 align:middle line:84%
If an Arcturian comes
in, a Pleiadian comes in,

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.470 align:middle line:84%
a reptilian comes
in, I recognize.

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:49.870 align:middle line:84%
I have a knowing
about who they are.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And I also tune into
their energy signature

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.380 align:middle line:90%
to recognize the root.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:59.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many people on this
planet are doing what you do?

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:03.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Oh, I would
say thousands, maybe even

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:06.550 align:middle line:84%
millions of people in this
planet are doing what I do.

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.500 align:middle line:84%
I believe a lot of us
are coming in and either

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.740 align:middle line:84%
have already
awakened to this work

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.270 align:middle line:84%
or are in that
process of awakening.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:21.420 align:middle line:84%
But even now, more starseeds
are coming in to help humanity

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:25.050 align:middle line:84%
and to bridge the many
galaxies in the knowledge

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:26.780 align:middle line:90%
and access the cosmic library.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
these luminous beings,

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:34.860 align:middle line:84%
Maria, say about this
planet, this world?

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: The beings of light,
especially the luminous beings

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:43.980 align:middle line:84%
of light, their core
purpose is restoration,

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:49.030 align:middle line:84%
and it's moving us back
to the divine blueprint.

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:52.260 align:middle line:84%
So about this planet,
it's about restoring Gaia,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.990 align:middle line:84%
and it's about restoring us
to the origin of blueprint

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:59.670 align:middle line:84%
without the distortions,
without the interferences,

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:02.640 align:middle line:84%
restoring our free will,
our true sovereignty.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And what the space that
they're holding for us

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:08.690 align:middle line:84%
is for us to awaken
to our divine power

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.930 align:middle line:84%
and move back and close
that gap of separation,

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:17.730 align:middle line:84%
and release and heal and remove
everything that was implanted,

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:21.800 align:middle line:84%
everything that was
distorted, our DNA,

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.750 align:middle line:84%
other implants, other
synthetic implants,

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.600 align:middle line:84%
other distortions
from other beings

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.730 align:middle line:84%
that came in to
manipulate or take

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:31.207 align:middle line:84%
siphon our life force
or energy or essence.

00:08:31.207 --> 00:08:33.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, your
grandfather was a shaman.

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:33.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did he teach
you these abilities?

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: He taught me a lot
of this in the astral plane.

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:45.120 align:middle line:84%
So I left Mexico when I was
about five or six-years-old.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And I used to meet him
in the-- or I still

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:52.620 align:middle line:84%
do, actually-- in a place where
both him and my grandmother

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:53.440 align:middle line:90%
would meet me.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.180 align:middle line:90%
And it was this beautiful place.

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.330 align:middle line:90%
It was this beautiful place.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.180 align:middle line:84%
It's up in a hill,
and they're surrounded

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.080 align:middle line:90%
by many flowers and herbs.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.430 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful meadow.

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:07.140 align:middle line:84%
So in the astro
plane, my grandfather

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.400 align:middle line:84%
would teach me about the
herbs and my grandmother.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.870 align:middle line:84%
They would also teach me
about the healing and healing

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:14.320 align:middle line:90%
aspects of the herbs.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.330 align:middle line:84%
We also would do
initiations together.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:23.340 align:middle line:84%
And even now when they come in,
they come in-- especially when

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:26.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm working with the ancestral
lineage and the bloodline--

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.750 align:middle line:84%
on both the masculine
and the feminine.

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:32.825 align:middle line:84%
So they're constantly supporting
and helping me remember.

00:09:32.825 --> 00:09:36.332 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did your
grandfather become a shaman?

00:09:36.332 --> 00:09:38.765 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: He was also
a naturally born shaman.

00:09:38.765 --> 00:09:39.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, he was?

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:40.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:43.480 align:middle line:84%
So he came in also
very much awake.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.190 align:middle line:90%
And he came in with the knowing.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:47.200 align:middle line:84%
He also started his
work very young.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't have, per se,
a person that taught him.

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:53.660 align:middle line:84%
He also, like myself
very early on,

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.530 align:middle line:84%
had beings that
were teaching him.

00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:01.030 align:middle line:84%
They're teaching him different
ways of healing, especially

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:06.420 align:middle line:84%
in his era, clearing black
magic, witchcraft, curses,

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:07.220 align:middle line:90%
hexes.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:09.303 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, this sounds
like it's generational,

00:10:09.303 --> 00:10:10.770 align:middle line:90%
it's handed down.

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:13.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Yeah, I
believe that it is.

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that I stepped
into it in a very different way

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.800 align:middle line:84%
in terms of accessing
what was already there

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.630 align:middle line:84%
and also remembering
from my past lives

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:26.120 align:middle line:84%
the work that I did there,
not just with humanity

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.880 align:middle line:84%
but with Mother Earth
and beyond, the galaxies.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And now, especially working with
the luminous beings, is cosmic.

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:35.330 align:middle line:84%
The work that I
do is very cosmic.

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:38.327 align:middle line:84%
It's universal, is
divine intelligence,

00:10:38.327 --> 00:10:39.285 align:middle line:90%
is source intelligence.

00:10:39.285 --> 00:10:41.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There aren't
many eight-year-olds

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:43.958 align:middle line:84%
who start their
shamanic initiation.

00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.000 align:middle line:90%
What was it like for you?

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: It was
very interesting.

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:50.810 align:middle line:84%
We were introduced to a
shaman, and at the time

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:52.610 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know she was a shaman.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:56.120 align:middle line:84%
When she saw me and
recognized who I was,

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.040 align:middle line:84%
she invited my
parents to come over

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:03.050 align:middle line:84%
and basically told them that I
travel a lot during the night

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:06.005 align:middle line:84%
and that I'm already doing
my shamanic work, especially.

00:11:06.005 --> 00:11:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And she described the
work that I was already

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:12.050 align:middle line:84%
doing, retrieving soul
fragments, clearing entities.

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:14.400 align:middle line:84%
Basically at that age
I was doing exorcisms.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And she suggested to my parents
that it was really important

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.830 align:middle line:90%
for me to start my initiation.

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:25.170 align:middle line:84%
Because I was so young
in the human body,

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:26.700 align:middle line:84%
it didn't remember
a lot of that.

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.770 align:middle line:84%
I remembered it as
a soul, as a spirit.

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:31.880 align:middle line:84%
So she started introducing
at the conscious level, tools

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:34.940 align:middle line:84%
for me to protect myself,
from me to ground myself,

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:36.420 align:middle line:90%
for me to clear myself.

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:37.740 align:middle line:90%
And it was very interesting.

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:41.360 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really
understand at that point

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:48.750 align:middle line:84%
the magnitude of it or
the universal impact,

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.650 align:middle line:84%
but for me at that
time, it was fun.

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:55.740 align:middle line:84%
It was fun to go and
participate and have

00:11:55.740 --> 00:12:02.550 align:middle line:84%
initiations, activations,
participate in healing baths.

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:04.265 align:middle line:90%
It was fun for me at that age.

00:12:04.265 --> 00:12:06.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's move to 18.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:09.560 align:middle line:84%
What kind of shamanic initiation
and training did you get?

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yeah.

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:12.610 align:middle line:84%
So at the age of
18, I was in college

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.000 align:middle line:84%
and a lot was happening there
where a lot of dimensions

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.620 align:middle line:84%
were opening up during
my college years.

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:20.460 align:middle line:84%
So that's when I went back
to her and I said, this is--

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:21.910 align:middle line:90%
I need to get a hold of this.

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:26.190 align:middle line:84%
So she created a process
for me where that's

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:28.060 align:middle line:90%
when I first began to channel.

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:30.840 align:middle line:84%
So when I'd come
to visit her, she'd

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:35.380 align:middle line:84%
have sort of everything set up
in terms of crystals, herbs,

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.660 align:middle line:84%
oils, whatever we
were going to use.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And she already had missions
for me to go on with her.

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:43.440 align:middle line:84%
So I'd come to her house,
we'd sit at a table,

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.180 align:middle line:90%
and she was also a channel.

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:50.040 align:middle line:84%
So as soon as she touched my
hand, she would go into trance

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.220 align:middle line:84%
and then begin to tell me
exactly what the mission was

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:54.340 align:middle line:90%
going to be about.

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And she would begin
to explain everything

00:12:56.370 --> 00:13:01.530 align:middle line:84%
that we were going to be
using to liberate or to heal

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:04.030 align:middle line:84%
or to undo whatever
we were doing.

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times it was
witchcraft or black magic.

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:09.490 align:middle line:90%
So it was very interesting.

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:12.990 align:middle line:84%
I started with what I
called earth energy, that's

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:14.380 align:middle line:90%
what-- or Earth Magic.

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:20.140 align:middle line:84%
She taught me of the herbs
as well and the crystals.

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:25.810 align:middle line:84%
Also taught me about using
objects to infuse energy.

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And now I've taken
that, and now you

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:32.050 align:middle line:84%
working with the
luminous beings of light,

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:34.852 align:middle line:90%
I work with pure frequency.

00:13:34.852 --> 00:13:38.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us what happened
at 12, this ET contact.

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.800 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: That was also
very interesting and strange

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:45.770 align:middle line:84%
at the same time because
it was my first experience.

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:49.240 align:middle line:84%
I remember sitting on my bed
just hearing these noises,

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.820 align:middle line:84%
like a buzzing, almost
like the TV analog

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:55.330 align:middle line:84%
when it kind of makes this
kind of buzzing sound.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:58.240 align:middle line:84%
When I started
hearing that, it felt

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.420 align:middle line:84%
like I was going to have a
headache and my visual started

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:02.390 align:middle line:90%
changing.

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden I saw what

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:08.680 align:middle line:84%
looked like these kind of
codes and squiggly lines

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:10.160 align:middle line:90%
in front of me.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.870 align:middle line:90%
And then they expanded.

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:14.020 align:middle line:84%
They almost expanded
backwards as

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:17.270 align:middle line:84%
if the portal was opening
up, the portal opening up.

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:22.390 align:middle line:84%
And from that portal,
a being came out.

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:28.780 align:middle line:84%
He was tall, but his torso
was not lengthy or slinky.

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:32.020 align:middle line:84%
He was kind of compact, but
it was-- he was very tall.

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And the way he communicated
was through telepathy,

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:40.820 align:middle line:84%
but what I heard initially
were the similar sounds

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:43.020 align:middle line:84%
that I heard before
the portal opened.

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:46.280 align:middle line:84%
So it was like a
clicking, ticking sound

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:48.870 align:middle line:90%
and then some other tones.

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:52.580 align:middle line:84%
And then in that moment
when he walked out

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:55.440 align:middle line:84%
of the portal, that's when
I understood so, again,

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.720 align:middle line:84%
I felt he was talking
to me through telepathy.

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:02.010 align:middle line:84%
I also feel like I-- because
now I channel light language,

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:05.700 align:middle line:84%
there's an understanding,
when you hear light language,

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:08.120 align:middle line:84%
if you're also channeling
light language, what

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.570 align:middle line:90%
that language is about.

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:12.710 align:middle line:84%
So I feel like those
tones, I recognize

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:16.710 align:middle line:84%
or I can hear the frequency
of it, and it was interpreted.

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:23.240 align:middle line:84%
He came in to show
me what was beyond.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:27.350 align:middle line:84%
In that area or in that
stage, at 12, I was--

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:32.180 align:middle line:84%
even though I already knew who
I was, I wasn't fully in it

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:34.640 align:middle line:90%
and I was very sheltered.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:38.540 align:middle line:84%
My parents were a
bit afraid that I

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:40.980 align:middle line:84%
didn't have other
resources or other training

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:43.950 align:middle line:84%
to do the work that I
was doing, so they would

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:46.470 align:middle line:90%
ask me to keep it hush hush.

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:50.670 align:middle line:84%
So this being of light came
in to show me what was beyond.

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:54.510 align:middle line:84%
As he stepped out of the
portal, he pulled up his hands

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:57.730 align:middle line:84%
and then around him I
saw different images,

00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:00.932 align:middle line:84%
very similar to the
images in the frame

00:16:00.932 --> 00:16:03.140 align:middle line:84%
we saw earlier in the picture
of the luminous beings.

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:05.473 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you brought
us another artistic rendering

00:16:05.473 --> 00:16:06.670 align:middle line:90%
of this first encounter.

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:07.550 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:10.375 align:middle line:90%


00:16:10.375 --> 00:16:11.580 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:14.430 align:middle line:90%
So a lot of sacred geometry.

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:18.000 align:middle line:84%
I feel like this was my
introduction to everything

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.350 align:middle line:84%
that is beyond what we
know or what I knew,

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:26.045 align:middle line:84%
everything that is beyond
what I was currently living.

00:16:26.045 --> 00:16:28.185 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It was like a
window to the universe, huh?

00:16:28.185 --> 00:16:30.038 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: It was a
window to the universe,

00:16:30.038 --> 00:16:31.330 align:middle line:90%
but it was much more than that.

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:36.910 align:middle line:84%
I felt like it was a
message of the knowledge,

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:41.256 align:middle line:84%
the cosmic library that is out
there, that is so accessible.

00:16:41.256 --> 00:16:43.725 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did the ET come
walking through there?

00:16:43.725 --> 00:16:46.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: He walked all
the way out, stand before me.

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:48.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did it scare you?

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:51.010 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: No, it didn't.

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:54.830 align:middle line:84%
None of my interactions
were scary for me.

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:59.500 align:middle line:84%
Even when I was facing
very dark, demonic beings,

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:03.880 align:middle line:84%
I didn't feel
scared at that time.

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:07.736 align:middle line:84%
I feel like that fear
comes from the ego,

00:17:07.736 --> 00:17:09.819 align:middle line:84%
and that's more when you're
in your conscious self

00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:11.540 align:middle line:90%
and in the human body.

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:15.619 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these experiences
I felt I was beyond,

00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:19.220 align:middle line:84%
I was at the soul level, I
was at the spiritual level.

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:23.290 align:middle line:84%
I was in the astral plane
when these experiences--

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:24.710 align:middle line:90%
and they were perfect.

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:28.730 align:middle line:84%
And as they
presented themselves,

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:31.160 align:middle line:84%
it was a download
of information.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.430 align:middle line:84%
Especially in this
one, a download

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:40.360 align:middle line:84%
of the consciousness that's
beyond the other galaxies that

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:44.420 align:middle line:84%
were available and
what can be accessed.

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like this was also
a message of where I was going

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:49.550 align:middle line:84%
and what I was going
to be working with.

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:53.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, that information, and more
than that information, that

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:57.460 align:middle line:84%
was presented to me about
other galaxies, other beings,

00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:59.870 align:middle line:84%
the impact, the power
of sacred geometry.

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:00.885 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Past lives?

00:18:00.885 --> 00:18:02.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: The past lives.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:02.895 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How many?

00:18:02.895 --> 00:18:05.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: In that
moment it almost felt

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:07.990 align:middle line:84%
like it was an infinite
amount because I could see all

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:12.070 align:middle line:90%
the flashing of the pictures.

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:14.560 align:middle line:84%
If I was to count
them now, as I'm

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:18.692 align:middle line:84%
looking at that picture,
about 100 and 103, 108.

00:18:18.692 --> 00:18:19.525 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Past lives?

00:18:19.525 --> 00:18:20.325 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Mhm.

00:18:20.325 --> 00:18:21.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:23.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Well, we've
lived many, many, many.

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:26.420 align:middle line:84%
Many of us have been here
for a very long time.

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:29.110 align:middle line:84%
And that was just
a short 100 and--

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:32.440 align:middle line:84%
103, 108 that they
wanted me to be

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:35.283 align:middle line:84%
aware of that were
correlating to the work

00:18:35.283 --> 00:18:36.700 align:middle line:84%
that I was doing
here immediately.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you were also
taken aboard a starship?

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:40.525 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:18:40.525 --> 00:18:41.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell us about that.

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:43.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Well, that
happened several times

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:46.280 align:middle line:90%
where I was aboard many ships.

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:52.710 align:middle line:84%
There was one when I went
and did my training there.

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:54.650 align:middle line:84%
There was another
time where they

00:18:54.650 --> 00:19:00.180 align:middle line:84%
asked me to come and be
part of the leadership.

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And there was another
one where I came

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:06.090 align:middle line:84%
and they introduced
me to my own ship.

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And this is where I
take a lot of my clients

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.390 align:middle line:84%
to do the work with
the luminous beings

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:14.760 align:middle line:84%
and to access the
Akashic library,

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:21.330 align:middle line:84%
and also to do other DNA
blueprinting architect work.

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind
of training did you

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:25.546 align:middle line:84%
do with astral realm
combat training?

00:19:25.546 --> 00:19:26.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: OK.

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.730 align:middle line:90%
So in that astral plane--

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:34.350 align:middle line:84%
so my training started
as actual combat,

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:38.640 align:middle line:84%
meaning that they would
train me with other people--

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:43.350 align:middle line:84%
or other beings, other
spirits, to do contact

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:45.160 align:middle line:90%
as if we were in the military.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:53.650 align:middle line:84%
So it was almost like we were
like an elite of Navy SEALs.

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:55.590 align:middle line:84%
Like the Navy SEALs,
like the elite group

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:57.810 align:middle line:84%
that works behind the
scenes that goes on missions

00:19:57.810 --> 00:19:59.440 align:middle line:90%
that nobody really knows about.

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And this combat initially
incorporated hands-on

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:07.740 align:middle line:90%
and incorporated weapons.

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.770 align:middle line:84%
As that training
progressed, now it

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:15.840 align:middle line:84%
incorporates frequency,
sound, tones.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.130 align:middle line:84%
It incorporates a
sacred geometry.

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:21.510 align:middle line:84%
But it was very interesting
to start there and be

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:26.910 align:middle line:84%
in a room that looked like
sort of a Dojo, other beings

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:32.425 align:middle line:84%
from different galaxies sitting
there, waiting to participate

00:20:32.425 --> 00:20:33.225 align:middle line:90%
in this training.

00:20:33.225 --> 00:20:35.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you battle
with any of them?

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:36.320 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: I did.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:39.200 align:middle line:84%
I did with several, but the
one that was more memorable--

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:43.070 align:middle line:84%
most memorable was a being
that kind of looked like a sumo

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:44.565 align:middle line:90%
wrestler who was--

00:20:44.565 --> 00:20:45.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's big.

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:49.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: --big like
five times my size.

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:53.642 align:middle line:84%
And I remember that the first
time I fought, I didn't win.

00:20:53.642 --> 00:20:55.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you brought
us another rendering

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.050 align:middle line:90%
of this sumo wrestler.

00:20:57.050 --> 00:20:58.450 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at this.

00:20:58.450 --> 00:20:59.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:00.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Geez.

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:02.290 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTINEZ: So this is
what it looked like.

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:06.680 align:middle line:10%
And I remember we did several,
we would fight with each other.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.210 align:middle line:10%
This was all practice.

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:11.660 align:middle line:84%
And the first time I
fought him, I didn't win.

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:15.802 align:middle line:84%
And I just remember just giving
it my all and it didn't happen.

00:21:15.802 --> 00:21:17.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He would
have crushed you.

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:19.753 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTINEZ: And the
second time around--

00:21:19.753 --> 00:21:21.920 align:middle line:10%
it might have been more
than the second time around,

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:25.110 align:middle line:10%
but I remember when I completed
this training is when I actually

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:25.910 align:middle line:10%
beat him.

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:28.820 align:middle line:10%
So when I beat
him, this was done

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:31.102 align:middle line:10%
and then they moved me to
the next level of training.

00:21:31.102 --> 00:21:33.741 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did you beat him?

00:21:33.741 --> 00:21:38.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Well, part of
it was we also use high--

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:44.190 align:middle line:84%
we also learn how to use
telekinesis in this realm.

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:46.340 align:middle line:84%
So some of it was
that, some of it

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:50.270 align:middle line:90%
was really outmaneuvering him.

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And in this, what I also learned
when you're in the astral plane

00:21:54.320 --> 00:22:00.460 align:middle line:84%
is that it's your imagination
that creates who you are.

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:02.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was he
trying to hurt you?

00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:03.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes and no.

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:05.250 align:middle line:10%
I mean, not necessarily.

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:07.410 align:middle line:10%
We were all helping
each other train.

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:13.620 align:middle line:10%
And so what happened here, I
made myself stronger than him.

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:16.740 align:middle line:84%
So I brought in the physical,
I brought in the mental,

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:20.735 align:middle line:84%
I brought in the intellectual
strategy to beat him.

00:22:20.735 --> 00:22:24.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you also learned
interdimensional combat training

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:26.840 align:middle line:90%
beyond the ship, did you not?

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:27.655 align:middle line:90%
Outside of it?

00:22:27.655 --> 00:22:27.985 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:22:27.985 --> 00:22:29.152 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What was that like?

00:22:29.152 --> 00:22:31.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: So that's
what I'm referring to,

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:36.600 align:middle line:84%
that they took me from
this physical with weapons,

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:37.497 align:middle line:90%
physical combat.

00:22:37.497 --> 00:22:38.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They all look like him?

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:40.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: No, no, no.

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:42.030 align:middle line:90%
Not all of them.

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:43.530 align:middle line:90%
They are very different.

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:47.060 align:middle line:84%
Some of them do have
their size, others--

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:51.980 align:middle line:84%
if you can imagine being in a
room and everybody has a gift,

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:55.100 align:middle line:84%
either they can
move objects or they

00:22:55.100 --> 00:23:00.150 align:middle line:84%
can work with the elements
or they can conjure things,

00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:02.935 align:middle line:84%
so that was the next level
of training after that.

00:23:02.935 --> 00:23:05.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why were they
training you for combat?

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:08.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Because the work
that I do, my sole mission,

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:13.010 align:middle line:84%
is to heal the
blueprint, which means

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:17.250 align:middle line:84%
removing the distortions,
which means finding, seeking,

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:24.450 align:middle line:84%
entity interruptions, demonic,
archon, reptilian, Anunnaki,

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:26.900 align:middle line:84%
distortions, or
other shadow beings

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:31.830 align:middle line:84%
that have taken over
the physical body or any

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:34.510 align:middle line:84%
of the multidimensional
bodies, the mental, physical,

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:39.360 align:middle line:84%
and emotional, soul or spirit
or other, the blueprint.

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And they were training
me to do this,

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:48.480 align:middle line:84%
to help humanity, and
other beings of light,

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:51.810 align:middle line:84%
restore true sovereignty
so they can come back

00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:56.580 align:middle line:84%
to owning their divine blueprint
to the original source, which

00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:00.240 align:middle line:84%
is when we're limitless,
we're all powerful,

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:06.120 align:middle line:84%
we don't really age, we can
create instant manifestation

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:08.670 align:middle line:84%
where we can command
and so it becomes.

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:11.170 align:middle line:84%
So that is part of
my soul's mission.

00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:14.610 align:middle line:84%
So all of this
training was for me

00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:18.900 align:middle line:84%
to express my soul
mission in the highest

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:20.690 align:middle line:90%
and best for everyone involved.

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:23.985 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you didn't want
to be a warrior, did you?

00:24:23.985 --> 00:24:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: No, I
didn't in that sense.

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.650 align:middle line:84%
And I actually
asked at one point.

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:34.720 align:middle line:84%
What I asked-- because it
was very dark at one point

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:37.670 align:middle line:84%
where the beings
that I was fighting,

00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:40.490 align:middle line:84%
the missions that I was
going, I was very dark.

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:43.850 align:middle line:84%
So at one point I asked
my counselor, I said,

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:46.390 align:middle line:90%
I accept my mission.

00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:48.730 align:middle line:84%
I appreciate that I'm
here and I appreciate

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:52.450 align:middle line:84%
the impact I create
or I contribute to,

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:54.850 align:middle line:90%
but I want to do this with joy.

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And when I asked that, I
still do the same thing

00:24:58.610 --> 00:24:59.930 align:middle line:90%
but now I do it differently.

00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I
mean, that now the way

00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:04.660 align:middle line:84%
I do it, yes, it's
the imagination,

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:06.690 align:middle line:90%
it's sacred geometry.

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:09.850 align:middle line:84%
They're introducing me to
a higher beings of light

00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:14.270 align:middle line:84%
where when they come
in and they say, OK,

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:16.180 align:middle line:84%
I see this in that
person, immediately

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:17.390 align:middle line:90%
that's taken care of.

00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:19.150 align:middle line:84%
If I'm working
with somebody and I

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:22.880 align:middle line:84%
see a distortion in their field,
if I see an entity implanted,

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:26.580 align:middle line:84%
if I see other occupants
in their field,

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:34.190 align:middle line:84%
if I see other snake beings or
black magic, as soon as I look

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:37.050 align:middle line:90%
at that picture and I stated--

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:38.870 align:middle line:84%
all these beings
of light come in

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:40.590 align:middle line:84%
and release all
this distortions,

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:42.265 align:middle line:90%
so now the work is very easy.

00:25:42.265 --> 00:25:45.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why did you decide
to be a channel of source

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:48.832 align:middle line:90%
instead of being a warrior?

00:25:48.832 --> 00:25:51.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Well, I still
would say that I'm a warrior,

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:53.670 align:middle line:84%
but I'm a light warrior
in a different way.

00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:55.170 align:middle line:90%
It's not a physical.

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:57.180 align:middle line:90%
So it's not a physical exertion.

00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:00.925 align:middle line:84%
I actually now, the work that
I do, I do it from the source.

00:26:00.925 --> 00:26:01.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is source?

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:06.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Source is
that infinite creation.

00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:09.440 align:middle line:84%
It's the infinite
or fountain of all.

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:14.540 align:middle line:84%
It is the divine consciousness,
the unity or oneness

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:18.680 align:middle line:84%
where everything emanates,
it's the creation of all.

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:22.170 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't a choice.

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:25.180 align:middle line:90%
It was a new development for me.

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:28.117 align:middle line:84%
So initially the
work that I was doing

00:26:28.117 --> 00:26:30.700 align:middle line:84%
and the way I was channeling and
the way I was doing the work,

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:32.460 align:middle line:84%
I was using a lot
of my life force

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:35.620 align:middle line:84%
because that's how I knew how
to do it at the beginning.

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And as I continued to
work with my counsel,

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:40.750 align:middle line:84%
as I continued to
work with my mentors,

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:45.720 align:middle line:84%
as I continued to step
further into the bigger not

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:48.210 align:middle line:84%
just the human, not just
Mother Earth, now it's

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:50.430 align:middle line:84%
different galaxies,
as I continue

00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:56.220 align:middle line:84%
to evolve into my mission,
then now the way I channel

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:58.920 align:middle line:90%
or what I channel is the truth.

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:04.090 align:middle line:84%
The true frequency that
is instant creation,

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:07.480 align:middle line:84%
that is instant healing, that
is instant manifestation.

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:11.910 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't take away from my
life force so I'm not depleted,

00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:13.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm not exhausted.

00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:16.160 align:middle line:84%
So I can work with many
and wherever they are.

>>NOORY: Source, what are the
true origins of human DNA?

00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:12.131 align:middle line:90%

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:29.280 align:middle line:84%
The true origin of the
DNA is a collaboration

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:36.300 align:middle line:84%
of other beings of light
intended for the good of all,

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:41.730 align:middle line:84%
intended for the race

through its ascension.

00:34:52.260 --> 00:35:02.010 align:middle line:84%
The beings of light
were many, 22 or more.

00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:05.670 align:middle line:84%
The distortion began
when others beings

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:08.910 align:middle line:84%
saw the opportunity,
the opportunity

00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:16.720 align:middle line:84%
to take to create fear
and to have enslavement.

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:24.850 align:middle line:84%
The true source of the DNA was
meant as limitless potential,

00:35:24.850 --> 00:35:30.640 align:middle line:84%
as pure possibility,
as creation,

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:35.260 align:middle line:90%
was meant to be supernatural.

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:37.130 align:middle line:90%
These gifts were siphoned.

00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:41.800 align:middle line:84%
These gifts were
distorted through control

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:50.050 align:middle line:84%
and through manipulation
to take from

00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:55.840 align:middle line:84%
and to enslave and
to keep oppressed

00:35:55.840 --> 00:36:02.950 align:middle line:84%
for other dark
secrets, or for others

00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:05.590 align:middle line:84%
who were not part of
the higher collective,

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:06.900 align:middle line:90%

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:12.230 align:middle line:90%
It can be restored.

00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:19.160 align:middle line:84%
And we restore it
through healing the DNA,

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:23.220 align:middle line:84%

the DNA splicing,

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:29.990 align:middle line:84%

Angeles had a tragedy

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:28.330 align:middle line:84%
of fires that wiped out
many communities, many homes

00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:30.340 align:middle line:90%
and many people's lives.

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:32.660 align:middle line:84%
Was there galactic
interference there?

00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:35.580 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes, there was.

00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:40.110 align:middle line:84%
When I and other light beings
that I work with tune in, we

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:44.980 align:middle line:84%
saw several ships outside
that were interfering,

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:48.120 align:middle line:84%
that were creating
the chaos or adding

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:54.720 align:middle line:84%
to the chaos that had plasmic
beings in different areas of Los

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:56.250 align:middle line:90%
Angeles.

00:38:56.250 --> 00:38:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And this was like
an opportunity.

00:38:59.310 --> 00:39:01.570 align:middle line:84%
So when we looked
at this situation,

00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:04.720 align:middle line:84%
they were manipulating
those involved.

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:07.970 align:middle line:84%
They were manipulating
the media communication,

00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:13.450 align:middle line:84%
and they were contributing
to the emotional chaos that

00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:17.110 align:middle line:84%
was creating more
of that situation,

00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:22.376 align:middle line:84%
as well as initiating
some of the fires.

00:39:22.376 --> 00:39:26.844 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will there be
another tragedy like that?

00:39:26.844 --> 00:39:29.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: The answer
to that is difficult.

00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:31.360 align:middle line:90%
And even if I tune in--

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:34.120 align:middle line:90%
because we can't control.

00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:38.410 align:middle line:84%
but we can continue to hold
space and we continue to clear

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:45.100 align:middle line:84%
and we can continue to seek
and look out for, restore.

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:49.430 align:middle line:84%
And we can continue to elevate,
elevate our consciousness.

00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:53.300 align:middle line:84%
The higher vibrational we are,
the higher our consciousness,

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:57.710 align:middle line:84%
the less we participate
in that type of chaos

00:39:57.710 --> 00:40:00.950 align:middle line:84%
or we fall into
acting from fear,

00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:03.850 align:middle line:90%
from scarcity, or from doubt.

00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:07.760 align:middle line:84%
The more we elevate
ourselves, the more

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:11.930 align:middle line:84%
we align ourselves, the more
we contribute in a positive way

00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:30.350 align:middle line:84%
restore that DNA blueprint, help

00:40:30.350 --> 00:40:35.090 align:middle line:84%

00:40:35.090 --> 00:40:39.990 align:middle line:84%
some of those gifts, some of
those supernatural abilities,

00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:43.970 align:middle line:84%
and to also express
their own mission,

00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:46.490 align:middle line:84%
to welcome starseeds
into this life

00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:49.640 align:middle line:84%
and help create
the space for them

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:53.490 align:middle line:84%
to bring in what they're here to
bring, to express their mission,

00:40:53.490 --> 00:40:57.680 align:middle line:84%

to elevate mass consciousness

00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:00.250 align:middle line:90%

>>MARTINEZ: There's still
more to do here on Earth.

00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:13.000 align:middle line:90%
I travel to different galaxies.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.310 align:middle line:84%
I meet with different
beings of light,

00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:21.000 align:middle line:84%
and we still see the
opportunity here for humanity

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.790 align:middle line:90%
to evolve even more.

00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:26.740 align:middle line:84%
There's a place where
we're all supernatural.

00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:30.840 align:middle line:84%
There's a timeline where we can
speak telepathically, where we

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:33.760 align:middle line:90%
can move objects with our mind.

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:36.790 align:middle line:84%
There's a timeline
where we don't age,

00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:38.920 align:middle line:90%
so that's where we're going.

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:41.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's why many of
us keep choosing Earth,

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:46.000 align:middle line:84%
because we know that possibility
and we know that reality.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.270 align:middle line:84%
So we are here to continue
to guide, show the way,

00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:55.020 align:middle line:84%
to awaken humanity
to that possibility

00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:59.260 align:middle line:84%
of their limited self, of
their true divine essence,

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:01.660 align:middle line:84%
of living in flow
and prosperity,

00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:04.800 align:middle line:90%
being healthy, never aging.

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:07.175 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is your daily
mission with good old Mother

00:42:07.175 --> 00:42:07.975 align:middle line:90%
Earth?

00:42:07.975 --> 00:42:11.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: It
changes every day.

00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:15.050 align:middle line:84%
Today's mission was
actually not here on Earth.

00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:18.130 align:middle line:84%
It was actually going out
into the galaxies and work

00:42:18.130 --> 00:42:19.430 align:middle line:90%
with the solar flares.

00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:23.710 align:middle line:90%
So what we did, we--

00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:27.680 align:middle line:84%
so the solar flares can be good,
but they can also be harmful.

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And especially for people
that are very sensitive

00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:32.720 align:middle line:84%
and especially if there are
other things that are happening,

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:35.020 align:middle line:90%
other interferences.

00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:40.120 align:middle line:84%
Today's mission was
going out and calibrating

00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:43.930 align:middle line:84%
how we're receiving or
how we're perceiving

00:42:43.930 --> 00:42:46.040 align:middle line:90%
the energy of the solar flares.

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:48.730 align:middle line:84%
A lot of us here are
experiencing them

00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:54.190 align:middle line:84%
as being very tired, being
exhausted, feeling out

00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:56.860 align:middle line:84%
of sorts, not in
our body, feeling

00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:58.970 align:middle line:84%
like we're not able
to do our work.

00:42:58.970 --> 00:43:03.550 align:middle line:84%
So what we did is we went
out to calibrate how humanity

00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:07.990 align:middle line:84%
was receiving them so that
we can do what we're here

00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:12.520 align:middle line:84%
to do very effortlessly in
the way that we're meant to,

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:15.830 align:middle line:90%
in the way that serves many.

00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:17.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
hopeful for the planet?

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:19.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: I am.

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:20.890 align:middle line:90%
I am.

00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:23.980 align:middle line:84%
You asked me this
question before about--

00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:29.780 align:middle line:84%
when we were talking to source,
and Earth, like you said,

00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:32.690 align:middle line:84%
it's going through a
beautiful, beautiful ascension.

00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:38.110 align:middle line:10%
And the more we as humans
awake and the more we

00:43:38.110 --> 00:43:41.530 align:middle line:10%
step into our sovereignty, and
the more we become limitless

00:43:41.530 --> 00:43:45.760 align:middle line:10%
and we more we awaken
our supernatural powers,

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:49.840 align:middle line:10%
Earth also heals because
we heal the trauma that

00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:52.900 align:middle line:10%
is impacting Mother
Earth because we heal

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:57.640 align:middle line:10%
the distortion that is
affecting Mother Earth when

00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:59.330 align:middle line:10%
we hold the lower frequencies.

00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:01.530 align:middle line:90%
So, yes, I am very hopeful.

00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:05.130 align:middle line:84%
I am very hopeful of
where we are all going,

00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:07.290 align:middle line:84%
all the beings that
are coming in to help,

00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:11.750 align:middle line:84%
and all the beings that we can
now access in the 48th dimension

00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:16.470 align:middle line:84%
