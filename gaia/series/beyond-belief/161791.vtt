00:00:19.576 --> 00:00:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to this edition

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.250 align:middle line:90%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.730 align:middle line:10%
And we've got a
great show for you.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.930 align:middle line:10%
We've got two Jays talking
about "Hollywood Decoded,"

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.120 align:middle line:10%
the ability for Hollywood to put
in symbolism in different kinds

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.820 align:middle line:10%
of films and movies
to teach you a lesson,

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.610 align:middle line:10%
to give you information.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.795 align:middle line:84%
Their program, of course,
is on the "Gaia" series,

00:00:39.795 --> 00:00:41.040 align:middle line:90%
"Hollywood Decoded."

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.460 align:middle line:90%
I want you to take a look at it.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.334 align:middle line:10%
>>JAY DYER: In Ridley
Scott's "Blade Runner,"

00:00:44.334 --> 00:00:46.620 align:middle line:10%
we have the warning of a
completely synthetic future,

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.740 align:middle line:10%
something that's completely
overwritten normal reality.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.167 align:middle line:84%
LA traffic is still
bad 20 years from now.

00:00:53.167 --> 00:00:54.000 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Giant ziggurats
towering over the entire city

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.210 align:middle line:84%
with one corporation that runs
it all, the Tyrell Corporation.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.710 align:middle line:90%
And what are they obsessed with?

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.560 align:middle line:84%
Artificial intelligence
and human engineering.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.370 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: So this film is
really an amazing exploration

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:14.340 align:middle line:84%
of what happens when an
artificial creature, Decker,

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.810 align:middle line:84%
begins to realize that he is
beginning to become self-aware,

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.140 align:middle line:90%
self-conscious.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.450 align:middle line:84%
I think that is actually
what the film is about,

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.930 align:middle line:84%
is Decker's coming from
kind of the matrix of being

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.730 align:middle line:90%
artificial intelligence.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And Batty initiating
him, and leading him

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.910 align:middle line:84%
in to individuality,
which he achieves.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.200 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: So with our two
Jays, of course, Jay Dyer,

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.070 align:middle line:10%
you are the author, Jay,
of "Esoteric Hollywood,"

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.480 align:middle line:10%
which is an amazing book that
deals with the intricacies

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.280 align:middle line:10%
of Hollywood.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.624 align:middle line:10%
How did you come up with that?

00:01:48.624 --> 00:01:50.790 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: Well, it's born of
a love of film, actually.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.600 align:middle line:10%
I went to undergrad
and grad school

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.790 align:middle line:10%
focused on film and philosophy.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.980 align:middle line:10%
And the more that you take
film classes, the more

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.990 align:middle line:10%
you realize there's actually
interplay between these two

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.790 align:middle line:10%
worlds.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And simultaneously
with that, I was also

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.750 align:middle line:84%
studying conspiracy
on my own on the side.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.639 align:middle line:84%
I started realizing
that conspiracy is also

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.070 align:middle line:90%
related to Hollywood as well.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.903 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:02:10.903 --> 00:02:13.440 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: And so it all just
kind of flowered together

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.800 align:middle line:10%
into this book, after
about eight or 10 years.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.170 align:middle line:10%
And I happened to meet Jay
Weidner at a conference.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.151 align:middle line:84%
And from that, we just decided
that this needed to be a show.

00:02:25.151 --> 00:02:26.400 align:middle line:90%
There's so much material here.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.700 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
metaphysical, secret society,

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.100 align:middle line:84%
conspiracy topics that
relate to Hollywood.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And even the
blockbusters, that it

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.287 align:middle line:84%
needs to be some kind of show
that demonstrates the symbolism

00:02:37.287 --> 00:02:38.370 align:middle line:90%
that you're talking about.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.703 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And a great show it is.

00:02:39.703 --> 00:02:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And of course, Jay Weidner,
that Jay Dyer just mentioned,

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.440 align:middle line:84%
is a renowned filmmaker and
is responsible for developing

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.260 align:middle line:84%
the "Beyond Belief" television
show five years ago.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.210 align:middle line:90%
Remember that day?

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.790 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: I do.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:51.630 align:middle line:90%
It was a long time ago.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.588 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, welcome.

00:02:52.588 --> 00:02:55.080 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: It's been a long,
long road for "Beyond Belief."

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's been
a great road too.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.410 align:middle line:84%
Robert Frost once
said, "Two roads

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.000 align:middle line:84%
diverged in the
yellow wood, and I

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.821 align:middle line:90%
took the one less traveled by."

00:03:01.821 --> 00:03:02.820 align:middle line:90%
That's what we did, Jay.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.110 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: That's
what we do, actually,

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.460 align:middle line:90%
both you and I. It's our life.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
met up with Jay Dyer

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.510 align:middle line:84%
and started talking
about Hollywood

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.590 align:middle line:84%
and all the strange
things that are going on,

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.770 align:middle line:90%
what was it that you first saw?

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.550 align:middle line:10%
>>WEIDNER: Well first,
like a companion.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.650 align:middle line:10%
I finally had someone I could
talk to about these things,

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.760 align:middle line:10%
because it's been a
lonely road talking about,

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.240 align:middle line:10%
saying that there are
esoteric symbols in the plots

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.660 align:middle line:10%
of Hollywood films.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.700 align:middle line:84%
10 years ago, all I got
was raised eyebrows.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.290 align:middle line:10%
It was only in the
last few years,

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.580 align:middle line:10%
probably because we're coming
at it from two different sides,

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.350 align:middle line:10%
we've started actually
getting people

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.500 align:middle line:10%
to understand that this
is really going on.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.570 align:middle line:10%
And then secondly, I
think filmmakers, in fact

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.120 align:middle line:10%
I know filmmakers
like Christopher Nolan

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.800 align:middle line:10%
are actually listening to us.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.235 align:middle line:10%
And they're starting to
slip things into their films

00:03:52.235 --> 00:03:53.610 align:middle line:10%
because they
realize that this is

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.090 align:middle line:10%
what creates a lasting
benefit to the film,

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.880 align:middle line:10%
that you can go watch
"2001: A Space Odyssey"

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.640 align:middle line:10%
30 years after it
was made and still

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.050 align:middle line:10%
find symbols and messages from
Stanley Kubrick in the film.

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.670 align:middle line:84%
And they want that
kind of-- they

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.620 align:middle line:84%
want their films to
last that long too.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.830 align:middle line:10%
And so I think that, like in
Interstellar for instance,

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.390 align:middle line:10%
I think that
Christopher Nolan is

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.106 align:middle line:10%
burying all sorts of messages
that he wants to be unravelled.

00:04:20.106 --> 00:04:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And Jay and I
actually do unravel

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.560 align:middle line:84%
that film later in our
series, "Hollywood Decoded."

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.010 align:middle line:84%
So I think that it's
both reaching back.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.180 align:middle line:84%
It's showing people what has
already existed in films.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And then we're kind of
co-creating a future in films,

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.140 align:middle line:84%
where filmmakers are
adding in things, messages,

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.997 align:middle line:84%
because they know that there's
people out there drilling down,

00:04:42.997 --> 00:04:43.830 align:middle line:90%
which is what we do.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there some
governmental agency

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.030 align:middle line:84%
that is going to
Hollywood and saying

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.210 align:middle line:84%
look, put in information
about these conspiracies,

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.120 align:middle line:84%
or put in these
things about UFOs.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.160 align:middle line:90%
Is some organization doing that?

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.310 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yes.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.610 align:middle line:84%
I think that Hollywood is
being run by some agency.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.110 align:middle line:90%
I don't know who--

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.920 align:middle line:84%
intel agency, that
is making sure

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.410 align:middle line:84%
there are slow leaks
of information.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.630 align:middle line:90%
And also information withheld.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And aliens are a
perfect example.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.040 align:middle line:10%
If you really follow
Hollywood from the '50s on,

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.140 align:middle line:10%
you can see there's
a slow revealing

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.540 align:middle line:10%
of the alien interaction
with the human race.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kind of getting us
abreast of what's going on.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: That's right,
get us used to an idea.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.860 align:middle line:10%
And also, the same
thing with conspiracy.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.070 align:middle line:10%
Hollywood is more and more
dealing with conspiracy.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.900 align:middle line:10%
Because we're beginning
to figure out that

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.000 align:middle line:10%
there actually is conspiracies.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.280 align:middle line:10%
But also, conspiracies
are great entertainment.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.592 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Shakespeare's greatest
plays are conspiracies.

00:05:44.592 --> 00:05:45.675 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure, absolutely.

00:05:45.675 --> 00:05:46.966 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: "Hamlet," "Macbeth."

00:05:46.966 --> 00:05:49.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Yeah, I think that
when I was doing my research,

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.260 align:middle line:84%
I came across actually
academic text that

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.660 align:middle line:84%
discussed the relationship
between the intelligence

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.300 align:middle line:90%
agencies and Hollywood.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And so most of the 16 or so that
we know, intelligence agencies,

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.970 align:middle line:84%
actually have liaison
offices with various studios.

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.782 align:middle line:84%
And so it's just like you said,
they actually can say at times,

00:06:06.782 --> 00:06:09.240 align:middle line:84%
we want this message here, we
don't want this message here.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.490 align:middle line:84%
You need to alter the
script a little bit here.

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.110 align:middle line:84%
Again, written by university
professors, two or three books

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.990 align:middle line:90%
I came across.

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.830 align:middle line:90%
This blew me away.

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.870 align:middle line:84%
Because I had no
idea that there was

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.400 align:middle line:84%
such an intimate relationship
between the Pentagon

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.200 align:middle line:90%
and Hollywood.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.730 align:middle line:90%
But it's all there.

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:24.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's huge.

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.120 align:middle line:10%
Lamar Waldron, who's been on
"Coast to Coast" and "Beyond

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.210 align:middle line:10%
Belief," has written books
about the JFK assassination,

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:34.500 align:middle line:10%
wrote in his book that the
CIA has a division that

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.380 align:middle line:10%
does nothing but deal with
the media, which includes

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:41.400 align:middle line:10%
Hollywood, trying to get
them to control what they say

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.100 align:middle line:10%
or to say something that
the government wants

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.170 align:middle line:10%
them to know about and say.

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:48.954 align:middle line:84%
Who would think about
that, years ago?

00:06:48.954 --> 00:06:51.120 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Well, William
Colby, the head of the CIA,

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.600 align:middle line:84%
said that he plays the press
like a giant Wurlitzer.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.630 align:middle line:90%
So that was in the '60s.

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And we know around the
JFK assassination, all

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.780 align:middle line:84%
of the interplay of
intelligence agencies,

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.330 align:middle line:84%
trying to hide what
was really going on.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.360 align:middle line:10%
And then Oliver Stone
made his great film in '91

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.590 align:middle line:10%
about JFK, in which the
"Washington Post" reviewed

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.840 align:middle line:10%
the film before it came out.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.810 align:middle line:84%
The first time that a
film was actually reviewed

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.230 align:middle line:90%
at all before it came out.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And it was a huge
negative review.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.165 align:middle line:84%
And the "Washington Post"
has ties to the CIA.

00:07:21.165 --> 00:07:21.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:24.030 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: So we're looking
at this, and saying, yeah,

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:25.030 align:middle line:90%
this is what's going on.

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:26.613 align:middle line:84%
We just have to come
to grips with it.

00:07:26.613 --> 00:07:29.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that the CIA
actually took over Hollywood

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:31.591 align:middle line:90%
until the late '70s.

00:07:31.591 --> 00:07:33.090 align:middle line:10%
They think you can
see, if you watch

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:36.720 align:middle line:10%
films, that there
was a kind of a tenor

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.870 align:middle line:10%
to the films of the '70s, very
rebellious, very revealing,

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.460 align:middle line:10%
very conspiratorial.

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And then "The Godfather,"
actually talking

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.530 align:middle line:84%
about the mafia
for the first time.

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:49.420 align:middle line:84%
And all this, and
then around '79, '80,

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.780 align:middle line:84%
you see a sudden
shift in the way

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.970 align:middle line:84%
that films are more
blockbustery, less

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:56.209 align:middle line:84%
controversial,
and I think that's

00:07:56.209 --> 00:07:57.750 align:middle line:84%
when they started
coming in and said,

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:59.670 align:middle line:84%
uh, you guys, we've
had enough of that.

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:01.684 align:middle line:84%
We're not going
reveal any more truths

00:08:01.684 --> 00:08:02.850 align:middle line:90%
that you guys are revealing.

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:03.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Don't go there.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.443 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Don't go there.

00:08:04.443 --> 00:08:06.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: There's actually
a movie about this topic

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:07.616 align:middle line:90%
called "Wag the Dog."

00:08:07.616 --> 00:08:08.865 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah, absolutely.

00:08:08.865 --> 00:08:09.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: A lot of people
are probably familiar with,

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:11.080 align:middle line:90%
in the early '90s and--

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With Dustin Hoffman.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:12.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.269 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: He plays
Stanley Kubrick.

00:08:14.269 --> 00:08:16.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And then you have
the Robert De Niro character,

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.230 align:middle line:84%
who is more or less the liaison
who's kind of telling him

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:21.450 align:middle line:84%
what to do and how the
scripts going to be.

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:24.090 align:middle line:10%
And they even kind of create
a fake war in Albania,

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:26.230 align:middle line:10%
with Kirsten Dunst, is
actually a young girl.

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:27.896 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: With a blue
screen behind them.

00:08:27.896 --> 00:08:30.799 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: She's holding
Tostitos, and they Photoshop--

00:08:30.799 --> 00:08:31.840 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Etched them out.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:32.640 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, and the
Dustin Hoffman character

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:36.270 align:middle line:90%
is named Stanley.

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:37.645 align:middle line:84%
And he's clearly
Stanley Kubrick.

00:08:37.645 --> 00:08:39.978 align:middle line:84%
And he's running around saying
this is my greatest work,

00:08:39.978 --> 00:08:42.240 align:middle line:84%
this is my greatest work, I
want the world to know it.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And then Robert De Niro
says, uh-uh, uh-uh.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:47.050 align:middle line:90%
And then Dustin Hoffman dies.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:51.660 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that the
director, whose name escapes me

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.280 align:middle line:84%
at the moment, was
trying to show us

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.539 align:middle line:84%
that Stanley Kubrick was
involved in this stuff.

00:08:55.539 --> 00:08:57.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now when we
talk about the meaning

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.470 align:middle line:84%
of esoteric films,
exactly what are

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:00.720 align:middle line:90%
we talking about first of all?

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.360 align:middle line:84%
For a "Beyond Belief"
audience, what

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:06.990 align:middle line:84%
does esoteric mean when you're
dealing with these films?

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:10.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Well, esoteric
means inner, hidden.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And then esoteric
is the opposite

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.440 align:middle line:84%
of that, which is
public and revealed.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And so I titled my
book that because I

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.430 align:middle line:84%
felt like there was
so much going on

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:19.846 align:middle line:84%
in films that it was actually
multi-layered, multi-tiered.

00:09:19.846 --> 00:09:23.460 align:middle line:84%
And you can have the level which
is kind of the surface meaning,

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:26.170 align:middle line:84%
or like if you talk
about great literature,

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:29.000 align:middle line:84%
if you have a college class, you
might do a close reading, which

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.750 align:middle line:84%
is where you're picking
apart the symbols,

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:32.825 align:middle line:84%
and the imagery, and
the foreshadowing.

00:09:32.825 --> 00:09:34.950 align:middle line:84%
But then it goes deeper
than that, because you also

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:37.890 align:middle line:84%
have kind of occult, or esoteric
meanings in a lot of films,

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:40.050 align:middle line:84%
like "2001" or "Eyes
Wide Shut," where

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:42.090 align:middle line:84%
we're dealing with
secret societies,

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:43.900 align:middle line:90%
and metaphysics, and gods.

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:44.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Real life.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:46.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:47.850 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
also layers where

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:50.010 align:middle line:84%
there might be government
propaganda, where

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:54.150 align:middle line:84%
the establishment is essentially
trying to socially engineer

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:57.430 align:middle line:84%
and nudge or turn the population
in a certain direction.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.840 align:middle line:84%
So it can really just go off
in all kinds of directions

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.452 align:middle line:84%
if you know how to
decode those layers.

00:10:02.452 --> 00:10:03.660 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we try to do.

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:05.035 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
wrote the book,

00:10:05.035 --> 00:10:08.790 align:middle line:84%
"Esoteric Hollywood," what was
the impetus to write the book?

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:11.400 align:middle line:84%
What did you first
see that made you say,

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.710 align:middle line:90%
well, there's more to this?

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:15.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: I think when
I was in high school,

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.390 align:middle line:84%
I really developed
a love for film.

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:19.115 align:middle line:10%
And I remember back
in the late '90s,

00:10:19.115 --> 00:10:21.890 align:middle line:10%
"Conspiracy Theory" came
out, the Dick Donner film

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:23.100 align:middle line:10%
with Mel Gibson.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And the whole plot is Mel
Gibson is this former MKUltra

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:27.660 align:middle line:90%
survivor.

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:28.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Who has all this
triggered memory coming back.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:32.329 align:middle line:84%
And he doesn't know
what's going on.

00:10:32.329 --> 00:10:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And he's running this
little conspiracy magazine.

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And I remember watching
that and thinking there's

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:38.670 align:middle line:90%
something going on here.

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:41.360 align:middle line:84%
Why is this film talking
about MKUltra, what's MKUltra?

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.070 align:middle line:84%
So it just kind of
piqued my interest

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:45.019 align:middle line:84%
to start looking
into these topics

00:10:45.019 --> 00:10:46.060 align:middle line:90%
back when I was 17 or 18.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was like a
domino effect after that.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:48.200 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And then you start noticing that
there's all these other films

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:51.530 align:middle line:90%
that have similar topics.

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:54.190 align:middle line:84%
I liked "The Godfather"
trilogy quite a bit,

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:55.560 align:middle line:90%
that Jay mentioned.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.130 align:middle line:10%
And you notice, that
especially in "Godfather II,"

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:01.430 align:middle line:10%
it's all about the mob working
together with the government,

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:04.220 align:middle line:10%
in terms of how to
corrupt senators

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:05.480 align:middle line:10%
and how to coerce them.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And then, in "Part
III," Michael Corleone

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:13.559 align:middle line:84%
becomes this global, basically
private foundation operator.

00:11:13.559 --> 00:11:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And you start noticing,
oh, that's actually

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:16.550 align:middle line:90%
how the world really works.

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:17.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:20.030 align:middle line:84%
So of all the filmmakers
that have been out there,

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:22.310 align:middle line:90%
who's the most esoteric one?

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:24.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: We're probably
going to agree and disagree.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.230 align:middle line:10%
I think that number one,
I have to agree with Jay,

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:28.995 align:middle line:10%
probably Kubrick.

00:11:28.995 --> 00:11:29.870 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I would too.

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:32.450 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: I'm going to say number
two, actually David Lynch.

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:34.590 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And how
about Oliver Stone?

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:36.319 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: Yes, in many ways, yeah.

00:11:36.319 --> 00:11:37.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But Kubrick,
of course, when

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:39.360 align:middle line:84%
he came out with
some of his movies,

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:43.260 align:middle line:84%
and we'll talk about a few more,
"Space Odyssey," "2001: A Space

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:47.920 align:middle line:84%
Odyssey," when I first watched
that, and I was much younger,

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.188 align:middle line:90%
I didn't get it right away.

>>NOORY: Jay, what
did that scene mean?

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:42.836 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Well,
it's interesting.

00:12:42.836 --> 00:12:45.850 align:middle line:84%
There was a famous incident
when they showed "2001: A Space

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:49.210 align:middle line:84%
Odyssey" in Hollywood, at the
Hollywood Dome, the Cinerama

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:51.190 align:middle line:84%
Theater there on
Sunset Boulevard.

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:53.660 align:middle line:84%
Rock Hudson, about
halfway through the film,

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:56.990 align:middle line:84%
stood up and went I don't
know what this movie is about,

00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:59.290 align:middle line:90%
and stormed out of the theater.

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot
of people did that.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.020 align:middle line:84%
I know my dad, when he saw it,
he stormed out of the theater.

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:06.680 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people didn't get it.

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Stormed
out in frustration?

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:09.490 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, frustration.

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:10.940 align:middle line:90%
I was exact opposite.

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:14.020 align:middle line:84%
I was completely entranced and
could not get out of my seat.

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And the usher had to literally
come and tell me to leave,

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:18.130 align:middle line:90%
that it was time to go.

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:19.380 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't get on my seat.

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And I was stunned for like
three days after I saw the film.

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:23.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So you get this.

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:25.240 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: I didn't get it.

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:28.330 align:middle line:84%
I knew that something was
happening that I should get,

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:29.440 align:middle line:90%
but I didn't know why.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.750 align:middle line:84%
It took me years
really to unveil

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:32.900 align:middle line:90%
what was really going on.

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:35.620 align:middle line:84%
I must have seen
it 20 or 30 times.

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:40.390 align:middle line:84%
And I began realizing,
as I matured, and studied

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:43.270 align:middle line:84%
philosophy, and alchemy,
and esotericism,

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:46.840 align:middle line:84%
that Kubrick was heavily
enmeshed in these subjects.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And then after he died,
I talked to a person who

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:53.210 align:middle line:90%
worked at his estate in London.

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:55.510 align:middle line:84%
He said, oh, yeah,
he had whole shelves,

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:58.960 align:middle line:84%
a library full of
alchemy books, philosophy

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.690 align:middle line:90%
books on hermetic traditions.

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:03.104 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right,
he was into this.

00:14:03.104 --> 00:14:04.520 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: He was
totally into it.

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:05.800 align:middle line:90%
It was his life.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:09.280 align:middle line:10%
And I think that he had a
plan at the end of his life

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:14.380 align:middle line:10%
to do "Eyes Wide Shut" and then
"AI" as a kind of final bookend

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:16.930 align:middle line:10%
to what he was really
trying to express

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:21.922 align:middle line:10%
about both esotericism, but also
his fears of secret societies

00:14:21.922 --> 00:14:23.380 align:middle line:10%
and where they're
going to take us,

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:26.320 align:middle line:10%
if they keep going
on unchecked, which

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.210 align:middle line:10%
is what I think
both of those films

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:29.710 align:middle line:10%
were originally
going to be about.

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:32.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And died before he
finished "Eyes Wide Shut."

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:33.228 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yes, he did.

00:14:33.228 --> 00:14:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And I believe they
re-edited "Eyes Wide Shut"

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:39.070 align:middle line:84%
and took huge chunks of
important material out of it.

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:42.037 align:middle line:84%
I was told by one of his top
assistants that this was so.

00:14:42.037 --> 00:14:43.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that was
another esoteric movie

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:47.650 align:middle line:84%
I didn't get until you
watch it three, four times.

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And then it starts
to dawn on you,

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.340 align:middle line:84%
hey, this is a little
symbolism, they're

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:52.750 align:middle line:90%
trying to tell us something.

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:56.440 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, and
Kubrick, when I first

00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:00.700 align:middle line:84%
started arguing that Kubrick was
placing symbols into his films,

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:02.500 align:middle line:84%
this was before "Eyes
Wide Shut" came out.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:03.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.800 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: People,
basically I was chastised

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.960 align:middle line:84%
and called kind of--
you're just seeing

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.190 align:middle line:90%
things that aren't there.

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And then "Eyes Wide Shut"
came out exactly 30 years

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:16.920 align:middle line:84%
after the Apollo launch,
and when people saw that,

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:17.720 align:middle line:90%
that was it.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.070 align:middle line:90%
They all said, you're right.

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:21.130 align:middle line:84%
This guy is obviously
doing things

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:23.170 align:middle line:84%
that we did not
realize in his films.

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And we all have to go
back and take a closer

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:27.490 align:middle line:90%
look at all of his films.

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:30.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was he, in your
opinion, being told what to do?

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.660 align:middle line:90%
Or was he doing this on his own?

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:34.270 align:middle line:10%
>>WEIDNER: He was
being told what

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:37.840 align:middle line:10%
to do in "2001:
A Space Odyssey."

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:40.870 align:middle line:10%
That was definitely the
government telling him

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:44.374 align:middle line:10%
that we're going to reforge the
future, as far as space travel,

00:15:44.374 --> 00:15:45.290 align:middle line:10%
or what it looks like.

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And he had major
corporations behind him,

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:52.450 align:middle line:84%
major people in NASA working
with him on "Space Odyssey."

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:54.100 align:middle line:90%
But I think he cut a deal.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:55.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm pretty sure I'm
right about this.

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:57.220 align:middle line:84%
He's the only
filmmaker, I think,

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:59.500 align:middle line:84%
because of what he
did for the government

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:03.280 align:middle line:84%
in "2001: A Space Odyssey," he
got to kind of have a free ride

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:06.040 align:middle line:84%
and do whatever he wanted
for the rest of his career,

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:08.000 align:middle line:84%
and "Eyes Wide Shut,"
which was re-edited.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:08.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.640 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: But you know, he
did not have anyone re-edit

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.630 align:middle line:90%
"Clockwork Orange."

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:16.930 align:middle line:10%
He re-edited it after
the controversy arised.

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:19.750 align:middle line:84%
Same thing with "Barry
Lyndon," all of his films,

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:21.760 align:middle line:84%
he was in complete
control of them.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:26.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Nazis, Jay
Dyer, understood propaganda.

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:29.900 align:middle line:84%
They even had a department that
did nothing but propaganda.

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Yeah, and this
goes back to the earliest

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:33.100 align:middle line:90%
days of the camera.

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.970 align:middle line:84%
The camera was known,
even when it was invented,

00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:38.916 align:middle line:84%
that it was going to be a
tremendous tool for propaganda.

00:16:38.916 --> 00:16:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And so the Nazis were some of
the first pioneers of that.

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:42.580 align:middle line:90%
You're absolutely right.

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And then Hollywood does
the exact same thing.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.587 align:middle line:84%
Some of the earliest days of
Hollywood were actually Nazis.

00:16:47.587 --> 00:16:49.420 align:middle line:84%
And then you have various
competing factions

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:52.180 align:middle line:84%
who kind of vied for
control of Hollywood.

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:55.290 align:middle line:84%
But from the earliest days,
movies were propaganda.

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:58.570 align:middle line:84%
You can go back to Howard Hughes
in the '20s, "Hell's Angels."

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:01.361 align:middle line:84%
He was filming giant
war propaganda films.

00:17:01.361 --> 00:17:03.610 align:middle line:10%
Most people don't know that,
but they were propaganda.

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:05.290 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Maybe even funded
by the government to do that.

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:06.640 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: Oh, absolutely.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:07.520 align:middle line:10%
>>WEIDNER: I agree.

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:11.329 align:middle line:10%
And Leni Riefenstahl, who
was Hitler's filmmaker,

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:15.460 align:middle line:10%
literally hired 30,000 extras
to be at the Nuremberg rally.

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:17.579 align:middle line:10%
Those weren't people
that were actually Nazis.

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:18.880 align:middle line:10%
Those were people that she
went out in the streets

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.380 align:middle line:10%
and gathered, on
told them how to act.

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:22.599 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Made it sound like
they all wanted to follow him.

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:23.020 align:middle line:10%
>>WEIDNER: Exactly.

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:24.220 align:middle line:10%
It was all propaganda.

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:26.140 align:middle line:10%
The entire Nuremberg
rally was nothing

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:28.060 align:middle line:10%
but staged, the entire thing.

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:29.860 align:middle line:84%
Same with "The
Olympiad," her great film

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:32.020 align:middle line:90%
on the 1936 Olympics.

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:35.140 align:middle line:10%
I mean, that was all staged.

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:36.880 align:middle line:10%
The cameras were
buried under the pool

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.520 align:middle line:10%
so you could see
all the swimmers,

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:40.050 align:middle line:10%
and they were all
brilliantly done.

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:42.460 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, she does
not get enough credit

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:46.490 align:middle line:10%
by the way for her pioneering
filmmaking propaganda

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:47.290 align:middle line:10%
abilities.

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And I'm one of her biggest fans
and think, despite the fact

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.239 align:middle line:84%
that she worked with the
Nazis, she was a genius.

00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:55.030 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: The Soviets
did the same thing too.

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:56.920 align:middle line:10%
There were a lot of Soviet
films that were actually

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.300 align:middle line:10%
pretty famous and well known.

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:00.640 align:middle line:10%
"Battle of Potemkin" is
actually a propaganda film.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:03.280 align:middle line:10%
So you've got the communists,
you've got the fascists,

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:05.655 align:middle line:10%
and you've got America as well
doing their own propaganda

00:18:05.655 --> 00:18:06.454 align:middle line:10%
films.

00:18:06.454 --> 00:18:08.530 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And this came in
an era where television

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:11.080 align:middle line:10%
wasn't predominant at all.

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And all we had really was
a radio and the movies.

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And they probably figured how
better way to reach people.

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:21.350 align:middle line:84%
We don't have social networking,
we can only have Facebook,

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:24.070 align:middle line:84%
we don't have Twitters,
and text messaging.

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:25.930 align:middle line:84%
How do we reach
all these people,

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:29.170 align:middle line:84%
get our message across,
and get them to understand,

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:30.689 align:middle line:90%
believe us, and follow us?

00:18:30.689 --> 00:18:31.730 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they did.

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:34.120 align:middle line:84%
The Nazis were
excellent at this.

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:36.550 align:middle line:10%
Even at Hitler's
speeches, they would have

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:38.950 align:middle line:10%
the logo of the swastika there.

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:42.160 align:middle line:10%
I mean, they just had everything
down to a science, didn't they?

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.740 align:middle line:10%
>>WEIDNER: Well, I don't
think anybody's ever

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:48.790 align:middle line:10%
been able to achieve this
kind of political performance

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:51.460 align:middle line:10%
like fascism.

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:53.500 align:middle line:10%
Communism can't
compete with them.

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:58.030 align:middle line:10%
The symbols, the banners,
the music, the lighting,

00:18:58.030 --> 00:18:59.149 align:middle line:10%
and everything.

00:18:59.149 --> 00:19:00.190 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They had it all.

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:03.820 align:middle line:10%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, it appeals
to a very basic nature

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:05.070 align:middle line:10%
of human beings.

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:06.790 align:middle line:10%
And you know, Hitler knew that.

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And you know soil
and soul, he would

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:14.080 align:middle line:84%
call it, the blood in the
ground, and your soul together.

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.150 align:middle line:90%
This is a very fascist idea.

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:18.700 align:middle line:84%
And a very dangerous
idea in some ways too.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And Hitler had it
down like no one.

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:23.080 align:middle line:84%
And then, I really do
believe that was Leni

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:25.080 align:middle line:90%
Riefenstahl behind all of it.

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.140 align:middle line:84%
He was designing--
he was drawing.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:27.940 align:middle line:90%
He was an artist.

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And he was designing
these rallies

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:31.840 align:middle line:90%
when he was a poor little guy.

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:32.770 align:middle line:90%
We found the drawings.

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:34.727 align:middle line:84%
And he designed the
Nuremberg rally.

00:19:34.727 --> 00:19:36.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was way
ahead of his time.

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:37.030 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Way
ahead of his time.

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:38.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Way ahead of his time.

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:41.830 align:middle line:84%
When Chris Carter put
together "X-Files",

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:45.220 align:middle line:84%
how did he get into
those files, Jay?

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:48.130 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: My understanding is that
there actually was a connection

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:49.630 align:middle line:10%
between the CIA
and the "X-Files.

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:51.850 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, there are
interviews with Dean Haglund

00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:54.140 align:middle line:10%
from the "X-Files," where
he says that we had the CIA

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:54.940 align:middle line:10%
on set.

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:57.481 align:middle line:10%
They were actually telling us
what we could and couldn't say.

00:19:57.481 --> 00:19:59.440 align:middle line:10%
So I think that Chris
Carter had to have

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.830 align:middle line:10%
some connection, somebody who
was leaking information to him.

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:04.960 align:middle line:90%
Because so many of those plots--

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:06.251 align:middle line:90%
and I love the show.

00:20:06.251 --> 00:20:08.500 align:middle line:84%
I've seen it probably three
times all the way through.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.833 align:middle line:84%
So many of those plots, so
many of those episodes, which

00:20:10.833 --> 00:20:13.540 align:middle line:84%
we actually cover, do deal
with real conspiracies,

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:15.230 align:middle line:90%
real deep state issues.

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:18.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They really did touch
on conspiracies in "X-Files."

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:32.590 align:middle line:10%
at the expense of human life
and the future of the planet.

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:37.370 align:middle line:10%
Driven not only by corporate
greed, but a darker objective.

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:39.460 align:middle line:10%
>> The take over of America.

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:42.500 align:middle line:10%
>> And then the world itself,

cruel, or efficient.

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:03.137 align:middle line:10%
and enslave American
citizens at home.

00:21:03.137 --> 00:21:05.470 align:middle line:10%
With tools like the Patriot
Act and the National Defense

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:08.740 align:middle line:10%
Authorization Act, which
abridge the Constitution

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:11.360 align:middle line:10%
in the name of
national security.

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:14.770 align:middle line:10%
The militarization of police

A government preparing to
use that data against you,

when it strikes, and the
final takeover begins.

>> By a well-oiled and
well-armed multi-national group

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:53.680 align:middle line:10%
of elites that will cull,

[PLAYBACK ENDS]

00:22:33.482 --> 00:22:35.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can't get
much stronger than that,

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:37.000 align:middle line:90%
in terms of giving messages.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.110 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: No, Chris Carter's
been doing amazing things

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:42.850 align:middle line:10%
for his whole career.

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:45.580 align:middle line:10%
He had a show called
"The Lone Gunman," which

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:50.320 align:middle line:10%
came out in April of
2001, in which the opening

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:55.820 align:middle line:10%
episode, a plane gets taken
over by remote control

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:58.120 align:middle line:10%
and is going to fly into
the World Trade Center,

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.160 align:middle line:10%
until the lone gunmen
successfully cracked

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:02.680 align:middle line:10%
the code in the software
and avert the plane,

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:04.270 align:middle line:10%
but at the last minute.

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:07.380 align:middle line:10%
I mean that was an amazing
bit of predictive programming.

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:08.740 align:middle line:90%
And he's done that before.

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:13.390 align:middle line:84%
He predicted bird flu in his
other show, "Millennium,"

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:17.440 align:middle line:84%
and "X-Files" is just filled
with predictive programming.

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.590 align:middle line:84%
I guarantee you that he
was getting fed information

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:21.410 align:middle line:90%
by somebody.

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:22.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:23.980 align:middle line:90%
You just don't create this.

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:30.430 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: No, it was definitely
controlled in a way that--

00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:34.480 align:middle line:84%
several times in the "X-Files,"
he does what we just saw,

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.400 align:middle line:90%
where there's a sudden--

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.290 align:middle line:84%
almost like a documentary for
like five or 10 minutes, where

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:41.290 align:middle line:84%
somebody's releasing
all this information,

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:44.656 align:middle line:84%
and Carter's making all these
cuts and showing you reality.

00:23:44.656 --> 00:23:46.780 align:middle line:84%
And those are the prime
moments when you really got

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:47.988 align:middle line:90%
to perk up and pay attention.

00:23:47.988 --> 00:23:50.920 align:middle line:84%
Because somebody has
told Carter to release

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.600 align:middle line:84%
this amount of
information in this way.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think what we just
saw is one of those moments.

00:23:56.430 --> 00:24:00.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would Chris Carter
deny what you've just said?

00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:01.779 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: I think--
what do you think?

00:24:01.779 --> 00:24:02.820 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: I don't think so.

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:05.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or would he say, hey,
yeah, I do get fed information.

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:06.680 align:middle line:90%
They do tell me about this.

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.714 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: I think
he's proud of it.

00:24:08.714 --> 00:24:10.380 align:middle line:84%
I don't think he's
hiding it in any way.

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:13.097 align:middle line:90%
It's so obvious that, you know--

00:24:13.097 --> 00:24:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: I mean, if you look at
the later seasons of "X-Files,"

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:18.050 align:middle line:84%
there's actually episodes
that David Duchovny wrote

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:21.170 align:middle line:84%
and produced, like "Hollywood
AD," and "Hollywood AD,"

00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:22.970 align:middle line:90%
is almost literally what we do.

00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:24.830 align:middle line:84%
The plot of that
episode was that there's

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:27.560 align:middle line:84%
a giant secret society
network that kind of

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:30.170 align:middle line:84%
runs Hollywood and is
promoting gnosticism,

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:31.700 align:middle line:90%
promoting secret society ideas.

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:35.840 align:middle line:84%
So I think if you've got even
actors stepping in and doing

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:39.230 align:middle line:84%
the production and writing
roles about what we do,

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:41.300 align:middle line:90%
then that has to be well-known.

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:42.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where does
it go from here?

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:45.447 align:middle line:90%
What's next in this area?

00:24:45.447 --> 00:24:47.280 align:middle line:10%
>>WEIDNER: Well, I
think, as I said earlier,

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:50.580 align:middle line:10%
I think filmmakers who
may not have wanted

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:55.627 align:middle line:10%
to waste their time trying
to say deeper things,

00:24:55.627 --> 00:24:57.960 align:middle line:10%
they just wanted to do an
action film, or a horror film,

00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:00.420 align:middle line:10%
or whatever, are rethinking
what they're doing now,

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:02.700 align:middle line:10%
and they're realizing that
in order for their films

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:05.310 align:middle line:10%
to stand the test
of time, that they

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:08.700 align:middle line:10%
have to start adding things that
make the film more interesting.

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:10.320 align:middle line:90%
And so they're doing that.

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's happening
a lot nowadays.

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And to the point
now where there's

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.790 align:middle line:84%
almost so many films that
have to be deciphered,

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:19.640 align:middle line:84%
that there is enough
time for guys like Jay

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.360 align:middle line:90%
and I to even do it anymore.

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.160 align:middle line:90%
Which is good.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:22.960 align:middle line:90%
It's a good thing.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:24.960 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I
think the films are

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:27.450 align:middle line:84%
getting more interesting,
especially some of the TV

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:28.950 align:middle line:90%
series that are up on Netflix.

00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:31.290 align:middle line:84%
They're actually getting
very interesting subjects

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:33.270 align:middle line:90%
and esoteric ideas.

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And definitely, we
see the mainstream

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:39.742 align:middle line:84%
moving towards this, which
is a really good thing.

00:25:39.742 --> 00:25:41.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
shows like "Breaking Bad"

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:44.790 align:middle line:84%
had a message that might
have been leaked into it?

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:47.130 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: Absolutely, Vince
Gilligan was also involved

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:48.300 align:middle line:10%
in "X-Files."

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:51.420 align:middle line:10%
And so I think if you look at
someone like Catherine Austin

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:53.700 align:middle line:10%
Fitts, who I've done a
lot of interviews with,

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:56.690 align:middle line:10%
she will explain the realities
behind "Breaking Bad,"

00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:58.980 align:middle line:10%
that there are actually
covert networks that

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:01.320 align:middle line:10%
will run drugs in the
very same fashion,

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:03.300 align:middle line:10%
through all kinds of
fronts and shells,

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.004 align:middle line:10%
just like you see
in "Breaking Bad."

00:26:05.004 --> 00:26:07.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you talk about
predictive programming,

00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:09.060 align:middle line:90%
exactly what is that?

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:13.380 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: That
is an intel agency

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:19.530 align:middle line:84%
who wants to soften up
the audience for an idea.

00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:22.680 align:middle line:10%
So we have, like
in "The Matrix,"

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:31.950 align:middle line:10%
Neo's passport says that it was
issued on September 11th, 2001.

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:33.827 align:middle line:84%
And the film came out
two years earlier.

00:26:33.827 --> 00:26:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's
what they're trying to do,

00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:39.537 align:middle line:84%
is set you up, so that
when the event occurs,

00:26:39.537 --> 00:26:40.620 align:middle line:90%
you're kind of OK with it.

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:43.530 align:middle line:84%
This is what Carter was
doing with "The Lone Gunman."

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:45.107 align:middle line:90%
He is softening up the audience.

00:26:45.107 --> 00:26:46.440 align:middle line:90%
They knew this thing was coming.

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.030 align:middle line:90%
Let's make this show.

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:49.270 align:middle line:90%
Let's show that it happened.

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:50.150 align:middle line:84%
Then when it happens,
it's not going

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:52.800 align:middle line:84%
to be such a big shock to the
people watching, because they

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.429 align:middle line:90%
saw it already on TV.

00:26:54.429 --> 00:26:56.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: I think this
is really an idea that

00:26:56.220 --> 00:27:00.570 align:middle line:84%
comes out of early 20th century
British espionage fiction.

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:03.070 align:middle line:10%
So you have a lot of writers
like Graham Greene, who

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:05.460 align:middle line:10%
will write books like,
"Our Man in Havana,"

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:07.945 align:middle line:10%
and these books will
predict events like--

00:27:07.945 --> 00:27:08.820 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Ian Fleming?

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:09.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.837 align:middle line:84%
They'll predict events
like false flag attacks,

00:27:11.837 --> 00:27:13.920 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, that will
happen a year or two later.

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.450 align:middle line:10%
In fact, you mentioned
Ian Fleming--

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:18.000 align:middle line:10%
his brother, Peter
Fleming, also wrote a novel

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.220 align:middle line:10%
about a flight of a Nazi
leader to Scotland a year

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:25.674 align:middle line:10%
or two before Rudolf
Hess' famous flight.

00:27:25.674 --> 00:27:27.090 align:middle line:84%
So I think that
what you're seeing

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:29.500 align:middle line:84%
is this kind of, as he
mentioned, softening up.

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:33.000 align:middle line:84%
And almost a kind of magic
ritual, voodoo ritual,

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.480 align:middle line:84%
where it's like, oh,
they know what's coming.

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And so you're kind of
deceived into thinking

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.110 align:middle line:84%
that the establishment
has God powers.

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:42.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I didn't
know about the passport date

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:44.010 align:middle line:90%
from "The Matrix."

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:44.860 align:middle line:90%
That's unbelievable.

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:45.660 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: It is.

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:46.460 align:middle line:90%
And there's others.

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:48.510 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
references actually

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:52.920 align:middle line:84%
to the 9/11 events going on
in the entertainment industry.

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:56.260 align:middle line:90%
And it bears further scrutiny.

00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:57.060 align:middle line:90%
Because I'm--

00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:58.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It sure does.

00:27:58.690 --> 00:28:00.270 align:middle line:10%
>>WEIDNER: But
again, we also know

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:04.410 align:middle line:10%
that, as Cliff High has
talked about frequently,

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:09.920 align:middle line:10%
that people have the ability
to understand future events.

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And he does his
programs, which show

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:16.890 align:middle line:84%
that people are talking on the
internet about an event that

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:18.180 align:middle line:90%
hasn't occurred yet.

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:19.560 align:middle line:90%
And then it will occur.

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's
also what's going on here.

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:24.380 align:middle line:90%
People are naturally psychic.

00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:25.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They are
naturally psychic.

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:27.290 align:middle line:90%
They have this connection.

00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:29.900 align:middle line:84%
But I don't believe
in coincidences.

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:34.610 align:middle line:84%
There's just no way somebody
would have injected 9/11

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:38.450 align:middle line:84%
in a passport in a movie,
or come up with an idea

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:42.700 align:middle line:84%
that planes are going
to target buildings.

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:44.800 align:middle line:90%
You don't guess that.

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:47.200 align:middle line:84%
Somebody's telling
somebody something.

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:49.900 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, and
so close to the event.

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:51.670 align:middle line:84%
They both happened
before the event,

00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:52.930 align:middle line:90%
but they're pretty close.

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:56.150 align:middle line:84%
Two years is pretty
close to the event time.

00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And so it was definitely
done on purpose.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:03.130 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I think during the
Oklahoma federal building

00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:07.930 align:middle line:10%
bombing that there was
a story or a book that

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:11.410 align:middle line:10%
had come out prior to
that, wasn't there, Jay?

00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: It's "The Final
Jihad" by Keating,

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:14.650 align:middle line:90%
who was the governor's brother.

00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:15.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:16.749 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And he
mentions Tim McVeigh.

00:29:16.749 --> 00:29:18.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It came out
years before, years

00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:20.710 align:middle line:84%
before the actual
event happened.

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:23.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Tim McVeigh,
instead of--

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:27.130 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Also, five years
before the Titanic sunk,

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:31.450 align:middle line:84%
there was a novel called "The
Titan," about a super ship

00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:34.244 align:middle line:84%
called The Titan, which
sinks by hitting an iceberg

00:29:34.244 --> 00:29:35.410 align:middle line:90%
and kills everyone on board.

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:37.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Go figure, go figure.

00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:39.441 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: I think there's two
things that work with that.

00:29:39.441 --> 00:29:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think sometimes it's
intelligence agencies telling,

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:43.186 align:middle line:90%
feeding information.

00:29:43.186 --> 00:29:44.560 align:middle line:84%
I also think that
at times people

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:47.800 align:middle line:84%
have a kind of artistic
inspiration or sense

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:48.740 align:middle line:90%
of what's coming.

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:51.130 align:middle line:10%
So an example of that
would be, there's

00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:54.040 align:middle line:10%
a famous Dostoyevsky novel
from the late 1800s, called

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:54.970 align:middle line:10%
"Demons."

00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And in that novel, he predicts
a socialist revolution

00:29:58.150 --> 00:30:03.040 align:middle line:84%
that will come on top of
millions of skulls for Russia.

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:05.890 align:middle line:90%
That's 20, 30 years before 1917.

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:07.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which happened.

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:10.300 align:middle line:84%
When you talked about
"The Matrix" again,

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:14.380 align:middle line:84%
there's a genius behind
these movies, isn't there?

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:16.424 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: It's
questionable, you know,

00:30:16.424 --> 00:30:18.340 align:middle line:84%
who's really writing
these at a certain point.

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:20.620 align:middle line:84%
Yes, the Wachowskis
did write it,

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:23.500 align:middle line:84%
but you have to
really wonder who's

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:25.720 align:middle line:84%
lurking really in
the shadows, making

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.250 align:middle line:90%
sure these things are done.

00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think that there is,
as Jay has pointed out,

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:32.020 align:middle line:84%
an intel agency that's
at the heart of this.

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have a little
clip of that "Matrix" passport

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:35.430 align:middle line:90%
scene.

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:36.710 align:middle line:90%
Let's-- this fascinates me.

00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:38.036 align:middle line:90%
Let's have a look at it.

00:30:38.036 --> 00:30:38.836 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:30:38.836 --> 00:30:42.190 align:middle line:10%
>> You have a Social Security
number, you pay your taxes,

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:47.650 align:middle line:10%
and you help your landlady
carry out her garbage.

00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:51.250 align:middle line:90%


00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:54.560 align:middle line:10%
The other life is
lived in computers,

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:57.970 align:middle line:10%
where you go by the
hacker alias Neo

00:30:57.970 --> 00:31:00.790 align:middle line:10%
and are guilty of
virtually every computer

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:01.970 align:middle line:10%
crime we have a law for.

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:02.770 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:03.894 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah it's uncanny.

00:31:03.894 --> 00:31:05.570 align:middle line:84%
You could actually
see the date there.

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:09.140 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, again
though, unless you had a DV--

00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:10.660 align:middle line:90%
we didn't even have DVDs then--

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:11.824 align:middle line:90%
if you had a videotape--

00:31:11.824 --> 00:31:13.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: --you wouldn't
have caught that.

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:15.115 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: You wouldn't
have caught it.

00:31:15.115 --> 00:31:19.600 align:middle line:84%
And so, again, when videotape
became ever present,

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.500 align:middle line:84%
then they could
freeze frame stuff.

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:23.470 align:middle line:84%
And so it came
easier for filmmakers

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:25.189 align:middle line:84%
to add more things
in because people

00:31:25.189 --> 00:31:26.480 align:middle line:90%
are at home freeze framing it--

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:26.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:28.480 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: --and
looking for things.

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: A lot of people would
be skeptical of the idea

00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:33.580 align:middle line:84%
that you could have
something that detailed

00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:35.040 align:middle line:90%
on purpose and intentional.

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:37.360 align:middle line:84%
But if you watch a lot of
director's commentaries,

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:39.880 align:middle line:84%
or even Roger Ebert's
DVD commentaries,

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:44.770 align:middle line:84%
they will discuss intricacies
and details ad nauseum.

00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:46.240 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it is that intricate.

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Especially directors like
Christopher Nolan or Kubrick,

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.702 align:middle line:84%
they're very attentive
to the details.

00:31:50.702 --> 00:31:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And so these kinds of
things aren't accidental.

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:54.280 align:middle line:90%
They're not coincidence.

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:55.880 align:middle line:90%
They're usually on purpose.

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:59.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think something that's
so significant, like that date,

00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:01.760 align:middle line:84%
and this is 1998, you know
three years ahead of time.

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:03.404 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that's
a coincidence.

00:32:03.404 --> 00:32:05.320 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I mean when
Oliver Stone put together

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:11.020 align:middle line:10%
his "JFK" film, of course,
which truly dug into the Warren

00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:14.890 align:middle line:10%
Commission, and tore
it apart, and really

00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:17.890 align:middle line:10%
backed up the things that
Jim Garrison, the New Orleans

00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:20.890 align:middle line:10%
prosecutor, was
trying to unravel.

00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:22.990 align:middle line:84%
How does he know that
stuff as a director?

00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:25.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how does a director
pick up stuff like that?

00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:29.470 align:middle line:84%
Somebody's coming to
him on the outside.

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:31.630 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: I think
in that case, he

00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:34.300 align:middle line:84%
became fascinated
by the whole thing,

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:37.090 align:middle line:84%
after watching "The Men
who Killed Kennedy," which

00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:38.590 align:middle line:84%
was a great
documentary series that

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:42.040 align:middle line:84%
came out about four years
earlier, five years earlier.

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And he apparently became
obsessed, from what I hear.

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:47.800 align:middle line:90%
And he was into every detail.

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:50.270 align:middle line:10%
Jim Marrs, he based the
book, off of "Crossfire."

00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:51.460 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: God rest his soul.

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:52.900 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: May he rest in peace.

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And I've talked to Jim
quite a bit about it,

00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:59.110 align:middle line:84%
and Jim said that Oliver
would be on the phone all day

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:04.120 align:middle line:84%
with him, discussing little
tiny details, like was JFK

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:06.120 align:middle line:90%
wearing a toupee, did he have--

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:09.830 align:middle line:84%
where was his tie,
why was Jackie's--

00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:12.810 align:middle line:84%
did Jackie get hit by
any blood, and all this.

00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:15.260 align:middle line:90%
And super details.

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:16.760 align:middle line:90%
And you can see it in the film.

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:17.890 align:middle line:90%
It's a great film.

00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:19.450 align:middle line:84%
It is the best film that
Oliver Stone ever made.

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:20.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think so too.

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:22.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: I think it's one
of the best films ever made.

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:24.760 align:middle line:84%
I think the acting, the
lighting, the cinematography,

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:26.962 align:middle line:84%
everything was just
top rate in that film.

00:33:26.962 --> 00:33:28.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: You mentioned
Jim Garrison.

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:30.211 align:middle line:84%
He's actually been in
a few movies as well.

00:33:30.211 --> 00:33:32.128 align:middle line:84%
He shows up in the '80s
movie, "The Big Easy."

00:33:32.128 --> 00:33:32.927 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:33:32.927 --> 00:33:34.270 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Which is an interesting.

00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:36.090 align:middle line:90%
There's another tie-in between--

00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:37.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And see,
and there was a time

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:39.730 align:middle line:84%
where the government
tried to portray

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:41.500 align:middle line:90%
Jim Garrison as a lunatic.

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:42.850 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:33:42.850 --> 00:33:44.310 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Even Johnny Carson.

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:45.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:46.360 align:middle line:90%
They put him down.

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:48.750 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Somebody had to
tell Johnny Carson this too,

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:50.740 align:middle line:84%
you've got to make
him look like a fool.

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:54.790 align:middle line:84%
So does it go all the
way to talk show hosts?

00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:56.362 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is, probably.

00:33:56.362 --> 00:33:57.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've got
to tell you, Jay,

00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:01.900 align:middle line:84%
that I have never been
approached by the government

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:04.240 align:middle line:90%
to do this or to do that.

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:07.390 align:middle line:84%
They just have stayed away
from me for some reason.

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:10.900 align:middle line:84%
With our vast audience, I've
always wondered about that.

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:14.299 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're afraid that I'll
say they tried to approach me.

00:34:14.299 --> 00:34:16.590 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Well, I have to
say, I've never been either.

00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:19.030 align:middle line:84%
I've never had any government
agency ever try to influence

00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:21.159 align:middle line:84%
what I'm doing on
"Gaia" or anything.

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:23.159 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's
certain people

00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:24.409 align:middle line:90%
that they just stay away from.

00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:25.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They stay away from.

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:27.691 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: They've already done
an analysis of the personnel,

00:34:27.691 --> 00:34:29.464 align:middle line:84%
and know they'll blow
the beans in public.

00:34:29.464 --> 00:34:30.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:31.590 align:middle line:84%
That guy's not
going to play ball.

00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:32.620 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: They're not
going to play ball,

00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:33.850 align:middle line:90%
so there's no point in--

00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:37.159 align:middle line:84%
let him just be suspicious,
but never ever confirm.

00:34:37.159 --> 00:34:39.040 align:middle line:84%
Because don't forget,
if they do come to you

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:42.850 align:middle line:84%
and tell you what to do, it
confirms your worst suspicions.

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:46.000 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, you're going to be
going to guns, because you now

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.020 align:middle line:84%
know that this is
exactly what's going on.

00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:51.309 align:middle line:84%
Where now you're not 100% sure
if they're telling people what

00:34:51.309 --> 00:34:53.350 align:middle line:84%
to do, because they've
never told you what to do,

00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:54.370 align:middle line:90%
and I'm in the same boat.

00:34:54.370 --> 00:34:56.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah if they're
that concerned about it,

00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:57.394 align:middle line:84%
and they come to
me, then there's

00:34:57.394 --> 00:34:59.511 align:middle line:84%
got to be some fire
behind that smoke.

00:34:59.511 --> 00:35:01.510 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Absolutely,
and they don't want that.

00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:02.890 align:middle line:84%
That's the last thing
they want is a guy who's

00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:05.050 align:middle line:84%
got millions of people
listening to him on radio

00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:07.050 align:middle line:84%
suddenly start talking
about this gentleman that

00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:09.000 align:middle line:84%
approached him yesterday
at the coffee shop.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:09.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:12.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Well, conspiracy
theory is the pejorative that

00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:14.050 align:middle line:90%
comes out of the JFK period.

00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:17.260 align:middle line:84%
The CIA actually created that
term as a weaponized term

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:20.350 align:middle line:84%
for anybody that questioned
the report, oh, that's

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:21.430 align:middle line:90%
a conspiracy theorist.

00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:22.471 align:middle line:90%
And that actually worked.

00:35:22.471 --> 00:35:24.550 align:middle line:84%
But I think nowadays,
it's kind of backfired.

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And to be a conspiracy
theorist is actually

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:27.530 align:middle line:90%
to be a reality theorist.

00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:29.499 align:middle line:84%
It's not really a
pejorative anymore.

00:35:29.499 --> 00:35:31.915 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think that
governments, with your program,

00:35:31.915 --> 00:35:34.900 align:middle line:84%
"Hollywood Decoded,"
will continue

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:38.830 align:middle line:84%
to try to leak information into
films, and television shows,

00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:41.630 align:middle line:84%
and even fake news
with social networking?

00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:43.570 align:middle line:84%
I think we have to add
that to the mix now.

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:45.361 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: We do, that's
a very good point.

00:35:45.361 --> 00:35:47.680 align:middle line:84%
Because once you realize
that the movies are

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:51.430 align:middle line:84%
being turned into propaganda
and being weaponized,

00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:53.760 align:middle line:84%
then you have to say to
yourself, OK, is it novels?

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:54.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:55.400 align:middle line:90%
OK, is it TV shows?

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:56.320 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.310 align:middle line:90%
Is it new shows?

00:35:57.310 --> 00:35:58.180 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:01.570 align:middle line:84%
Then you start getting into
the fake news and examining it,

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:04.300 align:middle line:84%
and you realize that almost
everything you're seeing

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:05.980 align:middle line:90%
is a contrived incident.

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:07.844 align:middle line:84%
And they're learning
that from movies.

00:36:07.844 --> 00:36:09.760 align:middle line:84%
They're taking Hollywood
production techniques

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:13.300 align:middle line:84%
and applying them to news
now, to where they're

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:17.980 align:middle line:84%
literally having fake actors,
and everything's fake,

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:21.520 align:middle line:84%
and the lighting is great,
and the acting is great,

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:24.960 align:middle line:84%
and the production
values are first class.

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:26.482 align:middle line:10%
And that's troubling.

00:36:26.482 --> 00:36:27.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: You mentioned
"The Matrix,"

00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:32.860 align:middle line:84%
there's a scene that we watched
when Neo first pulls a book off

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:35.770 align:middle line:84%
of his shelf and it's a famous
philosophy book, actually.

00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:40.360 align:middle line:10%
It's called-- it's "Simulacra
and Simulation," by Jean

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:42.580 align:middle line:10%
Baudrillard, who was a famous
French philosopher, who

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:45.910 align:middle line:10%
wrote that where we're
going with this tech

00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:49.390 align:middle line:10%
synthetic society is a world
in which the synthetic will

00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:50.970 align:middle line:10%
overlay the real.

00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And so I think it's amazing
to me that they stuck that in.

00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:57.604 align:middle line:84%
He's pulling out this book that
deals with that topic, Neo is.

00:36:57.604 --> 00:36:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're dealing
with, with mass media,

00:36:59.770 --> 00:37:01.460 align:middle line:90%
is this synthetic overlay--

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:03.460 align:middle line:84%
it's not the real world
that's really out there,

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:07.300 align:middle line:84%
but it's the one that the media
kind of gives us as the glasses

00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:09.060 align:middle line:84%
that we're supposed
to interpret reality.

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:11.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's that's fake
media perception.

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:12.300 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:14.320 align:middle line:84%
Wasn't it Bill Casey,
the CIA director,

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:17.650 align:middle line:84%
he said that when
everybody out there--

00:37:17.650 --> 00:37:20.590 align:middle line:84%
when absolutely everything
they believe is BS,

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:21.964 align:middle line:90%
we know we've succeeded.

00:37:21.964 --> 00:37:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
we are right now.

00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:26.269 align:middle line:84%
Everything, nobody has any
footing in reality anymore.

00:37:26.269 --> 00:37:27.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They don't know.

00:37:27.310 --> 00:37:28.487 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: They are confused.

00:37:28.487 --> 00:37:29.320 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: They are.

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:31.690 align:middle line:84%
Hollywood is largely
responsible for that.

00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:32.740 align:middle line:90%
I hate to say it.

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:34.610 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: James Cameron,
great director.

00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:36.280 align:middle line:10%
Is he told stuff too?

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:37.530 align:middle line:10%
>>WEIDNER: Yes.

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:40.680 align:middle line:10%
There's no way that a
former truck driver could

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:44.070 align:middle line:10%
know what he knows and put
it into "The Terminator,"

00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:48.780 align:middle line:10%
not at that time,
not in 1983, '84.

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:52.290 align:middle line:84%
DARPA was working on
all of those things,

00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:55.380 align:middle line:84%
but it was super top
secret at the time.

00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:59.625 align:middle line:84%
I heard about it from insiders,
from NASA insiders that they

00:37:59.625 --> 00:38:01.140 align:middle line:84%
were working on
these robots that

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:03.270 align:middle line:84%
were going to be able
to think independently,

00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:05.500 align:middle line:84%
and they would be used
for law enforcement.

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:08.800 align:middle line:84%
But that was long before
anybody knew about it.

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, Cameron knew
about it, and got it right.

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:12.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:16.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Even the internet plays
a big role in "The Terminator."

00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:18.660 align:middle line:84%
Nobody in the '80s knew
about the internet,

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:21.229 align:middle line:84%
unless they worked
in some agency.

00:38:21.229 --> 00:38:23.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right, and
who would predict that?

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:26.340 align:middle line:84%
Because if you knew,
heck, I'd be buying stock

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:28.110 align:middle line:90%
at all these emerging companies.

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:29.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Well, what's
funny is that there

00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:33.060 align:middle line:84%
are all of these '80s
movies and TV shows that

00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:35.790 align:middle line:84%
have the internet, and even
older science fiction stories,

00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:37.320 align:middle line:90%
from Isaac Asimov.

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:39.047 align:middle line:84%
But if you think about
"The Running Man,"

00:38:39.047 --> 00:38:41.130 align:middle line:84%
there's a famous scene
where in "The Running Man,"

00:38:41.130 --> 00:38:44.250 align:middle line:84%
Arnold Schwarzenegger comes in,
and he orders a plane ticket

00:38:44.250 --> 00:38:46.830 align:middle line:90%
on the info net in the film.

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:09.390 align:middle line:10%
I'm talking about something
real, something measurable

00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:10.840 align:middle line:10%
in the biology of the forest.

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:13.260 align:middle line:10%
>> Which is what exactly?

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:15.780 align:middle line:10%
>> What we think we know
is that there's some kind

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:20.280 align:middle line:10%
of electrochemical communication
between the roots of the trees,

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:22.550 align:middle line:10%
like the synapses
between neurons.

00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:26.070 align:middle line:10%
And each tree has ten to
the fourth connections

00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:27.300 align:middle line:10%
to the trees around it.

00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:31.350 align:middle line:10%
And there are 10 to the
12th trees on Pandora.

00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:33.810 align:middle line:10%
>> Which is a lot, I'm guessing.

00:39:33.810 --> 00:39:38.430 align:middle line:10%
>> It's more connections
than the human brain, get it?

00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:39.870 align:middle line:10%
It's a network.

00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:41.300 align:middle line:10%
It's a global network.

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:42.960 align:middle line:10%
And the Na'vi can access it.

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:47.340 align:middle line:10%
They can upload and download
data, memories, at sites

00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:49.377 align:middle line:10%
like the one you just destroyed.

00:39:49.377 --> 00:39:50.808 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:39:50.808 --> 00:39:52.085 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:39:52.085 --> 00:39:52.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great movie.

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:53.620 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, great movie.

00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:55.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of
symbolism behind it.

00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:59.470 align:middle line:84%
Did Cameron have some kind
of glimpse into the future?

00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:02.170 align:middle line:10%
>>WEIDNER: Well, yeah,
I think, what my thesis

00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:05.920 align:middle line:10%
is that he had made "Titanic,"
which was the greatest

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.780 align:middle line:10%
grossing film of all time.

00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:10.940 align:middle line:10%
And the hidden message
behind "Titanic" I think

00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:14.410 align:middle line:10%
is that we're witnessing
the end of our world.

00:40:14.410 --> 00:40:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And then he kind
of realized that he

00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:21.920 align:middle line:84%
made kind of a bummer movie
with the end of the world--

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:22.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A downer.

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:24.260 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: A downer.

00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:26.680 align:middle line:84%
So he decided to come
back with his answer

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:29.830 align:middle line:84%
to what the end of
that world would be,

00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:31.679 align:middle line:84%
and what we could do
to make a newer world.

00:40:31.679 --> 00:40:33.220 align:middle line:10%
And I think that's
what he was trying

00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:35.320 align:middle line:10%
to show in "Avatar,"
that going back

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:40.197 align:middle line:10%
to a more natural existence,
more of a tribal existence,

00:40:40.197 --> 00:40:42.280 align:middle line:10%
is probably going to be a
better way for us to go.

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
in the future, we

00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:47.620 align:middle line:84%
are going to go back into a more
rural, bringing our machines

00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:48.580 align:middle line:90%
and our toys with us.

00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:50.680 align:middle line:84%
I think that's
what the answer is.

00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:53.482 align:middle line:84%
That we're probably going
to de-urbanize the world.

00:40:53.482 --> 00:40:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And there's really no point
for people to be piled up

00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:57.114 align:middle line:90%
on top of each other anymore.

00:40:57.114 --> 00:40:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
probably where we're going.

00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:00.446 align:middle line:84%
So I think Cameron,
in the end, is

00:41:00.446 --> 00:41:01.960 align:middle line:84%
going to be right
I like that last--

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:03.400 align:middle line:90%
that scene in particular.

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:08.380 align:middle line:84%
Because as a person who tries
to talk about spiritual matters,

00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:11.740 align:middle line:84%
and to watch Giovanni
Ribisi's eyes rolling.

00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:13.070 align:middle line:90%
I get that a lot.

00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:15.370 align:middle line:84%
So I really like that scene,
because I'm constantly up

00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:18.760 align:middle line:84%
against people like him,
who cannot comprehend what

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:20.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm saying.

00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:22.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've seen you
roll your eyes sometimes.

00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:24.130 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: I do roll my
eyes at people like him.

00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:27.760 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of my favorite
scenes in the movie.

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:31.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As you look at these
films that are emerging today,

00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:34.690 align:middle line:84%
are you seeing something
that we should know about,

00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:38.980 align:middle line:84%
that could occur two, three,
four, or five years from now?

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:43.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Yes, so many examples
from the past show this.

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:46.060 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at
Spielberg films, like "AI,"

00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:47.560 align:middle line:84%
you know, we're
seeing, for example,

00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:50.410 align:middle line:84%
sex bots, that are replacing
real relationships.

00:41:50.410 --> 00:41:53.910 align:middle line:84%
That was a big theme in that
movie back in 2000, 2001.

00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:56.260 align:middle line:84%
15 years, 20 years
later, we're seeing it.

00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:58.930 align:middle line:84%
So I think that nowadays what
we can look at in the films

00:41:58.930 --> 00:42:02.080 align:middle line:84%
is what we can expect
15, 20 years from now.

00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:05.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you see another
9/11 in the movies, for example?

00:42:05.770 --> 00:42:07.020 align:middle line:90%
Do you see anything like that?

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:08.561 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Well, I
think that they're

00:42:08.561 --> 00:42:10.600 align:middle line:84%
getting worried about
pulling off events,

00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:14.860 align:middle line:84%
because we're getting so
hip to what they're doing,

00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:18.220 align:middle line:84%
that when they pull
a fake event now,

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:22.120 align:middle line:84%
they have 50,000 independent
investigators on the internet

00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:23.360 align:middle line:90%
tearing apart the event.

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:23.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:24.670 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And they're
getting a little bit worried

00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:27.510 align:middle line:84%
about that, that we're getting
too hip to what they're doing.

00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:30.010 align:middle line:84%
So I've noticed the
events are slowing down.

00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:32.630 align:middle line:84%
They're not pulling those
many fake events anymore.

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:33.620 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:35.090 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's because of that.

00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:36.700 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting
is because, I

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:38.741 align:middle line:84%
think, because of what
Jay and I have been doing,

00:42:38.741 --> 00:42:41.180 align:middle line:84%
not as a direct result,
but as a side result,

00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:43.870 align:middle line:84%
is people are
going to movies now

00:42:43.870 --> 00:42:45.460 align:middle line:84%
that are coming out
now, and looking

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:48.190 align:middle line:84%
for predictive programming,
in the movies, which has never

00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:49.430 align:middle line:90%
happened before.

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:50.860 align:middle line:90%
So that's really interesting.

00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And what it looks like to me
is that they are planning on

00:42:56.050 --> 00:42:58.810 align:middle line:84%
like creating some kind of
dystopian future of some kind,

00:42:58.810 --> 00:43:02.230 align:middle line:84%
because that's what the themes
of all the modern films,

00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:06.370 align:middle line:84%
over and over again, is
this dystopian, confused,

00:43:06.370 --> 00:43:09.870 align:middle line:84%
chaotic future, which
does not make me feel real

00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:12.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Well, if we think about
the Lakowski's-- it makes me

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:15.070 align:middle line:84%
think of "V for Vandetta," which
is another film that I think

00:43:15.070 --> 00:43:17.950 align:middle line:84%
deals with a lot of the
themes that we're discussing,

00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:20.700 align:middle line:84%
predictive
programming, dystopia.

00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:25.080 align:middle line:10%
And in "V for Vendetta," you
have a big landmark, Big Ben,

00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:27.300 align:middle line:10%
that's essentially destroyed.

00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:30.000 align:middle line:84%
In a lot of other
natural disaster movies,

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.870 align:middle line:84%
they love to destroy
the Golden Gate Bridge.

00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:37.020 align:middle line:84%
So I think that if we were to
pick out certain landmarks--

00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:38.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That could
be the next one.

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:39.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: One one level--

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:41.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: God, let's hope not.

00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:42.440 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: But, yeah.

00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:45.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jay, lot of competition
out there with everything.

00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:47.580 align:middle line:84%
You've got television,
you've got the internet,

00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:49.500 align:middle line:90%
you've got Facebook.

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:51.180 align:middle line:84%
You've got all these
places coming up

00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:52.380 align:middle line:90%
with their own programming.

00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:54.142 align:middle line:90%
What's the future for films?

00:43:54.142 --> 00:43:55.850 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: That's a
really good question.

00:43:55.850 --> 00:43:57.610 align:middle line:90%
I think about that a lot.

00:43:57.610 --> 00:44:00.580 align:middle line:84%
I think that films
are losing some

00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:02.350 align:middle line:90%
of their sense of individuation.

00:44:02.350 --> 00:44:04.210 align:middle line:90%
I don't think there's really--

00:44:04.210 --> 00:44:07.450 align:middle line:84%
you can't really sense
a style from a director

00:44:07.450 --> 00:44:08.980 align:middle line:90%
as much as you used to.

00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:10.510 align:middle line:84%
Of course, people
like David Lynch,

00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:14.230 align:middle line:84%
you can see their style,
because it's so idiosyncratic.

00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:17.740 align:middle line:84%
But I think we're running
into kind of a sameness

00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:19.480 align:middle line:84%
now, in the way
that films are made,

00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:21.667 align:middle line:90%
and there's way too much CGI.

00:44:21.667 --> 00:44:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think that there's going
to be a rebellion against that.

00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to go down
to more base, good acting,

00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:30.410 align:middle line:84%
good writing kinds of films
are going to come back.

00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:32.259 align:middle line:84%
So it's really going
to be the creator.

00:44:32.259 --> 00:44:33.550 align:middle line:90%
It always has been the creator.

00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:35.480 align:middle line:90%
But Hollywood is losing control.

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:36.570 align:middle line:90%
And that's a good thing.

00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:39.460 align:middle line:84%
Control is now coming back to
the independent film makers,

00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:42.550 align:middle line:84%
and the equipment and
technology is so low budget,

00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:45.220 align:middle line:84%
that a person with
not much money

00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:47.140 align:middle line:84%
can actually make an
interesting film now.

00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:49.450 align:middle line:84%
So I think the future's
very bright for the artist.

00:44:49.450 --> 00:44:51.700 align:middle line:84%
There's never been a
better time to be a content

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:53.046 align:middle line:90%
creator than right now.

00:44:53.046 --> 00:44:54.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your show,
"Hollywood Decoded"

00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:55.930 align:middle line:90%
is pretty cutting edge.

00:44:55.930 --> 00:44:58.897 align:middle line:84%
What can we expect
from you in the future?

00:44:58.897 --> 00:44:59.980 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: More cutting edge.

00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:02.520 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we're going
to be taking apart

00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:04.530 align:middle line:84%
some of the biggest
films that are out there.

00:45:04.530 --> 00:45:05.904 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do
some Hitchcock.

00:45:05.904 --> 00:45:07.580 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do
more James Cameron.

00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:09.150 align:middle line:90%
We're going to do Ridley Scott.

00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:12.120 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do Christopher
Nolan films that run the gamut.

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:14.481 align:middle line:90%
We've got "Batman," we've got--

00:45:14.481 --> 00:45:15.730 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: We've got them all.

00:45:15.730 --> 00:45:16.730 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: We got them all.

00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:20.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I tell people not
everything's a conspiracy,

00:45:20.490 --> 00:45:23.790 align:middle line:84%
but you need to look at
everything as if it were.

00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: I tell
people that it's OK

00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:29.010 align:middle line:84%
if you want to call me
a conspiracy theorist,

00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:31.500 align:middle line:84%
but then I get to call you
a coincidence theorist.
