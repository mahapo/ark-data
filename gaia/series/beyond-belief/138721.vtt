>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:21.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.210 align:middle line:10%
I do not know where
our producers come up

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.750 align:middle line:10%
with these great shows
week after week after week,

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.220 align:middle line:10%
and we've got another
one for you today.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.270 align:middle line:84%
This time, we're talking with
occult researcher, Lon Milo

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.070 align:middle line:90%
Duquette.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, Lon is a very
special person

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.240 align:middle line:84%
because he has jumped into
the occult as a researcher

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.450 align:middle line:84%
and has unraveled
some amazing stories.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.070 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
talk with you today

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.290 align:middle line:84%
about one such person
named Aleister Crowley.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.720 align:middle line:90%
Lon, welcome to the program.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LON MILO DUQUETTE:
Thank you, George.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.273 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Hey, tell us a little
bit about this individual

00:00:56.273 --> 00:00:59.470 align:middle line:84%
we're going to talk about
today, Aleister Crowley.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.140 align:middle line:10%
>>DUQUETTE: OK,
Aleister Crowley has,

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.470 align:middle line:10%
more or less, dominated my
interest since the late '60s.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.290 align:middle line:84%
He was an English occultist,
who in his lifetime

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.320 align:middle line:84%
garnered an extremely
bad reputation as,

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.290 align:middle line:84%
among other things,
a black magician.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Conjuring up the
devil, all this stuff.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: Well, that's
what people like to think.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
what they thought.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: That's
what they thought.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.900 align:middle line:10%
And actually was probably
one of the most brilliant,

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.570 align:middle line:10%
esoterically spiritual
minds of the 20th century.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And during his lifetime,
he was vilified

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.710 align:middle line:84%
as a pretty dark character,
but those that understood him

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.470 align:middle line:84%
during his lifetime
really understood him

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.480 align:middle line:90%
to be a brilliant character.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.780 align:middle line:84%
And now his reputation
is undergoing a major--

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:03.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Scrutiny.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: Yes,
he's quite respected.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What time period
are we talking about for him?

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:14.670 align:middle line:10%
>>DUQUETTE: He was born in
1875 and he died in 1947.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.080 align:middle line:84%
He was, among other
things also involved

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.826 align:middle line:90%
in British intelligence.

00:02:20.826 --> 00:02:22.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, in what way?

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: He went to
Cambridge with the idea

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.607 align:middle line:90%
of becoming a diplomat.

00:02:25.607 --> 00:02:26.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A diplomat.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.030 align:middle line:90%
>>DUQUETTE: Right.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For the
British government.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: Right,
which more or less,

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.560 align:middle line:84%
was what people who were being
recruited for intelligence

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.620 align:middle line:84%
said that they would
be doing in Cambridge.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.060 align:middle line:10%
There's a recent book called
"Aleister Crowley Secret Agent

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.577 align:middle line:10%
666" by--

00:02:43.577 --> 00:02:45.660 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Great, the sign
of the beast, by the way.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.975 align:middle line:90%
>>DUQUETTE: Yes.

00:02:45.975 --> 00:02:47.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That number.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: It outlines his
intelligence activities prior

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.230 align:middle line:84%
to and during World
War I and World War II.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was this
a career for him?

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.170 align:middle line:90%
He was getting paid for this?

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: Well, it's like
an amateur gentleman's career.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.025 align:middle line:90%
Sort of the pre-James Bond era.

00:03:05.025 --> 00:03:05.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love this.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: That
would be Crowley.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.207 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And this was Cambridge.

00:03:10.207 --> 00:03:11.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: He went
to Cambridge, yes.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.390 align:middle line:10%
The newest book
outlines his activities

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.670 align:middle line:10%
in helping to get the
United States involved

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.450 align:middle line:10%
in World War I on
England's side,

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.010 align:middle line:10%
rather than on Germany's side.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.215 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like World
War II, almost.

00:03:28.215 --> 00:03:29.034 align:middle line:90%
Same kind of thing.

00:03:29.034 --> 00:03:31.200 align:middle line:84%
So when he went to Cambridge,
he must have picked up

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.470 align:middle line:90%
some added skills.

>>NARRATOR: In his last
year at Cambridge in 1898,

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.620 align:middle line:10%
Aleister Crowley wanted ultimate
achievement in three different

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.700 align:middle line:10%
aspects of his life--

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:49.020 align:middle line:10%
poetry, mountain climbing, and
the search for spiritual truth.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.010 align:middle line:84%
By coincidence, he was to form
three long lasting friendships

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.707 align:middle line:84%
that same year, which would
mirror those aspirations.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:03:56.732 --> 00:03:57.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You know, Lon.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.800 align:middle line:84%
I've always liked
that kind of accent.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.280 align:middle line:84%
I've always wanted to do a
show with a British accent

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.510 align:middle line:90%
for the entire program.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: It gives an
air of respectability

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.190 align:middle line:90%
to what is being said, for sure.

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At what point
in Crowley's career,

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.250 align:middle line:84%
because here he is this
British agent basically,

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.110 align:middle line:84%
does he start dabbling with
the occult and the dark side

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.910 align:middle line:90%
of life.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: Well, I think he
always considered himself,

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.560 align:middle line:90%
first and foremost, a poet.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A poet?

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: Yes, and
so even his involvement

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.860 align:middle line:84%
in the spiritual
practices of magic,

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.070 align:middle line:84%
the Hebrew Kabbalah, even
the Eastern practices,

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:41.580 align:middle line:84%
he saw as an expression of his
poetic yearning, if you will,

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.310 align:middle line:90%
toward enlightenment.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.970 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, he
looked at everything,

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.430 align:middle line:84%
including his
intelligence activities

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.740 align:middle line:84%
and his mountain climbing
as romantic expressions

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.470 align:middle line:90%
of his poetic nature.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was he
involved with anybody?

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.885 align:middle line:90%
Was he married?

00:05:00.885 --> 00:05:02.782 align:middle line:90%
Did he have kids?

00:05:02.782 --> 00:05:04.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: He was
married several times,

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.030 align:middle line:84%
and he had several
children over the years.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.880 align:middle line:84%
He was what we
would consider, what

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.760 align:middle line:84%
was considered in those
days sort of a libertine.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:16.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A-ha.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: And that gave
ammunition to his detractors

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:27.120 align:middle line:90%
that he led an immoral life.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did he have
many detractors?

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: He had
many, many detractors.

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.900 align:middle line:84%
And for one reason
or another, he

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.830 align:middle line:90%
cultivated negative publicity.

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:37.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.040 align:middle line:90%
He enjoyed it.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: He enjoyed
it, and that may have also

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:43.600 align:middle line:84%
been part of his
disinformation cover

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.050 align:middle line:90%
as an intelligence officer.

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.440 align:middle line:84%
He came to the United
States prior to World War I

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.100 align:middle line:84%
and convinced a German
propaganda newspaper

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.580 align:middle line:84%
in New York that he was
a German sympathizer.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.810 align:middle line:84%
He got not only a
column in that newspaper

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:06.520 align:middle line:84%
but became an editor, a
co-editor of the newspaper.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.910 align:middle line:84%
It was Crowley's
editorials advocating

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.470 align:middle line:84%
unrestricted submarine warfare
against civilian shipping

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:19.890 align:middle line:84%
that helped American
public opinion to come in

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:26.460 align:middle line:84%
to help England and not
come in and help Germany.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So he wasn't a
double agent, by any means.

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:31.440 align:middle line:84%
He was all
pro-British, wasn't he.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: He was
all pro-British

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:36.930 align:middle line:84%
but he allowed everyone to
think that he was pro-German.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That must have
been frustrating to do that.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: It was frustrating
and he said that after he died,

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:51.300 align:middle line:84%
it would be proved that he was
always working for England.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:52.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was
his role, I guess.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: Yes, but
he was true to his word

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:05.220 align:middle line:84%
and didn't say that he was a
double agent, until after he

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.830 align:middle line:84%
died, when they
immediately found

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:11.970 align:middle line:84%
a letter from British
intelligence in his wallet.

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:14.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See this is
the profile that I've

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:17.730 align:middle line:84%
had from him over
the years, and that

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:22.050 align:middle line:84%
is that he was a dark magic
practitioner, believed that he

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:26.280 align:middle line:84%
could have been the anti-Christ,
dabbled with the Devil

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.120 align:middle line:84%
and Satan, was a black
mass type person.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean everything
horrendous that you

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:35.310 align:middle line:84%
could think about--
sexual perversions,

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:39.510 align:middle line:84%
all this stuff I heard
about Aleister Crowley.

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:43.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: Yes and
most of it he loved.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was it true?

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: Well, we'd
have to take things

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:48.660 align:middle line:90%
one thing at a time.

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:50.940 align:middle line:84%
Crowley was not, in
my opinion, was not

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.410 align:middle line:90%
an evil individual at all.

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:58.410 align:middle line:84%
He was a serious
spiritual practitioner

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:04.170 align:middle line:84%
that saw the purpose of
all spiritual endeavors

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:09.750 align:middle line:84%
as a self-transformational
process.

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:13.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did he get this rap
of being all these things I've

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:14.550 align:middle line:90%
just said?

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:17.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: Most
of it we can blame

on ultra conservative Victorian
attitudes towards sex,

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.650 align:middle line:90%
morality, and religion.

freak in today's terms?

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: In today's
terms he was a freak.

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And if he had been
doing what he did today,

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:41.250 align:middle line:84%
he would not even be
considered too much

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.740 align:middle line:84%
of an eccentric
character at all.

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So Lon,
how was he raised?

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.309 align:middle line:90%
Let's start with his father.

00:08:47.309 --> 00:08:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think we have
a picture of him.

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:51.120 align:middle line:84%
There he is, father,
Edward Crowley.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.985 align:middle line:84%
He did not live long at all,
53 years, but what kind of guy

00:08:54.985 --> 00:08:55.785 align:middle line:90%
was he?

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:58.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: He was
a wealthy brewer.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.590 align:middle line:84%
He had a brewing
company, Crowley Ales,

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:04.530 align:middle line:84%
which sold right up
into the 20th century.

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:08.700 align:middle line:84%
He sort of invented the
equivalent of the convenience

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:09.832 align:middle line:90%
store market.

00:09:09.832 --> 00:09:10.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like 7-Eleven?

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:12.000 align:middle line:90%
>>DUQUETTE: Like 7-eleven.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:12.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: Yeah, and
for working men, working

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.410 align:middle line:84%
in mines in Industrial
Revolution, when

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:21.090 align:middle line:84%
they got a lunch
break, they would

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.190 align:middle line:90%
go to one of his little inns.

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:24.820 align:middle line:90%
They would drink Crowley Ale.

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:26.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, buy things.

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:28.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: Have a ham sandwich
or something like that.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:29.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Brilliant.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.590 align:middle line:90%
>>DUQUETTE: So he was wealthy.

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:33.690 align:middle line:90%
They weren't a noble family.

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:35.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did he have
a dark side to him?

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.200 align:middle line:90%
>>DUQUETTE: No.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:41.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, they belonged to
the Exclusive Brethren

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:44.910 align:middle line:84%
or the Plymouth Brethren,
sort of an early version

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:47.730 align:middle line:84%
of modern evangelical
Christians,

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:50.100 align:middle line:90%
Darbyites they were called.

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And Darby was the
one that came up

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:56.220 align:middle line:84%
with the impending end
of the world, the Rapture

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.980 align:middle line:84%
of the church,
and things that we

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:03.630 align:middle line:84%
think of as, sort of, modern
evangelical Christianity.

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:09.570 align:middle line:84%
That all of us are doomed to
go to hell just for being born.

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:12.150 align:middle line:84%
That's the price we
pay for being born

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:14.130 align:middle line:90%
is that we're damned to hell.

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:20.040 align:middle line:84%
And only if we have grace
that is God-given at birth,

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.470 align:middle line:90%
whether we go to hell or heaven.

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:28.300 align:middle line:84%
It was very strict, severely
strict, conservative Christian

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:29.100 align:middle line:90%
movement.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you don't
think the father was

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:35.700 align:middle line:84%
the basis of the foundation
that Aleister had?

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: He was
affected by his father.

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:40.290 align:middle line:84%
He respected his father, and
he loved his father very much.

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And his father was
a lay preacher,

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:45.409 align:middle line:90%
who would get on his horse.

00:10:45.409 --> 00:10:46.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And go off
into communities?

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:48.783 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: And go off
into the communities.

00:10:48.783 --> 00:10:51.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So let's
take a look at Mom

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:52.920 align:middle line:84%
and see what kind
of an influence

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.630 align:middle line:90%
she had with Aleister.

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:55.450 align:middle line:90%
There she is now.

00:10:55.450 --> 00:11:00.510 align:middle line:84%
Whoa, she obviously had a lot
to do with his devil worshipping

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:01.560 align:middle line:90%
or whatever he did.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.601 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: Doesn't that
look like it's right out

00:11:03.601 --> 00:11:04.860 align:middle line:90%
of Dickens' Oliver Twist.

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, it sure does.

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:07.650 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about Emily.

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:11.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: Well, Emily was
also a member of the Plymouth

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:17.580 align:middle line:84%
Brethren, and she emotionally
misunderstood the doctrines

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:22.380 align:middle line:84%
of the church enough to actually
traumatize the young Crowley.

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:25.530 align:middle line:84%
So on one hand, he had the
father, who he respected,

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:28.230 align:middle line:84%
who in a sense, was
a church leader.

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:29.730 align:middle line:90%
And Crowley would like--

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:32.220 align:middle line:84%
would grow up to
like to see himself

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:35.170 align:middle line:84%
as a church leader, too,
or a spiritual leader.

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:36.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She looks
like she could

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:40.530 align:middle line:84%
have been the reason he
was a little off kilter,

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:42.590 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just saying
that by her picture.

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:45.270 align:middle line:10%
>>DUQUETTE: If we want to
be amateur psychologists,

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:51.870 align:middle line:10%
it's really easy for us to
actually see Crowley's talking

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:54.150 align:middle line:10%
about himself as the Beast 666--

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:56.370 align:middle line:10%
his mother, when he
was naughty as a child,

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:57.490 align:middle line:10%
called him the Beast 666.

00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:58.290 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: See?

00:11:58.290 --> 00:11:59.640 align:middle line:10%
There you go

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:03.390 align:middle line:10%
>>DUQUETTE: But he was trying
to use everything in his life

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:08.250 align:middle line:10%
as a metaphor for his
own spiritual growth.

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:14.580 align:middle line:10%
He saw the new advances
in human thought

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:18.960 align:middle line:10%
as an evolutionary step
in human consciousness.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:24.450 align:middle line:10%
And he used the Bible
story or the story

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:27.480 align:middle line:10%
of the Book of the
Revelation of John,

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:31.140 align:middle line:10%
with the beast 666 and
the end of the age,

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.300 align:middle line:10%
he saw that as the
perfect metaphor

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.430 align:middle line:10%
and a perfect
description of what's

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:38.580 align:middle line:10%
happening in human
consciousness around the turn

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.680 align:middle line:10%
of the 20th century.

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:44.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He developed a
concept called magick.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:45.434 align:middle line:90%
What was that?

00:12:45.434 --> 00:12:47.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: Magick's
an old concept that

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.470 align:middle line:90%
goes back to prehistory, OK?

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:52.950 align:middle line:84%
But Crowley's idea
of magick is a form

00:12:52.950 --> 00:13:00.030 align:middle line:84%
of willed, self-evolution,
purposefully setting about

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:03.720 align:middle line:90%
to raise your consciousness.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And he used the Hebrew
Kabbalah as sort of a step

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:12.230 align:middle line:90%
by step process of waking up.

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:15.080 align:middle line:84%
When we look at
it that way, it is

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:20.330 align:middle line:84%
what the great spiritual
teachers of the past

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:22.520 align:middle line:90%
have been saying all along.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:30.440 align:middle line:84%
Crowley said, I'm going to
use the terms, the vocabulary,

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:33.980 align:middle line:90%
the metaphors of classic magick.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to deal with these
concepts of consciousness

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:43.370 align:middle line:84%
as spirits, as angels,
as demons, as gods.

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:44.552 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And he did.

00:13:44.552 --> 00:13:46.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: And he
did, and this is

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:48.920 align:middle line:84%
where so much of the
misunderstanding of Crowley

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.300 align:middle line:90%
comes from.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:56.930 align:middle line:84%
It comes from anyone
with a limited definition

00:13:56.930 --> 00:14:00.530 align:middle line:84%
of what a spirit is, what an
angel is, what a demon is,

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:02.000 align:middle line:90%
what a god is.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But I can see how
people would misinterpret that.

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:08.245 align:middle line:10%
>>DUQUETTE:
Absolutely, absolutely,

00:14:08.245 --> 00:14:11.900 align:middle line:10%
and it was sort of
Crowley's tragic flaw

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:19.960 align:middle line:10%
that he underestimated the
number of people that could

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.415 align:middle line:10%

to meet the leader of the

Hermetic Order of

was founded by high degree
Freemasons in the latter part

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:36.680 align:middle line:10%
of the 19th century as a magical

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:15.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: Right and the Golden
Dawn certainly wasn't that.

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:17.570 align:middle line:84%
It was how do we
enlighten ourselves?

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:18.470 align:middle line:90%
How do we become enlightened?

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:20.011 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But he
seemed to want to get

00:16:20.011 --> 00:16:24.650 align:middle line:84%
involved in all these
strange, bizarre activities.

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:27.686 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: Well,
he was attracted

00:16:27.686 --> 00:16:31.100 align:middle line:90%
to a colorful life, period.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So he wasn't a
dull guy at all, was he?

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.835 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: He was
anything but dull.

00:16:35.835 --> 00:16:36.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A character.

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:38.630 align:middle line:10%
>>DUQUETTE: Yes,
and we don't really

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:45.830 align:middle line:10%
have to resort to any made
up stories or any speculation

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:48.050 align:middle line:10%
of wild activities.

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:50.990 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to resort
to any made up stories.

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:53.856 align:middle line:84%
Crowley's life was
full of real stories

00:16:53.856 --> 00:16:58.100 align:middle line:84%
that are very, very
interesting and exciting

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.050 align:middle line:90%
in and of themselves.

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:02.150 align:middle line:84%
He was attracted
to the Golden Dawn

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:07.940 align:middle line:84%
and the Golden Dawn
had become, by 1900,

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:11.900 align:middle line:84%
sort of entrenched and
comfortable with themselves

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:16.460 align:middle line:84%
and sort of an elite attitude
formed within the degree

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:18.920 align:middle line:90%
structure of the Golden Dawn.

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:23.030 align:middle line:10%
And here comes Aleister
Crowley, who's obviously

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:27.200 align:middle line:10%
a brilliant guy, grasping
all of their concepts,

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.350 align:middle line:10%
mastering all of their
knowledge lectures

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:33.110 align:middle line:10%
in record-breaking
time, grasping

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:35.180 align:middle line:10%
the big picture of
what they're doing,

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:39.200 align:middle line:10%
but still, he was a wild
and crazy mountain climbing

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:43.220 align:middle line:10%
poet guy with all sorts of
friends, Oscar Wilde type

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:44.805 align:middle line:10%
friends, you know?

00:17:44.805 --> 00:17:45.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of that era.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:48.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: Of that era,
and they were saying,

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:53.450 align:middle line:84%
this guy's just too
liberated, you know?

00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:54.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was too far.

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:57.110 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, he was-- the
he's a loose cannon.

00:17:57.110 --> 00:18:00.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would you say,
Lon, in all your research,

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:04.950 align:middle line:84%
was the strangest Aleister
Crowley story that's out there?

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:05.750 align:middle line:90%
>>DUQUETTE: Wow!

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:09.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bizarre, black
magic, whatever he did--

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:11.530 align:middle line:84%
what would you say
was the strangest one?

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:14.420 align:middle line:90%
>>DUQUETTE: Wow!

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:16.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That gave
him the notoriety.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:20.945 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: I have such
a deep well of things

00:18:20.945 --> 00:18:23.360 align:middle line:90%
that I could choose from.

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:25.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, did
he have black masses

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:26.740 align:middle line:90%
where he prayed to the devil?

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:27.540 align:middle line:90%
>>DUQUETTE: No, no.

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:29.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did he do
anything like that?

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.870 align:middle line:90%
Because we all think he did.

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:32.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: We all
think he did, yeah.

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:36.710 align:middle line:84%
He would throw around the
term Satan and Lucifer--

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:38.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Willy-nilly.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.250 align:middle line:90%
>>DUQUETTE: Willy-nilly, OK?

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:46.160 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps the wildest
thing that he did was he

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.950 align:middle line:10%
marched across the
North African Sahara

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:52.180 align:middle line:10%
with his friend and
colleague Victor Neuburg,

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:55.160 align:middle line:10%
the famous poet, Victor Neuburg.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:59.910 align:middle line:10%
And every evening,
they would make camp

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:05.550 align:middle line:10%
and they would perform
a magic ceremony that

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:11.190 align:middle line:10%
was developed by Doctor John
Dee, Queen Elizabeth I's court

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:17.030 align:middle line:10%
magician to open up
and receive visions

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:22.850 align:middle line:10%
of what they called the 30
Enochian Aires or Aethyrs.

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And if you can imagine
that the entire spectrum

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:31.560 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness from you and
me, everyday consciousness

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:37.700 align:middle line:84%
kind of people, all the way up
to the supreme consciousness of

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:40.550 align:middle line:90%
godhead itself, OK?

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And if you can
imagine that in 30

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:48.140 align:middle line:84%
ascending sections or
frequencies of consciousness,

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:53.720 align:middle line:84%
this Enochian magic operation
that used an angelic language--

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.540 align:middle line:90%
it's very colorful, very--

00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:59.870 align:middle line:84%
it's like a small
psychedelic drug

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:04.280 align:middle line:84%
that opens up the next door, the
next door, and the next door.

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And when the doors are
opened, a flood of images

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:12.290 align:middle line:84%
comes into the
magician and then--

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:14.150 align:middle line:90%
which was Crowley in this case--

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:17.592 align:middle line:84%
and he described what he was
seeing while Victor Neuburg.

00:20:17.592 --> 00:20:18.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was jotting it down.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:20.840 align:middle line:90%
>>DUQUETTE: Was jotting it down.

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And they did 30
Aethyrs on it and it

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:35.800 align:middle line:84%
is the most breathtaking and
strangely beautiful document.

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:38.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lon, in
talking about music,

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:41.590 align:middle line:84%
the Led Zeppelin
guitarist, Jimmy Page,

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:43.780 align:middle line:84%
was obsessed with
Aleister Crowley.

>>NARRATOR: The
cloud of mystique

00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:50.050 align:middle line:84%
that shadowed the band grew
with the news of Jimmy Page's

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:53.620 align:middle line:84%
interest in Aleister Crowley,
an early 20th century

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:57.400 align:middle line:84%
Englishman aligned with
black magic and demonology.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.640 align:middle line:84%
Page's fascination with
Crowley led many to believe he

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:03.497 align:middle line:90%
was into black magic himself.

00:21:03.497 --> 00:21:05.080 align:middle line:84%
LORI MATTIX: I think
he was absolutely

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:07.846 align:middle line:84%
fascinated with the man and
the knowledge of the will.

00:21:07.846 --> 00:21:09.220 align:middle line:10%
I don't think--
I mean, you know,

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:13.060 align:middle line:10%
he owned a lot of manuscripts
and he bought the Inverness

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:15.670 align:middle line:10%
Castle that was also Crowley's.

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think with it, he had
purchased a lot of manuscripts.

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And at one point,
he had a bookstore

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.590 align:middle line:90%
in English, an occult bookstore.

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:25.060 align:middle line:84%
And he was really
more fascinated

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:26.200 align:middle line:90%
by the knowledge of it.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.130 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:28.921 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Fascinated by
the knowledge of it.

00:21:28.921 --> 00:21:33.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: Yes,
you could say that.

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:37.150 align:middle line:84%
I think Jimmy Page's
rise to superstardom

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:39.450 align:middle line:84%
was because he's a
brilliant musician more--

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:41.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not because he
dabbled with the occult.

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:44.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: Right, but
his interest in Crowley

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:49.750 align:middle line:84%
was as a serious collector,
as a serious student,

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:52.810 align:middle line:84%
but even if he practiced
all of Aleister Crowley's

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:55.000 align:middle line:84%
different rituals and
disciplines, none of it

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.890 align:middle line:84%
would be, in my
opinion, considered

00:21:56.890 --> 00:22:01.486 align:middle line:90%
black magic or evil aligned.

00:22:01.486 --> 00:22:03.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you go to
dinner with Crowley today?

>>DUQUETTE: I'd go to
dinner with Crowley,

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:08.400 align:middle line:84%
but I'm sure that he'd
make me pick up the check.

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh, and what
would you ask him at dinner?

00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:15.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: I think
I would ask him,

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:21.700 align:middle line:84%
if he had it to do over again,
would he have given the future

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:28.900 align:middle line:84%
more credit to understand what
he was about without having

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:33.032 align:middle line:84%
to go through a great deal
of the Barnum and Bailey--

00:22:33.032 --> 00:22:34.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Routine.

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:35.320 align:middle line:90%
>>DUQUETTE: Routine.

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.030 align:middle line:90%
I think I would ask him that.

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:40.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was he grossly
misread as a person?

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:41.590 align:middle line:90%
>>DUQUETTE: Yes.

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:42.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: By people?

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:43.120 align:middle line:90%
>>DUQUETTE: Yes.

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:49.150 align:middle line:84%
He made enemies among the yellow
journalism press of the day,

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:53.620 align:middle line:84%
that stories of his
activities sold newspapers.

00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And at first, Crowley
thought that was good,

00:22:56.770 --> 00:23:00.130 align:middle line:90%
any publicity is good publicity.

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:00.995 align:middle line:90%
And he had learned--

00:23:00.995 --> 00:23:02.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He made some
mistakes, though.

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:03.460 align:middle line:90%
>>DUQUETTE: Oh, yes.

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:04.103 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes.

00:23:04.103 --> 00:23:05.352 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fundamental mistakes.

00:23:05.352 --> 00:23:07.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DUQUETTE: He was very human.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:10.270 align:middle line:90%
He was a very human prophet.

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:12.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a book
called "The Book of the Law"

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:15.850 align:middle line:84%
that Aleister Crowley
was pretty interested in.

00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:17.030 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at this.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:20.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: He wrote
solidly for one hour.

00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:24.380 align:middle line:10%
The same procedure was
followed the next day and again

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:28.160 align:middle line:10%
on the third, until finally,
the message from Aiwass

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.750 align:middle line:10%
was complete.

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:32.250 align:middle line:84%
What he had written
down would later

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:35.280 align:middle line:84%
become one of Crowley's
most infamous words known

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:38.220 align:middle line:84%
as "The Book of the
Law," the doctrine which

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:41.190 align:middle line:84%
the new order would
follow and Crowley himself

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:44.100 align:middle line:84%
would be the chief
of that new order.

The Beast 666 and his
scarlet woman, Rose.

00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:53.730 align:middle line:84%
"Do what thou wilt shall
be the whole of the law,"

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:57.010 align:middle line:84%
was probably the most
famous line from this book,

00:23:57.010 --> 00:23:59.800 align:middle line:84%
but there are also within
the work prophecies

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:02.680 align:middle line:84%
and revelations, which
would leave even the most

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:04.050 align:middle line:90%

this "Book of the Law?"

a book that Crowley

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.706 align:middle line:90%

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ah, OK,
like a channelling.

00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:24.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: Right, and he
didn't know what it was about.

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:29.480 align:middle line:84%
He would probably confess,
even at the end of his life,

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:32.330 align:middle line:84%
that he couldn't
completely understand

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:33.690 align:middle line:90%
what it was all about.

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:34.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Automatic
writing, almost.

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:35.560 align:middle line:90%
>>DUQUETTE: Yeah, right.

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:39.080 align:middle line:10%
But what it became for him
was the primary revelation

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.070 align:middle line:10%
of the age.

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:41.877 align:middle line:10%
It's in three chapters.

00:24:41.877 --> 00:24:42.710 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Small book.

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:44.168 align:middle line:10%
>>DUQUETTE: It's
a very small book.

00:24:44.168 --> 00:24:49.610 align:middle line:84%
The chapters give voice to
three primary Egyptian gods--

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:52.190 align:middle line:90%


00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:57.020 align:middle line:84%
the goddess Nuit, the goddess of
the night sky or the completely

00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:59.580 align:middle line:84%
expanded universe,
in other words,

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:03.110 align:middle line:84%
the god that's
everything outward, OK?

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And then Hadit, which is
the second chapter, which

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:10.610 align:middle line:84%
would be the
inscrutable point that's

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:13.080 align:middle line:90%
in the center of this big thing.

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:17.930 align:middle line:84%
So it's like lovers
on a cosmic scale, OK?

00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:20.135 align:middle line:84%
But if the circumference
is infinite,

00:25:20.135 --> 00:25:25.250 align:middle line:84%
then the point in the middle is
also infinitely everywhere, OK?

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And then the third chapter
is the Egyptian god Horus

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:34.070 align:middle line:84%
that Crowley eventually
saw his chapter

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:42.575 align:middle line:84%
as being indicative of the god
or the forces of consciousness

00:25:42.575 --> 00:25:47.690 align:middle line:84%
that are currently
in play today.

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:50.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why the Egyptian
influence in his life?

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:53.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: Well, it may have
come because they were in Cairo

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:55.370 align:middle line:90%
when it was written, OK?

00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:56.510 align:middle line:90%
And they had just spent--

00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:59.720 align:middle line:84%
he and his wife, his new
bride, had just a spent a night

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:01.564 align:middle line:90%
in the King's Chamber.

00:26:01.564 --> 00:26:03.230 align:middle line:84%
Staying all night in
the King's Chamber,

00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:04.490 align:middle line:90%
they came back to the hotel.

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:10.140 align:middle line:84%
She sort of fell into a
trance and said, the gods--

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:11.300 align:middle line:90%
it was her trance.

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:11.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They spoke to here.

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:12.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DUQUETTE: Yeah.

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, so he's writing
from what she was saying?

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:17.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: Well, she
eventually told him

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:20.790 align:middle line:84%
that this book wanted
to come through him.

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:21.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:24.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: OK, and then he
followed her instructions

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:29.810 align:middle line:84%
on how to set up the hotel
room and how to-- how to--

00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:31.670 align:middle line:84%
what time to sit
down and just write

00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:33.530 align:middle line:90%
what he heard through his ear.

00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:35.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did
he do with the book?

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:38.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: He ran away
from it for a few years

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:39.950 align:middle line:90%
because it scared him.

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:42.500 align:middle line:84%
That third chapter,
which describes

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:52.170 align:middle line:84%
the violent, bloody beginning
of a new age, and it scared him.

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:55.160 align:middle line:84%
Even he thought it
sounded too violent.

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:56.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Outlandish.

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:58.190 align:middle line:90%
>>DUQUETTE: Outlandish, OK?

00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:01.680 align:middle line:84%
But it's the Egyptian god Horus,
who is a wild and crazy guy.

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.920 align:middle line:84%
You know, he's a wild
and violent character.

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.210 align:middle line:84%
But when Crowley
finally understood,

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:12.730 align:middle line:84%
especially as the century
went into World War

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:16.990 align:middle line:84%
I, the bloodbath of World War
I, the bloodbath of World War

00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:18.070 align:middle line:90%
II, the--

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:20.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was this prophecy?

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: He saw
this third chapter,

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:24.400 align:middle line:90%
the wild chapter that--

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:25.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like Revelation almost.

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:27.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: Like
it's a Revelation.

00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:32.200 align:middle line:10%
It's not how we're
supposed to aspire

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:37.120 align:middle line:10%
to a moral or ethical life, OK?

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:41.720 align:middle line:84%
It's describing the nature,
the violent nature of the world

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:44.290 align:middle line:90%
at the beginning of a new age.

00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:48.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He had followers
like Raoul Loveday

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:49.490 align:middle line:90%
and Raoul's wife, Betty May.

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:50.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DUQUETTE: Right.

00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:51.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He had great followers.

00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:53.665 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: I don't know
how great they were,

00:27:53.665 --> 00:27:55.540 align:middle line:84%
but they came to
Sicily to see him.

00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:56.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, let's see

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:56.860 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:59.350 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: It did attract one
new disciple in particular,

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:04.300 align:middle line:10%
Raoul Loveday, a 23-year-old
man who arrived at the Abbey

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:10.220 align:middle line:10%
on the 26th of November 1922
with his young wife, Betty May.

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:13.530 align:middle line:84%
Raoul wanted to study
under the great master.

00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Betty was skeptical
and unsure of living

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.425 align:middle line:90%
in such a bizarre household.

00:28:17.425 --> 00:28:18.280 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:21.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: OK, so that's a
short clip on just a follower.

00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:24.800 align:middle line:84%
So he did have some people,
as we would say today, fans.

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:25.870 align:middle line:90%
>>DUQUETTE: He had fans.

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And poor Raoul and his wife,
who was an artist's model, Betty

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:36.340 align:middle line:84%
May, who didn't really want
to come with Raoul to Sicily

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:39.280 align:middle line:84%
to be with Crowley at
the Abbey of Thelema--

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:42.220 align:middle line:84%
Raoul went hiking,
and he ignored

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:45.940 align:middle line:84%
everybody's instructions
not to drink the water,

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:50.730 align:middle line:90%
and he developed dysentery.

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:53.352 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, geez, and in
those days, that's bad.

00:28:53.352 --> 00:28:54.310 align:middle line:90%
>>DUQUETTE: That's bad.

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:56.620 align:middle line:90%
And Raoul died.

00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:59.168 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From this?

00:28:59.168 --> 00:29:01.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: From the
dysentery, right.

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:07.780 align:middle line:84%
When newspapers in England
that had already vilified

00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:11.825 align:middle line:84%
Crowley in other matters,
when they got word

00:29:11.825 --> 00:29:16.480 align:middle line:84%
that a person died at
Crowley's compounds,

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:17.630 align:middle line:90%
they got a hold of it.

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And when Betty May came back
to England, they met with her.

00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:24.820 align:middle line:90%
She was a heroin addict.

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:28.990 align:middle line:84%
When she came back to London,
they met with her at the Plough

00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:33.520 align:middle line:84%
Pub-- my favorite pub
on Museum Street--

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:40.200 align:middle line:84%
and said, will you sign your
name to this story, you know?

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Authenticate
it, basically.

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:46.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: Yeah, and so they
tried to twist it in such a way

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:52.090 align:middle line:84%
to make it sound like
the evil meditations

00:29:52.090 --> 00:30:02.490 align:middle line:84%
that they were doing killed
him, but any real reporter today

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:06.850 align:middle line:84%
would not give that
story a second look.

00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And it was just part of
the ongoing vilification

00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:11.887 align:middle line:90%
of Crowley.

00:30:11.887 --> 00:30:13.720 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to point out
that Crowley was never

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.527 align:middle line:90%
arrested in his life.

00:30:15.527 --> 00:30:16.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or charged.

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:19.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: Or
charged with anything.

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:24.820 align:middle line:84%
Bankruptcy is probably
the biggest and libel, OK?

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:29.550 align:middle line:84%
He was not arrested for
being a pornographer,

00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:37.770 align:middle line:84%
but some of his books were
confiscated at various borders

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:39.690 align:middle line:90%
from countries like Italy.

00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:43.620 align:middle line:84%
Mussolini's Italy, that had
read the reports of Crowley.

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And Mussolini eventually kicked
Crowley out of Sicily in 1923.

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:52.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lon, you and I
both have a dear friend

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:57.140 align:middle line:84%
named Art Rosengarten, who
is an expert in tarot cards.

00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:01.250 align:middle line:84%
Tarot cards also played a
role with Aleister Crowley.

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:03.014 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

that can reveal the future?

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:12.330 align:middle line:84%
Some say they are a window
into another space and time.

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:17.730 align:middle line:90%


00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:19.470 align:middle line:10%
It's been claimed
they are the remnants

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:24.570 align:middle line:10%
of ancient esoteric wisdom, a
long lost book of secrets whose

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:30.570 align:middle line:10%
symbols both hide and
reveal important knowledge.

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:33.710 align:middle line:10%
The 78 intriguing and
perplexing tarot cards

00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:38.370 align:middle line:10%
have been feared by some
as the devil's playthings

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:40.300 align:middle line:10%
perhaps for very good reason.

with these, did he not?

Crowley learned in the Golden

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:55.020 align:middle line:10%

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:59.165 align:middle line:10%
reveal the esoteric nature
of the Hebrew Kabbalah.

00:31:59.165 --> 00:32:02.700 align:middle line:84%
They're like
Kabbalah flashcards.

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:08.190 align:middle line:84%
But even more than that, they
are images in a classic union,

00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:13.230 align:middle line:84%
archetypal way trigger different
aspects of consciousness.

00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And they can be used
in a meditative way

00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:22.180 align:middle line:84%
to systematically access
these higher and higher levels

00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:22.980 align:middle line:90%
of conscious.

of the game, wasn't he.

00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:26.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: He was way
ahead of the curve on it.

00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:30.510 align:middle line:84%
When England first started
to get into World War II,

Lady Frieda Harris, the
wife of Percy Harris,

00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:39.370 align:middle line:84%
a member of Parliament, became
one of Crowley's students,

00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:44.890 align:middle line:84%
and she talked him into
writing a book about tarot.

00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:46.870 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
write about tarot,

00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:49.330 align:middle line:84%
you write about Kabbalah,
when you write about Kabbalah,

00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:52.360 align:middle line:84%
you're writing about magic,
and when you write about magic,

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:55.570 align:middle line:84%
you're writing about
all spiritual things.

00:32:55.570 --> 00:32:58.450 align:middle line:10%
She saw Crowley at the
end of his life saying,

00:32:58.450 --> 00:33:02.650 align:middle line:10%
this could be your
big magnum opus here.

00:33:02.650 --> 00:33:09.940 align:middle line:10%
Write a book about tarot and
I will paint you 78 watercolor

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:12.550 align:middle line:10%
paintings at your direction.

00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And after going back
and forth for a while,

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:17.710 align:middle line:90%
Crowley agreed to do that.

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:19.690 align:middle line:10%
One of his greatest
works he wrote

00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:23.140 align:middle line:10%
in the last years of his life
is called "The Book of Thoth,"

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:26.469 align:middle line:10%
and the Thoth tarot deck that
Lady Frieda Harris painted--

00:33:26.469 --> 00:33:28.510 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That became the
premier deck, didn't it?

00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:33.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: That's the premier
deck, second only to the Rider,

00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:36.427 align:middle line:84%
the Waite deck, which
we're all familiar with.

00:33:36.427 --> 00:33:38.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you
know, in those cards,

00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:39.780 align:middle line:84%
though Lon, you
have the Death card

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:41.290 align:middle line:90%
and you have things like that.

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:42.680 align:middle line:90%
That's kind of scary.

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:47.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: Well, so is
walking across the street.

00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:49.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So he
dabbled in reality.

00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:54.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: Yes, well, so does
all serious spiritual art forms

00:33:54.370 --> 00:33:56.740 align:middle line:90%
or spiritual practices do.

00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:58.060 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, as you look at--

00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:02.140 align:middle line:10%
>>DUQUETTE: I mean, there's
evil looking gargoyles

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:07.410 align:middle line:10%
on all of the cathedrals of
Europe dedicated to Our Lady.

00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:09.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, makes
you wonder about that.

00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:12.639 align:middle line:84%
But if he lived
today and practiced

00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:16.155 align:middle line:84%
what he practiced then, he'd
be considered kind of dull,

00:34:16.155 --> 00:34:16.989 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't he?

00:34:16.989 --> 00:34:18.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DUQUETTE: Yeah.

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:19.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He really would.

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:21.629 align:middle line:90%
>>DUQUETTE: Yeah.

00:34:21.629 --> 00:34:26.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As we wrap this, we
got a little better perspective

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:28.650 align:middle line:90%
into who this individual was.

00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:33.239 align:middle line:84%
Do you think he has gotten a bum
rap for being considered evil?

00:34:33.239 --> 00:34:37.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DUQUETTE: Yes, the simple
straight answer is yes.

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:41.389 align:middle line:10%
It's truly a bum
rap when there's

00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:44.719 align:middle line:10%
so much real evil in the world.

00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:49.820 align:middle line:10%
To look at this guy,
who's only true motive

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:52.699 align:middle line:10%
was to raise the
consciousness of the planet.

00:34:52.699 --> 00:34:58.490 align:middle line:84%
He did it sometimes awkwardly,
sometimes failed completely,

00:34:58.490 --> 00:35:01.820 align:middle line:84%
but his motive was
the same motive

00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:06.110 align:middle line:84%
of every holy man
that has ever tried

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:08.407 align:middle line:84%
to raise the consciousness
of the planet.

00:35:08.407 --> 00:35:10.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thank you, Lon,
for being on the program.

00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:11.300 align:middle line:90%
>>DUQUETTE: Thank you, George.

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:13.670 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: OK, so the next time
you hear the name Aleister

00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:17.350 align:middle line:10%
Crowley, don't panic.

00:35:17.350 --> 00:35:19.960 align:middle line:84%
If you listen to
Lon Milo Duquette,

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:23.650 align:middle line:84%
you'll realize that he
was just another guy

00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:27.920 align:middle line:84%
with different concepts and
different approaches to life.

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:30.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and
this is "Beyond Belief."
