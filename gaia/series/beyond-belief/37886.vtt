back to  Beyond Belief.

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:28.695 align:middle line:84%
with our special guest from the
SETI Institute, that's Search

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:32.299 align:middle line:84%
for Extra Terrestrial
Intelligence, Seth Shostak.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:33.200 align:middle line:90%
He's an astronomer.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.067 align:middle line:90%
Seth, welcome back.

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:35.202 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:36.169 align:middle line:84%
>> Seth Shostak: Good,
well, I'm still okay.

00:00:36.169 --> 00:00:38.071 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Good for you.

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:39.306 align:middle line:90%
Astronomy.

00:00:39.306 --> 00:00:42.743 align:middle line:84%
It's been one of my
fascinations since I was a boy.

00:00:42.743 --> 00:00:48.215 align:middle line:84%
You have got to explain for
me the theory of the Big Bang,

00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:50.117 align:middle line:90%
because I still don't get it.

00:00:50.117 --> 00:00:52.519 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand how
something could blow

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:55.756 align:middle line:84%
up from some minute particle
they keep talking about.

00:00:55.756 --> 00:00:57.157 align:middle line:90%
I don't get it.

00:00:57.157 --> 00:00:58.992 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Yeah, well I don't
think anybody actually gets it.

00:00:58.992 --> 00:01:01.527 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's one of
the big mysteries, right?

00:01:01.527 --> 00:01:04.631 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knows what, if you
will, caused the Big Bang.

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:08.235 align:middle line:84%
We have this presumably
almost, maybe even,

00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:10.370 align:middle line:84%
infinitely small
volume of space --

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.739 align:middle line:84%
well, no space, because space
is part of the universe,

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:14.640 align:middle line:84%
that creates space
and everything in it.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.509 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know,
that's so mind --

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:17.444 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It makes no sense.

00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:18.277 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: It's
so mind boggling.

00:01:18.277 --> 00:01:20.814 align:middle line:90%
But look, the way it happened,

00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:23.616 align:middle line:84%
it became an observational
fact, right?

00:01:23.616 --> 00:01:26.553 align:middle line:84%
If you went back a hundred,
a hundred and twenty years

00:01:26.553 --> 00:01:28.889 align:middle line:84%
and you talked to astronomers
or anybody else and say,

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:31.223 align:middle line:90%
so what about the universe?

00:01:31.223 --> 00:01:32.526 align:middle line:90%
Did it have a beginning?

00:01:32.526 --> 00:01:33.894 align:middle line:90%
Is it going to have an end?

00:01:33.894 --> 00:01:37.831 align:middle line:84%
And the conventional wisdom
then was, it's the same.

00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:39.132 align:middle line:84%
I mean, things don't
change very fast.

00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:41.101 align:middle line:84%
Oh, the planets go
around the sun.

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:42.669 align:middle line:84%
You get a comet,
and stuff like that.

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:44.972 align:middle line:84%
A little bit of dirty
chemistry we call life

00:01:44.972 --> 00:01:46.973 align:middle line:90%
on this world the earth.

00:01:46.973 --> 00:01:48.976 align:middle line:84%
But things basically
don't change.

00:01:48.976 --> 00:01:51.845 align:middle line:84%
The universe has always been
here, it will always be here.

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:54.147 align:middle line:90%
Now, and that's the way --

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:55.215 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It used to be.

00:01:55.215 --> 00:01:56.049 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yeah.

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:57.384 align:middle line:90%
And then Einstein comes along.

00:01:57.384 --> 00:02:00.020 align:middle line:84%
And in 1915 he, you know,
works out general relativity.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.121 align:middle line:90%
He solves the equation.

00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:02.522 align:middle line:84%
He said, now wait a
minute, wait a minute.

00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:05.993 align:middle line:84%
These equations predict that the
universe can't just be static,

00:02:05.993 --> 00:02:07.728 align:middle line:90%
sort of the same forever.

00:02:07.728 --> 00:02:09.329 align:middle line:90%
It's got to either be expanding

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:11.131 align:middle line:84%
or contracting according
to my math.

00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:12.132 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Or both.

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:14.101 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Well, it's got --

00:02:14.101 --> 00:02:16.069 align:middle line:84%
maybe for a period of
time it's expanding,

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.903 align:middle line:90%
and then it's contracting.

00:02:16.903 --> 00:02:18.105 align:middle line:90%
It's got to do one or the other.

00:02:18.105 --> 00:02:20.574 align:middle line:84%
But in any case, and so he
goes to the astronomers.

00:02:20.574 --> 00:02:21.908 align:middle line:90%
He said, you know,

00:02:21.908 --> 00:02:23.410 align:middle line:84%
is it possible the universe
is expanding or contracting?

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.511 align:middle line:90%
They said no, it's static.

00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:26.213 align:middle line:84%
It's not. Okay, and
he said, then I've got

00:02:26.213 --> 00:02:28.115 align:middle line:84%
to fix my equations and
he puts in a fudge factor.

00:02:28.115 --> 00:02:32.185 align:middle line:84%
Okay. But then, an astronomer
by the name of Ed Hubble.

00:02:32.185 --> 00:02:33.954 align:middle line:84%
Now, everybody knows
Edwin Hubble.

00:02:33.954 --> 00:02:37.357 align:middle line:84%
He measures, you
know, galaxies nearby.

00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:41.695 align:middle line:84%
And he finds that, well,
they're all moving away from us.

00:02:41.695 --> 00:02:43.030 align:middle line:84%
Okay, that's an observational
fact.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.165 align:middle line:84%
It says nothing about
why they're doing that.

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:46.033 align:middle line:90%
They're all moving away.

00:02:46.033 --> 00:02:46.833 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And that's real.

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:47.634 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: And that's real.

00:02:47.634 --> 00:02:48.668 align:middle line:90%
There's no doubt about that.

00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:50.003 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, if they're
farther way,

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:52.105 align:middle line:84%
they're moving away
from us faster.

00:02:52.105 --> 00:02:54.941 align:middle line:84%
Okay, so imagine somebody had
the bad form to come in here

00:02:54.941 --> 00:02:56.410 align:middle line:84%
with a hand grenade and
pull the pin right here

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.011 align:middle line:90%
on the desk, okay?

00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:00.313 align:middle line:84%
And then you looked at
it, you know, a thousandth

00:03:00.313 --> 00:03:02.215 align:middle line:84%
of second later, what you'd
see is all these fragments

00:03:02.215 --> 00:03:03.350 align:middle line:90%
going off.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.918 align:middle line:90%
And you'd notice that the ones

00:03:04.918 --> 00:03:07.554 align:middle line:84%
that were moving
fastest were the ones

00:03:07.554 --> 00:03:08.622 align:middle line:90%
that were farthest away.

00:03:08.622 --> 00:03:10.323 align:middle line:84%
Of course, because
they're moving fastest.

00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:11.625 align:middle line:90%
They've gotten farthest away.

00:03:11.625 --> 00:03:13.794 align:middle line:84%
So you know, you
would say, well, gosh.

00:03:13.794 --> 00:03:14.861 align:middle line:90%
Two things.

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:17.297 align:middle line:84%
It was obviously some
sort of explosion

00:03:17.297 --> 00:03:18.432 align:middle line:90%
to push them, to push them.

00:03:18.432 --> 00:03:20.133 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and now they're
all moving away from it.

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:21.234 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what it looked

00:03:21.234 --> 00:03:23.637 align:middle line:84%
like had happened
to the universe.

00:03:23.637 --> 00:03:26.305 align:middle line:84%
Enormous controversy
about this for,

00:03:26.305 --> 00:03:29.543 align:middle line:90%
at least 30, 40 years, okay?

00:03:29.543 --> 00:03:32.512 align:middle line:84%
But now, we say yes, this
describes the universe.

00:03:32.512 --> 00:03:33.914 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Most astronomers
believe that.

00:03:33.914 --> 00:03:35.148 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Oh, I
think that yes.

00:03:35.148 --> 00:03:36.516 align:middle line:84%
It's very hard to find
somebody who doesn't believe

00:03:36.516 --> 00:03:38.752 align:middle line:84%
in the Big Bang anymore
because what it did is it made

00:03:38.752 --> 00:03:39.853 align:middle line:90%
some predictions.

00:03:39.853 --> 00:03:42.656 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Okay, but
what -- what blew up?

00:03:42.656 --> 00:03:46.059 align:middle line:84%
Let's agree for a moment
there was that explosion.

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:51.064 align:middle line:84%
Could it have been, for
example, an object so huge

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:55.335 align:middle line:84%
that the remnants of it,
the blown up remnants of it,

00:03:55.335 --> 00:03:57.838 align:middle line:84%
happens to be everything
we see in the universe?

00:03:57.838 --> 00:03:59.372 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Yeah, well then
it would have to have kind

00:03:59.372 --> 00:04:01.475 align:middle line:84%
of like the mass of
everything in the universe.

00:04:01.475 --> 00:04:02.309 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Absolutely.

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:03.543 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: That's a big thing.

00:04:03.543 --> 00:04:05.312 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't seem to be one
of the favorite theories

00:04:05.312 --> 00:04:06.680 align:middle line:90%
of cosmologists these days.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.050 align:middle line:84%
Look, there are a
lot of theories.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.121 align:middle line:84%
And nobody knows which is right
or if any of them is right.

00:04:14.121 --> 00:04:16.089 align:middle line:84%
So the bottom line
is, we don't know.

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:17.457 align:middle line:90%
We really don't know.

00:04:17.457 --> 00:04:20.794 align:middle line:84%
It does seem to be the case that
if you could just twist time

00:04:20.794 --> 00:04:23.597 align:middle line:84%
and space the right way,
right here, where you

00:04:23.597 --> 00:04:25.799 align:middle line:84%
and I are sitting here talking,
just twist it the right way --

00:04:25.799 --> 00:04:26.867 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Just a little bit.

00:04:26.867 --> 00:04:27.901 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: -- you
would create a Big Bang

00:04:27.901 --> 00:04:29.703 align:middle line:84%
that would produce
another universe.

00:04:29.703 --> 00:04:31.705 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if that would
make you feel better the rest

00:04:31.705 --> 00:04:32.906 align:middle line:90%
of the day, right?

00:04:32.906 --> 00:04:34.341 align:middle line:90%
If you could create a universe.

00:04:34.341 --> 00:04:35.942 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I'll be thinking
about that all day.

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:37.277 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yes!

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:38.645 align:middle line:84%
And there are physicists who
sort of try and figure out,

00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:41.014 align:middle line:84%
well, could that have been
the cause of our Big Bang?

00:04:41.014 --> 00:04:42.482 align:middle line:84%
Could there have
been other Big Bangs?

00:04:42.482 --> 00:04:44.618 align:middle line:84%
Very fashionable
these days to think

00:04:44.618 --> 00:04:49.189 align:middle line:84%
that our Big Bang is just one
of many because to say that,

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:51.091 align:middle line:84%
you could say well, gee,
we're not even special.

00:04:51.091 --> 00:04:53.894 align:middle line:84%
Our whole universe is not even
special, let alone our planet.

00:04:53.894 --> 00:04:54.961 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: So there
are many universes?

00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:56.797 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: There might
be many universes.

00:04:56.797 --> 00:04:59.499 align:middle line:84%
The reason that's interesting,
it solves a problem.

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:01.001 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is,
our universe seems

00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:02.502 align:middle line:90%
to be nicely set up for life.

00:05:02.502 --> 00:05:03.837 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:05:03.837 --> 00:05:04.538 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: You have stars,
you have planets, you know,

00:05:04.538 --> 00:05:05.238 align:middle line:90%
you have liquid water.

00:05:05.238 --> 00:05:06.706 align:middle line:90%
You have all this stuff.

00:05:06.706 --> 00:05:08.408 align:middle line:90%
That means that we're here.

00:05:08.408 --> 00:05:11.211 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, the
laws of physics.

00:05:11.211 --> 00:05:14.114 align:middle line:90%
Why are they just like that?

00:05:14.114 --> 00:05:15.882 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the only
answer people can come

00:05:15.882 --> 00:05:17.050 align:middle line:84%
up with is well God
made it that way.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.118 align:middle line:84%
That's not going to
be good enough --

00:05:18.118 --> 00:05:19.052 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: That's not
going to hold water.

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:20.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: That's
not going to --

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.054 align:middle line:84%
yeah, hold water
for the physicists.

00:05:21.054 --> 00:05:22.622 align:middle line:84%
So you need to come
up with another --

00:05:22.622 --> 00:05:26.159 align:middle line:84%
well, another idea is you
make zillions of universes.

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.661 align:middle line:90%
And most of them are bad.

00:05:27.661 --> 00:05:29.462 align:middle line:84%
Again, they're like
lottery tickets, right?

00:05:29.462 --> 00:05:30.931 align:middle line:90%
Most of them are bad.

00:05:30.931 --> 00:05:31.932 align:middle line:90%
But there are a couple --

00:05:31.932 --> 00:05:33.066 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: All but one.

00:05:33.066 --> 00:05:34.067 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Yeah, if you
had zillions of them,

00:05:34.067 --> 00:05:35.302 align:middle line:90%
then there are winners in there.

00:05:35.302 --> 00:05:37.370 align:middle line:90%
And we're in a winner.

00:05:38.572 --> 00:05:41.541 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: These universes
that might be out there,

00:05:41.541 --> 00:05:46.413 align:middle line:84%
why can't we see them
now, from this universe?

00:05:46.413 --> 00:05:49.349 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: The problem is we're
trapped in our own in a way.

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:50.717 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these things
might have --

00:05:50.717 --> 00:05:53.520 align:middle line:84%
we have three dimensions of
space, one dimension of time,

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.255 align:middle line:84%
I mean, at least
that we're aware of.

00:05:55.255 --> 00:05:57.457 align:middle line:84%
You know, these might
have two mentions of space

00:05:57.457 --> 00:06:00.327 align:middle line:84%
or 12 dimensions of
space or who knows what?

00:06:00.327 --> 00:06:03.463 align:middle line:84%
And so they're, you know, it's
-- maybe think of it this way.

00:06:03.463 --> 00:06:05.999 align:middle line:84%
All these universes
might be like bubbles

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:07.200 align:middle line:90%
in a bubble bath, right?

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.901 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:06:07.901 --> 00:06:09.302 align:middle line:90%
All stuck to each other.

00:06:09.302 --> 00:06:10.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: They might be stuck
to each other or they might not.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.305 align:middle line:84%
But in any case, you're
in one of those bubbles,

00:06:12.305 --> 00:06:13.506 align:middle line:84%
here are all these
other bubbles out there,

00:06:13.506 --> 00:06:14.507 align:middle line:90%
but you can't see them.

00:06:14.507 --> 00:06:15.642 align:middle line:90%
You're cut off from them.

00:06:15.642 --> 00:06:18.411 align:middle line:84%
So -- but I have to
say that physicists

00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:21.214 align:middle line:84%
in particular are pretty clever
about trying to think of a way

00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:24.284 align:middle line:84%
that you could see if --
not see them directly,

00:06:24.284 --> 00:06:27.220 align:middle line:84%
at least see their
effects, their influence.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.455 align:middle line:84%
Because if you could
do that, then you could

00:06:28.455 --> 00:06:31.458 align:middle line:84%
at least prove the idea
that there are multiverses.

00:06:31.458 --> 00:06:37.163 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Well, inasmuch as our
universe is endless, let's say,

00:06:37.163 --> 00:06:39.499 align:middle line:84%
why do we even have to
conceive of other universes?

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:44.604 align:middle line:84%
If this thing goes on
forever, isn't that enough?

00:06:44.604 --> 00:06:46.039 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Well, I don't know?

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:47.340 align:middle line:90%
Is it enough for you?

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.342 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think it would be
really interesting to know

00:06:49.342 --> 00:06:52.012 align:middle line:84%
that Big Bangs happen
all the time.

00:06:52.012 --> 00:06:53.747 align:middle line:90%
That sort of tells you

00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:56.683 align:middle line:84%
that there wasn't a
beginning to all of this.

00:06:56.683 --> 00:06:58.184 align:middle line:84%
And that's philosophically
interesting

00:06:58.184 --> 00:07:01.121 align:middle line:84%
because now it looks like, you
know, I mean, my niece comes

00:07:01.121 --> 00:07:02.956 align:middle line:84%
up to me and she says: So
what was there, you know,

00:07:02.956 --> 00:07:04.824 align:middle line:90%
14 and 1 billion years ago?

00:07:04.824 --> 00:07:05.458 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Exactly.

00:07:05.458 --> 00:07:06.526 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Right.

00:07:06.526 --> 00:07:07.460 align:middle line:84%
You know, what there
before the Big Bang.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.128 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: That's
a great question.

00:07:08.128 --> 00:07:09.095 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Exactly.

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:09.929 align:middle line:84%
And I tell her, look
Becca, you know.

00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:11.097 align:middle line:90%
That question doesn't make sense

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:13.667 align:middle line:84%
because there was no
time before the Big Bang.

00:07:13.667 --> 00:07:15.802 align:middle line:84%
Time came as part
of the universe.

00:07:15.802 --> 00:07:17.537 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: But her little
brain can't figure it out.

00:07:17.537 --> 00:07:18.238 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: She walks away.

00:07:18.238 --> 00:07:18.938 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Nor can mine.

00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:19.873 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Nor mine.

00:07:19.873 --> 00:07:21.274 align:middle line:84%
I mean, nobody can
figure that out.

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:23.743 align:middle line:84%
And if you have, you know, new
Big Bangs going on all the time,

00:07:23.743 --> 00:07:25.612 align:middle line:84%
then you can say, look,
there was never a beginning.

00:07:25.612 --> 00:07:26.813 align:middle line:90%
It's always been this way.

00:07:26.813 --> 00:07:29.716 align:middle line:84%
There's some sort
of meta-universe.

00:07:29.716 --> 00:07:31.785 align:middle line:84%
And all these Big Bangs go off
and they make these universes.

00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:34.187 align:middle line:84%
And they, you know, they
produce stars, some of them.

00:07:34.187 --> 00:07:34.754 align:middle line:90%
Some of them.

00:07:34.754 --> 00:07:35.555 align:middle line:90%
The good ones.

00:07:35.555 --> 00:07:36.256 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And then planets.

00:07:36.256 --> 00:07:37.223 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: The planets.

00:07:37.223 --> 00:07:38.491 align:middle line:84%
They produce George
Noory, right?

00:07:38.491 --> 00:07:39.993 align:middle line:84%
And then after 100 billion
years, all the stars die.

00:07:39.993 --> 00:07:40.960 align:middle line:90%
They expand.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:41.895 align:middle line:84%
And everything gets
cold and dark

00:07:41.895 --> 00:07:43.330 align:middle line:84%
and the last black
holes evaporate.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:44.397 align:middle line:90%
But they're still there.

00:07:44.397 --> 00:07:45.231 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: But there's
another universe.

00:07:45.231 --> 00:07:45.732 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: They're just dead.

00:07:45.732 --> 00:07:46.566 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:07:46.566 --> 00:07:47.667 align:middle line:90%
There's a little bit of action,

00:07:47.667 --> 00:07:48.468 align:middle line:84%
and then there's an
infinite amount of time

00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:50.070 align:middle line:90%
where there's no action.

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:51.871 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like a bad
movie, doesn't it?

00:07:51.871 --> 00:07:54.007 align:middle line:90%
And that's all there is to it.

00:07:54.007 --> 00:07:55.241 align:middle line:90%
And it happens all the time.

00:07:55.241 --> 00:07:56.710 align:middle line:90%
It would be interesting.

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:57.377 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It would be.

00:07:57.377 --> 00:07:58.645 align:middle line:90%
That's fascinating.

00:07:58.645 --> 00:08:01.081 align:middle line:84%
And then you add in
the life equation.

00:08:01.081 --> 00:08:02.482 align:middle line:90%
What the heck is it?

00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:03.316 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yeah.

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:04.417 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: What does it all mean?

00:08:04.417 --> 00:08:06.019 align:middle line:84%
I mean, here we are
talking to each other.

00:08:06.019 --> 00:08:07.921 align:middle line:90%
What's it all about, Alphie?

00:08:07.921 --> 00:08:08.988 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yes.

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:10.223 align:middle line:84%
I don't think Alphie
ever figured it out.

00:08:10.223 --> 00:08:12.325 align:middle line:90%
I don't think -- you know,

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:14.794 align:middle line:84%
this is up to you
and the Lord, George.

00:08:14.794 --> 00:08:17.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, honestly it is, because
on the one hand you can say

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:18.431 align:middle line:90%
that we're here for a purpose.

00:08:18.431 --> 00:08:19.966 align:middle line:90%
And that's one point of view.

00:08:19.966 --> 00:08:20.900 align:middle line:90%
And then maybe we are.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:21.667 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And a good point.

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:22.301 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yeah.

00:08:22.301 --> 00:08:23.303 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: I think.

00:08:23.303 --> 00:08:24.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: That's
one point of view.

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:26.772 align:middle line:84%
The other -- but then again,
you've got to ask, you know,

00:08:26.772 --> 00:08:28.742 align:middle line:84%
are the opossums here
for a purpose, too?

00:08:28.742 --> 00:08:31.411 align:middle line:84%
And you know, they're probably
asking themselves that question.

00:08:31.411 --> 00:08:32.879 align:middle line:84%
Or you could say, look,
you know, we're just a bit

00:08:32.879 --> 00:08:34.647 align:middle line:84%
of dirty chemistry
that happens to go on,

00:08:34.647 --> 00:08:35.949 align:middle line:90%
self-organizing chemistry.

00:08:35.949 --> 00:08:37.183 align:middle line:90%
And you know, it does its think.

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:38.151 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Which I won't accept.

00:08:38.151 --> 00:08:38.985 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yeah, well.

00:08:38.985 --> 00:08:40.186 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: I can't accept that.

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:41.153 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Yeah, nobody
knows any more than that.

00:08:41.153 --> 00:08:42.188 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we don't know.

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:43.723 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I mean,
you're a scientist.

00:08:43.723 --> 00:08:48.962 align:middle line:84%
Do you struggle between
accepting the chemistry theory

00:08:48.962 --> 00:08:51.631 align:middle line:84%
and the intelligent
design theory?

00:08:51.631 --> 00:08:53.266 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Well, I don't
have a great deal of sympathy

00:08:53.266 --> 00:08:55.468 align:middle line:84%
for intelligent design
because it seems

00:08:55.468 --> 00:08:58.004 align:middle line:84%
that you can explain all of
the evolution on earth or the,

00:08:58.004 --> 00:09:00.940 align:middle line:84%
you know, species we
have, even the beginnings

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:05.044 align:middle line:84%
of life just using
the laws of nature.

00:09:05.044 --> 00:09:08.815 align:middle line:84%
And if you can do that, then I'm
kind of reticent to say, well,

00:09:08.815 --> 00:09:11.885 align:middle line:84%
let's just throw all that out
and we'll just invoke, you know,

00:09:11.885 --> 00:09:13.153 align:middle line:90%
there was intelligent design.

00:09:13.153 --> 00:09:15.288 align:middle line:90%
Something designed this, okay?

00:09:15.288 --> 00:09:16.623 align:middle line:84%
But does that mean
that, you know,

00:09:16.623 --> 00:09:18.658 align:middle line:84%
you don't believe
in God or religion?

00:09:18.658 --> 00:09:20.794 align:middle line:84%
And that's a different
question, actually.

00:09:20.794 --> 00:09:25.331 align:middle line:84%
And it's -- yeah, it's tough
to try and find what you --

00:09:25.331 --> 00:09:26.599 align:middle line:84%
you know, how you
reconcile that.

00:09:26.599 --> 00:09:28.701 align:middle line:84%
And I can't say that
I've been successful.

00:09:28.701 --> 00:09:31.538 align:middle line:84%
But you know, I tend
to trust science

00:09:31.538 --> 00:09:35.141 align:middle line:84%
because when science is wrong,
usually science corrects itself.

00:09:35.141 --> 00:09:37.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Say I'd like to know
how this little tiny particles

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:42.515 align:middle line:84%
and organisms and little amoebas
and molecules all got together

00:09:42.515 --> 00:09:44.818 align:middle line:84%
to begin to form
us, for example.

00:09:44.818 --> 00:09:46.186 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yeah.

00:09:46.186 --> 00:09:47.921 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can -- I mean, that's
a question you could answer.

00:09:47.921 --> 00:09:49.322 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you say
look, I'm just going

00:09:49.322 --> 00:09:51.858 align:middle line:84%
to give you a whole
bunch of potions

00:09:51.858 --> 00:09:54.027 align:middle line:90%
with single-celled organisms.

00:09:54.027 --> 00:09:56.129 align:middle line:84%
And you know, will
it ever be the case

00:09:56.129 --> 00:09:58.531 align:middle line:84%
that eventually they start
sticking to one another

00:09:58.531 --> 00:09:59.833 align:middle line:90%
or engulfing one another?

00:09:59.833 --> 00:10:01.534 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Or multiplying and
doing this and doing that.

00:10:01.534 --> 00:10:04.537 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Yeah, and then you
get something a little more

00:10:04.537 --> 00:10:05.905 align:middle line:90%
complex and so forth and so on.

00:10:05.905 --> 00:10:07.273 align:middle line:90%
Well, that happened.

00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:11.511 align:middle line:84%
You know, for the first 4 --
or 3 1/2 billion years of life

00:10:11.511 --> 00:10:12.579 align:middle line:90%
on earth, there was nothing

00:10:12.579 --> 00:10:14.113 align:middle line:84%
that you could see
without a microscope.

00:10:14.113 --> 00:10:15.148 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they were
all single-celled.

00:10:15.148 --> 00:10:17.584 align:middle line:84%
And eventually they
did get together.

00:10:17.584 --> 00:10:20.086 align:middle line:84%
And that suggests that
if you wait long enough,

00:10:20.086 --> 00:10:21.488 align:middle line:90%
it might happen.

00:10:21.488 --> 00:10:23.456 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: But look
at the design.

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:27.060 align:middle line:84%
Who would come up with this
instrument called the human body

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.963 align:middle line:84%
that would give you a couple
eyes so you could see all

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:33.333 align:middle line:84%
around you, that would give you
a nose so you could smell all

00:10:33.333 --> 00:10:35.468 align:middle line:84%
around you, that would give you
ears so you could hear things,

00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:36.870 align:middle line:84%
that would give you a
mouth so you could talk

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:38.671 align:middle line:90%
and communicate and eat?

00:10:38.671 --> 00:10:40.940 align:middle line:84%
Who in the heck would come
up with something like that?

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.542 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Well, I
think you're suggesting

00:10:42.542 --> 00:10:43.676 align:middle line:90%
that it was designed that way.

00:10:43.676 --> 00:10:45.011 align:middle line:84%
And if it's true,
then they ought

00:10:45.011 --> 00:10:49.015 align:middle line:84%
to revoke the engineering
license because we barely work.

00:10:49.015 --> 00:10:50.884 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I wouldn't have
believed that when I was a kid.

00:10:50.884 --> 00:10:53.019 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, at a certain age
you realize you barely work.

00:10:53.019 --> 00:10:54.420 align:middle line:90%
The design is all --

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.855 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: What I mean, is -- but
look at the parts that function.

00:10:55.855 --> 00:10:56.856 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Yeah,
they barely function.

00:10:56.856 --> 00:10:57.690 align:middle line:90%
I mean, your eyes really --

00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:58.758 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: You think.

00:10:58.758 --> 00:11:00.093 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Yeah, your
eye's not so good.

00:11:00.093 --> 00:11:01.828 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've got that, you
know, the optic nerve comes

00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:03.396 align:middle line:84%
out on your retina,
right in front there.

00:11:03.396 --> 00:11:04.097 align:middle line:90%
That's terrible.

00:11:04.097 --> 00:11:05.465 align:middle line:90%
It makes a blind spot.

00:11:05.465 --> 00:11:06.399 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Well, maybe we're
still going through this change.

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:07.567 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Well,
I'm sure we are.

00:11:07.567 --> 00:11:09.402 align:middle line:84%
But I will point out
that eyes, for example --

00:11:09.402 --> 00:11:11.571 align:middle line:84%
I mean, eyes are very useful
if you're a living critter,

00:11:11.571 --> 00:11:13.039 align:middle line:84%
particularly if you're
an animal.

00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:14.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: No question.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.676 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Plants don't need
to go chase down their dinner.

00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:18.311 align:middle line:84%
But if you're an animal,
you do need to chase

00:11:18.311 --> 00:11:19.846 align:middle line:90%
down your dinner in many cases.

00:11:19.846 --> 00:11:21.214 align:middle line:90%
And so eyes really help.

00:11:21.214 --> 00:11:22.815 align:middle line:84%
And they also help you avoid
being somebody else's dinner.

00:11:22.815 --> 00:11:24.183 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Could you
imagine doing this show

00:11:24.183 --> 00:11:25.718 align:middle line:90%
if your mouth wasn't there?

00:11:25.718 --> 00:11:26.853 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yeah.

00:11:26.853 --> 00:11:28.621 align:middle line:84%
Well, it would be
somewhat less interesting.

00:11:28.621 --> 00:11:29.689 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: It wouldn't
work, yeah.

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:31.157 align:middle line:90%
There's some smarts to it.

00:11:31.157 --> 00:11:32.525 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Well, I've
got to say, though,

00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:37.630 align:middle line:84%
that eyes have appeared many
different times in the history

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:39.365 align:middle line:90%
of the biology of earth.

00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:41.434 align:middle line:84%
So they were, if you
will, invented many times.

00:11:41.434 --> 00:11:42.835 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yes.

00:11:42.835 --> 00:11:44.203 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: So, you know, that
suggests, look, it's so useful

00:11:44.203 --> 00:11:46.873 align:middle line:84%
that if by accident you
produce cells that, you know,

00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:49.542 align:middle line:84%
twitch a little bit when there's
some light, that that turns

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:52.946 align:middle line:84%
out to be incrementally
valuable.

00:11:52.946 --> 00:11:54.647 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: But they have
to be in the right place.

00:11:54.647 --> 00:11:56.449 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I wouldn't
mind one behind me.

00:11:56.449 --> 00:11:57.250 align:middle line:90%
That would be nice.

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:58.551 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yeah [laughs].

00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:00.687 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Let's take another
call here for Seth Shostak

00:12:00.687 --> 00:12:02.755 align:middle line:90%
from the SETI Institute.

00:12:02.755 --> 00:12:03.623 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello Seth.

00:12:03.623 --> 00:12:04.958 align:middle line:90%
My name is Ben.

00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.493 align:middle line:84%
And I was wondering if you
could give me some information

00:12:07.493 --> 00:12:11.197 align:middle line:84%
about the millions of stars
I see in the sky each night.

00:12:11.197 --> 00:12:11.898 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: The names.

00:12:11.898 --> 00:12:13.032 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: The many --

00:12:13.032 --> 00:12:14.667 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Information
about all those stars.

00:12:14.667 --> 00:12:15.635 align:middle line:90%
How come there's so many?

00:12:15.635 --> 00:12:17.003 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: How come
there's so many?

00:12:17.003 --> 00:12:20.673 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well, it turns out that
interstellar space is pretty

00:12:20.673 --> 00:12:21.874 align:middle line:90%
good at making stars.

00:12:21.874 --> 00:12:22.909 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty fertile.

00:12:22.909 --> 00:12:24.477 align:middle line:84%
Look, the galaxy is
just a big blob --

00:12:24.477 --> 00:12:26.579 align:middle line:84%
it started out as
a big blob of gas.

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:28.047 align:middle line:84%
Now you probably don't
remember that because that was

00:12:28.047 --> 00:12:30.383 align:middle line:84%
like 13 billion years
ago, right?

00:12:30.383 --> 00:12:31.651 align:middle line:90%
This big blob of gas.

00:12:31.651 --> 00:12:34.354 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out that, you
know, just physics really.

00:12:34.354 --> 00:12:37.390 align:middle line:84%
The places where the gas
is a little bit thicker,

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:40.093 align:middle line:84%
they begin to sort of collapse
under their own weight.

00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:41.628 align:middle line:84%
And that, you know,
it sort of breaks up

00:12:41.628 --> 00:12:42.795 align:middle line:90%
and you get more collapses.

00:12:42.795 --> 00:12:44.397 align:middle line:90%
And you start making stars.

00:12:44.397 --> 00:12:45.698 align:middle line:84%
So that's how the
stars were made.

00:12:45.698 --> 00:12:48.501 align:middle line:84%
We understand that
reasonably well actually,

00:12:48.501 --> 00:12:49.969 align:middle line:90%
how stars are made.

00:12:49.969 --> 00:12:52.238 align:middle line:84%
That there's so many of them,
well, there was a lot of gas.

00:12:52.238 --> 00:12:55.108 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that, you know, the
number of stars in the part

00:12:55.108 --> 00:12:58.044 align:middle line:84%
of the universe we can see,
if you need that number

00:12:58.044 --> 00:13:02.515 align:middle line:84%
for your next cocktail party,
that's 10,000 billion billion.

00:13:02.515 --> 00:13:03.750 align:middle line:90%
10,000 billion billion.

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:07.387 align:middle line:90%
One followed by 22 zeros, okay?

00:13:07.387 --> 00:13:09.422 align:middle line:84%
That's the number
that we can see.

00:13:09.422 --> 00:13:11.591 align:middle line:84%
But of course, if you went to
that farthest galaxy and looked

00:13:11.591 --> 00:13:13.993 align:middle line:84%
out in the same direction,
you'd see more galaxies.

00:13:13.993 --> 00:13:15.461 align:middle line:90%
So, you know, the number stars

00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:17.864 align:middle line:84%
in the entire universe
could even be infinite.

00:13:17.864 --> 00:13:20.466 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Would you say
that the law of physics,

00:13:20.466 --> 00:13:21.834 align:middle line:90%
how planets are developed,

00:13:21.834 --> 00:13:24.570 align:middle line:84%
how the star systems are
developed, are all the same?

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:25.338 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: It seems to be.

00:13:25.338 --> 00:13:26.773 align:middle line:90%
And you can test that.

00:13:26.773 --> 00:13:27.674 align:middle line:90%
Astronomers can test that.

00:13:27.674 --> 00:13:29.475 align:middle line:84%
But they look at
a distant galaxy

00:13:29.475 --> 00:13:30.743 align:middle line:90%
and they look at the light.

00:13:30.743 --> 00:13:32.912 align:middle line:84%
And they can see
the light is broken

00:13:32.912 --> 00:13:34.947 align:middle line:84%
up by these what are
called spectral lines.

00:13:34.947 --> 00:13:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And so a technical story, but
it turns out, you know, oh,

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:39.886 align:middle line:84%
there's sodium and
there's, you know, calcium

00:13:39.886 --> 00:13:41.653 align:middle line:90%
and there's hydrogen and helium.

00:13:41.653 --> 00:13:42.955 align:middle line:90%
It's all the same stuff.

00:13:42.955 --> 00:13:45.158 align:middle line:84%
And it also means that the
laws of physics are the same

00:13:45.158 --> 00:13:46.859 align:middle line:84%
because those atoms are doing
the same thing up there --

00:13:46.859 --> 00:13:48.161 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: They're spinning
around the same way.

00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:49.662 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: They're doing
the same thing they do here.

00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:50.596 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Isn't that remarkable?

00:13:50.596 --> 00:13:51.698 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: It is.

00:13:51.698 --> 00:13:53.866 align:middle line:84%
It is. And it might not
have to be that way.

00:13:53.866 --> 00:13:55.468 align:middle line:84%
It might be that there
are parts of the universe

00:13:55.468 --> 00:13:56.736 align:middle line:84%
where things are a
little different,

00:13:56.736 --> 00:13:58.371 align:middle line:90%
the laws are a little different.

00:13:58.371 --> 00:13:59.939 align:middle line:84%
And it would be hard
to determine.

00:13:59.939 --> 00:14:01.607 align:middle line:90%
But one thing you can say is

00:14:01.607 --> 00:14:05.178 align:middle line:84%
if they are different somewhere
else, it's either very far away

00:14:05.178 --> 00:14:06.312 align:middle line:90%
or the difference is so small

00:14:06.312 --> 00:14:08.347 align:middle line:84%
that we can't measure
it as of today.

00:14:08.347 --> 00:14:10.917 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Some of the pictures
of space that we've seen

00:14:10.917 --> 00:14:14.187 align:middle line:84%
through Hubble, like
the Horsehead Nebula

00:14:14.187 --> 00:14:18.224 align:middle line:84%
and other things that
look like breeding pods.

00:14:18.224 --> 00:14:22.261 align:middle line:84%
They actually look like they're
breeding pods for star systems.

00:14:22.261 --> 00:14:23.062 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yes.

00:14:23.062 --> 00:14:23.696 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Is that possible?

00:14:23.696 --> 00:14:24.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yeah.

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:25.631 align:middle line:90%
No, you actually do see that.

00:14:25.631 --> 00:14:27.200 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you see these
little small little --

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.402 align:middle line:84%
they look like drops of
goo or something like that.

00:14:29.402 --> 00:14:30.536 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:14:30.536 --> 00:14:31.671 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: In my view,
they're not so small.

00:14:31.671 --> 00:14:32.839 align:middle line:84%
They might be a couple
of light years across.

00:14:32.839 --> 00:14:34.574 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, that's
trillions of miles across.

00:14:34.574 --> 00:14:36.409 align:middle line:84%
But from a distance
they look small.

00:14:36.409 --> 00:14:39.712 align:middle line:84%
And those are indeed the
birthplaces of new stars, yeah.

00:14:39.712 --> 00:14:40.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: I love it.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.547 align:middle line:90%
It's like a nesting place.

00:14:41.547 --> 00:14:42.515 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Exactly.

00:14:42.515 --> 00:14:43.583 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: One of
my favorite photos,

00:14:43.583 --> 00:14:47.019 align:middle line:84%
the deep field picture
that Hubble took.

00:14:47.019 --> 00:14:47.787 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yeah.

00:14:47.787 --> 00:14:49.021 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Of more galaxies

00:14:49.021 --> 00:14:51.124 align:middle line:84%
than you could imagine
in a little tiny dot.

00:14:51.124 --> 00:14:52.492 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yes, exactly.

00:14:52.492 --> 00:14:54.927 align:middle line:84%
The first Hubble deep field
photo was a bit of sky covered

00:14:54.927 --> 00:14:55.828 align:middle line:90%
up with a pin head, you know?

00:14:55.828 --> 00:14:57.063 align:middle line:90%
Kind of like that.

00:14:57.063 --> 00:14:59.398 align:middle line:84%
And you can see hundreds,
maybe thousands

00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:02.101 align:middle line:90%
of galaxies in there, right?

00:15:02.101 --> 00:15:03.836 align:middle line:90%
And you can just say, okay.

00:15:03.836 --> 00:15:05.772 align:middle line:84%
What if I look over
here, you know?

00:15:05.772 --> 00:15:06.873 align:middle line:84%
Will I get the same
sort of picture?

00:15:06.873 --> 00:15:07.573 align:middle line:90%
And you do.

00:15:07.573 --> 00:15:08.875 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And you do.

00:15:08.875 --> 00:15:09.842 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: And no matter
where you point the camera,

00:15:09.842 --> 00:15:11.210 align:middle line:84%
you'll see the same
sort of thing.

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:15.414 align:middle line:84%
So that means the entire sky
has, within a pinhead, you know,

00:15:15.414 --> 00:15:16.482 align:middle line:90%
thousands of galaxies.

00:15:16.482 --> 00:15:17.884 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: More than
they ever imagined.

00:15:17.884 --> 00:15:20.052 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: So that means the
number of galaxies is, again,

00:15:20.052 --> 00:15:22.488 align:middle line:84%
the ones you can see,
is like 150 billion.

00:15:22.488 --> 00:15:24.524 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: 150 billion galaxies.

00:15:24.524 --> 00:15:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Yeah, and each one
might have a trillion planets.

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:29.829 align:middle line:90%
So, those are big numbers.

00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:30.963 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: There's
a lot out there.

00:15:30.963 --> 00:15:32.665 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Yeah,
There's a lot going on.

00:15:32.665 --> 00:15:34.734 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Would you like to be
around a million years from now?

00:15:34.734 --> 00:15:36.502 align:middle line:84%
What kind of knowledge
would you have?

00:15:36.502 --> 00:15:37.837 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yeah.

00:15:37.837 --> 00:15:40.139 align:middle line:84%
You know, I wonder if my tennis
game would have gotten any

00:15:40.139 --> 00:15:40.907 align:middle line:90%
better by then.

00:15:40.907 --> 00:15:41.774 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: God, I hope so.

00:15:41.774 --> 00:15:44.177 align:middle line:90%
Based on what I hear.

00:15:44.177 --> 00:15:45.211 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: I'd certainly

00:15:45.211 --> 00:15:46.512 align:middle line:84%
like to see what's
happened, certainly.

00:15:46.512 --> 00:15:48.281 align:middle line:84%
A million years from now is
far enough into the future

00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:51.083 align:middle line:84%
that things should
be very different.

00:15:51.083 --> 00:15:53.386 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand, you know,
the earth isn't that much older.

00:15:53.386 --> 00:15:56.389 align:middle line:84%
So it isn't that the earth
has gone away or, you know,

00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:58.224 align:middle line:84%
it's been cooked by the
sun or anything like that.

00:15:58.224 --> 00:16:01.594 align:middle line:84%
It would be very interesting
to see what's happened to us,

00:16:01.594 --> 00:16:02.662 align:middle line:90%
if we're still around.

00:16:02.662 --> 00:16:03.796 align:middle line:90%
You know, the average lifetime

00:16:03.796 --> 00:16:05.932 align:middle line:84%
for a species is
roughly a million years.

00:16:05.932 --> 00:16:07.934 align:middle line:84%
So would we still
be here or not?

00:16:07.934 --> 00:16:09.335 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I'd like to know.

00:16:09.335 --> 00:16:12.471 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: What do you think our
little cousin planet Mars looked

00:16:12.471 --> 00:16:13.973 align:middle line:90%
like a long time ago?

00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:16.776 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Well, that's
a real subject of study.

00:16:16.776 --> 00:16:18.044 align:middle line:90%
In fact, a lot of my colleagues

00:16:18.044 --> 00:16:21.147 align:middle line:84%
at the SETI Institute are
trying to figure that out.

00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, that's why
these rovers are on there, too.

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:25.051 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:16:25.051 --> 00:16:26.052 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: They're not
so much to look for life.

00:16:26.052 --> 00:16:27.420 align:middle line:84%
They're not doing
that directly yet.

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:29.255 align:middle line:84%
What they're looking for is the
history because they figure,

00:16:29.255 --> 00:16:31.524 align:middle line:84%
look, Mars looks
pretty sterile now.

00:16:31.524 --> 00:16:33.426 align:middle line:90%
The atmosphere's the wrong kind.

00:16:33.426 --> 00:16:34.126 align:middle line:90%
It's very thin.

00:16:34.126 --> 00:16:35.294 align:middle line:90%
It's really cold.

00:16:35.294 --> 00:16:37.129 align:middle line:84%
It's dry, there's
dust, whatever.

00:16:37.129 --> 00:16:38.497 align:middle line:84%
There's no liquid
water on the surface.

00:16:38.497 --> 00:16:42.568 align:middle line:84%
You take that cup of water,
whatever it is, you take that,

00:16:42.568 --> 00:16:44.170 align:middle line:90%
pour onto the surface of Mars.

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:45.238 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Whatever it is.

00:16:45.238 --> 00:16:46.639 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Whatever
it is, some liquid.

00:16:46.639 --> 00:16:48.541 align:middle line:84%
And because it's mostly water --
and I'll immediately sublimate.

00:16:48.541 --> 00:16:49.675 align:middle line:90%
It'll be like dry ice.

00:16:49.675 --> 00:16:50.610 align:middle line:90%
It'll just go psht!

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:51.377 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:16:51.377 --> 00:16:52.445 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It's gone, yeah.

00:16:52.445 --> 00:16:53.379 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: But it
wasn't always that way.

00:16:53.379 --> 00:16:54.680 align:middle line:84%
We know it wasn't
always that way.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.382 align:middle line:84%
Four billion years ago
if you'd gone to Mars,

00:16:56.382 --> 00:16:58.250 align:middle line:84%
you might have seen
lakes, maybe even oceans,

00:16:58.250 --> 00:16:59.352 align:middle line:90%
rivers, things like that.

00:16:59.352 --> 00:17:00.853 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Would you
have seen vegetation?

00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:01.921 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: That's
the big question.

00:17:01.921 --> 00:17:02.922 align:middle line:90%
Would you?

00:17:02.922 --> 00:17:03.489 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:17:03.489 --> 00:17:04.257 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Maybe.

00:17:04.257 --> 00:17:05.557 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Maybe, maybe.

00:17:05.557 --> 00:17:07.493 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you know,
if like got started

00:17:07.493 --> 00:17:10.630 align:middle line:84%
on Mars before it got started
on Earth, it's conceivable,

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:12.865 align:middle line:84%
no proof for this, but it's
conceivable that, you know,

00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:15.201 align:middle line:84%
some rock got kicked off
Mars, landed on Earth,

00:17:15.201 --> 00:17:17.069 align:middle line:84%
which was sterile at the
time and infected us.

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:17.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And struck us.

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:18.905 align:middle line:90%
And it went everywhere.

00:17:18.905 --> 00:17:20.306 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: And we're
the descendants of that.

00:17:20.306 --> 00:17:22.141 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: What do you
think happened to Mars,

00:17:22.141 --> 00:17:25.244 align:middle line:84%
assuming it had an ocean,
it had an atmosphere.

00:17:25.244 --> 00:17:25.878 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:17:25.878 --> 00:17:26.712 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yeah.

00:17:26.712 --> 00:17:27.747 align:middle line:90%
Mars went bad sort of like --

00:17:27.747 --> 00:17:29.081 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It went south fast.

00:17:29.081 --> 00:17:30.182 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Yeah, it was some
of the neighborhood kids.

00:17:30.182 --> 00:17:31.550 align:middle line:90%
It went bad.

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:34.687 align:middle line:84%
And the reason it went bad,
largely, is because it's small.

00:17:34.687 --> 00:17:36.989 align:middle line:84%
So it's losing a little bit
of its atmosphere because,

00:17:36.989 --> 00:17:38.858 align:middle line:84%
you know, it doesn't have
quite as much gravity.

00:17:38.858 --> 00:17:41.694 align:middle line:84%
Also it looks like some
big rock sailed by Mars,

00:17:41.694 --> 00:17:43.563 align:middle line:84%
just like a rock slammed
into the Earth [inaudible].

00:17:43.563 --> 00:17:45.765 align:middle line:84%
Some rock sailed by Mars
and sort of striped a lot

00:17:45.765 --> 00:17:46.999 align:middle line:90%
of the atmosphere away.

00:17:46.999 --> 00:17:49.468 align:middle line:90%
But fundamentally, it was small.

00:17:49.468 --> 00:17:52.004 align:middle line:84%
It was losing its atmosphere,
and also, because it's small,

00:17:52.004 --> 00:17:54.307 align:middle line:84%
it didn't have as
much internal heat.

00:17:54.307 --> 00:17:55.975 align:middle line:84%
You know, the Earth is
still warm from its birth.

00:17:55.975 --> 00:17:56.609 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: That's right.

00:17:56.609 --> 00:17:57.643 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Right?

00:17:57.643 --> 00:17:59.011 align:middle line:84%
You go down into a
mine, it gets warm.

00:17:59.011 --> 00:18:00.513 align:middle line:84%
You go down a hundred miles and
it becomes, you know, the --

00:18:00.513 --> 00:18:01.147 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It's hot.

00:18:01.147 --> 00:18:01.847 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yeah!

00:18:01.847 --> 00:18:03.215 align:middle line:90%
It's really hot, okay?

00:18:03.215 --> 00:18:06.185 align:middle line:84%
And that's what drives plate
tectonics, produces volcanoes.

00:18:06.185 --> 00:18:08.254 align:middle line:84%
And those volcanoes are
belching up, you know,

00:18:08.254 --> 00:18:10.156 align:middle line:90%
gases from the inside, right?

00:18:10.156 --> 00:18:12.124 align:middle line:84%
So we keep replenishing
our atmosphere

00:18:12.124 --> 00:18:13.526 align:middle line:90%
with something, anyhow.

00:18:13.526 --> 00:18:14.794 align:middle line:90%
Well Mars stopped doing that.

00:18:14.794 --> 00:18:15.895 align:middle line:90%
I mean, Mars had volcanoes.

00:18:15.895 --> 00:18:17.797 align:middle line:84%
There are big volcanic
cones on Mars.

00:18:17.797 --> 00:18:20.199 align:middle line:84%
But there's been no action
there for a really long time.

00:18:20.199 --> 00:18:22.168 align:middle line:84%
So, and that's just
because it was small,

00:18:22.168 --> 00:18:23.669 align:middle line:90%
didn't have so much heat.

00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:26.839 align:middle line:84%
And if it had, you know, a
bigger -- if had been bigger,

00:18:26.839 --> 00:18:28.074 align:middle line:90%
if Mars had only been --

00:18:28.074 --> 00:18:29.208 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: It might
have been like us.

00:18:29.208 --> 00:18:30.476 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Hadn't been
the runt of the litter,

00:18:30.476 --> 00:18:31.444 align:middle line:90%
it might have done better.

00:18:31.444 --> 00:18:32.511 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Interesting.

00:18:32.511 --> 00:18:33.646 align:middle line:84%
Let's take another
question for you Seth.

00:18:33.646 --> 00:18:34.547 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:18:34.547 --> 00:18:35.114 align:middle line:90%
Listen in.

00:18:35.114 --> 00:18:35.748 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello Seth.

00:18:35.748 --> 00:18:36.882 align:middle line:90%
This is Don.

00:18:36.882 --> 00:18:39.352 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to know if
we have definitive proof

00:18:39.352 --> 00:18:42.488 align:middle line:90%
that ET life exists among us?

00:18:42.488 --> 00:18:45.124 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Well, another
good question for you.

00:18:45.124 --> 00:18:46.325 align:middle line:90%
A believer.

00:18:46.325 --> 00:18:49.462 align:middle line:84%
He believes that there
is ET life, but not here.

00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:51.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Yeah, well, he
wants to know if we have

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:53.299 align:middle line:84%
that definitive -- look,
all I can say to that,

00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:55.368 align:middle line:84%
you know that I'm
skeptical they're visiting.

00:18:55.368 --> 00:18:56.602 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Absolutely.

00:18:56.602 --> 00:18:57.937 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: And if they
were here, if they were sort

00:18:57.937 --> 00:19:00.039 align:middle line:84%
of like Men in Black, you
know, they were, I don't know,

00:19:00.039 --> 00:19:02.708 align:middle line:84%
selling contraband cigarettes
on the streets of New York.

00:19:02.708 --> 00:19:05.845 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if they had --
obviously, you know,

00:19:05.845 --> 00:19:07.780 align:middle line:84%
we would probably
stop doing SETI.

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:09.649 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it would be
much more interesting

00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:11.817 align:middle line:84%
to find the aliens here
than to find out --

00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:12.885 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Wouldn't have
to listen for them.

00:19:12.885 --> 00:19:13.919 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Yeah,
you listen for them

00:19:13.919 --> 00:19:15.488 align:middle line:84%
from 500 light years
away or something.

00:19:15.488 --> 00:19:18.391 align:middle line:84%
So I think that that evidence
is just not good enough.

00:19:18.391 --> 00:19:20.126 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a lot of
people believe it is.

00:19:20.126 --> 00:19:21.494 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not one of them.

00:19:21.494 --> 00:19:23.496 align:middle line:84%
And you haven't convinced many
scientists, I have to say.

00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:26.599 align:middle line:84%
The usual thing I get
when I point that out is,

00:19:26.599 --> 00:19:28.100 align:middle line:84%
people say you guys,
you scientists,

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.002 align:middle line:90%
you have closed minds.

00:19:30.002 --> 00:19:33.105 align:middle line:84%
Or, there is good evidence,
but, you know, it's stacked

00:19:33.105 --> 00:19:34.473 align:middle line:90%
up by the government somewhere.

00:19:34.473 --> 00:19:36.375 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Would you be in shock
if we found definitive proof

00:19:36.375 --> 00:19:39.111 align:middle line:84%
that said that they were here,
they helped build the pyramids,

00:19:39.111 --> 00:19:41.180 align:middle line:84%
they did all these
other wonderful things?

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.381 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yeah.

00:19:42.381 --> 00:19:43.582 align:middle line:84%
I get that a lot about the
pyramids, I have to say.

00:19:43.582 --> 00:19:45.584 align:middle line:84%
And the first time I was
in Australia giving a talk

00:19:45.584 --> 00:19:46.652 align:middle line:84%
and some guy in the
audience said:

00:19:46.652 --> 00:19:47.853 align:middle line:84%
So who do you think
built the pyramids?

00:19:47.853 --> 00:19:50.456 align:middle line:84%
I was so stunned that I
turned around and I said:

00:19:50.456 --> 00:19:51.357 align:middle line:84%
Who do you think
built the pyramids?

00:19:51.357 --> 00:19:52.658 align:middle line:90%
He said: Well, aliens.

00:19:52.658 --> 00:19:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And I said: Well, I've
got this radical theory.

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.228 align:middle line:84%
I think they were built
by Egyptians, right?

00:19:56.228 --> 00:19:57.196 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: [Inaudible].

00:19:57.196 --> 00:19:57.897 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: [Inaudible]
Yes, he's --

00:19:57.897 --> 00:19:59.298 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Whoever he is.

00:19:59.298 --> 00:20:02.635 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: I was going to say,
he's made a career out of that.

00:20:02.635 --> 00:20:06.572 align:middle line:84%
But I have to say that these
people were not stupid.

00:20:06.572 --> 00:20:09.575 align:middle line:84%
And in stacking limestone blocks
on the planes outside of Cairo,

00:20:09.575 --> 00:20:10.943 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you can do that.

00:20:10.943 --> 00:20:11.644 align:middle line:90%
And they could do that.

00:20:11.644 --> 00:20:12.845 align:middle line:90%
They could do that.

00:20:12.845 --> 00:20:14.246 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think that
that's very good evidence.

00:20:14.246 --> 00:20:17.717 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think if they
were really here, right,

00:20:17.717 --> 00:20:20.252 align:middle line:84%
you would have, I know, things
like this would happen to you.

00:20:20.252 --> 00:20:22.154 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know, I was just
at the airport yesterday.

00:20:22.154 --> 00:20:23.456 align:middle line:84%
And you're sitting
there in the plane

00:20:23.456 --> 00:20:26.025 align:middle line:84%
and occasionally the pilot
would come on and say:

00:20:26.025 --> 00:20:27.426 align:middle line:90%
You know, well, look Seth.

00:20:27.426 --> 00:20:29.261 align:middle line:84%
There's some unidentified craft
in the area -- Well, not Seth.

00:20:29.261 --> 00:20:30.596 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: It's going
to gobble us up.

00:20:30.596 --> 00:20:31.997 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Well, we don't
know what they're going to do.

00:20:31.997 --> 00:20:34.200 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't file a flight
plan so the FAA says we've got

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:37.269 align:middle line:84%
to stay here at the gate for a
while until they clear the area.

00:20:37.269 --> 00:20:38.671 align:middle line:90%
Never happens.

00:20:38.671 --> 00:20:40.072 align:middle line:90%
Never happens.

00:20:40.072 --> 00:20:41.874 align:middle line:84%
When you have real
invasions like,

00:20:41.874 --> 00:20:44.009 align:middle line:84%
well the Spaniards
invading Peru.

00:20:44.009 --> 00:20:46.278 align:middle line:84%
You know, the Incas
weren't in doubt

00:20:46.278 --> 00:20:48.848 align:middle line:84%
about whether they
were being invaded.

00:20:48.848 --> 00:20:50.382 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Let's take
another question for Seth.

00:20:50.382 --> 00:20:51.383 align:middle line:90%
They keep rolling in.

00:20:51.383 --> 00:20:53.285 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:20:53.285 --> 00:20:53.853 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi Seth.

00:20:53.853 --> 00:20:54.987 align:middle line:90%
This is Terry.

00:20:54.987 --> 00:20:57.990 align:middle line:84%
I was wondering how the
Milky Way came to be.

00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:58.958 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:20:58.958 --> 00:21:00.659 align:middle line:84%
How did the Milky
Way come to be?

00:21:00.659 --> 00:21:01.193 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yeah?

00:21:01.193 --> 00:21:01.894 align:middle line:90%
Our galaxy.

00:21:01.894 --> 00:21:02.928 align:middle line:90%
Well, I mean, that's --

00:21:02.928 --> 00:21:04.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: How did
galaxies come to be?

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:06.866 align:middle line:84%
Why are they all spread
around all over the place?

00:21:06.866 --> 00:21:09.802 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: One of the big
research questions in astronomy.

00:21:09.802 --> 00:21:12.438 align:middle line:84%
You could get a grant from the
National Science Foundation

00:21:12.438 --> 00:21:14.974 align:middle line:84%
to study that, George,
if you want.

00:21:14.974 --> 00:21:16.976 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just in very crude
terms, what we think is --

00:21:16.976 --> 00:21:18.043 align:middle line:90%
okay, there's a Big Bang.

00:21:18.043 --> 00:21:19.945 align:middle line:90%
It blows out all this stuff.

00:21:19.945 --> 00:21:20.880 align:middle line:90%
It's very hot.

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.715 align:middle line:84%
The early moments
of the universe,

00:21:22.715 --> 00:21:24.884 align:middle line:84%
the first three minutes,
the whole universe is

00:21:24.884 --> 00:21:26.952 align:middle line:84%
like the inside of
an H bomb, you know?

00:21:26.952 --> 00:21:28.020 align:middle line:90%
Not great.

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:29.188 align:middle line:84%
Okay. But then eventually
it cools off.

00:21:29.188 --> 00:21:30.523 align:middle line:84%
And after a couple
hundred thousand years,

00:21:30.523 --> 00:21:31.924 align:middle line:90%
you get atoms and so forth.

00:21:31.924 --> 00:21:33.192 align:middle line:90%
And so you have all these clouds

00:21:33.192 --> 00:21:36.195 align:middle line:84%
of material, stuff,
matter, okay?

00:21:36.195 --> 00:21:39.498 align:middle line:84%
And because it's not exactly
perfectly uniform, you know,

00:21:39.498 --> 00:21:40.466 align:middle line:90%
it's a little clumpier --

00:21:40.466 --> 00:21:41.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Clumpy
here, clumpy there.

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:42.835 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: And a
little clumpy there.

00:21:42.835 --> 00:21:45.504 align:middle line:84%
And those clumps begin to
form big clusters of galaxies,

00:21:45.504 --> 00:21:47.973 align:middle line:84%
which also then sort
of sub-clump.

00:21:47.973 --> 00:21:50.543 align:middle line:84%
And those fall in on themselves
and they produce starts

00:21:50.543 --> 00:21:51.710 align:middle line:90%
and things we call galaxies.

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:53.045 align:middle line:84%
Because once you
start that, you know,

00:21:53.045 --> 00:21:55.948 align:middle line:84%
they hold the whole thing
together with gravity.

00:21:55.948 --> 00:21:57.917 align:middle line:84%
I mean, galaxies are just
held together by gravity.

00:21:57.917 --> 00:22:00.052 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: So you
think what they were,

00:22:00.052 --> 00:22:01.987 align:middle line:90%
they're remnant of the Big Bang.

00:22:01.987 --> 00:22:02.655 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yes.

00:22:02.655 --> 00:22:03.689 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: In clumps.

00:22:03.689 --> 00:22:05.057 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yes.

00:22:05.057 --> 00:22:07.960 align:middle line:84%
The galaxies are the result
of clumpiness in the Big Bang.

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.562 align:middle line:90%
And that's a problem because --

00:22:09.562 --> 00:22:10.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Lots of
clumps out there.

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:12.398 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: You need to have
clumps right at the beginning

00:22:12.398 --> 00:22:14.567 align:middle line:84%
of the Big Bang, You
know, the first fraction

00:22:14.567 --> 00:22:16.435 align:middle line:84%
of a second, you
need clumpiness.

00:22:16.435 --> 00:22:17.536 align:middle line:90%
And it's very tiny.

00:22:17.536 --> 00:22:18.837 align:middle line:90%
It's very hot and you sort

00:22:18.837 --> 00:22:20.506 align:middle line:84%
of wonder how can
you get clumpiness?

00:22:20.506 --> 00:22:22.508 align:middle line:84%
And that's, you know
that's the question.

00:22:22.508 --> 00:22:25.177 align:middle line:84%
Part of it is just due to what's
called the uncertainty principle

00:22:25.177 --> 00:22:27.646 align:middle line:84%
in physics that, you know,
not everything can be

00:22:27.646 --> 00:22:30.149 align:middle line:84%
in the same place at the same --
I mean, you can't have uniform,

00:22:30.149 --> 00:22:32.518 align:middle line:84%
perfect uniformity,
apparently you can't have.

00:22:32.518 --> 00:22:33.752 align:middle line:90%
But it's a big question.

00:22:33.752 --> 00:22:38.724 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Why are some
objects 14 billion years old

00:22:38.724 --> 00:22:41.160 align:middle line:84%
and others are 4 1/2
billion years old?

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.295 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Well, you're always
building new stuff, right?

00:22:43.295 --> 00:22:45.531 align:middle line:90%
We've seen stars that, you know,

00:22:45.531 --> 00:22:47.099 align:middle line:84%
are only a couple of
million years old.

00:22:47.099 --> 00:22:48.367 align:middle line:84%
Because, you know,
there was still --

00:22:48.367 --> 00:22:49.969 align:middle line:84%
there's still leftover
gas out there.

00:22:49.969 --> 00:22:51.637 align:middle line:90%
It hasn't all be used up.

00:22:51.637 --> 00:22:52.972 align:middle line:90%
Not by a long shot.

00:22:52.972 --> 00:22:55.140 align:middle line:84%
Most of it's still out there
leftover from the Big Bang.

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:57.142 align:middle line:84%
And it still clumps
and makes new stars.

00:22:57.142 --> 00:22:59.945 align:middle line:84%
So you can find stars
that are very young,

00:22:59.945 --> 00:23:01.881 align:middle line:84%
in astronomical terms, a
couple of million years.

00:23:01.881 --> 00:23:04.383 align:middle line:84%
There was just a planet
found recently wandering

00:23:04.383 --> 00:23:05.718 align:middle line:90%
between the stars.

00:23:05.718 --> 00:23:08.554 align:middle line:84%
And that planet's probably
only about a million years old.

00:23:08.554 --> 00:23:13.158 align:middle line:84%
Our sun and the eight, now,
planets, around our sun,

00:23:13.158 --> 00:23:14.793 align:middle line:84%
they were all formed more
or less at the same time,

00:23:14.793 --> 00:23:16.428 align:middle line:90%
4 1/2 billion years ago.

00:23:16.428 --> 00:23:18.130 align:middle line:84%
So we're the new
kids on the block.

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:21.367 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Now, will there
be other star systems born a

00:23:21.367 --> 00:23:23.002 align:middle line:90%
billion years from now?

00:23:23.002 --> 00:23:24.069 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yes, yes.

00:23:24.069 --> 00:23:26.872 align:middle line:84%
You'll still be making
stars for a while.

00:23:26.872 --> 00:23:28.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Will it ever stop.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.875 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yes, it does stop.

00:23:29.875 --> 00:23:31.744 align:middle line:90%
That's the bad news.

00:23:31.744 --> 00:23:32.878 align:middle line:84%
The good news is
there's [inaudible]--

00:23:32.878 --> 00:23:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: When it
stops, is that it for us?

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.282 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Well, yes.

00:23:36.282 --> 00:23:40.352 align:middle line:84%
I mean, not -- for us, that's
going to take tens of billions

00:23:40.352 --> 00:23:41.687 align:middle line:90%
of years before you start

00:23:41.687 --> 00:23:43.756 align:middle line:84%
to really slow the
rate of star formation.

00:23:43.756 --> 00:23:45.157 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Okay.

00:23:45.157 --> 00:23:46.525 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: And eventually after
a hundred billion or, you know,

00:23:46.525 --> 00:23:49.061 align:middle line:84%
a trillion years, essentially
no new stars are being made.

00:23:49.061 --> 00:23:50.496 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And the universe dies.

00:23:50.496 --> 00:23:53.232 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: The stars all burn
out, so it gets dark, right?

00:23:53.232 --> 00:23:55.534 align:middle line:84%
Our sun is going to turn
into a charcoal briquette.

00:23:55.534 --> 00:23:56.669 align:middle line:90%
I mean, a big one.

00:23:56.669 --> 00:23:58.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: In about five
billion years, right?

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:00.139 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Well, it begins the
process in five billion years.

00:24:00.139 --> 00:24:01.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I used to worry about
that, by the way, in school.

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:02.875 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Well, you could.

00:24:02.875 --> 00:24:03.442 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: I was.

00:24:03.442 --> 00:24:04.543 align:middle line:90%
I was scared.

00:24:04.543 --> 00:24:05.944 align:middle line:84%
My teacher would say
the sun's going to burn

00:24:05.944 --> 00:24:07.713 align:middle line:90%
out in five billion years.

00:24:07.713 --> 00:24:10.482 align:middle line:90%
And I'd go home crying.

00:24:10.482 --> 00:24:12.651 align:middle line:90%
It was not a good feeling.

00:24:12.651 --> 00:24:13.852 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: I hope
you don't continue

00:24:13.852 --> 00:24:15.688 align:middle line:84%
to send this teacher
Christmas cards.

00:24:15.688 --> 00:24:16.555 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: No, he's passed on.

00:24:16.555 --> 00:24:17.389 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Oh, okay.

00:24:17.389 --> 00:24:18.223 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: He's in the hereafter.

00:24:18.223 --> 00:24:19.458 align:middle line:90%
He's now part of coast to coast.

00:24:19.458 --> 00:24:21.093 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yeah, okay.

00:24:21.093 --> 00:24:22.161 align:middle line:90%
Well, yes.

00:24:22.161 --> 00:24:23.696 align:middle line:84%
But that's really
going to happen.

00:24:23.696 --> 00:24:25.864 align:middle line:84%
But you know, it isn't
the end of everything.

00:24:25.864 --> 00:24:28.300 align:middle line:90%
I mean, things still happen.

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:32.104 align:middle line:84%
But people have worked out
sort of how long does that go

00:24:32.104 --> 00:24:34.173 align:middle line:90%
on before nothing more happens.

00:24:34.173 --> 00:24:38.477 align:middle line:84%
Because there comes a
point after a google years.

00:24:38.477 --> 00:24:41.480 align:middle line:84%
So that's a one followed
by a hundred zeros.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.147 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Zeros.

00:24:42.147 --> 00:24:42.981 align:middle line:90%
That's a long time.

00:24:42.981 --> 00:24:44.216 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: That's a big number.

00:24:44.216 --> 00:24:46.018 align:middle line:90%
That's a very long time.

00:24:46.018 --> 00:24:48.587 align:middle line:84%
But after that, then the
last of the black holes,

00:24:48.587 --> 00:24:51.190 align:middle line:84%
really big black holes, they
evaporate and that's it.

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:53.125 align:middle line:90%
And after that, nothing happens.

00:24:53.125 --> 00:24:54.993 align:middle line:84%
There's not enough energy
in the universe anywhere

00:24:54.993 --> 00:24:57.062 align:middle line:84%
that you can get it together
and roast a marshmallow.

00:24:57.062 --> 00:24:58.263 align:middle line:90%
I mean, nothing's happening.

00:24:58.263 --> 00:24:59.531 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And then we move
on to the next universe.

00:24:59.531 --> 00:25:01.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: No, our
universe stays there.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.801 align:middle line:90%
It's still expanding.

00:25:02.801 --> 00:25:04.036 align:middle line:90%
It may even be accelerating.

00:25:04.036 --> 00:25:05.037 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Will it go dark?

00:25:05.037 --> 00:25:05.971 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: It is dark.

00:25:05.971 --> 00:25:08.007 align:middle line:84%
It's just a soup
of cold particles.

00:25:08.007 --> 00:25:08.841 align:middle line:90%
Everything is dark.

00:25:08.841 --> 00:25:10.642 align:middle line:90%
Nothing's happening anywhere.

00:25:10.642 --> 00:25:12.010 align:middle line:84%
You can look everywhere
for a party.

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:12.745 align:middle line:90%
There are not parties.

00:25:12.745 --> 00:25:13.812 align:middle line:90%
There's none.

00:25:13.812 --> 00:25:15.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: So the sun,
would sun be there

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:17.483 align:middle line:84%
in shape even though
it would be burned out?

00:25:17.483 --> 00:25:19.351 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Probably it
will have worked its way

00:25:19.351 --> 00:25:21.754 align:middle line:84%
into a big black hole in the
center of the galaxy by then.

00:25:21.754 --> 00:25:24.390 align:middle line:84%
If not, it's just a
lump of coal, mostly.

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:25.057 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:25:25.057 --> 00:25:25.557 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yeah.

00:25:25.557 --> 00:25:26.525 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:25:26.525 --> 00:25:27.593 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: But dark,
totally dark.

00:25:27.593 --> 00:25:28.861 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Dark,
dark, dark, dark, dark.

00:25:28.861 --> 00:25:30.129 align:middle line:90%
You don't get to see anything.

00:25:30.129 --> 00:25:31.063 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And you
can't see anything.

00:25:31.063 --> 00:25:32.164 align:middle line:90%
It's like closing your eyes.

00:25:32.164 --> 00:25:33.165 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Well, you
know, you could look

00:25:33.165 --> 00:25:35.167 align:middle line:84%
for a little bit
of residual heat.

00:25:35.167 --> 00:25:38.036 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, the universe has
expanded so much that, you know,

00:25:38.036 --> 00:25:40.839 align:middle line:90%
you can't see galaxies nearby.

00:25:40.839 --> 00:25:43.041 align:middle line:84%
The galaxies themselves
have all collided.

00:25:43.041 --> 00:25:45.144 align:middle line:84%
The stars have collided and made
a big black hole in the center.

00:25:45.144 --> 00:25:46.245 align:middle line:90%
So they're just big black holes.

00:25:46.245 --> 00:25:47.112 align:middle line:90%
And then they evaporate.

00:25:47.112 --> 00:25:49.081 align:middle line:90%
And then it's just this swoop,

00:25:49.081 --> 00:25:53.685 align:middle line:84%
a soup of very tiny
particles not doing much.

00:25:53.685 --> 00:25:55.821 align:middle line:84%
But the thing about
that is, you might say,

00:25:55.821 --> 00:25:57.089 align:middle line:90%
that's kind of boring.

00:25:57.089 --> 00:25:58.891 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, what
happens after that?

00:25:58.891 --> 00:26:00.025 align:middle line:90%
Nothing happens after that.

00:26:00.025 --> 00:26:02.828 align:middle line:84%
It stays that way, not
just for a billion years

00:26:02.828 --> 00:26:05.230 align:middle line:84%
or a trillion years
or a gazillion years.

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:07.266 align:middle line:84%
It stays that way
forever, expanding.

00:26:07.266 --> 00:26:08.467 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:26:08.467 --> 00:26:10.302 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: So here's the
history of the cosmos.

00:26:10.302 --> 00:26:11.537 align:middle line:90%
This Big Bang -- Bam!

00:26:11.537 --> 00:26:14.373 align:middle line:84%
You know, a hundred billion
years of stars, planets,

00:26:14.373 --> 00:26:15.407 align:middle line:90%
late night radio, whatever.

00:26:15.407 --> 00:26:18.544 align:middle line:84%
And then there's an
infinity forever,

00:26:18.544 --> 00:26:20.212 align:middle line:90%
forever, of nothingness.

00:26:20.212 --> 00:26:21.113 align:middle line:90%
So it's pssht!

00:26:21.113 --> 00:26:22.481 align:middle line:90%
Infinity of nothingness.

00:26:22.481 --> 00:26:25.117 align:middle line:84%
You've got to ask yourself,
so what's the point of that?

00:26:25.117 --> 00:26:27.186 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Does it ever
contract and blow up again?

00:26:27.186 --> 00:26:28.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: It could,
in principle.

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:30.055 align:middle line:84%
But in practice, you
can look at the --

00:26:30.055 --> 00:26:32.658 align:middle line:84%
that depends on how much
stuff there is per, you know,

00:26:32.658 --> 00:26:34.526 align:middle line:84%
cubic yard or something
like that.

00:26:34.526 --> 00:26:35.761 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out
there's not enough

00:26:35.761 --> 00:26:37.830 align:middle line:84%
to suggest that's
going to happen.

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:40.532 align:middle line:84%
At the moment we'd say the
big crunch, not in our future.

00:26:40.532 --> 00:26:41.967 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Let's take
one more call for you.

00:26:41.967 --> 00:26:45.104 align:middle line:90%
Seth Shostak, last call.

00:26:45.104 --> 00:26:45.938 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi Seth.

00:26:45.938 --> 00:26:48.373 align:middle line:90%
I'm Eileen from New Hampshire.

00:26:48.373 --> 00:26:50.809 align:middle line:84%
I'm wondering if you think
that there are more planets

00:26:50.809 --> 00:26:52.911 align:middle line:84%
that have not been
discovered yet.

00:26:52.911 --> 00:26:55.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Oh, of course.

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.081 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: You bet, Eileen.

00:26:56.081 --> 00:26:57.483 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Billions
and billions more.

00:26:57.483 --> 00:26:59.151 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Oh, and
more than that even.

00:26:59.151 --> 00:27:01.386 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Well, I can
give you the numbers.

00:27:01.386 --> 00:27:03.322 align:middle line:90%
As of last night, more or less,

00:27:03.322 --> 00:27:05.858 align:middle line:84%
we found about a thousand
confirmed planets.

00:27:05.858 --> 00:27:07.759 align:middle line:84%
These are not just,
oh, the data look good.

00:27:07.759 --> 00:27:08.460 align:middle line:90%
There might a planet there.

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:09.561 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: In our galaxy?

00:27:09.561 --> 00:27:10.963 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Oh, they're
all pretty --

00:27:10.963 --> 00:27:13.832 align:middle line:84%
yeah, they're reasonably close,
within a few hundred light years

00:27:13.832 --> 00:27:15.567 align:middle line:90%
in general, in general.

00:27:15.567 --> 00:27:18.770 align:middle line:84%
NASA's Kepler spacecraft, which
has been sending down data

00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:20.172 align:middle line:90%
for the last four years,

00:27:20.172 --> 00:27:25.277 align:middle line:84%
has found at least roughly 3,000
additional planetary candidates.

00:27:25.277 --> 00:27:27.479 align:middle line:84%
They're not confirmed, but
probably 80 or 90 percent

00:27:27.479 --> 00:27:28.514 align:middle line:84%
of them will turn
out to be planets.

00:27:28.514 --> 00:27:29.982 align:middle line:84%
There are another
couple of thousand.

00:27:29.982 --> 00:27:31.350 align:middle line:90%
And there are more Kepler data.

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:32.150 align:middle line:90%
Kepler itself is --

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:32.784 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: More, more, more.

00:27:32.784 --> 00:27:34.119 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yeah.

00:27:34.119 --> 00:27:37.923 align:middle line:84%
So by two years from today,
we'll say that we have found

00:27:37.923 --> 00:27:39.658 align:middle line:90%
on the order of 5,000 planets.

00:27:39.658 --> 00:27:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And you might think
that's a big number.

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:42.961 align:middle line:84%
But that's actually not
the interesting number.

00:27:42.961 --> 00:27:46.665 align:middle line:84%
The interesting number is what
fraction of stars have planets.

00:27:46.665 --> 00:27:47.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And if
that's a high percent?

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:48.634 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: And it's
a high percent --

00:27:48.634 --> 00:27:49.701 align:middle line:90%
it is a high percentage.

00:27:49.701 --> 00:27:51.003 align:middle line:84%
In fact you talk with
people who do this

00:27:51.003 --> 00:27:52.271 align:middle line:84%
for a living and
they'll tell you.

00:27:52.271 --> 00:27:54.773 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: It's the
same primordial soup.

00:27:54.773 --> 00:27:55.741 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Yeah.

00:27:55.741 --> 00:27:56.642 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: The playbook
is the same.

00:27:56.642 --> 00:27:57.743 align:middle line:90%
>> Shostak: Planets everywhere.

00:27:57.743 --> 00:27:59.945 align:middle line:84%
Planets are -- they're
like fire hydrants.

00:27:59.945 --> 00:28:00.879 align:middle line:90%
They're everywhere.

00:28:00.879 --> 00:28:02.281 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: I think it's great.

00:28:02.281 --> 00:28:04.316 align:middle line:84%
If people want more information
on SETI, what do they do, Seth?

00:28:04.316 --> 00:28:06.151 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: Well, I mean, they
can go to their local library.

00:28:06.151 --> 00:28:08.620 align:middle line:84%
Or they can go to
SETI.org on the Web.

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:09.755 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Perfect.

00:28:09.755 --> 00:28:10.522 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: That's what
[inaudible] right now.

00:28:10.522 --> 00:28:11.557 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And keep going.

00:28:11.557 --> 00:28:12.457 align:middle line:84%
You've got a good
array of telescopes.

00:28:12.457 --> 00:28:13.926 align:middle line:90%
Find the signal.

00:28:13.926 --> 00:28:15.294 align:middle line:84%
>> Shostak: I'll let
you know, George.

00:28:15.294 --> 00:28:16.795 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Seth Shostak.

00:28:16.795 --> 00:28:18.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:20.232 align:middle line:84%
You've been listening to
Beyond Belief  as we talk

00:28:20.232 --> 00:28:24.303 align:middle line:84%
and explore all the various
aspects of this universe.

00:28:24.303 --> 00:28:27.439 align:middle line:84%
And what you just heard
today is that there are more

00:28:27.439 --> 00:28:29.241 align:middle line:90%
than just one universe.

00:28:29.241 --> 00:28:32.978 align:middle line:84%
We have many, many
more right here,

00:28:32.978 --> 00:28:34.546 align:middle line:84%
somewhere out there
in the cosmos.

00:28:34.546 --> 00:28:35.981 align:middle line:90%
Seth, again, thank you so much.

00:28:35.981 --> 00:28:37.382 align:middle line:84%
It's always a pleasure
talking to you.

00:28:37.382 --> 00:28:38.784 align:middle line:90%
