00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
back to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.030 align:middle line:10%
We have heard a lot about
the Knights Templar,

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.850 align:middle line:10%
the custodians of
the Shroud of Turin,

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.550 align:middle line:10%
the custodians of the
Ark of the Covenant.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:31.970 align:middle line:90%
But who were they?

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.860 align:middle line:90%
How did they get established?

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.350 align:middle line:90%
And what happened to them?

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.394 align:middle line:84%
With us is renowned
historian Freddy Silva.

00:00:38.394 --> 00:00:40.060 align:middle line:84%
Freddy, welcome back
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.476 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY SILVA:
Thank you, George.

00:00:41.476 --> 00:00:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have a book
dedicated to the Knights

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:44.710 align:middle line:90%
Templar, don't you?

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:45.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: I do.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.070 align:middle line:10%
And it was going to
be a very small book.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.350 align:middle line:10%
And then it became a
really, really big book.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.940 align:middle line:10%
And it was really
about the origins

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.760 align:middle line:10%
of my country of birth, which,
believe it or not, is Portugal.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Of course
I sound Portuguese.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to find out
what was the relationship

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.990 align:middle line:90%
between the two.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.106 align:middle line:84%
And I had no idea
that this story

00:01:02.106 --> 00:01:03.730 align:middle line:84%
was going to take me
down a long rabbit

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.970 align:middle line:84%
hole of why the
Templars would create

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Europe's first nation-state,
which is Portugal.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.050 align:middle line:10%
And also why would they go
as far from Rome as possible

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.000 align:middle line:10%
to basically instill
something there

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.650 align:middle line:10%
that I had no idea
what it would be.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out, it was
all related to the Grail.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:22.720 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: We'll get into that.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.040 align:middle line:10%
What's the name of this book?

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: First Templar Nation.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: First Templar Nation.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.281 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Knights Templar, of
course, established by whom?

00:01:30.281 --> 00:01:31.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Well, this
is the fun part.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.880 align:middle line:84%
Most people consider them
to be part of the Crusades.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:34.680 align:middle line:90%
They were not.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.850 align:middle line:84%
They were a group of
fellows who basically

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.850 align:middle line:84%
went into Jerusalem on
the back of the Crusades

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.520 align:middle line:84%
and used the opportunity to
go and look for something

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.410 align:middle line:90%
which is already prearranged.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And I had no idea
that the person--

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.610 align:middle line:84%
the linchpin of the
whole organization

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.650 align:middle line:84%
was a man called
Bernard of Clairvaux,

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.750 align:middle line:84%
who was the head of the
Cistercian Order of monks.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what time
period are we talking about?

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.178 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: We're talking
about early 12th century

00:01:56.178 --> 00:02:00.550 align:middle line:84%
now, 1100 A.D. And
basically there

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.420 align:middle line:84%
was a small band
of men who worked

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.840 align:middle line:90%
their way into Jerusalem.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And they stayed at the
Church of the Holy Sepulcher

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.860 align:middle line:90%
for a short while.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.630 align:middle line:84%
Hugues de Payens
was one of them.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And Godfrey de Saint-Omer
was the second one.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.550 align:middle line:84%
And then something happened
where they decided,

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.550 align:middle line:84%
we really don't want to
hang out here much more.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.950 align:middle line:84%
We want to go and look for
something very, very specific.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And we need someone
to really help

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.270 align:middle line:84%
us understand what it is
that we're looking for.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
Bernard comes in.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.380 align:middle line:84%
He hand-picks most of
the original Templar

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Knights, two of which it turns
out were actually Portuguese.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.050 align:middle line:84%
But there's a third
portion of the story, which

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.940 align:middle line:84%
is a group of people who
were very, very mysterious

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.200 align:middle line:84%
and which very little is known
about called the Order of Sion,

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.010 align:middle line:84%
who actually were fundamental to
the creation of the Templars--

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.020 align:middle line:84%
along with the
Cistercian monks--

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.580 align:middle line:84%
who then allowed the Templars
to go on this secret mission

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.070 align:middle line:84%
to Temple Mount and
eventually create

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.300 align:middle line:90%
the first country of Europe.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What were
they looking for?

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.552 align:middle line:90%
Why Jerusalem, first of all?

00:02:58.552 --> 00:03:00.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Well, when you
start looking at the Templars

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.770 align:middle line:84%
and how they behaved,
they behave much more

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.200 align:middle line:84%
or less like a
magisterial college,

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.020 align:middle line:84%
as though they had a
very spiritual intent.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.510 align:middle line:84%
There is no doubt that
people had to sort of protect

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.740 align:middle line:90%
themselves back in the day.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.760 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
fighting going on.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.900 align:middle line:84%
The economy was basically
an economy of plunder.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.530 align:middle line:84%
Even monks had to learn how
to fight rather than write.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out
that they simply

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.550 align:middle line:84%
were guided by a very
spiritual principle.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.466 align:middle line:84%
They were looking for
something very specific.

00:03:26.466 --> 00:03:28.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have to understand,
first of all, that these people

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.100 align:middle line:90%
were very rich.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.692 align:middle line:90%
They were nobles in Europe.

00:03:31.692 --> 00:03:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And yet, they gave up
all of their wealth

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.280 align:middle line:84%
to go traveling 2000
miles to the Middle East,

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.770 align:middle line:84%
to labor in really hot
and dusty conditions,

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.820 align:middle line:84%
to dig tunnels on the Temple
Mount to find treasure.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:43.870 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make sense.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.880 align:middle line:84%
Why not sit at home,
keep your money,

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.330 align:middle line:90%
and avoid all the problems?

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:48.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How many were there?

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: There were actually 11.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.230 align:middle line:84%
Most people claim
that there were nine.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.330 align:middle line:90%
There were actually--

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's it?

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: That it.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.992 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Knights
Templar started at 11?

00:03:54.992 --> 00:03:56.325 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: It's amazing, isn't it?

00:03:56.325 --> 00:03:58.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I thought it was
like an army of people.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.283 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, no, no.

00:03:59.283 --> 00:04:00.760 align:middle line:90%
Those were the Crusaders.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.340 align:middle line:84%
It took me about two
years to finally sort out

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.810 align:middle line:84%
all of these different factions
and figure out who was who.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.140 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very confusing.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.509 align:middle line:84%
They all seem to get
lumped into the Crusaders.

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:11.050 align:middle line:84%
But there was actually
other factions

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.210 align:middle line:84%
like the Knights Hospitallers,
who were actually

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:14.834 align:middle line:84%
the people who were
actually protecting

00:04:14.834 --> 00:04:16.399 align:middle line:90%
the pilgrims in Jerusalem.

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And they're already 40
years ahead of the Templars.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.150 align:middle line:84%
The Templars really didn't
do any protecting at all.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.882 align:middle line:84%
They actually were sequestered
inside Temple Mount.

00:04:24.882 --> 00:04:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And they literally spent most
of their time digging tunnels

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.490 align:middle line:84%
towards a central location,
which was recently

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:31.930 align:middle line:90%
validated by archeology.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.490 align:middle line:84%
So they were looking for
something very specific

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.482 align:middle line:90%
that was hidden there.

00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And yes, they
eventually discovered

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.107 align:middle line:90%
quite a bit of gold bullion.

00:04:37.107 --> 00:04:37.906 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:04:37.906 --> 00:04:39.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: That is validated.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.890 align:middle line:84%
But the one thing that they
were very much looking for

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.370 align:middle line:90%
was scrolls.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Scrolls of what?

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Scrolls
written by the Essenes--

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.035 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:04:47.035 --> 00:04:48.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --that they
had buried there.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.870 align:middle line:84%
Because the Essenes
and the Templars--

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some of which we
found in the Dead Sea Scrolls.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.520 align:middle line:84%
And it makes you wonder
why were they buried there

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.450 align:middle line:90%
in the first place?

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.750 align:middle line:84%
It seems to-- and to
understand that, you

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.140 align:middle line:84%
have to first of all get
under the skin of Bernard

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.200 align:middle line:90%
of Clairvaux.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.300 align:middle line:90%
Why was he behind the Templars?

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.310 align:middle line:90%
What was the fundamental drive?

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.970 align:middle line:84%
And the drive was to create
a pure state of Christianity.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking about a
concept that has nothing

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.290 align:middle line:90%
to do with the Catholic Church.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.880 align:middle line:84%
This is something--
a frame of mind

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.620 align:middle line:84%
that is much more a
Buddhist construct.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:18.884 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Powerful people.

00:05:18.884 --> 00:05:19.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Very much so.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.380 align:middle line:84%
But they wanted a very pure
understanding of Christianity

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.617 align:middle line:90%
and a spiritual value.

00:05:23.617 --> 00:05:25.200 align:middle line:84%
Because they recognized
that no matter

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.990 align:middle line:84%
how much wealth you gather,
unless you take care of this

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.640 align:middle line:90%
and this, you've got nothing.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.430 align:middle line:84%
You're just basically a dead
body walking through life

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.320 align:middle line:84%
and having a very
hard experience.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.950 align:middle line:84%
They wanted a spiritual
understanding, a bigger picture

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.790 align:middle line:90%
of what it means to be human.

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost like a new age
ideal that they were following.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.980 align:middle line:10%
And in the end, yes, they
did find a lot of scrolls.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.800 align:middle line:10%
They came back to Europe
under secret guidance.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.800 align:middle line:10%
And they employed cryptographers
to actually unravel

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.850 align:middle line:10%
what was in the scrolls,
which tells me they

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.190 align:middle line:10%
had nothing to do with money.

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.090 align:middle line:84%
It had something to do
with a spiritual treasure.

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:56.673 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They needed
to find that out.

00:05:56.673 --> 00:06:00.857 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at more about
the Dead Sea Scrolls.

00:06:00.857 --> 00:06:02.440 align:middle line:84%
>>STEPHEN FRY: Well,
here in Jerusalem

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.410 align:middle line:84%
there's the aptly named
Shrine of the Book, where

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.080 align:middle line:84%
some of the most precious
religious writings

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.320 align:middle line:90%
are on display.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.820 align:middle line:84%
But even in these special and
carefully climate-controlled

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.150 align:middle line:84%
conditions, some
of the older texts

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:16.900 align:middle line:84%
are in danger of being
lost to us forever.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.410 align:middle line:90%


00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.960 align:middle line:10%
The most famous
documents displayed here

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.800 align:middle line:10%
are the Dead Sea Scrolls,
fragments of biblical texts

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.620 align:middle line:10%
and religious writings
from the time of Christ.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.500 align:middle line:10%
The Scrolls lay hidden
for nearly two millennia

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:39.220 align:middle line:10%
until a Bedouin shepherd
stumbled upon them in 1946.

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.970 align:middle line:10%
>>PNINA SHOR: They are
believed to be the discovery

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:43.550 align:middle line:10%
of the 20th century.

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.920 align:middle line:10%
We're talking about a corpus
of over 900 manuscripts,

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.050 align:middle line:10%
comprising all of the
books of the Bible.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.850 align:middle line:10%
>>FRY: Right.

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.016 align:middle line:10%
>>SHOR: And these are the
oldest copies of the Bible

00:06:54.016 --> 00:06:55.910 align:middle line:10%
that we have, 2000 years old.

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:56.710 align:middle line:10%
>>FRY: Wow.

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:57.510 align:middle line:10%
>>SHOR: We have--

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:00.060 align:middle line:10%
>>FRY: These ancient
texts are so fragile,

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.460 align:middle line:10%
that only four highly trained
researchers from the Israel

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.160 align:middle line:10%
Antiquities Authority
are allowed actually

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.470 align:middle line:10%
to handle them.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:13.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was the Bible based
on the Dead Sea Scrolls?

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:14.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Far from it, actually.

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.020 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they seem to
have actually sidelined

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.630 align:middle line:84%
everything that seemed
to be of spiritual value,

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:20.740 align:middle line:90%
true spiritual value.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And they created almost
like a shadow Bible--

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.530 align:middle line:84%
or shall I say a
selective Bible--

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.440 align:middle line:84%
based on the ideas and
ideals of a group of men

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.729 align:middle line:84%
who wanted to take
over the power vacuum

00:07:31.729 --> 00:07:33.520 align:middle line:84%
that, at that time in
Europe, had been left

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.380 align:middle line:90%
by the imploding Roman Empire.

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:38.590 align:middle line:84%
So the more important scrolls
and the more important gospels

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:41.140 align:middle line:84%
of the more spiritual
aspects about the empowerment

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:45.970 align:middle line:84%
of the self, the finding
of God within the person,

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:48.670 align:middle line:84%
not asking a bishop
or a priest to find

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:50.530 align:middle line:90%
God outside of oneself--

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:52.221 align:middle line:84%
so these are very
Buddhist ideals.

00:07:52.221 --> 00:07:54.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the Gospel
of Thomas deals with,

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:55.109 align:middle line:90%
the Gospel of Philip.

00:07:55.109 --> 00:07:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And these are all
the gnostic gospels

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:59.669 align:middle line:84%
that were found hidden away by
the Essenes, and also in Egypt.

00:07:59.669 --> 00:08:01.210 align:middle line:84%
So these people
obviously were trying

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:03.190 align:middle line:84%
to maintain a very
spiritual lineage going back

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:04.901 align:middle line:90%
at least 6,000 years.

00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the
Templars were actually

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:08.530 align:middle line:84%
trying to create and
bring back to Europe.

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:11.080 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Freddy, weren't
the Templars eventually

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:16.360 align:middle line:10%
attacked and murdered
on Friday the 13th?

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.140 align:middle line:84%
That's why we have this
bad luck day all the time.

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.260 align:middle line:90%
Didn't something happen to them?

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It was not
fun, that's for sure.

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:25.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who expunged them?

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.561 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Well, basically what
happened was the Templars

00:08:27.561 --> 00:08:31.750 align:middle line:84%
had grown very-- over the
course of about 150 years,

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:33.789 align:middle line:84%
the Templars were loved
in Europe by the people.

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:35.413 align:middle line:84%
Because they said,
well, we'll give you

00:08:35.413 --> 00:08:37.150 align:middle line:90%
protection from the church.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:39.669 align:middle line:10%
We're going to teach you a
spiritual ideal about the self.

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:42.460 align:middle line:84%
We're going to nurture your
sense of community, education,

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.150 align:middle line:84%
looking after the
poor, hospitals.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:44.950 align:middle line:90%
And the peasants--

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:45.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sounds good to me.

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:46.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:48.411 align:middle line:84%
This was like nothing
what the church

00:08:48.411 --> 00:08:49.720 align:middle line:90%
was preaching at the time.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.280 align:middle line:84%
We'll give you
anything that we have.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's how they grew rich,
by people literally donating

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.400 align:middle line:90%
money, and wealth, and land.

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.620 align:middle line:84%
And then they basically
gave them back.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:02.840 align:middle line:84%
So they create these sort of
new age communities in a sense.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.456 align:middle line:84%
So the church was
getting a little bit

00:09:04.456 --> 00:09:05.330 align:middle line:90%
concerned about this.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:06.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah.

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:07.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: But here's
the big part.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:07.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They didn't like this.

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:09.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Philip
of France was also

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:11.670 align:middle line:84%
very keen to join the inner
Templar brotherhood, who

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:15.130 align:middle line:84%
were practicing a very secret
spiritual doctrine called

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:18.400 align:middle line:84%
the raising of the dead,
which really goes back

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:19.960 align:middle line:90%
to the concept of Resurrection.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.745 align:middle line:84%
But not in the way
that we think it is.

00:09:21.745 --> 00:09:23.900 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to
do with dead people.

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.110 align:middle line:84%
So he wanted to know
more about this concept

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:27.190 align:middle line:90%
of self-empowerment.

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:30.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Templars realized
that Philip was about as honest

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:32.080 align:middle line:90%
as a $15 note.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.790 align:middle line:84%
So basically they
said, no, I'm sorry.

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:35.470 align:middle line:84%
You can't join the
inner brotherhood.

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:38.200 align:middle line:90%
So basically Philip said, OK.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to basically
tell the church that you've

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:44.040 align:middle line:84%
been honoring a devil
called Baphomet,

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.720 align:middle line:84%
that you practice all kinds
of perverse sexual acts.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:51.149 align:middle line:84%
And also, because I owe you
phenomenal amounts of money,

00:09:51.149 --> 00:09:52.690 align:middle line:84%
it means I don't
have to pay you back

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:55.120 align:middle line:84%
if the church comes by
and takes you all out.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's how the pope became
embroiled in this whole drama.

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:00.790 align:middle line:84%
The pope really
was just concerned

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:03.320 align:middle line:84%
that the Templars were taking
power away from the church.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.980 align:middle line:84%
But Philip basically
made it out to be

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.020 align:middle line:90%
much, much deeper than this.

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:09.760 align:middle line:84%
It was more like a
complete contradiction

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.130 align:middle line:90%
of Catholic values.

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:14.770 align:middle line:84%
So they basically
concocted this between them

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:17.640 align:middle line:84%
to get rid of the Templar
order on Friday the 13th.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.620 align:middle line:84%
And many of them already
had full knowledge.

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.390 align:middle line:84%
Most of them escaped to
Portugal and Scotland,

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:24.301 align:middle line:84%
and then created Scottish
Rite Freemasonry.

00:10:24.301 --> 00:10:25.300 align:middle line:90%
So they're still around.

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:29.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did they end
up being the protectors

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:31.240 align:middle line:90%
of the Shroud of Turin?

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Now, that
I'm not so sure.

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:35.200 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the
[INAUDIBLE] pieces of evidence

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.070 align:middle line:84%
I've found for the
Shroud of Turin

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:39.820 align:middle line:84%
was the fact that it's
actually the image,

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:42.010 align:middle line:84%
not of Christ, but of
Jacques de Maille, who

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:46.000 align:middle line:84%
was the Templar master at
the time of Friday the 13th.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.650 align:middle line:84%
And if you actually look at the
visage on the actual shroud,

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.250 align:middle line:84%
the features are
very modern European.

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:53.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They are.

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:54.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They are
not Semitic at all.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:54.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They
don't look Semitic.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And that's your first
clue that obviously there's

00:10:56.830 --> 00:10:58.810 align:middle line:84%
something wrong with
the perceived idea

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:00.550 align:middle line:90%
that it is the shroud of Christ.

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:03.090 align:middle line:84%
The Templars didn't
give much about Christ.

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Their person that they
revered was John the Baptist

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:07.314 align:middle line:90%
and Mary Magdalene.

00:11:07.314 --> 00:11:08.230 align:middle line:90%
And you can see this--

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:08.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, absolutely.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.570 align:middle line:84%
You look at all the
churches that they erected.

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:14.740 align:middle line:84%
They are all dedicated to John
the Baptist or Mary Magdalene.

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:16.960 align:middle line:84%
Because they were
following and protecting

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.960 align:middle line:84%
the actual holy bloodline,
the true holy bloodline,

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.091 align:middle line:84%
which is a
matriarchal bloodline.

00:11:22.091 --> 00:11:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And when I was doing some
research into this project--

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.250 align:middle line:84%
and again, I wasn't
trying to find the work

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:29.890 align:middle line:84%
to fill a certain
idea that I had.

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:31.600 align:middle line:90%
I let the research guide me.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.313 align:middle line:84%
And I followed the
doors where they led me.

00:11:35.313 --> 00:11:37.646 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that I
found in this-- and there's

00:11:37.646 --> 00:11:39.910 align:middle line:84%
only two copies of this
book available in the world,

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:41.467 align:middle line:90%
written on animal skin.

00:11:41.467 --> 00:11:42.550 align:middle line:90%
One of them is at Harvard.

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:44.950 align:middle line:84%
I had to beg them
to go in and let

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:47.080 align:middle line:84%
me read this in medieval
Portuguese, which

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.220 align:middle line:90%
took a long time.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.600 align:middle line:90%
And there's no index.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And somewhere on page
700, suddenly there's

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:55.560 align:middle line:84%
a swearing-in ceremony of the
Templar master in Portugal

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:58.210 align:middle line:84%
that says within the
swearing-in ceremony,

00:11:58.210 --> 00:11:59.927 align:middle line:84%
I vow to protect the
bloodline of David.

00:11:59.927 --> 00:12:01.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:04.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Now, why would you have
a swearing ceremony in Portugal

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:06.610 align:middle line:84%
unless there was a
bloodline to protect?

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:08.250 align:middle line:90%
So that was their motive.

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:10.630 align:middle line:84%
It was to maintain the spiritual
tradition that goes back

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:12.910 align:middle line:84%
thousands of years, well
before Christianity,

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:15.790 align:middle line:84%
to bring back the sense
of spirituality at a time

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:18.520 align:middle line:84%
when Europe had a
complete lack of it.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Freddy, let's look
more about the Templars

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:22.450 align:middle line:90%
and their existence.

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:25.110 align:middle line:90%


00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:27.360 align:middle line:10%
>>EDWARD COLEMAN: The
Templars come into existence

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:31.259 align:middle line:10%
in the wake of the
aftermath of the Crusades.

00:12:31.259 --> 00:12:33.300 align:middle line:10%
There is a perceived
problem about the protection

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:36.060 align:middle line:10%
of pilgrims who were coming in
greater numbers to Jerusalem

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:39.000 align:middle line:10%
in the wake of the success
of the First Crusade.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.310 align:middle line:10%
And the Templars are
organized effectively

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:42.640 align:middle line:10%
to provide that escort.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.400 align:middle line:10%


00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.400 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: They set up
their headquarters here

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.400 align:middle line:10%
at the Al-Aqsa mosque
on Temple Mount.

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:54.550 align:middle line:10%
For over 60 years, this
would be the knights' center

00:12:54.550 --> 00:13:00.110 align:middle line:10%
of power, their military
and religious headquarters.

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:02.330 align:middle line:10%
Many believe this to
be the original site

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:04.160 align:middle line:10%
of Solomon's temple.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.200 align:middle line:10%
For centuries,
Christian scholars

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.890 align:middle line:10%
had speculated about
its mystical purpose.

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:12.740 align:middle line:10%
The Knights were
fascinated by this place.

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:15.710 align:middle line:10%
So much so that they
called themselves

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:17.900 align:middle line:10%
the Poor Fellow-Soldiers
of Christ

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:22.950 align:middle line:10%
and the Temple of Solomon,
a title eventually

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:26.830 align:middle line:10%
shortened the Knights Templar.

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:29.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there still
Templars today like that,

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:30.811 align:middle line:90%
that we just saw?

00:13:30.811 --> 00:13:31.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, I think so.

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:33.435 align:middle line:84%
I think these people
were clever enough

00:13:33.435 --> 00:13:35.680 align:middle line:84%
to understand that it's
one thing to stand up

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:38.410 align:middle line:84%
for your belief systems
and die for them.

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:41.320 align:middle line:84%
It's another thing if you just
basically give lip service,

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.320 align:middle line:84%
and then change your name with
a bit of public relations,

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.960 align:middle line:84%
and continue living and telling
people the bigger picture.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.486 align:middle line:84%
So they essentially became
Scottish Rite Freemasons

00:13:50.486 --> 00:13:51.286 align:middle line:90%
or Rosicrucians.

00:13:51.286 --> 00:13:52.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:53.600 align:middle line:90%
What an evolution.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.380 align:middle line:90%
So they're still around today.

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:57.619 align:middle line:90%
Just under a different guise.

00:13:57.619 --> 00:13:59.410 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of the
biggest practical jokes

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:02.920 align:middle line:84%
that was played in
history goes back to--

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.590 align:middle line:90%
I think it was the 1500s.

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:07.750 align:middle line:90%
No, actually just before that.

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And it was when the pope
was trying to extinguish

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:11.990 align:middle line:90%
the Templar order in Portugal.

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:15.260 align:middle line:84%
So the Templars created this
entire country from scratch.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And the pope didn't
have any idea

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:18.220 align:middle line:90%
what was going on in there.

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:19.330 align:middle line:90%
He sends a letter out.

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:22.244 align:middle line:84%
And it says, the Templars
need to be exterminated.

00:14:22.244 --> 00:14:23.160 align:middle line:90%
They're a big problem.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:23.930 align:middle line:90%
There worshipping devils--

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:25.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nice of the
pope to say that, right.

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:26.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.540 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't realize
that the king of Portugal

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.460 align:middle line:90%
was himself a Templar Knight.

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And eventually the
king said, well,

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:35.600 align:middle line:84%
we can't keep fighting the
pope and the Spanish army.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:36.400 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you what.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.355 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you go
away on vacation?

00:14:38.355 --> 00:14:39.155 align:middle line:90%
Go to the Algarve.

00:14:39.155 --> 00:14:40.330 align:middle line:90%
It's a nice place.

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:41.590 align:middle line:90%
Go away for a few years.

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:45.040 align:middle line:84%
Let me have the money and
the lands that belong to you.

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And I will write to
the pope, and I'll say,

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:49.782 align:middle line:84%
pope, the Knights
Templar no longer exist,

00:14:49.782 --> 00:14:50.740 align:middle line:90%
you'll be glad to know.

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:53.355 align:middle line:84%
But incredibly enough, there's
a brand new order of knights

00:14:53.355 --> 00:14:54.480 align:middle line:90%
that's just appeared here--

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.021 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Another
group has popped up.

00:14:56.021 --> 00:14:58.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --called the Order
of the Knights of Christ.

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And the pope said,
thank you, my son.

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.030 align:middle line:10%
Well done.

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:03.020 align:middle line:10%
The Templars come
back from the Algarve

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:04.295 align:middle line:10%
after a six year vacation.

00:15:04.295 --> 00:15:05.170 align:middle line:10%
They go see the king.

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:06.460 align:middle line:10%
And the king says, right.

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:08.240 align:middle line:84%
You are no longer
the Knights Templar.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.340 align:middle line:90%
We're not?

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:12.490 align:middle line:84%
No, you are now to be called the
Order of the Knights of Christ,

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:13.290 align:middle line:90%
savvy?

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:14.770 align:middle line:90%
And they went, OK.

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:15.726 align:middle line:90%
And here's your money.

00:15:15.726 --> 00:15:16.600 align:middle line:90%
And here's your land.

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And let's get back
to the project

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:20.050 align:middle line:84%
that we started
here, which includes

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:23.830 align:middle line:84%
discovering the New World called
Newfoundland in Nova Scotia.

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:25.164 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were these good people?

00:15:25.164 --> 00:15:26.663 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They were
very good people.

00:15:26.663 --> 00:15:27.880 align:middle line:90%
They were very spiritual.

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:31.840 align:middle line:84%
The original core, absolutely,
when it was still manageable.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.530 align:middle line:84%
They grew so big, so fast, that
all the checks and balances

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:37.510 align:middle line:90%
began to break down.

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And then of course, a
lot of nefarious people

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:41.350 align:middle line:84%
began to be attracted
by the concept

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:43.330 align:middle line:84%
that, perhaps, they
were very, very wealthy.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:44.410 align:middle line:90%
They were wealthy.

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:46.736 align:middle line:84%
But that wasn't the
point why they existed.

00:15:46.736 --> 00:15:48.610 align:middle line:84%
The wealth was really
generated from the fact

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:50.189 align:middle line:90%
that they were great traders.

00:15:50.189 --> 00:15:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And they were able to actually
promote good things to people,

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:57.040 align:middle line:84%
including looking after
the sick, the infirm,

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.200 align:middle line:84%
educating the children
of peasants, of course.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:15:59.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were
caring people.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.895 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They were
loved by people.

00:16:00.895 --> 00:16:02.020 align:middle line:90%
They were absolutely loved.

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:05.950 align:middle line:84%
And yes, they also proposed
equality with women.

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:10.330 align:middle line:84%
And they also validated
Muslims and other people.

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:12.842 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why, Freddy, were
they so controversial then?

00:16:12.842 --> 00:16:14.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Because of the
politics of the period.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.600 align:middle line:84%
They were practicing
a spirituality

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.210 align:middle line:90%
where God is an inner concept.

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:21.520 align:middle line:84%
It's an inner experience
of the individual.

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And that individual should
decide their own fate.

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:26.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very
spiritual doctrine.

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:28.150 align:middle line:84%
At the time, the church
couldn't allow that.

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:31.720 align:middle line:84%
Because for God to exist,
they have to be in power.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.130 align:middle line:90%
They have to be talked to.

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:34.390 align:middle line:90%
They have to be approached.

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:37.930 align:middle line:84%
They act as an intermediary
between you and your salvation.

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:39.330 align:middle line:90%
They weren't offering salvation.

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:41.560 align:middle line:84%
If you didn't believe in
what the church was selling,

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:45.630 align:middle line:84%
you'd basically be, well,
crucified or tortured to death,

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:48.600 align:middle line:84%
as a lot of women discovered
during the witch hunt trials

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:49.927 align:middle line:90%
and during the Inquisition.

00:16:49.927 --> 00:16:51.760 align:middle line:84%
So these were people
who were not practicing

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:53.200 align:middle line:90%
a true Christian value.

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:56.260 align:middle line:84%
The Templars were actually more
Christians than the Christians.

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:59.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There has
always been rumors

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:02.680 align:middle line:84%
that the Templars had
possession of the Ark

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:06.819 align:middle line:84%
of the Covenant, that
incredible box that

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:10.450 align:middle line:90%
held the Ten Commandments.

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:11.250 align:middle line:90%
Did they?

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:12.104 align:middle line:90%
Did they have it?

00:17:12.104 --> 00:17:13.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: I don't know.

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:15.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it in a
church in Ethiopia?

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:18.390 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: I actually do believe
Graham Hancock's research

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:19.190 align:middle line:10%
in this.

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:20.089 align:middle line:90%
I read his book.

00:17:20.089 --> 00:17:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And I found it very compelling
that the Ark is actually there.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:27.190 align:middle line:84%
But I also discovered that
there's also various elements

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:29.510 align:middle line:90%
of the Ark around the world.

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:32.230 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you happen
to understand Portuguese,

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:36.710 align:middle line:84%
as I do, and you go to the
most famous site in Portugal,

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:38.040 align:middle line:90%
which is the town of Tomar--

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.710 align:middle line:84%
which is actually named for
one of the daughters of Jesus

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:43.737 align:middle line:84%
and Mary Magdalene, by the
way-- which means palm tree.

00:17:43.737 --> 00:17:45.820 align:middle line:84%
There are no palm trees
in that part of the world.

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:47.050 align:middle line:90%
At least back then.

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:48.910 align:middle line:90%
It was too cold.

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:51.940 align:middle line:84%
They basically have a
tradition, have a festival

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:53.440 align:middle line:84%
that happens once
every four years

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.579 align:middle line:90%
around the summer solstice.

00:17:55.579 --> 00:17:57.370 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't honor the
solstice, because that

00:17:57.370 --> 00:17:58.360 align:middle line:90%
happens every year.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:00.340 align:middle line:90%
So why have it every four years?

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:02.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's the Feast
of the Tabuleiros.

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:05.446 align:middle line:84%
Now, unless you're Portuguese,
you don't know what that means.

00:18:05.446 --> 00:18:06.320 align:middle line:90%
It's actually a tray.

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.140 align:middle line:84%
The Feast of the
Tray, where women

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:10.990 align:middle line:84%
wear a tray on their
heads with these loaves.

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And when I read Graham Hancock's
book, The Sign and the Seal,

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:18.340 align:middle line:84%
they have exactly the same
thing happening in Ethiopia

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:19.810 align:middle line:84%
around the churches
where they say

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:23.650 align:middle line:84%
that the true Ark of the
Covenant is actually held.

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:26.770 align:middle line:10%
>>NADIA BILCHIK: And where
is the Ark of the Covenant?

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:28.960 align:middle line:10%
Well, the Ethiopians,
both Christians

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:33.965 align:middle line:10%
and Jewish Ethiopians, believe
that's in a church in Ethiopia.

00:18:33.965 --> 00:18:36.490 align:middle line:10%
Now, interestingly enough,
the story and the mystery

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:40.600 align:middle line:10%
has revived because this
particular church developed

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:41.620 align:middle line:10%
a leak.

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:46.480 align:middle line:10%
Which means that the famous
Ark will have to be moved.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:49.780 align:middle line:10%
Now, why this is a problem
is that the only person

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:52.990 align:middle line:10%
who can actually watch
it is one guardian.

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:56.380 align:middle line:10%
He is the only person
who is allowed to see

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:58.150 align:middle line:10%
this Ark of the Covenant.

00:18:58.150 --> 00:18:58.930 align:middle line:10%
>>NEWSCASTER: OK, let me make
sure I've got this right.

00:18:58.930 --> 00:18:59.730 align:middle line:10%
They sprung a leak.

00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:00.570 align:middle line:10%
So they need to--

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:00.770 align:middle line:10%
>>BILCHIK: To move it.

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:01.450 align:middle line:10%
>>NEWSCASTER: --do some repairs.

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:01.630 align:middle line:90%
>>BILCHIK: Of course.

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:02.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWSCASTER: It
needs to be moved.

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:03.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BILCHIK: And he
can't move it alone.

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:06.970 align:middle line:84%
So it may be the first
time in thousands of years

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:08.082 align:middle line:90%
that people get to see it.

00:19:08.082 --> 00:19:09.790 align:middle line:10%
>>NEWSCASTER: OK, are
we sure it's there?

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:10.310 align:middle line:10%
Have they been playing a hoax--

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:11.020 align:middle line:10%
>>BILCHIK: Well, can you ever--

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:12.353 align:middle line:10%
>>NEWSCASTER: --on us for years?

00:19:12.353 --> 00:19:13.810 align:middle line:10%
>>BILCHIK: What
popular belief is

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:16.290 align:middle line:10%
is that there is some
ancient relic there.

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:19.229 align:middle line:10%
And that they really
believe it is the Ark.

00:19:19.229 --> 00:19:20.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, the
Ark of the Covenant

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:23.740 align:middle line:90%
is a very physical apparatus.

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:28.300 align:middle line:84%
Yet some people have thought,
maybe it's not physical.

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:29.590 align:middle line:90%
It's more spiritual.

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:30.460 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:32.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: I think it's both.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.400 align:middle line:90%
I think it has components of--

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.910 align:middle line:84%
and again, the
writer Graham Hancock

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:40.480 align:middle line:84%
has made a very good and lucid
argument for its location.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:43.540 align:middle line:84%
There is also a lucid argument
that exists in Portugal,

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:45.790 align:middle line:90%
as well, in the town of Tomar.

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And also the fact that what it
contains and what it represents

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.530 align:middle line:90%
is a spiritual component.

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:51.740 align:middle line:90%
So I think it's both.

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:55.720 align:middle line:84%
I think we tend to sort of
get very confused whether it's

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:56.590 align:middle line:90%
either-or.

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:59.230 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a lot of
gray areas in between.

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:02.050 align:middle line:84%
In the metaphysical world,
and the world of spirituality,

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:04.480 align:middle line:84%
everything has a
metaphorical component.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's all based on the
meeting of matter and spirit.

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:10.976 align:middle line:84%
So the more latitude
you give this question,

00:20:10.976 --> 00:20:12.850 align:middle line:84%
the more you understand
what it really means.

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:14.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's been
reported, Freddy,

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:17.290 align:middle line:84%
that those who would come
upon the Ark of the Covenant

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:21.110 align:middle line:84%
would die instantly, like it had
some kind of radiation emitting

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.910 align:middle line:90%
from it.

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:23.285 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It sounds
like what they

00:20:23.285 --> 00:20:25.954 align:middle line:84%
talk about the entrance halls
to the Hall of Records in Egypt.

00:20:25.954 --> 00:20:27.370 align:middle line:84%
It was the same
thing with statues

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:29.980 align:middle line:84%
that had a certain
electromagnetic property

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:33.550 align:middle line:84%
that unless you have the right
incantation or spell, yes,

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:35.250 align:middle line:90%
it would do something to you.

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:37.900 align:middle line:84%
So it obviously was protecting
something very, very important.

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:39.310 align:middle line:90%
I, for one, believe that.

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:40.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Knights Templar--

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:43.240 align:middle line:84%
again, dealing with
the Ark of the Covenant

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.890 align:middle line:84%
and possibly the Shroud
of Turin, which you say

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:48.010 align:middle line:90%
was somebody else--

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:52.080 align:middle line:84%
the point here is they seem to
have been a very powerful group

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:53.430 align:middle line:90%
of people.

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:55.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They were
amazingly influential.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:58.710 align:middle line:84%
There was a sort of moral vacuum
in Europe in the Middle Ages.

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:00.270 align:middle line:90%
And they filled that vacuum.

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:02.645 align:middle line:84%
Again, if you look at the
origin of the Templars

00:21:02.645 --> 00:21:04.020 align:middle line:84%
and where these
people came from,

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:06.240 align:middle line:84%
they came from some of
the finest noble people

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.100 align:middle line:90%
in Europe, in Burgundy.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And Burgundy's the
key to everything.

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And basically these
were intellectuals.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.100 align:middle line:84%
These were people
who actually worked--

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.680 align:middle line:84%
there were Jews
working with Muslims.

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:17.850 align:middle line:90%
Heaven forbid!

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:19.200 align:middle line:84%
They actually worked
together and shared--

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were people
who cared about other people.

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:21.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:24.090 align:middle line:84%
It's like, how can we do
things for the common good?

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:26.910 align:middle line:84%
Because everybody-- the reason
why Europe is falling apart

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:30.420 align:middle line:84%
is because they're all fighting
for possession of resources.

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:31.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We need them today.

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:32.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:35.116 align:middle line:84%
It's like we're reliving
history all over again.

00:21:35.116 --> 00:21:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And so when this group
of intellectuals says,

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:38.080 align:middle line:90%
well, wait a minute.

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.690 align:middle line:90%
Let's agree to disagree.

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:40.750 align:middle line:90%
We have our differences.

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:42.030 align:middle line:90%
We have different opinions.

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:44.640 align:middle line:84%
But why not accept
our differences

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:47.280 align:middle line:84%
and find commonalities where
we can work together and grow

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.120 align:middle line:90%
together?

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.010 align:middle line:84%
If we all prosper,
then we can basically

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:53.190 align:middle line:84%
get on with our belief
system and still get along.

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:55.890 align:middle line:84%
It's not really a very
difficult concept to understand.

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And they practiced
what they preached.

00:21:57.690 --> 00:21:59.130 align:middle line:90%
And that's why they were loved.

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:03.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is the perception
of the Templars today somewhat

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:04.710 align:middle line:90%
jaded?

00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:08.700 align:middle line:84%
It's not quite as good
as you've just described.

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Because
eventually the organization

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:14.130 align:middle line:84%
grew so fast, so quickly that
the usual checks and balances

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:16.390 align:middle line:84%
that they were using
to allow administration

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:19.420 align:middle line:84%
to the inner brotherhood
fell by the wayside.

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:21.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they literally
were outgrowing

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:24.660 align:middle line:84%
their resources and their
ability to manage themselves.

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:27.120 align:middle line:84%
So eventually they
had to just accept

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:31.110 align:middle line:84%
anybody who basically maintained
little kingdoms around Europe.

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's where
the corruption came in.

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And yes, there was corruption
towards the 14th century.

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:36.345 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There was.

00:22:36.345 --> 00:22:37.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: There were
people who were using

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:39.210 align:middle line:90%
the Templars for personal gain.

00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:42.540 align:middle line:84%
But that's not what the
original mandate was all about.

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:43.740 align:middle line:90%
It's like any organization.

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:46.020 align:middle line:84%
It starts off quite
small and manageable.

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:48.780 align:middle line:84%
As it grows too big,
it's out of control.

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:51.270 align:middle line:84%
The core spiritual
concept is still there.

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:53.830 align:middle line:84%
But there are all of these
pods on the outside that

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:55.030 align:middle line:90%
were totally out of control.

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:57.840 align:middle line:84%
And they were used for
making lots of money

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.150 align:middle line:84%
and basically creating little
fiefdoms by themselves.

00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:02.320 align:middle line:84%
But that's not what the
original mandate was about.

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.600 align:middle line:84%
And we're left with
that perception,

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:04.980 align:middle line:90%
because that's where it ended.

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:08.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could the Knight
Templars exist today

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:09.470 align:middle line:90%
in this environment?

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:10.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, absolutely.

00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:11.440 align:middle line:90%
They're everywhere.

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.760 align:middle line:90%
They're absolutely everywhere.

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:13.560 align:middle line:90%
You'll find them--

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they know
they are who they are?

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:16.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, I think so.

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:18.678 align:middle line:84%
I think there are pods of
people who still understand

00:23:18.678 --> 00:23:19.740 align:middle line:90%
the original principles.

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:22.380 align:middle line:84%
For example, the
Shriners, who were

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:23.795 align:middle line:90%
the sort of public version.

00:23:23.795 --> 00:23:25.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And
they're good people.

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:26.753 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And they're
very good people.

00:23:26.753 --> 00:23:28.480 align:middle line:90%
10% tithing, for example.

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.885 align:middle line:90%
Doing charitable works.

00:23:29.885 --> 00:23:32.010 align:middle line:10%
The Knights Hospitallers
are still around in Malta,

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:32.770 align:middle line:10%
by the way.

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So there are offshoots
of the Knights Templar.

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:35.948 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: They're all sister--

00:23:35.948 --> 00:23:36.750 align:middle line:90%
connection groups.

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:39.900 align:middle line:84%
They all basically work together
to create this bigger picture.

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:42.380 align:middle line:84%
Because they recognize
they have things in common.

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:44.880 align:middle line:84%
And if you work together with
the things you have in common,

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.657 align:middle line:84%
it means that
everybody benefits.

00:23:46.657 --> 00:23:48.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Knights
Templar protected

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.710 align:middle line:90%
bloodlines in the past.

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:52.330 align:middle line:84%
Are they still protecting
bloodlines today?

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:53.420 align:middle line:90%
And if so, what are they?

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:54.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, I think so.

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:56.490 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not sure that the people
who are part of the bloodline

00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:58.531 align:middle line:84%
actually know that they're
part of that bloodline

00:23:58.531 --> 00:23:59.790 align:middle line:90%
to protect their identities.

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:00.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Their assets.

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:02.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Again, politics here.

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.900 align:middle line:90%
Waiting for the right moment.

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:05.490 align:middle line:10%
The Order of Sion,
which eventually

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:07.830 align:middle line:10%
became the Priory of Sion--

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:10.180 align:middle line:10%
which of course, became the
focus of Holy Blood, Holy

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:10.980 align:middle line:10%
Grail--

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:12.750 align:middle line:10%
even though that wasn't
the original mandate

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:13.874 align:middle line:10%
that they were looking for.

00:24:13.874 --> 00:24:16.650 align:middle line:84%
They found it-- stumbled
upon it by accident.

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:19.740 align:middle line:84%
These people were very keen
on trying to basically protect

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:22.650 align:middle line:84%
the bloodline of David, which
is such an old bloodline that

00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:26.620 align:middle line:84%
goes back to Sumeria and the
priestesses of the temple.

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:28.597 align:middle line:90%
It's a matriarchal bloodline.

00:24:28.597 --> 00:24:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And basically it was
the understanding

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:32.490 align:middle line:84%
that these people
maintain the true secrets

00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:34.350 align:middle line:84%
of the temple, which
is the understanding

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:36.440 align:middle line:84%
of the spiritual
development of the soul

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:38.730 align:middle line:84%
while it's entrapped
in a human body.

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:41.100 align:middle line:84%
So again, it's a
spiritual development.

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:43.740 align:middle line:84%
So because of politics,
because the way the church

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:45.240 align:middle line:84%
won the argument,
because of the way

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:48.750 align:middle line:84%
the church undermined the
Merovingian dynasty, which

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:50.940 align:middle line:84%
was the continuation of
the bloodline in Europe,

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:52.110 align:middle line:90%
in France--

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:54.690 align:middle line:84%
the Carolingians, who were
supported by the church,

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:56.010 align:middle line:90%
won the argument.

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:58.590 align:middle line:84%
They basically exterminated
the Merovingians.

00:24:58.590 --> 00:24:59.800 align:middle line:90%
Drove them underground.

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:01.320 align:middle line:90%
And it's still that way today.

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:03.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's looking at
the sort of scenario,

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:06.980 align:middle line:84%
this chess game essentially
playing itself out over,

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:09.360 align:middle line:90%
what, 900 years now?

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
the people who do--

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:13.410 align:middle line:84%
there's a part of
Priory of Sion which

00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:16.489 align:middle line:84%
is doing things for
very strange ideals.

00:25:16.489 --> 00:25:18.030 align:middle line:84%
But there's another
part of it, which

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:19.800 align:middle line:90%
has a spiritual component.

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's that along with
the Cistercian group,

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:25.620 align:middle line:84%
and the Templars, and the
Scottish Rite freemasons,

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:28.656 align:middle line:84%
which I believe still
know the location

00:25:28.656 --> 00:25:30.780 align:middle line:84%
of the people of the
bloodline and are still trying

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:32.020 align:middle line:90%
to protect their identities.

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:34.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very serious thing
as far as they're concerned.

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:37.170 align:middle line:84%
Because it protects a very
deep spiritual concept.

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could there be a danger
with these individuals who

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:44.640 align:middle line:90%
have this kind of power?

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:47.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: If the ego is
left unchecked, absolutely.

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:49.240 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what
it comes down to.

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:53.480 align:middle line:84%
Any spiritual teaching is
about the seduction of the ego.

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:56.420 align:middle line:84%
It's about maintaining
your physical impulses

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:57.220 align:middle line:90%
under control.

00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:59.020 align:middle line:84%
The first teaching
you'll ever learn.

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:01.660 align:middle line:84%
So the whole concept of
the spiritual teaching

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:04.999 align:middle line:84%
is to actually make sure that
you understand your position

00:26:04.999 --> 00:26:06.290 align:middle line:90%
in the bigger scheme of things.

00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:07.250 align:middle line:90%
It's not about you.

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:08.750 align:middle line:90%
It's about the bigger picture.

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:12.790 align:middle line:84%
So yes, it's about understanding
how their role plays out

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:15.880 align:middle line:84%
in the current perception
and the paradigm of politics

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:18.130 align:middle line:84%
and religion, and waiting
for the right moment when

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:20.560 align:middle line:84%
that opportunity
arises where everybody

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:21.730 align:middle line:90%
will get that message.

00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:24.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could we have
any Knights Templar

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:25.807 align:middle line:90%
involved in politics today?

00:26:25.807 --> 00:26:26.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, I believe so.

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:28.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think I've already
met a couple of them.

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:30.320 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I can't
tell you who they are.

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.320 align:middle line:84%
But yes, I have met
a couple of them.

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.240 align:middle line:84%
There are Templar groups
all around the world.

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.865 align:middle line:84%
Some of them just
dress up because it's

00:26:35.865 --> 00:26:37.420 align:middle line:90%
fun to be in regalia.

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:38.920 align:middle line:84%
But then there are
also other people

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:40.750 align:middle line:84%
who are doing it
very much for real.

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And they keep themselves
under the radar.

00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:43.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're very serious.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: They're very serious.

00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:46.310 align:middle line:84%
They have a good sense
of humor, as well.

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:48.184 align:middle line:84%
But they know exactly
what they're doing.

00:26:48.184 --> 00:26:49.600 align:middle line:84%
They know not to
raise their heads

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:51.812 align:middle line:84%
a bit too above the
parapet to make sure they

00:26:51.812 --> 00:26:53.020 align:middle line:90%
don't get knocked down again.

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:54.797 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would we
know their names?

00:26:54.797 --> 00:26:55.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Not really.

00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:57.088 align:middle line:84%
They keep themselves
to themselves.

00:26:57.088 --> 00:26:57.970 align:middle line:90%
Again--

00:26:57.970 --> 00:26:58.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Private people.

00:26:58.590 --> 00:26:59.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: They're humble.

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:00.520 align:middle line:90%
They're very humble people.

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:03.220 align:middle line:84%
Some of them work for
charitable organizations.

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:06.220 align:middle line:84%
Some do a lot of
works for children.

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:08.357 align:middle line:84%
And again, they keep
themselves under the radar.

00:27:08.357 --> 00:27:09.690 align:middle line:90%
You know, really, really humble.

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:10.565 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just enough.

00:27:10.565 --> 00:27:13.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: But some of them are
actually captains of industry.

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:16.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you met a
Knights Templar directly,

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:19.660 align:middle line:90%
what would you ask them today?

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:22.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Am I telling the truth?

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:25.830 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because-- yeah, I mean,
for me, as a researcher--

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:28.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I spend a lot
of time making sure

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:29.390 align:middle line:90%
that all my facts are checked.

00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:30.931 align:middle line:84%
Which means that it
takes a long time

00:27:30.931 --> 00:27:32.400 align:middle line:90%
to write a book on this stuff.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.800 align:middle line:84%
I would find out how close
am I to the real truth.

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.870 align:middle line:84%
Because eventually
only the people

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:39.520 align:middle line:84%
directly involved in anything
know the actual truth.

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.110 align:middle line:90%
I hope I'm pretty close to it.

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And so far, meeting some
of the Scottish Rite

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.840 align:middle line:84%
Freemasons and the lectures
I've given for them,

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.245 align:middle line:84%
they're saying I'm pretty
damn close to the truth.

00:27:48.245 --> 00:27:49.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would
they be frustrated

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:51.280 align:middle line:90%
with what's happening today?

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I think they
recognize the earth for what

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:54.550 align:middle line:84%
it is and the human
condition for what it is.

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:56.090 align:middle line:84%
It's always going
to be frustrating.

00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you
have opportunities

00:27:57.390 --> 00:27:59.820 align:middle line:84%
where you can do the things
that you really want to do.

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:01.278 align:middle line:10%
And you accept that
for what it is.

00:28:01.278 --> 00:28:03.939 align:middle line:10%
And acceptance is
the key to survival.

00:28:03.939 --> 00:28:05.730 align:middle line:10%
So as long as you're
in control of yourself

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:08.880 align:middle line:10%
and your own emotions, and you
are in control of what you do

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:11.460 align:middle line:10%
and what you say, you
do the best you can.

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:13.565 align:middle line:84%
You learn to live and
survive for another day

00:28:13.565 --> 00:28:14.940 align:middle line:84%
when the opportunity
arises where

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:17.700 align:middle line:84%
you can do exactly what you
want to do without having

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:19.350 align:middle line:90%
to hide behind the shell.

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:21.510 align:middle line:84%
So I think that they
actually are in control.

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:23.450 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I believe they're
doing the right thing.

00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:24.908 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
were good people.

00:28:24.908 --> 00:28:26.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I totally
believe so, yes.

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:29.100 align:middle line:10%
Because everything
they did always had

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:30.630 align:middle line:10%
a spiritual component to it.

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:33.400 align:middle line:10%
And everybody benefits from it.

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And from all the
examples that survive

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:37.320 align:middle line:84%
that have been written about
them, from the early days

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:39.460 align:middle line:84%
of the 11th century
and the 12th century,

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:41.419 align:middle line:84%
everybody seems to have
benefited all the time.

00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:46.118 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Knights Templar.

00:28:46.118 --> 00:28:51.570 align:middle line:84%
I always believed that they were
a group of warring type people.

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:52.890 align:middle line:90%
Obviously not.

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:55.170 align:middle line:84%
They were here for the
betterment of mankind.

00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:58.560 align:middle line:10%
And according to Freddy
Silva, they're still here.

00:28:58.560 --> 00:28:59.490 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:02.280 align:middle line:84%
