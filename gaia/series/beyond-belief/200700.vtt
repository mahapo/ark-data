>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief".

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.060 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Bruce Damer is a scientist,
designer, intellectual working

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.150 align:middle line:10%
on the key question of
how life started on Earth,

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.710 align:middle line:10%
the future of humanity.

As we expand in
this space, you're

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.000 align:middle line:84%
going to enjoy our

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.510 align:middle line:90%
Bruce, welcome to the program.

>>BRUCE DAMER:
Thank you, George.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.505 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
you get involved

00:00:43.505 --> 00:00:46.270 align:middle line:84%
in all of this, investigating
life out there and life here?

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: You know,
when I was a kid,

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.260 align:middle line:84%
I watched Neil Armstrong
step down onto the moon,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.180 align:middle line:90%
and I was hooked on live TV.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How old were you?

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.380 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: I was seven.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was 13, and
it was fascinating.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.650 align:middle line:90%
And I, too, watched that.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.240 align:middle line:90%
And it was unbelievable.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.760 align:middle line:84%
Grainy black and white,
but it worked, didn't it?

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.660 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: It worked.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.970 align:middle line:10%
And then when I
was 14, I decided

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.570 align:middle line:10%
the coolest question to work
on for a nerdy kid like me was

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.930 align:middle line:10%
how did life begin from
a jumble of molecules?

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.740 align:middle line:84%
So I had my first
thought experiment.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.850 align:middle line:84%
You know how Albert Einstein
had thought experiments?

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And it was a jumble of
molecules self-assembling kind

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.530 align:middle line:84%
of in my third eye,
in my imagination.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And I could speak to it, and I
asked it, how did life begin?

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And it said, figure out how
I made a copy of myself.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now did you get
spiritual or religious at all

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:36.760 align:middle line:90%
during this period?

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.930 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: I kind of was.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.800 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
spiritual or religious was.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.360 align:middle line:10%
But I always felt there
was this etheric feel

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.320 align:middle line:10%
that I was in contact with.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And it also contained
these thought

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.730 align:middle line:84%
experiments that contained
visions of the future.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:50.732 align:middle line:90%
So as a little kid--

00:01:50.732 --> 00:01:52.565 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all little kids
are pretty etherial.

00:01:52.565 --> 00:01:53.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.965 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: Pretty dreamy, yeah.

00:01:54.965 --> 00:01:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you're
going to mix science

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.150 align:middle line:84%
with spirituality to get us
this answer on how life began?

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: In a
sense, I have, yeah.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:03.670 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.970 align:middle line:84%
So if you study Newton,
if you study Descartes,

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.240 align:middle line:84%
they use dreams to
do their science.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.860 align:middle line:84%
So it's a long
tradition in science.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.693 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think of Charles Darwin

00:02:13.693 --> 00:02:14.890 align:middle line:90%
and his theory of evolution?

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:15.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: Very powerful.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:16.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.958 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: Very powerful,
but not quite complete.

00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:20.445 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because there's a
camp that doesn't accept him.

00:02:20.445 --> 00:02:21.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: Well,
what we've done is

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.210 align:middle line:84%
we've extended it because
there's missing pieces to it.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.290 align:middle line:84%
And with this origin
of life model,

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.430 align:middle line:84%
we've made the
discovery that we came

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.220 align:middle line:84%
not from, probably,
competing individuals,

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.580 align:middle line:84%
you know, fighting
red in tooth and claw,

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.120 align:middle line:84%
but from a
collaborative community

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.510 align:middle line:84%
complex, that the origin,
our common ancestor

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.343 align:middle line:90%
is a complex community.

00:02:42.343 --> 00:02:44.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But don't you
think, Bruce, somewhere

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.850 align:middle line:84%
along the line, there's some
kind of intelligent planning

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:47.650 align:middle line:90%
here?

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:48.880 align:middle line:90%
This can't be an accident.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.080 align:middle line:90%
It can't be random.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.460 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: You would think so.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.080 align:middle line:84%
But if you look in complexity
theory, when networks form,

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.500 align:middle line:84%
they grow faster than
the individuals can.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.660 align:middle line:84%
So in sense that etheric
field that I contacted

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.660 align:middle line:84%
when I was a kid, and I
didn't know what it was,

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.100 align:middle line:84%
could possibly be explained
by complex weaving of life

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.237 align:middle line:90%
that we can't even see.

00:03:10.237 --> 00:03:11.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.410 align:middle line:84%
My thoughts on all of
this is because I'm

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.590 align:middle line:84%
such a strong believer
in intelligent design,

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.750 align:middle line:84%
is that we all have
to live with water.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:21.550 align:middle line:90%
We have to.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.260 align:middle line:90%
Without that, we're gone.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.460 align:middle line:90%
Everything's gone.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.110 align:middle line:84%
Trees are gone, grass is gone,
we're gone, everything's gone.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.630 align:middle line:84%
Who would conceive
of the plan to make

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.630 align:middle line:84%
it rain on plants and trees
when you need the water there?

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that alone
tells me there's

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.800 align:middle line:90%
some kind of planning to this.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: It's a hard
one to figure out.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.840 align:middle line:84%
But when we go to
Mars, the rain stopped

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.170 align:middle line:90%
about four billion years ago.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And so did the life.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: If it ever
got started there.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we
think it did, don't we?

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: Well, there's
a whiff of methane

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.200 align:middle line:84%
that seems to be coming
up through the rocks.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what
does that tell you?

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: There could
be methane-eating or

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.622 align:middle line:84%
methane-producing
life in the rocks.

00:04:04.622 --> 00:04:06.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or in the little
organisms down there,

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.050 align:middle line:90%
or critters.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.600 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: Probably bacteria,
kind of like the plaque

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.930 align:middle line:90%
on your teeth.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But to me,
that's not life.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.649 align:middle line:84%
I want to see an
animal or something.

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:17.540 align:middle line:90%
That's life to me.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: Yeah, you want
something driving around

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.200 align:middle line:90%
in something.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Back to the
Charles Darwin theory.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.100 align:middle line:90%
What does he say?

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: So he says
that the only mechanism

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.150 align:middle line:84%
you need to generate complex
forms from earlier ones

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.070 align:middle line:84%
is a process of
natural selection.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.740 align:middle line:90%
We have a big population.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.550 align:middle line:84%
One of them gets through
and spreads its genes,

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.870 align:middle line:84%
and then you have
another set of selection,

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.320 align:middle line:84%
and then another
population, and then

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.210 align:middle line:90%
the strongest one gets through.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's a staircasing
thing, kind of like economics

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:51.670 align:middle line:90%
with companies competing.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bruce, you had a chance
to go to New Zealand, where

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:55.920 align:middle line:90%
you did some incredible things.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.006 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.795 align:middle line:10%
- It's just a case
of weird science.

00:05:01.795 --> 00:05:04.770 align:middle line:10%

scientist Dr. Bruce

Damer is at Rotorua's
Hell's Gate conducting

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.530 align:middle line:10%
research trials aiming to
answer the age old question,

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:14.850 align:middle line:10%
how did we get here?

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:15.880 align:middle line:10%
- It's very exciting.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.690 align:middle line:10%
It's a 21st century science,
revolutionary science,

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:19.920 align:middle line:10%
to watch.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.950 align:middle line:10%
If we can find this cycle,
it's the engine of creation,

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:23.760 align:middle line:10%
effectively.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.060 align:middle line:10%
Also that we came not
from an individual,

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.810 align:middle line:10%
not from competing individuals,
but from a network,

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.420 align:middle line:10%
a collaborative community
was at the taproot

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.130 align:middle line:10%
of the tree of life.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.100 align:middle line:84%
- Dr. Damer's research
could turn previous origins

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.200 align:middle line:90%
of life science on its hit.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.540 align:middle line:84%
His testing with a
hot springs on land

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.080 align:middle line:84%
may have been the starting
point for life itself.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.800 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Damer's searching
for RNA, a nucleic acid

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.630 align:middle line:90%
and the basis of living cells.

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.200 align:middle line:10%
- So what we think
is that RNA could

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.920 align:middle line:10%
have been the first polymer
that life synthesized first

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.930 align:middle line:10%
at random in a
process like this,

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.450 align:middle line:10%
and then picked
through selection

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.670 align:middle line:10%
through these
cycling protocells,

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.950 align:middle line:10%
which we're doing here
in the hot spring,

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.720 align:middle line:10%
picked ones that worked.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.970 align:middle line:10%
- He's also hoping
to conduct research

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.160 align:middle line:10%
into the formation of
a molecular structure

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.130 align:middle line:10%
much closer to home.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.830 align:middle line:10%
- It's possible, also,
that DNA could have formed

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.680 align:middle line:10%
in a condition like
this, self-assembled.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.260 align:middle line:10%
So those little double
helical polymers

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.360 align:middle line:10%
self-assembling just like
we're doing with the RNA here,

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.650 align:middle line:10%
and that DNA may have been
around the same time as RNA,

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.240 align:middle line:10%
and then they could interact.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.870 align:middle line:10%
And the DNA acts as a
data store for the RNA,

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.970 align:middle line:10%
which reads the data
store and then makes all

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:41.790 align:middle line:10%
the proteins that make life.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:44.340 align:middle line:84%
- For years scientists
had accepted the theory

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.730 align:middle line:84%
that life began in hydrothermal
vents in the ocean.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:51.240 align:middle line:10%
Charles Darwin once speculated
that biological molecules might

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.180 align:middle line:10%
form in a warm little
pond, and Doctor Damer

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.060 align:middle line:10%
believes this to be much
closer to the truth.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.540 align:middle line:10%
- If we can show to our
colleagues and to the world

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:04.140 align:middle line:10%
that we can self-assemble an
important biopolymer of life

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:08.533 align:middle line:10%
called RNA in a hot spring
pool that's cycling,

00:07:08.533 --> 00:07:10.950 align:middle line:10%
in the conditions that would
have been around in the early

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:13.110 align:middle line:10%
Earth on these big
volcanic islands,

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:16.110 align:middle line:10%
our colleagues are really going
to seriously look at doing more

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:17.130 align:middle line:10%
experiments.

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And it'll create a whole
movement, a whole sort

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:22.230 align:middle line:84%
of paradigm shift in origin
of life thinking back

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:24.720 align:middle line:84%
to Darwin's warm
little pond, only now

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.390 align:middle line:90%
it's a cycling hot little pool.

>>NOORY: Bruce,
did you find what

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:29.610 align:middle line:90%
you were looking for there?

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:30.930 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: We did.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:34.500 align:middle line:84%
What we did was put the
building blocks of RNA

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.070 align:middle line:84%
in those solutions,
in those little vials,

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:41.160 align:middle line:84%
dried them down, and rehydrated
them with hot spring water.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.990 align:middle line:84%
They formed films,
and then they formed

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:45.530 align:middle line:90%
protocells that contained RNA.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And as this was happening, they
stitched the building blocks

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:53.190 align:middle line:84%
together into RNA long enough
to do functions, to do biology.

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:57.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why was the hot springs
water so important to this?

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: It was a
perfect marriage

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:02.670 align:middle line:84%
of just the right protons,
basically, in the acidic water,

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:04.860 align:middle line:84%
and the drying down, the
right heat, and the right

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:09.810 align:middle line:84%
drawing down to do the chemistry
that then life took over later.

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:12.220 align:middle line:84%
So we have a chicken
and egg problem

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:15.920 align:middle line:84%
in that you need to form
polymers to have living things.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.030 align:middle line:84%
But you can't do
it without enzymes,

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:21.150 align:middle line:84%
and we found that nature
had this technique,

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:25.110 align:middle line:84%
wet dry cycling, to be able to
do that job without enzymes.

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:28.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Without this, would
there been life on Earth?

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:29.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: Probably not.

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:30.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:31.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: Yeah.

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:34.860 align:middle line:84%
So wet dry cycling, so you
need volcanic landscapes

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:37.320 align:middle line:84%
with things like Old
Faithful that are constantly

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.360 align:middle line:90%
filling and refilling pools.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And we've done this in the
lab for 10 years, George.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now what about other
planets out there like Mars?

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.160 align:middle line:10%
Do they have that kind
of system going on, too?

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:48.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: Yes.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:53.060 align:middle line:84%
Mars-- the Spirit Rover,
which went to Mars

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:55.050 align:middle line:84%
and traveled for
about seven years,

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:57.510 align:middle line:84%
found an old hot spring
in Old Yellowstone

00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:59.100 align:middle line:90%
3.7 billion years old.

00:08:59.100 --> 00:08:59.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:00.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: Yeah.

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:04.650 align:middle line:84%
And what we're looking for on
Mars is something like this.

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:05.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is that?

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.532 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: That's a
stromatolite from Australia.

00:09:07.532 --> 00:09:08.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: May I feel it?

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:09.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: Yeah.

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:11.550 align:middle line:84%
It's got these
little ripples in it.

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.290 align:middle line:90%
You can see the ripples in it.

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:15.390 align:middle line:90%
That's the biofilms.

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:16.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's heavy.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:18.122 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: It's heavy,
and it's full of iron.

00:09:18.122 --> 00:09:20.220 align:middle line:84%
So the early Earth
was red, like Mars.

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:21.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is
what you don't want

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.690 align:middle line:84%
to hit the planet,
because if it's iron,

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:26.040 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't break down, does it?

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:26.957 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: That's right.

00:09:26.957 --> 00:09:27.870 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:30.250 align:middle line:90%
And so that's from Australia.

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's some of the oldest
evidence of life on Earth.

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:38.010 align:middle line:84%
So of the Mars 2020
Rover found such a thing

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:42.840 align:middle line:84%
at the surface in 2021, we'd
have reasonable evidence

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.240 align:middle line:84%
that life was on
the surface of Mars.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Life would be
all over this thing?

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: Well, what that is
is the fingerprint of life.

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:52.800 align:middle line:90%
So this is an old lake shore.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And when you go to
lake shores and you

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:58.350 align:middle line:84%
see that slimy stuff that's
really stinky in kind

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:03.000 align:middle line:84%
of mudflats, that's producing
oxygen, it's producing sulfur.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.970 align:middle line:84%
But when sediments
wash over it, they

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:08.580 align:middle line:84%
cement the sediments
together and make a platform,

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.080 align:middle line:84%
and that's what
these layers are.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's the fingerprint of
life three billion years ago.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that could be
on how many other planetary

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:18.952 align:middle line:84%
systems, let's say,
in our solar system?

00:10:18.952 --> 00:10:20.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: It could be on Mars.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:24.310 align:middle line:84%
It could have been on Venus, but
Venus, the oceans boiled off.

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:25.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Too hot.

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:26.130 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: Too hot.

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:29.430 align:middle line:84%
The moons of Saturn,
with their icy shells,

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:32.610 align:middle line:84%
maybe life couldn't start
there because for this model,

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:33.750 align:middle line:90%
you need wet dry cycling.

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:35.370 align:middle line:90%
You need landscape.

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:37.473 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
Europa, Jupiter's moon?

00:10:37.473 --> 00:10:38.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: Yeah,
it's covered in ice

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:42.430 align:middle line:84%
and there's a deep ocean, which
might have hydrothermal systems

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:43.230 align:middle line:90%
like a hot spring.

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:45.150 align:middle line:84%
But because you have
water, you can't

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:48.510 align:middle line:84%
form the chemicals of life
without them breaking down

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:49.585 align:middle line:90%
first.

00:10:49.585 --> 00:10:50.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:54.328 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: And Titan, which has
basically a hydrocarbon sea--

00:10:54.328 --> 00:10:55.620 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: Moon of Saturn, right?

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:56.670 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: Moon of Saturn.

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:58.500 align:middle line:90%
Titan's maybe too cold.

00:10:58.500 --> 00:10:59.880 align:middle line:90%
But missions are going to Titan.

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.380 align:middle line:84%
The dragonfly mission
will go there.

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we call our
system the Goldilocks spot,

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.750 align:middle line:84%
right, because it's got
just the right temperature,

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:08.490 align:middle line:90%
the right ingredients.

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:11.520 align:middle line:84%
But with billions of
planets in the universe,

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:15.180 align:middle line:84%
billions of planets,
the percent of planets

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:18.727 align:middle line:84%
that would be similar to ours
is astronomical, isn't it?

00:11:18.727 --> 00:11:20.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: There would
be a lot of them.

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:26.070 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, if they
can form these microbial mats,

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:28.820 align:middle line:84%
maybe that's common because
if you have wet dry cycling,

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:32.580 align:middle line:84%
you have volcanic landscapes,
a lot of water that's present.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.110 align:middle line:90%
But here's the trick.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:37.920 align:middle line:84%
You need to have those microbial
mats able to grow and flourish

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.683 align:middle line:84%
for three or four billion
years to produce oxygen.

00:11:40.683 --> 00:11:41.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It takes that long?

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:43.620 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: It takes that long.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.500 align:middle line:84%
So the oxygen and then
transition to bigger cells

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:50.220 align:middle line:84%
called eukaryotes, which
then form the first worms,

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:53.280 align:middle line:90%
the first fungi, first plants.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And then the oxygen
feeds their metabolisms,

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:58.140 align:middle line:90%
gives them the energy they need.

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:01.453 align:middle line:90%
And then we get to big animals.

00:12:01.453 --> 00:12:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to
have the right path

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.660 align:middle line:84%
to the right big animals and
the right mass extinctions

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:09.660 align:middle line:90%
to get to thinking animals.

what are the odds of
that on other planets?

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:23.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: There's a great
book called "Rare Earth"

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:25.230 align:middle line:90%
that really spells it all out.

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:28.590 align:middle line:84%
I think the odds are
likely because there's

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:31.620 align:middle line:84%
so many of those
planets, but still small,

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.780 align:middle line:84%
because the pathway
that you have

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:36.990 align:middle line:84%
to get through to get
to big thinking animals

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:38.850 align:middle line:90%
is so unlikely.

deep space mission like this.

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:33.050 align:middle line:10%
Two constellation
launches are required.

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:35.570 align:middle line:10%
The first is an
uncrewed Aires 5 launch

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:40.010 align:middle line:10%
of a booster segment called the
Earth Departure Stage or EDS,

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:42.440 align:middle line:10%
followed about 90 minutes
later by an Aires 1

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.480 align:middle line:10%
lift of an Orion
crew exploration

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.330 align:middle line:10%
vehicle with astronauts aboard.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:52.850 align:middle line:10%
Mounted atop the EDS is the NEO
Surface Access Module or NSAM.

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:55.310 align:middle line:84%
Astronauts in the
Orion rendezvous

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:57.740 align:middle line:84%
and then dock with
the EDS and NSAM,

00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:00.890 align:middle line:84%
creating a complete
stack, as it's called.

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:02.900 align:middle line:10%
When the appropriate
launch window arrives,

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:07.250 align:middle line:10%
the powerful EDS engines fire,
injecting the entire stack

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:11.800 align:middle line:10%
into a trajectory bound
for the target asteroid.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:16.000 align:middle line:10%
Approaching the NEO, the Orion
and NSAM separate from the EDS

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.945 align:middle line:10%
and take up a station-keeping
position nearby the NEO.

00:14:18.945 --> 00:14:22.330 align:middle line:10%
The mated vehicles now
match the NEO's rotation

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:25.810 align:middle line:10%
and begin a descent towards
the asteroid surface.

00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:28.000 align:middle line:10%
Astronauts now rotate
their joined vehicles

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.220 align:middle line:10%
to an NSAM down
orientation so that they

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:35.720 align:middle line:10%
can scan the NEO for a promising
place to moor their ship.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.220 align:middle line:84%
Up until this point,
the mission has

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:40.180 align:middle line:84%
been very similar to an
Apollo approach to the moon,

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:44.000 align:middle line:84%
but now some key
differences emerge.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.010 align:middle line:10%
Look carefully at the
bottom of the NSAM,

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:48.380 align:middle line:10%
and you'll notice
a ring of airbags.

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:50.180 align:middle line:10%
These have sensors
on their surfaces

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:54.425 align:middle line:10%
and penetrometer
probes between them.

00:14:54.425 --> 00:14:56.050 align:middle line:10%
Mission planners are
designing for what

00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:59.380 align:middle line:10%
they call a soft contact and
tether on the NEO surface.

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:02.990 align:middle line:90%


00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:05.630 align:middle line:10%
Because NEOs are much less
massive than the moon,

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:07.070 align:middle line:10%
only a small amount
of thrust will

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:11.340 align:middle line:10%
be required to balance the NEO's
tiny gravitational attraction.

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.220 align:middle line:10%
So mission designers
don't refer to this

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:18.240 align:middle line:10%
as a landing on the NEO surface,
but rather a docking with it.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:21.080 align:middle line:10%
It's more like one very
small spacecraft meeting up

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.600 align:middle line:10%
with a very large one.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.150 align:middle line:10%
When the stack first makes
contact with the surface,

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:28.850 align:middle line:10%
software looks at the airbag
sensors and penetrometer

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:31.370 align:middle line:10%
readings, decides quickly
if it's solid enough

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:35.330 align:middle line:10%
to stay, or to back off and
try a different docking site.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:38.180 align:middle line:10%
If the vote is to remain,
harpoon-tipped tethers

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.250 align:middle line:10%
fire into the nearby
surface in a bid

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:43.370 align:middle line:10%
to keep the NSAM
anchored and upright.

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:46.430 align:middle line:10%
The first small steps
for humans onto a NEO

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:49.520 align:middle line:10%
had better be small Indeed,
as the ultra low gravity will

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.100 align:middle line:10%
create conditions more
akin to scuba diving

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:53.720 align:middle line:10%
than to moon walking.

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:57.380 align:middle line:10%
NEOnauts, venturing out on
extravehicular activities,

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:59.210 align:middle line:10%
as spacewalks are
called, will probably

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:03.630 align:middle line:10%
need to keep a hand or foot
on their vehicle at all times.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:06.050 align:middle line:10%
Fortunately, the
securely anchored tethers

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:08.360 align:middle line:10%
will perform double
duty as handholds,

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.130 align:middle line:10%
allowing astronauts
to make their way down

00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:13.220 align:middle line:10%
to and around the surface.

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:16.820 align:middle line:10%
NEOs are likely to be very
crumbly and dirty places.

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:19.280 align:middle line:10%
Any dust the astronauts
stir up will likely

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.170 align:middle line:10%
float around them and
cling to their suits

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:23.740 align:middle line:10%
due to static electricity.

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:27.040 align:middle line:10%
Working on an asteroid won't
be like last century's lunar

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:29.320 align:middle line:10%
excursions.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:31.450 align:middle line:84%
At first, NEOnaut
crews will only

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:34.630 align:middle line:84%
explore very close
to their spacecraft.

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:38.350 align:middle line:10%
But they could climb back inside
and hop the entire vehicle

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:40.270 align:middle line:10%
to other locations
on the asteroid

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:42.340 align:middle line:10%
and take additional samples.

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:45.250 align:middle line:10%
Eventually the NEOnauts
may use jet packs,

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:47.380 align:middle line:10%
quite similar to the manned
maneuvering unit used

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.440 align:middle line:10%
on the shuttle to freely
fly, perhaps quite far

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.030 align:middle line:10%
from the safety of the NSAM.

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:55.630 align:middle line:10%
A lot of asteroid might be
covered in a single mission.

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:57.460 align:middle line:10%
But when it's time
to go for good,

00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:00.220 align:middle line:10%
the Orion and NSAM
upper stage will

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:03.250 align:middle line:10%
unhook from the
tether decking segment

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:06.450 align:middle line:10%
and pull away for
the return home.

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:08.970 align:middle line:10%
Firmly affixed to the
NEO, the piece left behind

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:12.750 align:middle line:10%
will become a long-term
robotic science station.

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:15.599 align:middle line:10%
Back in free space and
NEOnauts no longer,

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:18.369 align:middle line:10%
the group will perform a
direct entry flight profile

00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:22.770 align:middle line:10%
after dropping their NSAM living
quarters and Orion service

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:25.319 align:middle line:10%
module along the way.

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:27.300 align:middle line:10%
Like other Orion
missions, the crew

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:33.780 align:middle line:10%
will experience a fiery
reentry, a parachute descent,

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:36.510 align:middle line:10%
and then, most likely,
a splashdown-style water

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:39.920 align:middle line:10%
landing and recovery.

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:42.710 align:middle line:10%
NEOs, it turns out, are
individuals, each different

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:43.640 align:middle line:10%
from the other.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.290 align:middle line:10%
Following this
basic mission plan,

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:47.900 align:middle line:10%
additional sorties to
other NEOs could be flown.

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.360 align:middle line:10%
Proponents of NEO missions
cite several reasons

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.340 align:middle line:10%
for wanting to do
these missions.

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:54.590 align:middle line:10%
They think that NEO
samples selected

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:57.740 align:middle line:10%
by an intelligent human science
crew right there on the surface

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:00.440 align:middle line:10%
will likely hold amazing
planetary geoscience

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.210 align:middle line:10%
discoveries.

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:04.800 align:middle line:10%
The impact threat from
NEOs is always present.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.010 align:middle line:10%
So it's probably a good
idea for our civilization

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:09.170 align:middle line:10%
to learn as much
about them as we can.

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:11.480 align:middle line:10%
In fact, one asteroid
named Apophis

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:15.710 align:middle line:10%
will make a close encounter
with Earth in 2029.

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:18.770 align:middle line:10%
But perhaps most important,
NEOs and icy objects

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:21.200 align:middle line:10%
such as active comets
could be developed

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.940 align:middle line:10%
as a rich resource
stepping stones

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:28.730 align:middle line:10%
supporting future
human exploration

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:32.950 align:middle line:10%
and the eventual permanent human
settlement of the solar system,

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:36.589 align:middle line:10%
and maybe one day, beyond.

00:18:36.589 --> 00:18:40.040 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:41.030 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:45.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why, Bruce, would we
want to land on an asteroid?

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.160 align:middle line:90%
What's there for us?

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:49.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: It turns out, George,
that these asteroids are

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:52.730 align:middle line:84%
made up of what we believe are
the building blocks of life

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:55.040 align:middle line:90%
and what made us.

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.285 align:middle line:84%
So if I take this,
and I take a smell--

00:18:57.285 --> 00:18:58.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's that?

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: This is
like cosmic dust.

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:04.182 align:middle line:84%
It's a 4.6 billion-year-old
asteroid or meteorite.

00:19:04.182 --> 00:19:05.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Could barely see it.

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:06.640 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: Found on the Earth.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:10.273 align:middle line:84%
And you smell it, you get
the smoky gunpowder smell.

00:19:10.273 --> 00:19:11.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is
from an asteroid?

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:14.023 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: This is from an
asteroid that fell to the Earth

00:19:14.023 --> 00:19:15.090 align:middle line:90%
as a meteorite.

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:16.340 align:middle line:90%
And it's older than the Earth.

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:18.972 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How much is this worth?

00:19:18.972 --> 00:19:20.180 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: Anyone name a price.

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:21.570 align:middle line:90%
We'll put it on Craigslist.

00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:22.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:22.870 align:middle line:90%
Huh.

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:25.790 align:middle line:90%


00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:30.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: So if we go to an
asteroid with a human crew,

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:32.600 align:middle line:84%
we might be able to
find those organics that

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.370 align:middle line:84%
are the clue to
how we were made,

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:37.890 align:middle line:84%
all that organic material from
all those solar systems falling

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:38.690 align:middle line:90%
into the Earth.

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:41.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isn't an
asteroid tumbling along?

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:42.920 align:middle line:90%
How do you stay on it?

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.212 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: How do you stay on it?

00:19:44.212 --> 00:19:46.430 align:middle line:84%
So in that mission, that's
a human-crewed mission

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:48.830 align:middle line:84%
where you have to tether
down because there's almost

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:49.840 align:middle line:90%
no gravity.

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.740 align:middle line:90%
You go out on backpacks.

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:53.000 align:middle line:90%
But what we also worked out--

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you get
flung off into space?

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:56.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: It's pretty
slow rotation.

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:57.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is.

00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:59.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: You could throw
a baseball, George,

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:01.460 align:middle line:90%
and it wouldn't end up in orbit.

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:02.880 align:middle line:90%
One of those things.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:05.150 align:middle line:84%
But what we also
worked out is a method

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:09.020 align:middle line:84%
by which to encapsulate an
asteroid in a balloon fabric

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:12.870 align:middle line:84%
structure, like Bigelow's
building now, and fill it

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:13.670 align:middle line:90%
with gas.

00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:15.380 align:middle line:90%
And we'll stop the rotation.

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.940 align:middle line:84%
The tumbling will
stop in the friction.

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:21.890 align:middle line:84%
Then we can use, like, a sailing
ship technology to push gas

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:23.900 align:middle line:90%
at the asteroid and push it.

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you're talking
about maybe a 30-foot asteroid

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:27.310 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:29.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: 30 foot up
to a half a mile.

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A half a mile
balloon-type thing

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:32.120 align:middle line:90%
to encase it?

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:32.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: Yeah.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.790 align:middle line:90%
We could scale up.

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And why we would do this
is to extract materials

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:41.330 align:middle line:84%
like this and water ice to
create fuel stations for Elon

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:44.092 align:middle line:84%
Musk's Mars mission, for
example, because Elon needs--

00:20:44.092 --> 00:20:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like a
stopping off point?

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:46.350 align:middle line:90%
A stopping off.

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:48.010 align:middle line:84%
Like if you had a
Tesla car, you'd

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:49.350 align:middle line:90%
need to have a charging station.

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:50.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: So to open space, we
need to make fueling stations.

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's a technique that
the group has come up with.

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:58.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So British
astronaut, female,

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:01.220 align:middle line:84%
one of the first for
the Brits, claims

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:03.860 align:middle line:90%
that aliens are among us.

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:05.720 align:middle line:84%
Now she's not
talking about people

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.520 align:middle line:90%
who look like you and me.

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.380 align:middle line:84%
But she's talking
about organisms

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:11.330 align:middle line:90%
from other planets are here.

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:12.950 align:middle line:90%
Do you accept that?

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:16.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: Well, we'd have
to get a sample of them

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:18.770 align:middle line:84%
and sequence them to see
what their DNA looked

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:20.750 align:middle line:84%
like because chances
are their DNA

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:22.523 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't have the
same sequence as ours.

00:21:22.523 --> 00:21:24.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about the
possibilities, though?

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:25.370 align:middle line:90%
Is it?

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:26.550 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: It's possible.

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes that's
called panspermia.

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:31.370 align:middle line:84%
You may have covered
that in previous show.

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:32.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:34.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: Here's the
challenge with panspermia.

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:37.070 align:middle line:84%
So instead of this material
falling on the Earth

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:40.250 align:middle line:84%
to feed a process like we did
in New Zealand, where we're

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:43.130 align:middle line:84%
forming protocells,
what if life could

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:46.670 align:middle line:84%
come from outside as a
complete cell that came in?

00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:49.910 align:middle line:84%
The challenge is if life was
already here, it might eat it.

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:52.010 align:middle line:84%
That's what Charles
Darwin thought.

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:54.650 align:middle line:84%
Or if the Earth was very
toxic and difficult,

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:58.100 align:middle line:84%
it might just expire,
might not thrive at all.

00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:00.170 align:middle line:84%
So if something
landed on Mars today,

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:02.240 align:middle line:90%
it would just be sterilized.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've always liked
space since I was a kid.

00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:09.700 align:middle line:84%
But why is it so important
for us, as humans,

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:12.370 align:middle line:90%
to explore these other worlds?

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:14.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: I think, George,
because it teaches us how

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:17.590 align:middle line:90%
to be better stewards of ours.

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:21.310 align:middle line:84%
So if we see what happened to
Venus with a heating event that

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:23.290 align:middle line:84%
created a greenhouse,
runaway greenhouse,

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:25.930 align:middle line:84%
and basically
killed Venus, we can

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:29.320 align:middle line:84%
learn about the dangers of
managing the amount of CO2

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:32.080 align:middle line:84%
in our atmosphere
because we look at Venus,

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:34.930 align:middle line:84%
and that's like, that's
what happens to planets when

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:36.290 align:middle line:90%
the CO2 is the atmosphere.

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:38.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What can
we do about it?

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:41.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: Well, that's where
we came in with the US Navy.

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:45.520 align:middle line:84%
So about 15 years ago,
as part of a study--

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:46.547 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With the Navy?

00:22:46.547 --> 00:22:48.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: Well, this was for
the Office of Net Assessment

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:52.070 align:middle line:84%
at the Pentagon, where
they were saying,

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:56.120 align:middle line:84%
how can we get America off
dependence on foreign oil?

00:22:56.120 --> 00:23:00.310 align:middle line:84%
So we did a study with Andrew
Marshall and Peter Schwartz

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:01.780 align:middle line:90%
for the Pentagon.

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And that kicked off
a series of studies

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:08.020 align:middle line:84%
from the highest level that
was commissioned by the Joint

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:10.360 align:middle line:84%
Chiefs, and especially
in the Navy,

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:14.560 align:middle line:84%
on global security tied to
climate change and climate

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.390 align:middle line:90%
shocks, they're called.

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And so that's now activated
the Department of Defense.

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:21.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, these
climate shocks,

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:23.420 align:middle line:90%
what are they specifically?

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:26.088 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: So for example, what's
happening in Australia right

00:23:26.088 --> 00:23:27.880 align:middle line:84%
now, where I'm headed
in a couple of weeks.

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, be safe.

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:32.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: Yeah, where the
whole place is on fire.

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And climatologists
now believe that one

00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:36.400 align:middle line:84%
of the next targets
for wildfires

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.160 align:middle line:90%
will be the American southeast.

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And all you need to get
wildfires started is, say--

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:44.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A spark in
a dry area, right?

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: Right.

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:47.530 align:middle line:84%
So say, if in South
Carolina, they

00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:51.670 align:middle line:84%
have a unusual dry
30-day period, that

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:55.690 align:middle line:84%
is enough to dry out
the vegetation and all

00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:57.620 align:middle line:90%
that kudzu and everything.

00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:00.730 align:middle line:84%
And so you're going to see,
by the mid- to late '30s,

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:03.730 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see wildfires
in places we've never seen them,

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:07.510 align:middle line:84%
like in South Carolina,
like in Georgia, everywhere.

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:09.940 align:middle line:84%
So then everybody's
under threat.

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:12.970 align:middle line:10%
All those neighborhoods,
all those businesses.

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:15.670 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Could some of these
be deliberately set as well?

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:18.820 align:middle line:10%
>>DAMER: Well, they'll start
from all kinds of sources.

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:21.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you just spark
the back of a pickup

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:22.820 align:middle line:90%
and you can set a fire.

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:25.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how do you respond
to those climate shocks?

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:27.430 align:middle line:90%
How do you solve that?

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:29.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: So this is where
the Pentagon comes in.

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:34.240 align:middle line:84%
So I met Admiral Norman Hayes
in Qatar in the Middle East

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:35.650 align:middle line:90%
about a year ago.

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:37.240 align:middle line:84%
We were walking
around and we noticed

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:40.330 align:middle line:84%
that they had built half a
trillion dollars of skyscrapers

00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:42.363 align:middle line:84%
and World Cup
stadiums and whatnot.

00:24:42.363 --> 00:24:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And it was all
going to be rusting

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:46.960 align:middle line:84%
scaffolding because they built
it at or under sea level.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why would they do that?

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:51.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: You know,
nobody thought about it.

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:53.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How could they miss it?

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:55.390 align:middle line:84%
That would be the
first question I'd ask.

00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:58.872 align:middle line:84%
Folks, you know, we're
building this on a sand barge.

00:24:58.872 --> 00:24:59.830 align:middle line:90%
What's going to happen?

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:03.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: And Google and
Facebook completed $10 billion

00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:06.730 align:middle line:84%
on campus construction on the
Bay, on the San Francisco Bay,

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:08.470 align:middle line:90%
and there's a panic now.

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:13.312 align:middle line:84%
So they went to say is there
any plan for a Bay Area seawall

00:25:13.312 --> 00:25:15.020 align:middle line:84%
because we're going
to lose our campuses.

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:17.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How tall does
this seawall have to be?

00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:18.980 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: It's a good question.

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:22.870 align:middle line:84%
So SFO San Francisco Airport,
where you'll be flying in,

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:25.300 align:middle line:84%
is going to be building a
seawall for their runway

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:28.293 align:middle line:84%
because all the airports
are under threat worldwide.

00:25:28.293 --> 00:25:29.710 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: These
mood shocks, you've

00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:32.050 align:middle line:10%
identified really
10 specific goals

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:33.520 align:middle line:10%
to respond to these shocks.

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.228 align:middle line:10%
Can you go through a
few of those for us?

00:25:35.228 --> 00:25:36.028 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: Yeah.

00:25:36.028 --> 00:25:37.600 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
like the sea level.

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:41.530 align:middle line:84%
We have to build 11,000
miles of sea level, sea rise

00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:43.620 align:middle line:90%
mitigation, infrastructure.

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 11,000 miles.

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:50.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: 11,000 miles worldwide
just to preserve the high value

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:51.880 align:middle line:90%
coastal cities.

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:54.283 align:middle line:84%
Cities like Jakarta
are going to disappear.

00:25:54.283 --> 00:25:55.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How about New York?

00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:56.650 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: New York, yeah.

00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:57.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: LA.

00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:00.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: Bangkok, Delhi.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:01.848 align:middle line:90%
You just name them.

00:26:01.848 --> 00:26:03.140 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there are just so many.

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:05.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How high will
the sea levels rise?

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:07.210 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: No one knows for sure.

00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:09.100 align:middle line:84%
But here's the
challenge, George.

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:11.380 align:middle line:84%
So Houston is a
city that is totally

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:13.160 align:middle line:90%
activated at this point.

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:16.060 align:middle line:84%
So if you go to Houston and
you go to the Natural History

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:20.260 align:middle line:84%
Museum, there's a fantastic
projection map display

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:23.900 align:middle line:84%
showing what Houston will look
like with a two-inch rise,

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:25.978 align:middle line:84%
a four-inch rise,
a six-inch rise.

00:26:25.978 --> 00:26:27.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
seems like nothing.

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.187 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: It seems
like nothing, but what

00:26:29.187 --> 00:26:32.050 align:middle line:84%
it does, at the same time
as the Gulf is going up

00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:35.290 align:middle line:84%
two, four, six, eight inches,
the water is getting warmer.

00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:36.910 align:middle line:84%
The hurricanes
are more powerful.

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:41.550 align:middle line:84%
The storm surges are bigger
by more than two inches,

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:42.820 align:middle line:90%
by a magnifier.

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And so they are
showing the devastation

00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:48.440 align:middle line:84%
that Houston will experience,
which highways will become

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:51.430 align:middle line:90%
impassible with these things.

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:53.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But would a
barrier really work, Bruce?

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:56.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: It can, but
we have to rethink

00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:58.450 align:middle line:90%
how we do seawall barriers.

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:01.660 align:middle line:84%
So when you're back on the
east coast, if you fly in,

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:04.150 align:middle line:84%
you'll see all those
barrier islands.

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:08.140 align:middle line:84%
That's nature's way of
creating a seawall for storms.

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And that was just created
by piling up sand,

00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:11.500 align:middle line:90%
but they're living.

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:13.900 align:middle line:84%
Things are growing on
them, so they self-repair.

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:16.930 align:middle line:84%
Or so we can learn from nature
to build living seawalls

00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:18.490 align:middle line:90%
instead of concrete abutments.

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:21.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What else do you need
to do in some of these things?

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:24.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: We need to
secure the food supply

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:26.220 align:middle line:84%
because if food
supply runs out--

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:28.630 align:middle line:84%
so for example, the
Pentagon, in the study

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:31.030 align:middle line:84%
of the Syrian
conflict, it turns out

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:33.340 align:middle line:84%
that there was a drought
that was persistent that

00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:35.655 align:middle line:90%
led to the agricultural crash.

00:27:35.655 --> 00:27:37.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The famine
was horrible.

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:38.988 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: Famine was
horrible, and so the people

00:27:38.988 --> 00:27:41.470 align:middle line:84%
moved into Damascus,
which accelerated

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:44.800 align:middle line:84%
the Civil War, which was
already a political thing.

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.020 align:middle line:84%
So the Pentagon is
now classifying that

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:49.600 align:middle line:90%
as a climate change conflict.

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And so the Pentagon's
entire perspective

00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:54.850 align:middle line:84%
now on global
security has shifted

00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:57.790 align:middle line:84%
to tracking climate
and trying to look

00:27:57.790 --> 00:27:59.320 align:middle line:90%
at mitigation solutions.

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, they talk
about climate wars one day.

00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:02.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: Yeah.

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:02.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:04.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That these
things would happen.

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:06.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: And when people are
in migration, it's devastating.

00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:09.890 align:middle line:84%
So then on top of that,
you've got pandemics.

00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:11.050 align:middle line:90%
So what happens if--

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:16.010 align:middle line:84%
100 years ago, the Spanish
flu was finishing its rage

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:16.810 align:middle line:90%
across the Earth.

00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:18.670 align:middle line:90%
One in five people died.

00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And the Spanish flu
traveled by steamship.

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:24.680 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine today if we
had an influenza like that,

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:25.480 align:middle line:90%
how fast?

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:25.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Instant.

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: Instant.

00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:30.000 align:middle line:84%
So we need a rapid response
to viral infection.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It would probably
show up on our computers.

00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:33.660 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: Yeah.

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:34.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:36.430 align:middle line:90%
So that's another moon shot.

00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:39.980 align:middle line:84%
Rapid response to pandemics,
because they're coming.

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:43.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What exactly, Bruce,
are climate moon shots?

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.810 align:middle line:90%
Why do they call it moon shots?

00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:47.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: We call them moon shots
because of, basically, Neil

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:50.630 align:middle line:84%
Armstrong going to the moon
in the '60s with Kennedy

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:51.680 align:middle line:90%
announcing it.

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:53.360 align:middle line:90%
It seemed impossible.

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.787 align:middle line:84%
But a whole nation came
together and did the impossible.

00:28:55.787 --> 00:28:56.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They got it done.

00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:58.260 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: They got it done.

00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:02.630 align:middle line:84%
So the term moon shot is a term
for our time, a global culture

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:05.360 align:middle line:84%
of moon shots, of
we can do this.

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And coordinating together,
we've got all the best

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.965 align:middle line:84%
tools that we've ever
had as a species.

00:29:09.965 --> 00:29:11.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, when
people get together, too,

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:13.080 align:middle line:90%
they've talked about this.

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:13.923 align:middle line:90%
Let's look.

00:29:13.923 --> 00:29:14.790 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:17.260 align:middle line:84%
- What does the world
look like that you would

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:20.110 align:middle line:90%
want your children to live in?

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:21.550 align:middle line:90%
- There's no scarcity.

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:25.210 align:middle line:10%
- We can actually breathe
clean air, see the trees,

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:27.370 align:middle line:10%
hear the song the birds.

00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:31.600 align:middle line:84%
- We are balanced, sustainable,
appreciating biodiversity.

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.550 align:middle line:90%
- We protect what we love.

00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:37.210 align:middle line:84%
- Any amount of healing that
we can all do individually

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:42.250 align:middle line:84%
and internally, that will be
reflected in our outer reality.

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:44.050 align:middle line:10%
- If we go on our
ways, the way that we

00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:48.710 align:middle line:10%
do business and
the way of living,

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:52.820 align:middle line:10%
it's quite frightful
and unsustainable.

00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:56.340 align:middle line:84%
- We're going through a stress
point, a severe stress point.

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And we'll evolve
and we'll awaken.

00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:01.310 align:middle line:84%
- Well, what is
it that we can do?

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:03.350 align:middle line:90%
And then how can we do it?

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:05.210 align:middle line:90%
- Climate Mitigation Associates.

00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:08.660 align:middle line:84%
- A foundation for
transformation for humanity.

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:11.780 align:middle line:84%
- That grows like a
mycelium in the forest

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:15.800 align:middle line:84%
and collaborates just like
the origins of life itself.

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:19.670 align:middle line:84%
- A beacon of truth and
hope and love and trust.

00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:21.770 align:middle line:84%
- Bringing all of our
innovation and ingenuity

00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:25.830 align:middle line:84%
to work for and with the
Earth, and using crises

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:28.670 align:middle line:84%
as opportunities to moon
shot ourselves forward

00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:30.230 align:middle line:90%
into a future of abundance.

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:33.650 align:middle line:84%
- Where we bring the
green back, where we

00:30:33.650 --> 00:30:36.500 align:middle line:90%
care for the entire biosphere.

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:40.060 align:middle line:84%
We care for it like we
would care for our own baby.

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:42.580 align:middle line:84%
Whole effort of
humanity to respond,

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:46.390 align:middle line:84%
to bridge over these climate
shocks that are coming.

00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:47.950 align:middle line:84%
- Reverse some of
the processes that

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:49.450 align:middle line:84%
are causing climate
change, but also

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:52.810 align:middle line:84%
get prepared to mitigate some
of the things that are already

00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:53.680 align:middle line:90%
in motion.

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:55.240 align:middle line:84%
- Whatever the
environment changes,

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:57.970 align:middle line:84%
you have to change and
adjust to that environment.

00:30:57.970 --> 00:31:00.580 align:middle line:84%
- We were shaped
by climate shock,

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:02.110 align:middle line:90%
so we're pre-adapted for it.

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:04.640 align:middle line:90%
We know it when we see it.

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:06.940 align:middle line:90%
So we can do this as a species.

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:09.170 align:middle line:84%
- We can kind of
shift this whole ethos

00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:12.500 align:middle line:84%
of fear and scarcity into
a mindset of abundance,

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:15.060 align:middle line:84%
where there are solutions
readily available now.

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:17.150 align:middle line:84%
- Specifically,
nature-raised solutions,

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:19.310 align:middle line:84%
reforestation and
forest consideration,

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:22.040 align:middle line:84%
and the harnessing of
these exponentially growing

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:25.010 align:middle line:84%
technologies to make all the
human systems more efficient,

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:27.950 align:middle line:84%
use less resources, and make
the system more regenerative

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:30.140 align:middle line:90%
and more of a circular economy.

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:32.000 align:middle line:84%
- There's a whole
lot that we could

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.900 align:middle line:84%
be doing in a different way
with existing solutions.

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:37.820 align:middle line:84%
- We have to build
living seawalls, not

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:39.860 align:middle line:90%
dead ones out of concrete.

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:41.720 align:middle line:90%
We have to build for 500 years.

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:46.760 align:middle line:84%
- Collaboration is going to
be the source of creation.

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:49.520 align:middle line:84%
- All of life is a
collaborative sharing network.

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's where it
derives its power.

00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:55.310 align:middle line:84%
- Quiet your mind to
listen to your heart,

00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:57.980 align:middle line:84%
and then share it because
we are all interconnected.

00:31:57.980 --> 00:31:59.490 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:02.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you confident,
Bruce, that humankind

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:04.500 align:middle line:84%
can do what these
folks have been saying?

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:05.400 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: Absolutely.

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:06.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You are.

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:07.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: Totally, absolutely.

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:09.690 align:middle line:84%
When you see the
generation that's coming up

00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:13.020 align:middle line:84%
of Millennials-- and sometimes
they call the iGENS--

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:15.120 align:middle line:90%
they think in group mind.

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:19.620 align:middle line:84%
Unlike us, unlike the Boomers,
they think in a different way.

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:23.880 align:middle line:84%
They have different structures,
and they collaborate much more

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:25.060 align:middle line:90%
easily.

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:29.040 align:middle line:84%
So for example, here in Boulder
and the San Francisco Bay Area,

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:31.410 align:middle line:84%
Millennials have
created co-op housing.

00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:32.910 align:middle line:90%
Brand new way to live.

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:37.383 align:middle line:84%
They group order their food
from apps on their phones.

00:32:37.383 --> 00:32:38.550 align:middle line:90%
They manage their household.

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:39.840 align:middle line:90%
They manage their finance.

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:41.720 align:middle line:90%
And they automate everything.

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:44.010 align:middle line:84%
They have learned to
live a different way,

00:32:44.010 --> 00:32:48.720 align:middle line:84%
very efficiently and less
cost, less expense, less carbon

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.760 align:middle line:84%
output, but also in
a collaborative form.

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:54.000 align:middle line:84%
So it's not the hippie
communes of old.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.950 align:middle line:84%
It's something
new that's rising.

00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's a way to live on
the Earth that is brand

00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:00.120 align:middle line:90%
new in the new generation.

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:01.830 align:middle line:90%
We always have to look to them.

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:04.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you get
people to rally around this?

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:07.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: You know,
there's two ways we do it.

00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:11.640 align:middle line:84%
We look back and say, what
have we achieved up to 2019?

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:15.360 align:middle line:84%
We've achieved, actually, the
best time for human beings

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:16.653 align:middle line:90%
on the planet we've ever had.

00:33:16.653 --> 00:33:18.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, they say
it's the best of times

00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:19.528 align:middle line:90%
and the worst of times.

00:33:19.528 --> 00:33:20.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: And the worst of times.

00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:23.560 align:middle line:84%
But in our heads,
were full of anxiety.

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:28.050 align:middle line:84%
So in 2019, there was basically
an activation of awareness

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:29.980 align:middle line:90%
about this problem.

00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:33.510 align:middle line:84%
But I think, as people go
through a phase of panic

00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:36.490 align:middle line:84%
and they calm down, they
start to work together.

00:33:36.490 --> 00:33:38.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there enough
people, though, Bruce,

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:41.250 align:middle line:90%
like you to get this done?

00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:42.630 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: I believe so.

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:45.840 align:middle line:84%
We've got several constituencies
that that can get the job done.

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:48.570 align:middle line:84%
We've got the US
Department of Defense.

00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:51.870 align:middle line:84%
We've got a lot of extremely
brilliant-- in the video,

00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:54.240 align:middle line:90%
we saw Admiral Norman Hayes.

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.280 align:middle line:90%
And I know you're a Navy guy.

00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:58.740 align:middle line:84%
And the Navy is really
activated on this,

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:01.260 align:middle line:84%
and they have a focus
on forward planning

00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:02.820 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of our society.

00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:05.160 align:middle line:84%
They're thinking
about this for us.

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:06.930 align:middle line:84%
They're connected
with big finance.

00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:09.210 align:middle line:90%
Big finance is now activated.

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:12.020 align:middle line:84%
We saw BlackRock
Group just announce--

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:16.530 align:middle line:84%
they're a $6.1 trillion
group that is now shifting

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:19.020 align:middle line:90%
into an investment position.

00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:22.989 align:middle line:84%
So as you see the business
opportunity that arises--

00:34:22.989 --> 00:34:25.830 align:middle line:84%
the city of Houston, you
have refinery complexes

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:29.310 align:middle line:84%
that have got salt water in
them now from the sea level.

00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:30.719 align:middle line:90%
They need investment.

00:34:30.719 --> 00:34:32.520 align:middle line:90%
They need to start work.

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:35.370 align:middle line:84%
The '20s is the decade
of design and decision.

00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:40.409 align:middle line:84%
By 2030, most of these 10 moon
shots have to be in build.

00:34:40.409 --> 00:34:42.679 align:middle line:84%
So we're hosting
this competition,

00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:46.260 align:middle line:84%
this design challenge of how
do we build the best seawall?

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:48.630 align:middle line:84%
How do we secure our
food supply the best?

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:50.460 align:middle line:84%
How do we work on
human well-being.

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:53.350 align:middle line:84%
So we're not coming
from panic and anxiety

00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:55.260 align:middle line:84%
because if you're in
a team, and you're

00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:57.450 align:middle line:84%
coming from a place
of anxiety, you're

00:34:57.450 --> 00:34:58.860 align:middle line:90%
not going to get anything done.

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:03.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If by 2030 these aren't
accomplished, what happens?

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:05.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: We have challenges.

00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:07.560 align:middle line:84%
As Admiral Hayes
says, in battle,

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:11.760 align:middle line:84%
If you know that your enemy is
24 hours out from assaulting

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:14.460 align:middle line:84%
your position, it's
a different form

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:17.400 align:middle line:84%
of preparation, a
different kind of battle

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:20.700 align:middle line:84%
than if you're under
a surprise attack.

00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:25.230 align:middle line:84%
So if we have 10 years to
prepare for these Black Swan

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:28.250 align:middle line:84%
events, these unknown things
that we can't predict--

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:30.660 align:middle line:84%
the Earth system is too
complicated to predict.

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:34.060 align:middle line:84%
No one predicted Australia would
be on fire, the whole continent

00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:34.860 align:middle line:90%
at once.

00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:35.520 align:middle line:90%
No one.

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:36.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It just happened.

00:35:36.490 --> 00:35:37.650 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: It just happened.

00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:41.170 align:middle line:90%
So have to prepare for that.

00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:45.060 align:middle line:84%
So in the military context,
you do scenario planning,

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:47.080 align:middle line:90%
and you prepare for worst case.

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And then you pull back that
you could handle worst case.

00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:54.150 align:middle line:84%
It's not likely to be, but
you hold things in reserve.

00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:57.720 align:middle line:84%
So if we're going to lose
all the world's airports

00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:01.320 align:middle line:84%
by the 2050s, or they're
going to be under threat like

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:04.200 align:middle line:84%
LaGuardia is now-- it's
flooding all the time--

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:07.350 align:middle line:84%
what do we do as a civilization
to maintain a transportation

00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:08.470 align:middle line:90%
grid?

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:11.310 align:middle line:84%
If we start building
now, we'll have

00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:14.280 align:middle line:84%
a functional transportation
grid that will bridge over

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:15.570 align:middle line:90%
that challenge.

00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:18.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The late American
prophet Edgar Cayce

00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:21.840 align:middle line:84%
had a vision of what he thought
the United States of North

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:24.870 align:middle line:84%
America would look
like in the future,

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:26.550 align:middle line:90%
and it's pretty ominous.

00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:29.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think,
like, the west coast

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:33.120 align:middle line:84%
could very well be St.
Louis, full of water

00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:34.230 align:middle line:90%
all along the line.

00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:35.160 align:middle line:90%
Is that feasible?

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:36.240 align:middle line:90%
Is that real?

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:37.620 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: It's a possibility.

00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:40.360 align:middle line:84%
So for example, in the
Monterey Bay, where we live,

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:42.600 align:middle line:84%
it's one of the richest
agricultural regions

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:43.628 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:36:43.628 --> 00:36:44.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That'll be gone.

00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:46.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: Yeah, so how
do we mitigate that?

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:48.330 align:middle line:90%
How do we solve that?

00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And smart people
live everywhere.

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:54.960 align:middle line:84%
Google and Facebook will solve
this problem of the inundation

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.070 align:middle line:90%
of their campuses.

00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:57.070 align:middle line:90%
They're smart people.

00:36:57.070 --> 00:36:58.490 align:middle line:90%
They have resources.

00:36:58.490 --> 00:36:59.840 align:middle line:90%
They're can do.

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And this is going back to the
'60s, when this country was

00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:05.490 align:middle line:90%
a can do country.

00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:07.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we a
can do country today?

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:09.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: I believe that
in our souls we are,

00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:11.880 align:middle line:84%
but we have to tell
ourselves a different story.

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:13.880 align:middle line:84%
We have to tell ourselves
that we are can do,

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:17.750 align:middle line:84%
we were for 200
years, and if we fall

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:20.460 align:middle line:84%
under the story of the
Chicken Little, you know,

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:22.160 align:middle line:84%
the sky is falling,
the sky is falling,

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.720 align:middle line:90%
we're just going to run around.

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:25.320 align:middle line:90%
We can't afford that anymore.

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:26.750 align:middle line:90%
We've got to get down to work.

00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:28.583 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bruce, you've
got a planet of close

00:37:28.583 --> 00:37:30.030 align:middle line:90%
to a billion people.

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:32.300 align:middle line:90%
We can't save them all.

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:34.520 align:middle line:90%
So what happens in the future?

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:37.020 align:middle line:84%
How many people do
we actually save?

00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:40.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: So we have to make
some choices, for example.

00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:42.530 align:middle line:84%
But I think my
prediction is we'll

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:44.760 align:middle line:90%
bridge the whole thing over.

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:47.550 align:middle line:84%
We'll bridge the entire thing
called human civilization,

00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:49.130 align:middle line:90%
the human enterprise.

00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:51.530 align:middle line:90%
We may lose some landscapes.

00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:53.900 align:middle line:84%
We may have to relocate
because we have

00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:56.330 align:middle line:90%
to preserve some wild nature.

00:37:56.330 --> 00:37:59.420 align:middle line:90%
We have to do a lot of things.

00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:00.440 align:middle line:90%
We have to plant.

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And there's initiatives
in Silicon Valley,

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:05.880 align:middle line:84%
where this is based, to plant
a trillion trees, for example.

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:09.160 align:middle line:84%
So if we start planting, we
take some of the landscape,

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:12.710 align:middle line:84%
and say we put forests there,
real forest, real ecosystems,

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:14.790 align:middle line:90%
we'll pull a carbon out.

00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:17.010 align:middle line:84%
We'll pull the carbon
out of the atmosphere

00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:20.900 align:middle line:84%
so that this event is
not a 500 year event,

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:22.710 align:middle line:90%
it's a 200 year event.

00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:26.560 align:middle line:90%
Or it's not a 5,000 year event.

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:29.110 align:middle line:84%
If the methane is released
from the permafrost,

00:38:29.110 --> 00:38:31.350 align:middle line:90%
all bets are off.

00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:32.920 align:middle line:84%
So that's a really
dangerous one.

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:35.337 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've been mentioning
the Navy and the military.

00:38:35.337 --> 00:38:37.780 align:middle line:84%
Why are they so
interested in this?

00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:39.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: Well, in
the case of the Navy,

00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:41.140 align:middle line:84%
they got the
facilities at Norfolk.

00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:42.540 align:middle line:90%
They have bases.

00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:43.780 align:middle line:90%
They're at sea level.

00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:45.190 align:middle line:90%
They are on the sea.

00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:49.060 align:middle line:84%
That's where they live,
where they operate.

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:51.550 align:middle line:84%
Generally, it's because
in the Pentagon,

00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:55.160 align:middle line:84%
they have a function of forward
planning, five years, 10 years,

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:57.520 align:middle line:90%
15 years, 100 years.

00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:02.770 align:middle line:84%
That's what their mission is,
to look for security concerns

00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:07.690 align:middle line:84%
and to mitigate them, and to
advise the Joint Chiefs, who

00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:11.290 align:middle line:84%
advise the president and the
long-term planning offices

00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:12.400 align:middle line:90%
that they have.

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:14.650 align:middle line:84%
The thing that's wonderful
about the Pentagon

00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:18.640 align:middle line:84%
is the continuity in the
agency and the transparency

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:21.280 align:middle line:84%
and the quality of
individuals in the agency.

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:25.600 align:middle line:84%
So this is why I'm excited that
it's one of our four pillars.

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.520 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Watching
television last night,

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:30.250 align:middle line:10%
I stumbled across the movie
"The Day After Tomorrow"

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:31.810 align:middle line:10%
based on the book
by Whitley Strieber

00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:36.630 align:middle line:10%
and Art Bell called "The
Coming Global Super Storm".

00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:39.540 align:middle line:84%
That movie scares the
living daylights out of you.

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:41.543 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:39:41.543 --> 00:39:42.460 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: No one knows.

00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:44.530 align:middle line:84%
It's probably Hollywood
always depicts things

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:48.440 align:middle line:84%
more dramatically than
usually ever turn out.

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:50.770 align:middle line:84%
So there could be
some version of it.

00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:55.600 align:middle line:10%
If you watch "Blade Runner
2049" came out, I think,

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:58.990 align:middle line:10%
last year, what you notice
is that the police car that

00:39:58.990 --> 00:40:02.890 align:middle line:10%
comes off the LAPD tower and it
flies over the Central Valley,

00:40:02.890 --> 00:40:05.170 align:middle line:10%
and you see all
these strip farms

00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:07.540 align:middle line:10%
and all these aquaponics farms.

00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And the whole
agriculture is changed.

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:12.640 align:middle line:84%
It lands next to a dead oak
tree because all the oak forest

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:16.520 align:middle line:84%
changed with super storms coming
through California from Texas,

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:19.090 align:middle line:84%
which is the prediction now,
that these hurricanes will

00:40:19.090 --> 00:40:21.600 align:middle line:84%
actually cross
into the southland.

00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:22.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We don't need that.

00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:24.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: In the summer.

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:26.890 align:middle line:84%
So if you go talk to a farmer
who's an almond farmer,

00:40:26.890 --> 00:40:29.320 align:middle line:84%
and you say, you're going
to get 10 inches of hot rain

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:31.600 align:middle line:84%
in August, they'll
say all, my trees

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:33.670 align:middle line:90%
are going to die from fungus.

00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:36.100 align:middle line:84%
So if that's going
to come, then we

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:37.960 align:middle line:84%
need to start
rolling the Central

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:40.330 align:middle line:90%
Valley, the rolling '20s.

00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:42.968 align:middle line:84%
We need to start
transforming agriculture now.

00:40:42.968 --> 00:40:44.635 align:middle line:84%
But doesn't mean the
end of agriculture.

00:40:44.635 --> 00:40:47.170 align:middle line:84%
It means that we'll be
growing rice there, just as we

00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:49.210 align:middle line:90%
are north of the Sacramento.

00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:53.320 align:middle line:84%
So we can prepare for this,
if this is a likely scenario.

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:54.490 align:middle line:90%
Just start getting ready.

00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:56.530 align:middle line:90%
Change in advance.

00:40:56.530 --> 00:40:59.500 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How close are we
to getting and implementing

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.280 align:middle line:10%
any of these things?

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:03.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: This is the
time of activation.

00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:05.530 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, in
Australia now, they

00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:06.670 align:middle line:90%
have to rethink everything.

00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:10.480 align:middle line:84%
In California we have to rethink
everything due to wildfire.

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:14.020 align:middle line:84%
So government agencies, do we
need rooftop solar everywhere

00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:15.640 align:middle line:84%
because those
wildfires are caused

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:19.960 align:middle line:84%
by lines blowing in the wind
and shorting out and causing

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:20.920 align:middle line:90%
the fire.

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:23.380 align:middle line:84%
So here we are in Silicon
Valley with no electricity

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:25.300 align:middle line:90%
because the wind is blowing.

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:28.468 align:middle line:84%
And everyone in my neighborhood
is saying, this is crazy.

00:41:28.468 --> 00:41:30.010 align:middle line:84%
We're in the heart
of Silicon Valley,

00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:33.100 align:middle line:84%
and we just shut off
our power to prevent us

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:34.840 align:middle line:90%
from being burned down.

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's accelerating
the installation

00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:39.790 align:middle line:84%
of solar everywhere, so
the localization of power

00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:40.740 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And now we have Tesla
saying, hey, you

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:46.240 align:middle line:84%
can power your vehicle
from your rooftop solar.

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:50.900 align:middle line:84%
It's safe, and it's a
carbon neutral technology.

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:53.440 align:middle line:84%
It's what we need,
but it's going

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:55.330 align:middle line:84%
to have to be
massively deployed.

00:41:55.330 --> 00:41:59.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you could wave
a magic wand and fix this,

00:41:59.830 --> 00:42:02.560 align:middle line:84%
what would be the
first thing you'd fix?

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:04.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: I think that
we have to change

00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:08.650 align:middle line:84%
the story we're telling each
other to a positive solutions

00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:12.580 align:middle line:84%
moon shot, we can do
this story as a species

00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:16.940 align:middle line:84%
because if we get addicted
to all this negative stuff,

00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:19.660 align:middle line:84%
it runs our cortisol,
it runs our adrenaline.

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:21.700 align:middle line:84%
That's why we like
sure to click on,

00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:24.550 align:middle line:84%
we like to watch the
super storm movie.

00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:26.110 align:middle line:90%
We just love that stuff.

00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But we don't
want to be in it.

00:42:28.810 --> 00:42:31.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: Yeah, who wants
to be in that movie, right?

00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:32.290 align:middle line:90%
It's entertainment.

00:42:32.290 --> 00:42:35.680 align:middle line:84%
But if it takes over
our consciousness,

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:37.840 align:middle line:90%
it takes over our futures.

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:39.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you positive
about our future?

00:42:39.970 --> 00:42:41.410 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: Very positive.

00:42:41.410 --> 00:42:42.450 align:middle line:90%
Very positive, George.

00:42:42.450 --> 00:42:44.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You think we're
going to get this done?

00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:46.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: We're going to
get this done, absolutely.

00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:50.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a
worldwide collective resource

00:42:50.770 --> 00:42:51.700 align:middle line:90%
to get this done?

00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:52.500 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: Totally.

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:54.490 align:middle line:84%
So for example, when we
talk to our colleagues

00:42:54.490 --> 00:42:58.420 align:middle line:84%
in big finance, what they
tell us, there is $40 trillion

00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:00.940 align:middle line:90%
in finance, hedge funds.

00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:02.705 align:middle line:90%
You know the whole story.

00:43:02.705 --> 00:43:04.080 align:middle line:84%
You know what that
money's doing?

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:05.480 align:middle line:90%
It's just sitting there.

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:06.280 align:middle line:90%
It's just sitting.

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:07.730 align:middle line:90%
It's not working.

00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:11.360 align:middle line:84%
So as finance moves,
the world moves.

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:12.340 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:14.500 align:middle line:90%
Politics follows the money.

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:16.600 align:middle line:84%
So our colleagues
in big finance are

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:20.920 align:middle line:84%
saying, if you're telling us
that there is a huge investment

00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:23.290 align:middle line:84%
opportunity in
climate mitigation,

00:43:23.290 --> 00:43:25.600 align:middle line:84%
we're going to steer
our funds toward it.

00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:28.990 align:middle line:84%
Give us the studies to show
us the return on investment

00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:31.910 align:middle line:84%
because we're not getting
any return on investment now.

00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:33.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, not at all.

00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:34.970 align:middle line:84%
It's a losing
proposition, isn't it?

00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:36.250 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: And why is that?

00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:38.470 align:middle line:84%
Because those dollars
are in computer

00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:41.652 align:middle line:84%
files sitting on disk somewhere,
and they're not working.

00:43:41.652 --> 00:43:43.360 align:middle line:84%
What was great about
the moon shots, what

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:46.810 align:middle line:84%
was great about America,
money was out there working.

00:43:46.810 --> 00:43:48.330 align:middle line:90%
It was in people's hands.

00:43:48.330 --> 00:43:50.260 align:middle line:84%
We were building freeways
and shopping malls.

00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:51.340 align:middle line:90%
We're developing.

00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:54.190 align:middle line:84%
The money was circulating
through the workforce.

00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:56.500 align:middle line:84%
If we do that again,
we'll employ everybody.

00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:57.800 align:middle line:90%
We'll transform the globe.

00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:58.600 align:middle line:90%
Jobs.

00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:01.030 align:middle line:84%
We'll do what we did in
the 20th century, which

00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:02.440 align:middle line:90%
was just remarkable.

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:05.320 align:middle line:84%
We'll restart the economic
engine of the Earth

00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:09.880 align:middle line:84%
if we put those dollars into
work, into people's labor.

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:12.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
the silver spire?

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:14.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: So that was a vision
I had at the top of the show

00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:16.940 align:middle line:84%
we talked about how I
did thought experiments

00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:17.740 align:middle line:90%
as a little kid.

00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:20.080 align:middle line:84%
I was a dreamy kid,
believing that there

00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:23.050 align:middle line:84%
was kind of an intelligent,
ethereal field I

00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:24.825 align:middle line:90%
could communicate with.

00:44:24.825 --> 00:44:26.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, one night
a couple of years

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:30.250 align:middle line:84%
ago, I was sitting at
the coast at Moss Beach.

00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:32.960 align:middle line:84%
You've probably been there,
in Northern California.

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:34.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I have not been there.

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:36.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: Beautiful
sunset was happening.

00:44:36.830 --> 00:44:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And I did what I do in my
etheral practice, which

00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:42.120 align:middle line:90%
as I communicated with it.

00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:45.810 align:middle line:84%
I said, hey, universe-- you
know, the stars are coming out.

00:44:45.810 --> 00:44:47.980 align:middle line:84%
I said, hey,
universe, we're here.

00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:48.780 align:middle line:90%
We're here.

00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:50.430 align:middle line:90%
We're rare.

00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:51.450 align:middle line:90%
We're incredibly rare.

00:44:51.450 --> 00:44:52.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're a gem.

00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:53.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: We're a gem.

00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And I asked it, please
pay attention to us.

00:44:56.490 --> 00:44:59.560 align:middle line:84%
If you're out there,
we need some help here.

00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:00.390 align:middle line:90%
We need some help.

00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:02.850 align:middle line:84%
We could use some
guidance or some kind

00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:04.480 align:middle line:90%
of probabilistic shaping.

00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And what appeared
in my consciousness

00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:10.740 align:middle line:84%
was this almost
icicle-like silver spire.

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And it showed me
how life was made,

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:14.970 align:middle line:90%
and where we are in life now.

00:45:14.970 --> 00:45:18.030 align:middle line:84%
It showed the cosmo genesis
making atoms, making geology,

00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:20.730 align:middle line:84%
making hot spring,
making biofilms.

00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And as the sun rose and set and
rose and set and rose and set,

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:25.080 align:middle line:90%
it drove evolution.

00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:26.790 align:middle line:84%
That's the sole
process that made

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:29.670 align:middle line:84%
us, is the Earth
turning to face the sun.

00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:31.860 align:middle line:84%
Energy comes and
drives everything

00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:34.150 align:middle line:84%
through this
probabilistic cycle.

00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And then it showed me this
little eye that opened,

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:39.810 align:middle line:84%
which was self-awareness, the
first creatures that were aware

00:45:39.810 --> 00:45:42.150 align:middle line:84%
that they were
creatures, and that we

00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:47.520 align:middle line:84%
are in the super hyper cycling
phase of massive progress,

00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:50.730 align:middle line:84%
of massive stresses
and development

00:45:50.730 --> 00:45:53.700 align:middle line:84%
and insights and
healings and technology.

00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:56.040 align:middle line:84%
And we're in there,
and that just above us

00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:58.890 align:middle line:84%
is this ignition point
of total self-awareness

00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:00.870 align:middle line:90%
they call unity consciousness.

00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have helpers,
I believe angelic helpers.

00:46:04.090 --> 00:46:08.100 align:middle line:84%
There's a higher power that
influences things that we

00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:09.930 align:middle line:90%
go through all the time.

00:46:09.930 --> 00:46:14.250 align:middle line:84%
Will they step in and bail
us out at the right time?

00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:17.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: I believe that
they're working with us already

00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:20.940 align:middle line:84%
in that if you, in your
life, move through your life,

00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:22.920 align:middle line:90%
you get signs all the time.

00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:27.150 align:middle line:84%
That's actually almost the
definition of angelic helpers,

00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:30.360 align:middle line:84%
or insights, or many cultures
have different descriptions

00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:31.500 align:middle line:90%
for them.

00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:32.910 align:middle line:90%
And that you see signs.

00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:36.270 align:middle line:10%
And my belief, and my
spiritual practice and path,

00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:38.700 align:middle line:10%
is to pay attention
to the signs that

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:41.820 align:middle line:10%
are coming from the
bigger field, this bigger,

00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:43.500 align:middle line:10%
magnificent thing
that we're inside.

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:43.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:45.318 align:middle line:84%
You just got to be
able to read it.

00:46:45.318 --> 00:46:47.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMER: Read it and
follow its instruction.

00:46:47.970 --> 00:46:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And it will lead
you to, in my case,

00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:53.290 align:middle line:84%
the discovery of how the origin
of life may have occurred.

00:46:53.290 --> 00:46:56.440 align:middle line:10%
That's unlikely in a human
lifetime to get there,

00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:59.730 align:middle line:10%
to get to that very
point of that solution.

00:46:59.730 --> 00:47:00.900 align:middle line:90%
It's almost like a miracle.

00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:02.525 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I hope
we can get to it.

00:47:02.525 --> 00:47:06.870 align:middle line:84%
We probably need about another
10 million Dr. Bruce Damers

00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:08.460 align:middle line:90%
to get this done.

00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:10.770 align:middle line:90%
But at least we have one.

00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:13.050 align:middle line:84%
Bruce, thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief".

00:47:13.050 --> 00:47:14.317 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMER: My pleasure, George.
