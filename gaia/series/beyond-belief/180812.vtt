00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:24.469 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.469 --> 00:00:26.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.220 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.210 align:middle line:10%
In this program, we are going
to be seeking the truth.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.280 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we look for that
in every "Beyond Belief" show.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.400 align:middle line:84%
But Frank Chile
does exactly that.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.150 align:middle line:84%
He goes out and
looks for the truth.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.987 align:middle line:84%
Is it difficult, Frank,
to find the truth?

00:00:41.987 --> 00:00:43.570 align:middle line:10%
>>FRANK CHILLE: No,
all you have to be

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.910 align:middle line:10%
is open and receptive
and willing to listen.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
started this journey,

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.760 align:middle line:84%
which was in the '60s, what was
the impetus that got you going?

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: I was
driving along route 130

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.780 align:middle line:84%
in New Jersey in the
Cinnaminson area,

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.780 align:middle line:84%
and I was drawn to go
into a bookstore I'd never

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:02.742 align:middle line:90%
been in before.

00:01:02.742 --> 00:01:05.200 align:middle line:84%
I went into this bookstore,
and I start walking up and down

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.490 align:middle line:90%
the aisles of books.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And I stopped in front of a
section of metaphysical books,

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.260 align:middle line:84%
and one book started
to vibrate towards me

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.600 align:middle line:90%
like a wanted me to pick it up.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.990 align:middle line:84%
It was called
"From Outer Space,"

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.230 align:middle line:84%
by Howard Menger, a contactee
from North Jersey, who

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.760 align:middle line:84%
had an experience
as a young child--

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.770 align:middle line:90%
about the age of five or six.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.830 align:middle line:84%
And he started having
meetings with these visitors.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And after the war, he
had meetings at his home

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.242 align:middle line:90%
in High Bridge, New Jersey.

00:01:28.242 --> 00:01:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And at one of the
meetings, Valient Thorr

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.140 align:middle line:84%
happened to be there
with three visitors.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.720 align:middle line:84%
Photographs were taken
by a photographer

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.730 align:middle line:90%
by the name of August Roberts.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And these photographs have
gotten wide recognition

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.880 align:middle line:90%
since that.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.624 align:middle line:84%
I started to feel
enticed with it,

00:01:44.624 --> 00:01:47.290 align:middle line:84%
wanting to know more about these
space beings and these visitors

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.873 align:middle line:84%
that look like us,
who are coming here

00:01:48.873 --> 00:01:50.950 align:middle line:84%
on humanitarian
purposes, helping

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.470 align:middle line:84%
to elevate our
consciousness and awareness.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And a couple weeks later, I
was drawn to the same bookstore

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.950 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'm walking up and
down the aisles of books,

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.230 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not picking up anything.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready to walk out.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.180 align:middle line:84%
I passed by the cash
register, and there's

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.670 align:middle line:90%
a little holder of postcards.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And a postcard had
a picture of a UFO.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And I flipped it
over, and it said,

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.660 align:middle line:84%
this is one of a series
of seven photographs taken

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.890 align:middle line:84%
by Paul Villa outside
of Albuquerque,

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.040 align:middle line:90%
New Mexico in 1963.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.070 align:middle line:84%
To learn further uncensored
truths about UFOs,

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.160 align:middle line:84%
contact this organization
called Del Valle UFO,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.630 align:middle line:84%
which meets in the
Cinnaminson, New

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:26.920 align:middle line:90%
Jersey at the public library.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.890 align:middle line:84%
So I contacted the president,
found out when they meet.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And I started attending
meetings there.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.312 align:middle line:84%
And I started
meeting contactees--

00:02:33.312 --> 00:02:34.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you were hooked.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.644 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: And I was hooked.

00:02:35.644 --> 00:02:37.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You mentioned
Valient Thorr.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.350 align:middle line:84%
He purportedly was
from Venus, came here

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.310 align:middle line:84%
to try to give the Eisenhower
administration information

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.350 align:middle line:90%
to make things better for us.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.990 align:middle line:84%
They kind of told him,
we're not interested.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.180 align:middle line:84%
How realistic do you
think that story is?

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.551 align:middle line:90%
Written by Frank Stranges.

00:02:53.551 --> 00:02:55.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: I happened
to meet Dr. Stranges.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.320 align:middle line:10%
I met him and his wife.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.740 align:middle line:10%
I got a chance to talk to them
backstage after several events

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.260 align:middle line:10%
regarding their experiences
with Valient Thorr.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.350 align:middle line:84%
I feel his three years that
he spent at the Pentagon

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.270 align:middle line:84%
did not end his relationship
here on this planet.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.230 align:middle line:84%
He was going through
four 10-year phase

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.830 align:middle line:90%
programs since that point.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And I could go into that
with you if you'd like.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:15.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.876 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: The first
10-year period

00:03:16.876 --> 00:03:19.840 align:middle line:84%
was to contact world
leaders around the world

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.590 align:middle line:84%
to tell them that there are
visitors from other planets

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.210 align:middle line:84%
who are working
down here, and they

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.610 align:middle line:84%
want these governments to come
forward and share information.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.610 align:middle line:84%
Over a 10-year period,
none of the world leaders

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:31.818 align:middle line:90%
were willing to come forward.

00:03:31.818 --> 00:03:34.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't think
they believed the story.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:35.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: Maybe they didn't
want to believe the story.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or maybe
they didn't want to.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.696 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: The
second 10-year phase

00:03:38.696 --> 00:03:40.430 align:middle line:84%
was to contact religious
leaders from all

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.920 align:middle line:84%
over the world of
major religions

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.420 align:middle line:84%
to introduce to
them that there are

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.130 align:middle line:90%
visitors that are coming here.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Stranges
was asked, what did

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.060 align:middle line:84%
the Pope say when he
was asked about this?

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And the word came back from
Valient Thorr to Dr. Stranges

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.460 align:middle line:84%
was, the Pope said you row
your boat, we'll row ours.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.500 align:middle line:90%
So that went nowhere.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.040 align:middle line:84%
The next 10-year
phase was contacting

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.050 align:middle line:84%
heads of universities and
colleges around the world,

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.594 align:middle line:84%
introducing this
concept to them,

00:04:10.594 --> 00:04:11.760 align:middle line:90%
asking them to come forward.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.890 align:middle line:84%
And none of them would
be willing to do that.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.440 align:middle line:84%
The fourth and last phase,
which we're in right now,

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.930 align:middle line:84%
is contacting and
elevating consciousness

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.080 align:middle line:84%
at a grassroots level, which
is ongoing and continuous.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, they say
Valient Thorr is here still.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.290 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: Still.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.500 align:middle line:90%
He's never left.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where's his craft?

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: Supposedly
above Lake Mead, outside

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.300 align:middle line:90%
of Henderson, Nevada.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.610 align:middle line:84%
We do have a color
photograph of that craft.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.030 align:middle line:90%
Its 100 feet in diameter.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.640 align:middle line:90%
It's called Victor 1.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.450 align:middle line:84%
I happened to meet a Naval
commander who participated

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.870 align:middle line:84%
in two crash retrievals, where
he flew Colonel General George

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.950 align:middle line:84%
Marshall-- one to
Iceland and one to Utah.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.250 align:middle line:84%
He had contacted Dr.
Stranges, wanting

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.880 align:middle line:84%
to know if he can get a
copy of Valient Thorr's

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.830 align:middle line:90%
craft, a blueprint of it.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.780 align:middle line:84%
And Valient Thorr made
it available to him,

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.624 align:middle line:84%
but Dr. Stranges told
Commander Bethune,

00:05:05.624 --> 00:05:07.790 align:middle line:84%
you have to come to my home
in Van Nuys, California.

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.680 align:middle line:90%
I cannot mail this to you.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.420 align:middle line:90%
He went out Van Nuys.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:12.980 align:middle line:90%
He got the blueprint.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.080 align:middle line:84%
When he came back to New
Jersey, he contacted me.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.280 align:middle line:84%
He said, Frank, you
have to meet me.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.571 align:middle line:90%
You have to see this blueprint.

00:05:17.571 --> 00:05:20.734 align:middle line:84%
It was an incredible blueprint
of the inside of the craft.

00:05:20.734 --> 00:05:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Frank, Paula
Harris-- you know Paula?

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:23.483 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: Yes, I do.

00:05:23.483 --> 00:05:26.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Great a Italo-American
UFO investigator.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.080 align:middle line:10%
I had a chance to talk to Peter
Davenport from the National UFO

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.450 align:middle line:10%
Reporting Center, and
he said he has never

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.750 align:middle line:10%
seen a time where he is getting
more reports into the UFO

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.470 align:middle line:10%
center about UFOs and sightings.

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.730 align:middle line:84%
I think one of several
things might be happening.

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:44.510 align:middle line:84%
One, maybe we're
testing a lot of drones,

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.510 align:middle line:84%
and people are seeing these
strange objects in the sky.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.540 align:middle line:84%
Or two, we're getting
more visitations.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.400 align:middle line:84%
If we're getting
more visitations,

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.622 align:middle line:84%
Paula, what do you
think is going on?

00:05:54.622 --> 00:05:57.080 align:middle line:84%
>>PAULA HARRIS: Well, I think
there is a third one, George,

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.700 align:middle line:84%
and that is there
is an awareness.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.710 align:middle line:84%
Because if all those people were
looking into the live streaming

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.305 align:middle line:84%
of the citizen hearing,
there could be more awareness

00:06:06.305 --> 00:06:08.224 align:middle line:90%
of looking up to the skies.

00:06:08.224 --> 00:06:09.640 align:middle line:84%
What do I think
is going on there?

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.040 align:middle line:90%
There's a heightened awareness.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.060 align:middle line:90%
And of course, we have drones.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure, many.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:15.410 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Many.

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.520 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Alitalia
pilot-- and I have to say,

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.070 align:middle line:90%
he was an Italian pilot--

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.075 align:middle line:84%
that reported the drone
near JFK when he flew--

00:06:23.075 --> 00:06:24.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It almost hit him.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: It almost hit him.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.340 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking, was
that really a drone?

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.840 align:middle line:90%
What could that have been?

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.260 align:middle line:90%
Are they calling UFO'S drones?

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.960 align:middle line:84%
How do we know the difference
between a drone and a UFO?

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:41.090 align:middle line:84%
So that gets to be in my area
of exo-politics-- our stuff

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:42.290 align:middle line:90%
or their stuff?

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.410 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, maybe
there's more drones.

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.680 align:middle line:84%
And then the idea that there
could be more sightings

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.010 align:middle line:90%
if people are more aware of it.

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:53.510 align:middle line:90%
They're looking up in the skies.

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:56.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why does it seem,
Frank, that government still

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.840 align:middle line:84%
doesn't want to disclose
things that you've researched,

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.670 align:middle line:84%
Paula's researched, and
so many other people?

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:05.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: I think it's a
question of giving up power.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.870 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to be considered
small fish in a big pond.

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.880 align:middle line:84%
They want to be big
fish in a small pond.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now how have you
gone about your investigations

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.950 align:middle line:90%
of contactees?

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: Through
social meetings,

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.480 align:middle line:84%
meeting people in
environments where

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.270 align:middle line:84%
I have to go somewhere for a
work orientation, where I'm

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:26.000 align:middle line:90%
going somewhere for pleasure.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And I always find that I'm
in an environment, where

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.600 align:middle line:84%
I'll meet somebody, and I'll
be open and receptive to them,

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.860 align:middle line:90%
sharing information with me.

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.805 align:middle line:84%
And I may ask them a question or
two about paramilitary service,

00:07:36.805 --> 00:07:40.040 align:middle line:84%
if they've ever seen or
experienced anything unusual.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And I find that when
you're non-judgemental

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.901 align:middle line:84%
towards these individuals, it
seems to open up a floodgate.

00:07:44.901 --> 00:07:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And they want to
talk, and they want

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.690 align:middle line:90%
to share information with you.

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:48.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:49.799 align:middle line:84%
Because they've been
ridiculed so long.

00:07:49.799 --> 00:07:50.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: Yes, they have.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was part of
the interrupted journey

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.160 align:middle line:90%
that John Fuller wrote about.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.430 align:middle line:84%
and I remember an article
my mother brought me back

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:00.840 align:middle line:90%
in the '60s--

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.130 align:middle line:90%
"Look Magazine."

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:03.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: Incident and Exeter.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:06.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did that
whole story about them.

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:09.750 align:middle line:90%
And I was just mesmerized by it.

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:13.290 align:middle line:84%
It was one of the reasons
I went into broadcasting.

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:16.320 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to uncover
these kinds of stories.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And when I was a 21-year-old
radio reporter in Detroit,

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:23.520 align:middle line:84%
one of my first interviews
was with Stanton Friedman,

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.960 align:middle line:90%
the ufologist.

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.000 align:middle line:84%
But I also had a
chance to interview

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.890 align:middle line:84%
the psychiatrist of Barney
and Betty Hill, Dr. Benjamin

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:34.530 align:middle line:90%
Simon out of Boston.

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:36.419 align:middle line:84%
And I'm interviewing
him over the phone,

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:37.409 align:middle line:90%
and we're recording it.

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:38.820 align:middle line:90%
I can't find that tape today.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.679 align:middle line:90%
I've been looking everywhere.

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:42.299 align:middle line:90%
I have it somewhere.

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:43.799 align:middle line:90%
And I asked him specifically.

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:47.640 align:middle line:84%
I said, Doctor, I have to
ask you, were they lying?

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.680 align:middle line:90%
And he said, no.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.550 align:middle line:90%
Let me preface this, George.

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:54.460 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
happened to them.

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.440 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what they saw.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:00.190 align:middle line:84%
But under hypnosis,
separately, both of them

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:05.320 align:middle line:84%
told me this incredible story of
seeing a saucer, aliens coming

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:08.080 align:middle line:84%
to take them, putting
them on the ship,

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.480 align:middle line:90%
doing experiments on them.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:15.040 align:middle line:84%
Whatever happened to
them, they believe it.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.960 align:middle line:90%
They're telling the truth.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's how he
left it with me.

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:22.337 align:middle line:84%
And it was a wow factor story,
Frank, for the rest of my life.

00:09:22.337 --> 00:09:23.170 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: Of course.

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:26.200 align:middle line:10%
And the star map
that Betty drew was

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:33.130 align:middle line:10%
a complete overlay of the star
system that really exists.

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:37.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are we
still having resistance,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.560 align:middle line:90%
even in the media today?

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.300 align:middle line:84%
They're a little better
than what they used to be,

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:44.525 align:middle line:84%
but they still seem to hold back
on these incredible stories.

00:09:44.525 --> 00:09:46.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: You know,
I feel that's still

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:50.174 align:middle line:84%
part of the clamping down
and keeping quiet of getting

00:09:50.174 --> 00:09:51.090 align:middle line:90%
information out there.

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:54.490 align:middle line:84%
But I feel that the
move towards disclosure

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:58.250 align:middle line:84%
is moving at a more accelerated
pace than ever before.

00:09:58.250 --> 00:09:59.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm being told by
individuals that

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:04.090 align:middle line:84%
are close to scientists and
physicists that are being made

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:06.340 align:middle line:84%
aware of this information
of the technology that's

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:09.160 align:middle line:84%
going to be released that
they're going to be in support

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.860 align:middle line:84%
of the information that's going
to be revealed to the public,

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:14.380 align:middle line:84%
so that there'll be a
basis of understanding

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:17.230 align:middle line:84%
that the scientific community
may not be able to duplicate

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:20.860 align:middle line:84%
what they've done, but they
can sense and understand

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:22.810 align:middle line:84%
that there's advanced
science and advanced

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:25.730 align:middle line:84%
physics behind this that
is, indeed, possible

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:28.120 align:middle line:84%
that others with more
advanced knowledge can have.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We'll get into
some of your contactee cases

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:31.820 align:middle line:90%
that you've looked at.

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:35.560 align:middle line:84%
But it seems like
in the older days,

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:40.180 align:middle line:84%
we had more higher profile
UFO sightings and stories.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.820 align:middle line:10%
I think of Lonnie
Zamora, the lake police

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:45.670 align:middle line:10%
officer from Socorro,
New Mexico, all

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:47.830 align:middle line:10%
these incredible stories even.

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:50.650 align:middle line:84%
Dr. J. Allen Hynek, who headed
up the Project Blue Book

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:54.880 align:middle line:84%
case, who ended up being a
believer in UFOs when he said

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.900 align:middle line:84%
his swamp gas
theory back in the,

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:01.360 align:middle line:90%
I guess, late '60s, early '70s.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:04.210 align:middle line:84%
We used to have that kind
of publicity all the time.

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:05.410 align:middle line:90%
We don't seem to have that.

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:06.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: No, we don't.

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:07.050 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:09.700 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be more
alternative news

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:12.520 align:middle line:84%
than ever before but there's
a lot of individual sharing

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.570 align:middle line:84%
information at a
grassroots level

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:16.360 align:middle line:84%
I was talking
about before, where

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.500 align:middle line:90%
people are coming forward.

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And if they feel that
you're open and receptive,

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.520 align:middle line:84%
they will share
information with you.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And some extraordinary
stories are coming out.

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:25.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us
about your research,

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.293 align:middle line:90%
and what do you do specifically?

00:11:27.293 --> 00:11:31.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: Well, when I first
started joining Del Valle UFO,

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:35.140 align:middle line:84%
I met what I consider to be
the grandfather of UFO context.

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:36.280 align:middle line:90%
His name was Albert Coe.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:41.980 align:middle line:10%
He had an experience in
1920 on a canoe trip.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:46.470 align:middle line:84%
He went on a canoe trip in
the Mattawa River in Canada,

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:48.880 align:middle line:84%
the border of Canada
and New York state.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:52.970 align:middle line:84%
And he was 16 years
of age at the time.

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And he only released the
story in the late '60s.

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.730 align:middle line:84%
He was given the release
of this by the visitors.

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:01.990 align:middle line:84%
But they reached a part
in their canoe trip

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:03.450 align:middle line:84%
where they couldn't
traverse down

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:06.100 align:middle line:90%
the river because of rapids.

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:10.810 align:middle line:84%
So his friend took one branch
of the river and followed that.

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And Albert took another
branch of the river.

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:15.954 align:middle line:84%
And he's walking
along the river bank,

00:12:15.954 --> 00:12:17.620 align:middle line:84%
and he hears this
voice saying, help me.

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.850 align:middle line:84%
Please, somebody
help me, help me.

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And he doesn't know where
this voice is coming from.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.350 align:middle line:84%
He thought it was
coming from the woods.

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:24.820 align:middle line:84%
So he walked closer
to the woods,

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:29.119 align:middle line:84%
and the voice got more
quiet, more faint.

00:12:29.119 --> 00:12:30.910 align:middle line:84%
He walked back towards
the riverbank again,

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:32.350 align:middle line:90%
and he heard it louder.

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:34.030 align:middle line:84%
And he looked down
into a crevice,

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:36.970 align:middle line:84%
and he saw a young fella who
appeared to be maybe 18 or 19

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:40.060 align:middle line:84%
years of age, who was wearing
a one-piece suit, where

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:42.700 align:middle line:84%
the boots and the clothing
was all part of one.

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:44.590 align:middle line:90%
It was all attached.

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:47.020 align:middle line:84%
He had long blond
hair, and he had

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:49.390 align:middle line:84%
a belt that had
lights on the belt,

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:51.130 align:middle line:90%
and they appeared to be broken.

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:52.630 align:middle line:84%
Albert jumped down
into the crevice,

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:54.940 align:middle line:84%
and he said, thank
God you heard me.

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.720 align:middle line:84%
He said, I've fallen,
and I can't get up.

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:57.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: And Albert
saw that the fellow

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:03.190 align:middle line:84%
had been wedged against the wall
of the crevice and a boulder.

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:05.020 align:middle line:90%
So he tried to raise him up.

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:05.990 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't do it.

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:07.531 align:middle line:84%
And he said, wait
here just a minute.

00:13:07.531 --> 00:13:09.160 align:middle line:84%
He had an ax and
a piece of rope.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.986 align:middle line:84%
He cut down the sapling, and
he put together a little hoist,

00:13:12.986 --> 00:13:15.520 align:middle line:90%
and he hoisted the fellow up.

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And he said, how
did you get here?

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:20.350 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, I
came here to fish.

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:21.850 align:middle line:84%
And Albert didn't
see a fishing rod.

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:24.187 align:middle line:84%
He saw a wand that
was about this long.

00:13:24.187 --> 00:13:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And the fellow said,
this is my fishing rod.

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:26.853 align:middle line:90%
And it had a button.

00:13:26.853 --> 00:13:28.728 align:middle line:84%
He touched the button,
and it telescoped out.

00:13:28.728 --> 00:13:29.561 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Expandable.

00:13:29.561 --> 00:13:31.017 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: Expandable
fishing rod.

00:13:31.017 --> 00:13:32.350 align:middle line:90%
And he didn't see a boat around.

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:33.600 align:middle line:90%
He said, how did you get here?

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.920 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, my
father has a plane.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.540 align:middle line:84%
He's an inventor, and he
let me borrow his plane.

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:40.200 align:middle line:90%
Now this is 1920.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.190 align:middle line:90%
This is a biplane era.

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:43.190 align:middle line:90%
Albert's looking around.

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:44.160 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't see any airfield.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:45.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
no plane, right?

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:45.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: No.

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:46.900 align:middle line:90%
He says, where's your plane?

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.310 align:middle line:84%
He said, it's back
in the wood line.

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:49.930 align:middle line:84%
He said, there's a
clearing back there.

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:51.096 align:middle line:90%
He said, help me to my feet.

00:13:51.096 --> 00:13:53.800 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'll be able
to get back to my plane.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.180 align:middle line:90%
He had broken his leg.

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:58.930 align:middle line:90%
Albert put a--

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:00.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Cast.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.985 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: Not a cast, but he put
a piece of wood, a brace on it,

00:14:02.985 --> 00:14:05.110 align:middle line:84%
helped him to his feet,
and he took a couple steps.

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:07.270 align:middle line:84%
The fellow couldn't walk
more than a couple steps.

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you're not going
to be able to make it back

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:09.580 align:middle line:90%
to your plane.

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:10.380 align:middle line:90%
Let me help you.

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:12.550 align:middle line:84%
And the fellow said to
him, I'll let you help me,

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:16.090 align:middle line:84%
but you must promise me
not to reveal what you

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:18.640 align:middle line:90%
see about my father's plane.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:19.900 align:middle line:90%
And Albert said, all right.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:21.525 align:middle line:84%
So they walked back
into the wood line.

00:14:21.525 --> 00:14:24.190 align:middle line:84%
They walked maybe
50, 75 yards back.

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:26.950 align:middle line:84%
They get to the base
of a little hill.

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:30.220 align:middle line:84%
At the base of the hill,
this fellow says to Albert,

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:32.710 align:middle line:84%
my little plane is going
to be above the other side

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:34.060 align:middle line:90%
of this hill in a clearing.

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And he said, remember
your promise.

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.030 align:middle line:90%
So Albert said, all right.

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:38.380 align:middle line:90%
They get to the top of the hill.

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:39.780 align:middle line:90%
They look into a clearing.

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:43.874 align:middle line:84%
It's maybe 100 feet in diameter,
and there's a disk there.

00:14:43.874 --> 00:14:45.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just sitting there.

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: Just sitting there
on a tripod, on three legs.

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:50.060 align:middle line:84%
And he said, it looked like
one saucer on top of another.

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:51.340 align:middle line:90%
And he said it was silver.

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:54.610 align:middle line:84%
And he said was maybe
50, 60 feet in diameter.

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:57.930 align:middle line:84%
So the fellow says to Albert,
that's my little plane.

00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:59.470 align:middle line:90%
Help me over to it.

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:02.290 align:middle line:84%
So Albert helped him over
to the side of the craft.

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:06.460 align:middle line:84%
And he touched underneath of it,
and the bottom part of the ship

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:08.980 align:middle line:84%
opened up, like a
portal opened up.

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And he said to Albert, I can't
get into the ship myself.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.830 align:middle line:90%
He said, can you boost me up?

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:16.150 align:middle line:90%
And Albert said, sure.

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:19.600 align:middle line:84%
So he hoisted him up into
the ship, into the craft.

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And he said, he saw
lighting inside of it.

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:22.450 align:middle line:90%
He saw monitors there.

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:24.250 align:middle line:90%
And he said he saw seats.

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And he said, he never saw
anything like this in his life.

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:28.754 align:middle line:84%
So the fellow said
to Albert, I'm

00:15:28.754 --> 00:15:29.920 align:middle line:90%
going to start my plane now.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.660 align:middle line:84%
He said, go to the
edge of the clearing.

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:33.451 align:middle line:84%
He said, there's going
to be some vibration

00:15:33.451 --> 00:15:34.870 align:middle line:84%
and some turbulence
from my plane.

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:37.452 align:middle line:84%
He said, I don't want
you to be affected by it.

00:15:37.452 --> 00:15:39.910 align:middle line:84%
So Albert walked to the edge,
he said, thank you very much.

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:41.175 align:middle line:90%
They shook hands.

00:15:41.175 --> 00:15:43.072 align:middle line:84%
Albert walked to the
edge of the clearing,

00:15:43.072 --> 00:15:44.280 align:middle line:90%
and he heard a low vibration.

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.910 align:middle line:84%
It continued to
increase in intensity.

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And then gradually, the craft
lifted up off the ground.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:53.670 align:middle line:84%
The three legs receded
inside the craft,

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:55.930 align:middle line:84%
and it took off like
it wasn't even there.

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And Albert thought,
what did I do?

00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:00.160 align:middle line:90%
Did I just daydream all this?

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.830 align:middle line:84%
But before the
fellow left, he said,

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:04.800 align:middle line:84%
there's a place where you could
portage across to the river.

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:08.310 align:middle line:84%
It's about a quarter
mile downstream.

00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And he said, remember that
when you meet with your friend.

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.370 align:middle line:84%
So he met with his friend, and
his friend saw the same place

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:17.760 align:middle line:84%
that this visitor had said
where they could portage across.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.860 align:middle line:84%
So they continued on
their camping trip.

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:23.400 align:middle line:84%
And at night, they stopped,
they built a camp fire.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.552 align:middle line:90%
They set their tent up.

00:16:24.552 --> 00:16:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And Albert's friend
said, I'm going

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:29.610 align:middle line:84%
to write a letter that we could
drop off at the post office

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:31.355 align:middle line:90%
when we get to the next town.

00:16:31.355 --> 00:16:33.730 align:middle line:84%
And Albert said, I'm going to
stand here by the campfire.

00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:36.892 align:middle line:84%
So he's facing the river, and
he's looking at the night sky.

00:16:36.892 --> 00:16:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And he said, there's all
these beautiful stars.

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And he's thinking about
the activity of the day.

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And he says to himself,
did I dream what I just

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:46.490 align:middle line:90%
experienced this day?

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:49.550 align:middle line:84%
Just as he was thinking that,
he saw the craft, George,

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:52.010 align:middle line:84%
above the river, and it
started tilting back and forth

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:53.660 align:middle line:90%
like it was waving hello.

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:54.980 align:middle line:90%
He waved back to it.

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:56.930 align:middle line:84%
It did that a couple
more times and then just

00:16:56.930 --> 00:17:01.170 align:middle line:84%
took off into the night sky
like it had been a star.

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:02.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a story.

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:06.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: He knew at that
point that it wasn't a dream.

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:08.609 align:middle line:84%
So they finished
their camping trip.

00:17:08.609 --> 00:17:10.931 align:middle line:84%
About a month or two later,
about two months later,

00:17:10.931 --> 00:17:12.180 align:middle line:90%
he got a postcard in the mail.

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And it said, if you'd like to
continue the adventure that we

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:20.109 align:middle line:84%
had when you met me
along the river bank,

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:22.990 align:middle line:84%
meet me at the Hastings
Hotel in Hastings, New York.

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:24.609 align:middle line:90%
And it gave a date and a time.

00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And it said, at the
bottom, your friend, Zret--

00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:28.750 align:middle line:90%
signed Z-R-E-T.

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:31.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That sounds
extraterrestrial to me.

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:33.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: So Albert
told his mother

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:35.875 align:middle line:84%
that he was going to be meeting
somebody at the Hastings Hotel.

00:17:35.875 --> 00:17:37.630 align:middle line:84%
Remember, he was
16 years of age.

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:41.140 align:middle line:84%
1920-- he goes, he gets
up early, gets dressed.

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.210 align:middle line:84%
He goes into the lobby,
and he's wondering,

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:44.825 align:middle line:90%
will I recognize this person?

00:17:44.825 --> 00:17:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And he said, as he's thinking
that, the fellow walks over

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.910 align:middle line:84%
to him, and his
hair is cut short.

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:51.910 align:middle line:84%
He's wearing clothes
of the era, 1920.

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And he said to Albert,
I have my car outside.

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:57.730 align:middle line:84%
He said, would you like to take
a ride with me and go fishing?

00:17:57.730 --> 00:17:58.755 align:middle line:90%
And Albert said, yes.

00:17:58.755 --> 00:18:00.630 align:middle line:84%
So they're driving in
the car, and the fellow

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:01.750 align:middle line:90%
says, how's your family?

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:02.650 align:middle line:90%
How's school?

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:03.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a normal car?

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:05.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: A normal car.

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:08.500 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I'm going to
take you to an isolated area,

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:10.190 align:middle line:90%
and we're going to go fishing.

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:11.620 align:middle line:84%
So Albert's bursting
at the seams.

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:13.630 align:middle line:84%
He wants to find
out, who is this guy?

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:15.813 align:middle line:90%
What is this plane?

00:18:15.813 --> 00:18:19.450 align:middle line:90%
So they park the car.

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:21.730 align:middle line:84%
He brought a
regular fishing rod.

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And they both have their
fishing poles in the water,

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:26.970 align:middle line:84%
and there's a log
floating down the stream.

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And there's these turtles
running to the edge of the log

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:31.720 align:middle line:90%
and dropping off into the water.

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And the fellow says to
Albert, look at those turtles.

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:35.880 align:middle line:90%
They're a lot like humanity.

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:37.005 align:middle line:90%
They're a lot like mankind.

00:18:37.005 --> 00:18:39.629 align:middle line:84%
They run to the edge of the log,
and they continue to fall off.

00:18:39.629 --> 00:18:41.740 align:middle line:84%
And they do the same
thing over and over again.

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:45.100 align:middle line:84%
At that, jaw Albert
couldn't hold back anymore.

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:47.552 align:middle line:84%
And he said, what do you
mean, humanity's like turtles,

00:18:47.552 --> 00:18:49.760 align:middle line:84%
and they're doing the same
thing over and over again?

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And he said, where did
you get that little plane?

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:53.481 align:middle line:90%
Where's that little plane from?

00:18:53.481 --> 00:18:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I know you
have a lot of questions.

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:58.270 align:middle line:84%
He said, I had to get
permission to tell you this.

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:00.250 align:middle line:90%
He said, I'm not from here.

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:03.590 align:middle line:90%
He said, I'm a visitor.

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:06.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm from another star system.

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:09.400 align:middle line:84%
We came to earth some
50,000 years ago.

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:15.300 align:middle line:84%
He said, I have a civilization
that we live on in Mars.

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:16.310 align:middle line:90%
I had to get permission.

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:17.680 align:middle line:90%
You saved my life.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:20.890 align:middle line:84%
By you saving my life, they gave
me permission to share my story

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:23.710 align:middle line:84%
with you, but you cannot
share this with anybody else.

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:26.150 align:middle line:84%
He said, you must
keep this quiet.

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:29.900 align:middle line:84%
So it started a series of
discussion and interactions

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:32.420 align:middle line:84%
that Albert had throughout
the rest of his life.

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:35.750 align:middle line:84%
And believe it or not, when
he got a little bit older,

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:39.530 align:middle line:84%
he was part of the film
crew for Howard Hughes's

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:44.150 align:middle line:84%
film about the planes
during the First World War.

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:46.430 align:middle line:84%
He had developed one
of the camera lenses

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:50.930 align:middle line:84%
that they used in filming
the dogfights for that film.

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:54.620 align:middle line:84%
He got a patent for that, and it
made Albert's life a little bit

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:56.090 align:middle line:90%
more comfortable, George.

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And he continued to interact
with these space visitors.

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:02.750 align:middle line:84%
They appeared to be
in their late teens

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:04.447 align:middle line:84%
to no more than maybe
24, 25 years old.

00:20:04.447 --> 00:20:05.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So almost like his age.

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:07.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: Almost like his age.

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:08.840 align:middle line:84%
But of course, he
continued to age.

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And they told him that
they had come here

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:15.320 align:middle line:84%
from another star system,
where they were having problems

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:17.270 align:middle line:90%
with not having enough water.

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:18.620 align:middle line:90%
And they did explorations.

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.230 align:middle line:84%
They send out probes to
different solar systems,

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:22.760 align:middle line:84%
and they found that
our solar system

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:25.280 align:middle line:90%
would be able to support life.

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.410 align:middle line:84%
So they created these
massive spacecraft

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:30.500 align:middle line:84%
that could hold more
than 500,000 people.

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:34.066 align:middle line:84%
And he said, they took
off from their planet--

00:20:34.066 --> 00:20:34.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like cities.

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:35.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: Like.

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:38.210 align:middle line:84%
Cities and they targeted
our solar system.

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:41.450 align:middle line:84%
He said, three of them of,
unfortunately, lost control

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:43.690 align:middle line:84%
coming into our solar system
and crashed into the sun

00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:44.870 align:middle line:90%
and were destroyed.

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:47.540 align:middle line:84%
He said, one of them
crashed into Venus,

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:48.950 align:middle line:90%
and the people survived.

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And he said, the other
one landed on Mars.

00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:53.090 align:middle line:90%
This is 50,000 years ago.

00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:55.127 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we came
to earth, and we

00:20:55.127 --> 00:20:56.960 align:middle line:84%
noticed that there was
a very primitive life

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:57.839 align:middle line:90%
form here on Earth.

00:20:57.839 --> 00:20:59.630 align:middle line:84%
He said, but there were
two continents that

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:01.437 align:middle line:90%
existed that don't exist today.

00:21:01.437 --> 00:21:02.895 align:middle line:84%
One that we will
consider Atlantis.

00:21:02.895 --> 00:21:05.060 align:middle line:84%
And one that was
considered Lemuria.

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we started
interacting with them,

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:10.790 align:middle line:84%
and we taught them how
to perform agriculture.

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:15.680 align:middle line:84%
We taught them how to
use fire, how to use

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.192 align:middle line:90%
forging and things like that.

00:21:17.192 --> 00:21:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we taught them
everything that we could.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.774 align:middle line:84%
But he said, one
thing we did not

00:21:20.774 --> 00:21:23.600 align:middle line:84%
want to teach them
is the breakdown

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.120 align:middle line:84%
of the molecular structure
of matter, similar to what

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:27.190 align:middle line:90%
we would consider--

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:28.231 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The atomic bomb.

00:21:28.231 --> 00:21:29.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: Nuclear weapons, yes.

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:33.050 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, the technology
on the continent of Atlantis

00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:35.210 align:middle line:90%
became more advanced Lemuria.

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And he said, they were able
to get that information

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:40.610 align:middle line:90%
from the visitor scientists.

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And he said, they tried to use
it to subjugate the Lemurians.

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:48.816 align:middle line:84%
The Lemurians did not allow
themselves to be subjugated,

00:21:48.816 --> 00:21:50.690 align:middle line:84%
and they set off this
device, and it wound up

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:52.280 align:middle line:90%
destroying both continents.

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:53.570 align:middle line:90%
Both of them sank.

00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And he said that from
that point onward,

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.970 align:middle line:84%
they would only monitor the
goings-on on the planet Earth,

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:01.430 align:middle line:84%
but they would not
get directly involved.

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:04.070 align:middle line:84%
In the late 1800s, they saw
that we were progressing

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:08.270 align:middle line:84%
to the point that we would
be able to be able to explore

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:09.800 align:middle line:90%
nuclear technology again.

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.450 align:middle line:90%
We were developing x-rays.

00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:12.980 align:middle line:90%
We were involved in radium.

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:15.594 align:middle line:84%
And he asked for 100
volunteers to come down here.

00:22:15.594 --> 00:22:16.760 align:middle line:90%
He said, they had to be men.

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.593 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't be women,
because they thought

00:22:18.593 --> 00:22:19.940 align:middle line:90%
our planet was too hostile.

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:21.105 align:middle line:90%
So they had 100 volunteers.

00:22:21.105 --> 00:22:22.146 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They were right.

00:22:22.146 --> 00:22:23.660 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: They were right.

00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:26.270 align:middle line:84%
Zret was one of the 100
volunteers who came down.

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:28.850 align:middle line:84%
They were told that they
could be here for 100 years

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:31.520 align:middle line:84%
to help to motivate and
elevate consciousness,

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:34.070 align:middle line:84%
but they could not stay at
a job more than five years,

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:35.370 align:middle line:90%
because they don't age.

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:36.620 align:middle line:90%
They could not lay down roots.

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:37.940 align:middle line:90%
They could not marry.

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And they were involved
in different aspects--

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:44.300 align:middle line:84%
manufacturing,
metallurgy, science,

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:48.530 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of different
applications.

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:51.650 align:middle line:84%
The 100 visitors
were distributed

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:53.450 align:middle line:84%
among different
countries and continents

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:54.500 align:middle line:90%
all around the planet.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:56.390 align:middle line:84%
Albert got a chance
to meet all of them.

00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:58.370 align:middle line:84%
He moved to the
Philadelphia area.

00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:01.310 align:middle line:84%
He was released from
his vow of silence,

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:02.860 align:middle line:90%
and he came to Del Valle UFO.

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:04.610 align:middle line:84%
That's where I met him
for the first time.

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:05.818 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Does he still exist?

00:23:05.818 --> 00:23:07.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: He has passed.

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:08.910 align:middle line:90%
Unfortunately, he has passed.

00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:10.119 align:middle line:90%
I became very close with him.

00:23:10.119 --> 00:23:11.451 align:middle line:90%
I would pick him up at his home.

00:23:11.451 --> 00:23:13.010 align:middle line:84%
He lived in Northeast
Philadelphia.

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:15.170 align:middle line:84%
I would go to his
house, and his wife

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:16.632 align:middle line:90%
would prepare lunch for me.

00:23:16.632 --> 00:23:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And I would say to his
wife, I'd say, Mrs. Coe,

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:19.881 align:middle line:90%
did you ever meet the visitors?

00:23:19.881 --> 00:23:22.280 align:middle line:84%
She said, no, but Albert
has a lot of young friends

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.300 align:middle line:90%
who come here.

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:26.222 align:middle line:84%
And he goes away for periods of
two or three weeks at a time.

00:23:26.222 --> 00:23:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And then she went
into the kitchen.

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:29.305 align:middle line:84%
And Albert said,
she met the visitor.

00:23:29.305 --> 00:23:31.680 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't know they're the
young people that come over.

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:32.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She doesn't know.

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:32.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: She doesn't know.

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:34.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did you
think of his story?

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: I believed it.

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:37.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Compelling.

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:38.982 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: Compelling, integrity.

00:23:38.982 --> 00:23:41.190 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't looking to make
any money off of it at all.

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:43.560 align:middle line:84%
He was just sharing it with
people who were open-minded.

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:44.900 align:middle line:84%
He wrote a book that
he self-published

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:47.420 align:middle line:84%
called "The Shocking Truth,"
which is very, very rare today.

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:48.877 align:middle line:90%
It's an extremely rare--

00:23:48.877 --> 00:23:50.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it
back up what he said?

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:51.793 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: Backs up what he said.

00:23:51.793 --> 00:23:53.600 align:middle line:84%
It goes into all the
detail about this.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And he was given an
opportunity to go off planet.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.140 align:middle line:84%
He was involved in a car crash
along route 130 in New Jersey.

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:04.860 align:middle line:84%
He had suffered a stroke, and
he lost control of his car.

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:08.660 align:middle line:84%
He crashed into a barrier, came
across a three-lane highway

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:11.930 align:middle line:90%
and crashed his vehicle.

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:14.510 align:middle line:84%
He was brought into
the local hospital.

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:16.100 align:middle line:90%
He was on the death watch.

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:17.630 align:middle line:84%
They didn't think
he would survive.

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:19.860 align:middle line:84%
He had also impacted
his right knee,

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:22.190 align:middle line:90%
and it shattered his kneecap.

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:25.600 align:middle line:90%
His family was all brought in.

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:28.750 align:middle line:84%
They told the family he
had only 24 hours to live.

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:30.490 align:middle line:84%
What happened was,
during the night,

00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:33.530 align:middle line:84%
his friend Zret came and
worked on him all night long--

00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:34.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:35.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: I swear to God.

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:36.820 align:middle line:90%
He told me the story.

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:39.662 align:middle line:84%
The next morning, when the sun
arose, he got up out of bed.

00:24:39.662 --> 00:24:41.120 align:middle line:84%
He was ready to
leave the hospital.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.210 align:middle line:90%
He was completely healed.

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:43.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No!

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:44.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: The doctors
couldn't believe it.

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:45.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:47.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: Zret told him,
because you saved my life,

00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:49.990 align:middle line:84%
I was given the
permission to save yours.

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:52.300 align:middle line:84%
He said, I came into
the hospital at night.

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:54.400 align:middle line:84%
The belt that I had
on has the ability

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:57.340 align:middle line:84%
to bend light waves around
me, so I appeared invisible.

00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:59.900 align:middle line:84%
He said, I was able to repair
everything on your body,

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:01.840 align:middle line:90%
with the exception of your knee.

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:04.030 align:middle line:84%
To repair your
knee totally, we'd

00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:05.650 align:middle line:90%
have to take you off planet.

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:08.920 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I'd have to bring
you to either Mars or Venus

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:10.106 align:middle line:90%
for that work to be done.

00:25:10.106 --> 00:25:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And he said, if I
brought you there, it

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:14.080 align:middle line:90%
would change your vibration.

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:15.760 align:middle line:84%
You could not come
back to Earth.

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:18.700 align:middle line:84%
Albert said, can I
take my wife with me?

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:20.316 align:middle line:84%
He said, no, this
extends only to you.

00:25:20.316 --> 00:25:22.690 align:middle line:84%
He said, if I can't bring my
wife, I don't want to leave.

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:23.732 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm not leaving.

00:25:23.732 --> 00:25:24.565 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: He stayed.

00:25:24.565 --> 00:25:25.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who was Celaya Winkler?

00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:28.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: Celaya Winkler
was a woman that I had met.

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:30.580 align:middle line:84%
I moved out to
California, and I'd

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:35.360 align:middle line:84%
met Gabriel Green, who was a
photographer during the Second

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.160 align:middle line:90%
World War.

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And he filmed all the
Giant Rock UFO conventions.

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:41.200 align:middle line:90%
And I got a chance to meet him.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:48.080 align:middle line:84%
He published a newsletter called
"Amalgamated Flying Saucer

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:48.920 align:middle line:90%
Newsletter."

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:53.479 align:middle line:84%
He had a club called Amalgamated
Flying Saucer Clubs of America.

00:25:53.479 --> 00:25:54.770 align:middle line:90%
And I got a chance to meet him.

00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:57.020 align:middle line:84%
We would go out and
visit him on weekends.

00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Frank, there's
an extraordinary woman

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:00.020 align:middle line:90%
who lives out here.

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:01.144 align:middle line:90%
Her name is Celaya Winkler.

00:26:01.144 --> 00:26:03.830 align:middle line:84%
She used to be an artist
for the Disney studios.

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:05.090 align:middle line:90%
I'd like you to meet her.

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:07.670 align:middle line:84%
She retired from
Disney after 35 years,

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:10.970 align:middle line:84%
and she lived at a
Buddhist retreat.

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:14.570 align:middle line:84%
She became a Buddhist, and she
lived in a very modest cottage

00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:15.830 align:middle line:90%
in Yucca valley.

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:19.640 align:middle line:84%
And it was maybe 600
square feet in diameter.

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.560 align:middle line:84%
She was very much
into metaphysics.

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:24.500 align:middle line:84%
She was very much into
establishing connection

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:25.612 align:middle line:90%
with higher sources of--

00:26:25.612 --> 00:26:26.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Higher powers.

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:29.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: Yes, higher sources
of knowledge and wisdom.

00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:31.220 align:middle line:84%
And since she was
an artist, they

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:34.600 align:middle line:84%
decided to make their presence
known to her, these visitors.

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:35.400 align:middle line:90%
And she said--

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She painted them.

00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:37.294 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: She painted them.

00:26:37.294 --> 00:26:38.720 align:middle line:90%
They would appear on--

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.520 align:middle line:84%
first light of
morning would come

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:44.060 align:middle line:84%
through a window in her cottage,
and they would appear there.

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:45.710 align:middle line:84%
And they would stand
there perfectly

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:47.560 align:middle line:90%
still for her to capture.

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:49.274 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got
four of her paintings.

00:26:49.274 --> 00:26:50.690 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look
at these, Frank.

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And you can tell us
what we're looking at.

00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:53.290 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: Yes.

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:55.760 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
beings that she painted.

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:57.210 align:middle line:90%
His name is Hatonn.

00:26:57.210 --> 00:26:59.630 align:middle line:84%
He's known as the
record-keeper of the galaxy.

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:04.100 align:middle line:84%
He's on a planet that has
the records of the planet.

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:06.470 align:middle line:84%
And there were photographs
taken on this planet

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:08.660 align:middle line:90%
that I had the chance of seeing.

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:11.930 align:middle line:84%
Gabriel Green had a
series of 40 photos were

00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:13.880 align:middle line:90%
taken on Hatonn's home planet.

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:17.444 align:middle line:84%
And he was one of the first
ones that she painted.

00:27:17.444 --> 00:27:18.860 align:middle line:84%
The background of
that is supposed

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:23.389 align:middle line:84%
to be Mr. Shasta, and the
blue star to his left side--

00:27:23.389 --> 00:27:25.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: By the way, I
looked like that as a boy.

00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:26.060 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: You did?

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:27.976 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Really similar,
without the mustache,

00:27:27.976 --> 00:27:30.110 align:middle line:90%
of course, really similar.

00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:31.460 align:middle line:90%
OK, our next painting.

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:32.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: This is Esola.

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:35.960 align:middle line:90%
He's a master of magnetics.

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:39.050 align:middle line:84%
He works with using
magnetics and crafted

00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:40.550 align:middle line:90%
the visitors are using.

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And he's here to
teach others regarding

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.890 align:middle line:84%
the use of magnetics
for spacecraft and space

00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:47.032 align:middle line:90%
exploration.

00:27:47.032 --> 00:27:49.490 align:middle line:84%
The reason that these beings
wanted their likeness painted,

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:52.770 align:middle line:84%
George, is that they
wanted to be recognized

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:55.867 align:middle line:84%
so that when disclosure comes,
and they interact with us,

00:27:55.867 --> 00:27:57.450 align:middle line:84%
people will be able
to recognize them.

00:27:57.450 --> 00:27:59.014 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's he wearing?

00:27:59.014 --> 00:28:00.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: The headband
that he's wearing

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:06.590 align:middle line:84%
is symbolic of the magnetics
that he works with in his work.

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:08.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It doesn't
have any significance?

00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:11.312 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: Well, just that he
works with those energies,

00:28:11.312 --> 00:28:12.770 align:middle line:84%
and those energies
are incorporated

00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:15.410 align:middle line:90%
into the spacecraft designs.

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:17.210 align:middle line:84%
That's how she
captured his likeness.

00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:18.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got
two more paintings.

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:20.176 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: This is Korton.

00:28:20.176 --> 00:28:21.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's looks
like the other guy.

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.310 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: He looks very similar.

00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:24.110 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:27.080 align:middle line:84%
Celaya captured their eye
energy in oil paintings.

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:28.020 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very hard.

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:33.500 align:middle line:84%
I've spoken to many artists
who said capturing the likeness

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:39.570 align:middle line:84%
and the imagery in their
eyes is so difficult to do.

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And Celaya captured
it so perfectly.

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:45.500 align:middle line:84%
He works almost as,
like, a space detective

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:48.350 align:middle line:84%
within our solar system
and other solar systems.

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And we got a chance to see the
originals of these painting.

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:53.812 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They all look like us.

00:28:53.812 --> 00:28:54.611 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: They are.

00:28:54.611 --> 00:28:55.490 align:middle line:90%
They look like us.

00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:58.389 align:middle line:84%
They consider their forefathers
were our forefathers.

00:28:58.389 --> 00:28:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted us
to recognize them.

00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:02.970 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a
fourth painting.

00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:03.970 align:middle line:90%
This is a beautiful one.

00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:04.870 align:middle line:90%
This is Ashtar.

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:06.465 align:middle line:84%
You've probably heard
the name Ashtar.

00:29:06.465 --> 00:29:07.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have
heard that name.

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:09.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: Yes, Of
the Ashtar Command.

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:13.460 align:middle line:84%
He materialized in
Celaya's cottage

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:18.400 align:middle line:84%
and presented his likeness
of which he captured

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:19.900 align:middle line:84%
and, of course,
some of the aircraft

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:23.847 align:middle line:84%
in the background of
the Ashtar Command.

00:29:23.847 --> 00:29:25.930 align:middle line:84%
My brother and I got a
chance to see the originals

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:27.340 align:middle line:90%
of these paintings.

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:29.804 align:middle line:84%
And when I saw them, George,
I want to tell you, I wept.

00:29:29.804 --> 00:29:32.095 align:middle line:84%
Because I felt as if I was
looking at family portraits.

00:29:32.095 --> 00:29:32.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:34.761 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: I could not
believe the likeness.

00:29:34.761 --> 00:29:38.470 align:middle line:84%
I recognize these beings as if
they were part of our family.

00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:41.770 align:middle line:84%
And she captured dozens
and dozens of these.

00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:46.660 align:middle line:84%
She would send the paintings to
a place in northern California

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:48.760 align:middle line:90%
called the Mon-Ka Retreat.

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:50.560 align:middle line:84%
They published a
newsletter called "New

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:51.700 align:middle line:90%
From the Mountaintop."

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:55.120 align:middle line:10%
Her portraits would be shown
on this newsletter that

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:57.630 align:middle line:10%
was published and sent out
all around the world called

00:29:57.630 --> 00:29:58.990 align:middle line:10%
"News From the Mountaintop."

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:02.760 align:middle line:84%
And it was a husband
and wife team--

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:05.310 align:middle line:90%
Samuel Partridge and his wife.

00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:06.900 align:middle line:90%
She called herself White Dove.

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And they would receive
messages from these beings,

00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:10.567 align:middle line:84%
and they would
write the messages,

00:30:10.567 --> 00:30:12.608 align:middle line:84%
type them out, and put
them into this newsletter,

00:30:12.608 --> 00:30:13.560 align:middle line:90%
and send them all out.

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:15.310 align:middle line:84%
We got a chance to
visit them as well too.

00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:17.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why would
she be the contactee?

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.570 align:middle line:90%
What was so special about her?

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:21.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: I think
that they chose her

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:25.050 align:middle line:84%
because of her artistic
ability and for her willingness

00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:28.830 align:middle line:84%
to convey this profound
truth to mankind.

00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:32.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Frank, another contact
in the '70s was Barbara Beaver.

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:33.635 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about Barbara.

00:30:33.635 --> 00:30:36.310 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: This is an
extraordinary story.

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:37.990 align:middle line:90%
Gabriel Green contacted me.

00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:38.790 align:middle line:90%
He called me.

00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:40.965 align:middle line:84%
I was living in Laguna
Beach at the time.

00:30:40.965 --> 00:30:43.590 align:middle line:84%
He said, Frank, you have to come
out to Yucca valley this week.

00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:46.000 align:middle line:84%
There's something very
special that's going on.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.500 align:middle line:84%
He said, there's a
woman who's going

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:50.010 align:middle line:84%
to be giving a presentation
at the Yucca valley

00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:51.330 align:middle line:90%
Savings and Loan.

00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:53.414 align:middle line:84%
They're opening it up on
Sunday, which is really--

00:30:53.414 --> 00:30:54.288 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's rare.

00:30:54.288 --> 00:30:55.760 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: That is
really very rare.

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:59.630 align:middle line:84%
So my brother Simon and
I and about four or five

00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:06.470 align:middle line:84%
other friends came out
to Gabriel Green's home.

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:09.290 align:middle line:84%
The meeting was supposed to be
at 12:00 at the Yucca valley

00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:10.280 align:middle line:90%
Savings and Loan.

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:15.020 align:middle line:84%
They cleared out the lobby area
of all the desks, and chairs,

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:18.710 align:middle line:84%
and tables, and they
allowed Barbara to set up

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:21.680 align:middle line:90%
these portraits she had taken.

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:24.770 align:middle line:84%
She was a seamstress, and
she was a self-taught artist.

00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And she painted scenes of
what her experiences were.

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:29.510 align:middle line:90%
She lived in Yucca valley.

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:32.330 align:middle line:84%
She lived in Sunrise
apartment complex,

00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:35.570 align:middle line:84%
and she happened to be
maybe about a quarter mile

00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:37.820 align:middle line:84%
from an area called
Christ Desert Park.

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And Christ Desert
Park is an area--

00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:42.920 align:middle line:84%
there was an aircraft
engineer who worked

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.030 align:middle line:90%
in Long Beach, California.

00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:45.740 align:middle line:90%
His name was Frank Martin.

00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:47.900 align:middle line:84%
And he bought a piece of
property in Yucca valley,

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:50.120 align:middle line:84%
and he created these
scenes from the Bible

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:54.540 align:middle line:84%
from the New Testament of
plaster of Paris reliefs

00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:58.250 align:middle line:90%
of Jesus, the disciples.

00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And he created these scenes in
the desert where people could

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:04.280 align:middle line:84%
see these images-- they were
seven, eight, nine feet tall--

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:09.290 align:middle line:84%
of Jesus at the marriage feast
of Cana, the Last Supper,

00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:10.457 align:middle line:90%
Easter morning, the sermon--

00:32:10.457 --> 00:32:11.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All the classic events.

00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:13.254 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: All classic events.

00:32:13.254 --> 00:32:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And Simon and I would go out
there, and we would visit it.

00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:17.660 align:middle line:84%
The energy in that area
was always so high,

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:19.580 align:middle line:84%
and it was just a
beautiful place to visit.

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:22.610 align:middle line:84%
When Frank Martin
passed, he dedicated this

00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:26.000 align:middle line:84%
to the state of California,
and it became a historic area

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.710 align:middle line:90%
that people go and visit.

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:32.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, Barbara Beaver happened
to be in yoga meditation

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:33.770 align:middle line:90%
in her bedroom.

00:32:33.770 --> 00:32:37.730 align:middle line:84%
Her window of her bedroom
faced the Christ Desert Park,

00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:42.080 align:middle line:84%
and there's some hills above
the Christ Desert Park.

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And she noticed a
blue light that was

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:46.610 align:middle line:90%
bouncing up and down the hill.

00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
the blue light

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:50.630 align:middle line:84%
stopped, and she
said a cone of light

00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:54.350 align:middle line:84%
came out of that
blue dot, completely

00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:57.290 align:middle line:84%
enveloped her in her bedroom
in a cone of blue light.

00:32:57.290 --> 00:32:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And she heard a voice
inside of her head

00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:01.370 align:middle line:84%
say, Barbara, come to
Christ Desert Park.

00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:07.040 align:middle line:84%
Now she's wearing just a
yoga outfit, a pair sweats.

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:08.542 align:middle line:90%
She had no shoes or sandals.

00:33:08.542 --> 00:33:10.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How old was
she about this time?

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:12.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: About this time,
she was maybe 29 or 30.

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:13.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK, young.

00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:16.220 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: So she walks out
of her apartment complex,

00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:19.640 align:middle line:84%
and there's a dirt road leading
to the entrance of Christ

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:20.660 align:middle line:90%
Desert Park.

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:24.050 align:middle line:84%
She sees this blue dot above
the hill, and she said,

00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:25.730 align:middle line:90%
it's perfectly still.

00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:28.461 align:middle line:84%
She said, she's walking
towards the parking lot.

00:33:28.461 --> 00:33:29.710 align:middle line:90%
She gets into the parking lot.

00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:32.293 align:middle line:84%
The parking lot's a little bit
more than 100 feet in diameter.

00:33:32.293 --> 00:33:34.820 align:middle line:84%
So it's a good-sized
parking lot.

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And she hears the voice say,
Barbara, keep perfectly still.

00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And she hears this whoosh,
and the craft lands

00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:42.410 align:middle line:90%
right in the parking lot.

00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:49.340 align:middle line:84%
She said, it was violet colored,
with a gold rim around it.

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:51.950 align:middle line:84%
She said, the outer part
of the craft opened up,

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:53.632 align:middle line:90%
and she was invited to come in.

00:33:53.632 --> 00:33:54.590 align:middle line:90%
There was nobody there.

00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:56.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What a
great invitation.

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.760 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: She
walked inside of it.

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:00.150 align:middle line:90%
She was a seamstress.

00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:03.037 align:middle line:84%
She said, she saw geometric
patterns and colors--

00:34:03.037 --> 00:34:04.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How was she invited in?

00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:05.210 align:middle line:90%
Telepathically?

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:09.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: Telepathically, she
was invited to come on board.

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.370 align:middle line:90%
She walked inside of it.

00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:11.480 align:middle line:90%
She saw these patterns.

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:13.909 align:middle line:90%
She saw these geometric shapes.

00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:16.139 align:middle line:84%
And this voice said
to her, Barbara,

00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:18.860 align:middle line:84%
we cannot allow you to come into
the inner part of the craft,

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:21.080 align:middle line:84%
because you may have
some bacteria or residue

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:22.790 align:middle line:90%
on your outer clothing.

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:24.980 align:middle line:84%
They asked her to please
remove her clothing.

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:26.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Contamination.

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:28.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: And she's
thinking to herself,

00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:29.626 align:middle line:84%
I'm not taking
off my sweat suit,

00:34:29.626 --> 00:34:30.958 align:middle line:90%
cause I have nothing underneath.

00:34:30.958 --> 00:34:32.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have
weird aliens here.

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:33.409 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: Yes.

00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:35.449 align:middle line:84%
So as soon as that
thought came out,

00:34:35.449 --> 00:34:37.790 align:middle line:84%
she got this wave
that enveloped her

00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:40.100 align:middle line:84%
of loving energy
that she did not

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:41.850 align:middle line:90%
have to worry about anything.

00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:44.750 align:middle line:84%
So after she got
that sensation, she

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:46.850 align:middle line:84%
decided she would
take off her clothing.

00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:50.389 align:middle line:84%
She said, a canister came up
from the floor of the craft.

00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:52.159 align:middle line:90%
She said, it was cylindrical.

00:34:52.159 --> 00:34:53.510 align:middle line:90%
It was almost like a hamper.

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:55.010 align:middle line:90%
So she took off her sweat suit.

00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:56.630 align:middle line:90%
She put it in this container.

00:34:56.630 --> 00:34:58.830 align:middle line:84%
She said, it receded
into the floor.

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And then she said,
a partition opened,

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:04.120 align:middle line:84%
and a garment was on a hanger,
what she would call a hanger.

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:05.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hers.

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:07.276 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: For her to wear.

00:35:07.276 --> 00:35:08.400 align:middle line:90%
She picked up this garment.

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.650 align:middle line:84%
She said, it was of
the finest quality

00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:12.300 align:middle line:90%
she had ever encountered.

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:16.650 align:middle line:84%
She said, it was like
silk, but not of silk.

00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:19.530 align:middle line:84%
She put it on her body and
it form-fitted her entirely.

00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:23.494 align:middle line:84%
And she said, where the wrists
and where the ankles were,

00:35:23.494 --> 00:35:25.410 align:middle line:84%
it was open, but if you
run your hand over it,

00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:29.666 align:middle line:84%
it would close perfectly
without any zippers.

00:35:29.666 --> 00:35:31.290 align:middle line:84%
So she was playing
with it for a while,

00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:34.570 align:middle line:84%
and then after a few moments,
the center part of the craft

00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:35.370 align:middle line:90%
opened.

00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:37.953 align:middle line:84%
And she was allowed to come into
the center part of the craft.

00:35:37.953 --> 00:35:39.720 align:middle line:84%
She said, there were
four beings there.

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:41.940 align:middle line:84%
She said, there was
a male and female

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:43.985 align:middle line:84%
that looked like a Greek
god and a Greek goddess.

00:35:43.985 --> 00:35:45.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They looked human.

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:46.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: Human, totally human--

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:52.410 align:middle line:84%
blond hair, blue eyes, but their
skin was like a bronze color.

00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:55.740 align:middle line:84%
She said they were
like Greek statues.

00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:57.690 align:middle line:84%
They were perfect
And she said, there

00:35:57.690 --> 00:36:01.830 align:middle line:84%
was a tall being that appeared
to be maybe seven feet tall.

00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:03.390 align:middle line:84%
He looked like an
ancient Egyptian.

00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:06.660 align:middle line:84%
He had purple-colored skin
and purple-colored eyes,

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:07.820 align:middle line:90%
and he had a staff.

00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And then she said,
there was another being

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:11.430 align:middle line:84%
that was maybe
about four feet tall

00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:13.000 align:middle line:90%
that had violet-colored eyes.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And she said, it was the most
loving eyes she's ever seen.

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And they were welcoming
her onboard the craft.

00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:23.160 align:middle line:84%
Barbara started thinking,
why are you choosing me?

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:24.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm a seamstress.

00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:26.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any
educational background.

00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:27.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't know anything.

00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:30.447 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was she believer
in UFOs, ET at the time?

00:36:30.447 --> 00:36:32.030 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: This is
what I'm getting to.

00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:32.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:33.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: She was given a disk.

00:36:33.850 --> 00:36:35.490 align:middle line:90%
Now this was before CDs.

00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:37.590 align:middle line:84%
She was given what we
would consider today

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:41.010 align:middle line:84%
a CD, a silver disk bigger
than a silver dollar.

00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:43.170 align:middle line:84%
And it gave a holographic
display of her life

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:44.670 align:middle line:84%
from the time she
was a little girl.

00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:45.914 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did she play it?

00:36:45.914 --> 00:36:47.580 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: All she had
to do was hold it,

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:50.790 align:middle line:84%
and it enveloped a
three-dimensional holographic

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:51.930 align:middle line:90%
display for life.

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:53.580 align:middle line:90%
And she started to cry.

00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:55.710 align:middle line:84%
The beings came around her,
and they comforted her.

00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:57.330 align:middle line:90%
They were touching her shoulder.

00:36:57.330 --> 00:36:58.930 align:middle line:84%
The reason she started
to cry, George,

00:36:58.930 --> 00:37:00.346 align:middle line:84%
is when she was a
little girl, she

00:37:00.346 --> 00:37:02.490 align:middle line:84%
used to look up in
the night sky and say,

00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:06.131 align:middle line:84%
if there's other beings,
other visitors, let me know.

00:37:06.131 --> 00:37:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And she was seeing the
realization of her dream.

00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:08.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They heard her.

00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:10.011 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: They heard her.

00:37:10.011 --> 00:37:11.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's what she
was crying about.

00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we
want to take you

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:18.250 align:middle line:84%
to other life forms and
other societies that

00:37:18.250 --> 00:37:20.100 align:middle line:90%
exist within the solar system.

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:23.530 align:middle line:84%
She said, they took
her to every planet--

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:24.830 align:middle line:90%
Mercury through Pluto.

00:37:24.830 --> 00:37:26.830 align:middle line:84%
And she said, there's
civilizations and beings

00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:27.790 align:middle line:90%
living there.

00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And she said, she created
their likeness in paintings

00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:32.860 align:middle line:90%
that she shared.

00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:36.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was the news of
her contactee events public

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:37.450 align:middle line:90%
at that time?

00:37:37.450 --> 00:37:39.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: Only to those
who appeared there.

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:42.380 align:middle line:84%
There was about 75 of us at
Yucca valley Savings and Loan

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:43.180 align:middle line:90%
for that afternoon.

00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:44.365 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is she still alive?

00:37:44.365 --> 00:37:45.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: No, she's passed.

00:37:45.490 --> 00:37:46.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She's gone.

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:48.820 align:middle line:84%
All the great
contactees are gone.

00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:50.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: We were so
lucky to be there.

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:52.420 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting
is, they told her

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:55.840 align:middle line:84%
they wanted to utilize her in
an ambassador-type capacity.

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:58.330 align:middle line:84%
They said, we want to bring
visitors from other planets

00:37:58.330 --> 00:38:00.280 align:middle line:84%
to stay and live
with Earth families

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:02.350 align:middle line:84%
to learn what it's
like to live on Earth.

00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And they want people
from Earth families

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:07.570 align:middle line:84%
to go and stay with some of
these visitors' families.

00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:11.050 align:middle line:84%
they wanted to utilize
Barbara as an ambassador

00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:12.460 align:middle line:90%
in that capacity.

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And I said to her,
Barbara, is a contention

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:22.090 align:middle line:84%
upon us being receptive to
this program being successful?

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:24.850 align:middle line:84%
She looked down, and she looked
at me, and she said, yes.

00:38:24.850 --> 00:38:27.790 align:middle line:84%
We're all being monitored on
the big screen on board a craft.

00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
about the contactee phenomenon.

00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:31.180 align:middle line:90%
Frank?

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:32.110 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: What do
I think about them?

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:33.943 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, what do
you think's going on?

00:38:33.943 --> 00:38:37.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: I think, again, some
individuals are being contacted

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:42.550 align:middle line:84%
and given experiences like this
to share with a wider audience.

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And they're being selected
very, very judiciously

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:48.690 align:middle line:84%
for their backgrounds,
for their sincerity,

00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:52.930 align:middle line:84%
for their judiciousness,
and for their willingness

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:55.090 align:middle line:84%
to be able to participate
in these programs.

00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:57.340 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them didn't succeed,
because a lot of them

00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:58.910 align:middle line:90%
succumbed, like Barbara.

00:38:58.910 --> 00:39:00.790 align:middle line:90%
She was intimidated.

00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:02.890 align:middle line:84%
People would be threatening
her with phone calls,

00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:04.990 align:middle line:84%
knocking on her door that
she was taking God away

00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:08.620 align:middle line:84%
from us, that she was
working for the dark forces,

00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:09.670 align:middle line:90%
for the dark side.

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:11.110 align:middle line:90%
She shut down entirely.

00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:14.800 align:middle line:84%
She wound up living out the rest
of her life to the age of 67.

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And she passed in that
apartment that she lived in.

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:21.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was she
believed by people?

00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:23.652 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: Only those, I
believe, who heard her story.

00:39:23.652 --> 00:39:24.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you believe her?

00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:25.640 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: I believed her.

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:26.440 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:29.060 align:middle line:84%
I met her afterwards
about two weeks later,

00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:30.470 align:middle line:90%
and she started to shut down.

00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:32.250 align:middle line:84%
I saw her when we went
into a supermarket,

00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:34.340 align:middle line:84%
and I said, Barbara,
it's so good to see you.

00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:36.276 align:middle line:90%
But she seemed very pale.

00:39:36.276 --> 00:39:38.150 align:middle line:84%
I went to Gabriel Green's
house, and he said,

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:40.490 align:middle line:84%
Frank, strange things are
happening with Barbara.

00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:41.900 align:middle line:90%
She's being threatened.

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:45.200 align:middle line:84%
And after a couple more weeks
of that, she became quiet.

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:47.360 align:middle line:90%
It was never publicized anymore.

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:48.980 align:middle line:84%
The Yucca valley
Savings and Loan

00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:52.702 align:middle line:84%
never admitted that
they had the encounter.

00:39:52.702 --> 00:39:53.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Had the event.

00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:54.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: Yes.

00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:55.079 align:middle line:90%
There were 75 people.

00:39:55.079 --> 00:39:56.870 align:middle line:84%
It was only the living
memory of the people

00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:59.300 align:middle line:84%
who were there who still
have that experience

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:00.560 align:middle line:90%
and remembered it.

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:01.820 align:middle line:90%
I happened to speak at Mt.

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:06.102 align:middle line:84%
Shasta in July, and there was a
woman there who heard my story.

00:40:06.102 --> 00:40:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And she shared it with
some friends of hers who

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:10.970 align:middle line:90%
live in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:13.310 align:middle line:84%
The fellow by the name
of Michael Radford

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:15.560 align:middle line:84%
heard the story, and
he said to the girl,

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:17.840 align:middle line:84%
Ivy, Frank is talking
about my mother.

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:19.410 align:middle line:90%
Barbara Beaver is my mother.

00:40:19.410 --> 00:40:20.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No!

00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:21.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: I'm not kidding you.

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:22.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you freak out?

00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:24.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: I was so surprised.

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And I'm in touch with
Michael Radford now.

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:29.390 align:middle line:84%
He's sharing images with me
that his mother had painted

00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:31.790 align:middle line:84%
and shared with us at
that event and told me

00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:34.070 align:middle line:84%
that his mother passed
at the age of 67.

00:40:34.070 --> 00:40:35.840 align:middle line:84%
He said, nobody else
had ever contacted

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:38.125 align:middle line:84%
him regarding this
story, and he's

00:40:38.125 --> 00:40:40.250 align:middle line:84%
willing to share more
information about his mother.

00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:42.041 align:middle line:84%
And I hope to get more
of that information.

00:40:42.041 --> 00:40:45.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
the contactees are given

00:40:45.370 --> 00:40:47.320 align:middle line:90%
in terms of a gift afterwards?

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:48.310 align:middle line:90%
Anything?

00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:49.930 align:middle line:90%
Are they given health?

00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:53.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously,
she died at 67.

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:54.820 align:middle line:90%
They could have kept her alive.

00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:56.278 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: I'm sure
they could have.

00:40:56.278 --> 00:40:59.170 align:middle line:84%
With Albert Coe,
they had given him

00:40:59.170 --> 00:41:02.140 align:middle line:84%
a powder they told him
to mix with water that he

00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:04.450 align:middle line:84%
said was almost
like Alka Seltzer

00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:05.980 align:middle line:90%
when it would formulate.

00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And he said, it gave him
such invigorating energy,

00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:11.950 align:middle line:90%
he felt internally stimulated.

00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And he had the mind of an
18-year-old when I met him late

00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:16.210 align:middle line:90%
in life.

00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:20.542 align:middle line:84%
His mind was still
sharp as anything.

00:41:20.542 --> 00:41:22.000 align:middle line:84%
I would take him
to do radio shows,

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.340 align:middle line:84%
and he would share
his story with people.

00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:25.607 align:middle line:90%
And people would call in.

00:41:25.607 --> 00:41:27.190 align:middle line:84%
Some of the people
would be receptive.

00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And other people would
say, oh, you're a crank.

00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:29.950 align:middle line:90%
You're just making this up.

00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:31.180 align:middle line:84%
You're looking to
make money on this.

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:31.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
no money in this.

00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:33.634 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: There's no money, no.

00:41:33.634 --> 00:41:35.050 align:middle line:84%
He just wanted to
share his story.

00:41:35.050 --> 00:41:36.850 align:middle line:84%
Barbara wanted to
share her story.

00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:38.920 align:middle line:84%
There's other individuals
like that I've met.

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:40.930 align:middle line:84%
Some of them have not
come forward, George.

00:41:40.930 --> 00:41:43.180 align:middle line:84%
Some of them have shared
their stories with me,

00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:45.470 align:middle line:84%
and I'm hoping to give those
stories wider exposure.

00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:47.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about pilots
and things like that?

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:48.460 align:middle line:90%
Do you get those kinds of cases?

00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:49.090 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: I do.

00:41:49.090 --> 00:41:49.930 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:41:49.930 --> 00:41:52.360 align:middle line:84%
I happened to be
in a gas station,

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:54.850 align:middle line:84%
and a fellow was checking
his lottery ticket.

00:41:54.850 --> 00:41:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And I said, did
you have any luck?

00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:58.160 align:middle line:90%
He said, no, I have to go back.

00:41:58.160 --> 00:41:59.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm an airline pilot.

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:01.060 align:middle line:90%
I fly charter planes.

00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:04.690 align:middle line:84%
I said, do you ever see anything
extraordinary or unusual?

00:42:04.690 --> 00:42:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me for a
moment, George, and he said,

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:09.730 align:middle line:90%
are you talking about UFOs?

00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:10.780 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yes.

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:12.790 align:middle line:84%
He said, I've had more
than 40 sightings.

00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:14.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 40 sightings?

00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:17.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: Daytime and nighttime.

00:42:17.650 --> 00:42:19.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a gem he must be.

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:22.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: He said, I rarely
share this with other people,

00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:25.540 align:middle line:84%
but I've seen craft that
are enormous in size

00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:27.010 align:middle line:90%
when I'm in the cockpit.

00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:30.830 align:middle line:84%
He said, sometimes, they pace
my plane, but I've seen them.

00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:31.630 align:middle line:90%
They're real.

00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I have no
fear of them at all.

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:36.370 align:middle line:84%
One of the great
contactee of the '60s

00:42:36.370 --> 00:42:38.920 align:middle line:84%
was a fellow by the name
of George Van Tassel.

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:39.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: That's right.

00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:41.409 align:middle line:10%
>>HOST: Give me the
details, George,

00:42:41.409 --> 00:42:43.450 align:middle line:10%
because I'm never
tired of hearing

00:42:43.450 --> 00:42:47.500 align:middle line:10%
the details of a man who
says he has seen creatures

00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:48.632 align:middle line:10%
from another world.

00:42:48.632 --> 00:42:50.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE VAN TASSEL:
Well, actually, Jack, this

00:42:50.590 --> 00:42:53.050 align:middle line:84%
was as simple as
crossing a street

00:42:53.050 --> 00:42:54.430 align:middle line:90%
and getting hit by a car.

00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:57.730 align:middle line:84%
After it's over, you're the
victim of the circumstance.

00:42:57.730 --> 00:42:59.410 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't see the ship.

00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:03.190 align:middle line:84%
Land one of my son in-laws
that wasn't my son-in-law

00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:06.730 align:middle line:90%
at that time sought them down.

00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:09.670 align:middle line:84%
Another man in the
airport heard it,

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:12.280 align:middle line:84%
and he wasn't where
he could see it.

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And the man got off of the ship
and approached me before I even

00:43:16.570 --> 00:43:18.134 align:middle line:90%
knew there was a ship down.

00:43:18.134 --> 00:43:19.300 align:middle line:90%
>>HOST: Where were you then?

00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:20.830 align:middle line:84%
What time of day
or night was it?

00:43:20.830 --> 00:43:22.705 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN TASSEL: It was 2
o'clock in the morning

00:43:22.705 --> 00:43:24.850 align:middle line:84%
and approximately
a full moon, which

00:43:24.850 --> 00:43:26.412 align:middle line:90%
is like daylight in the desert.

00:43:26.412 --> 00:43:28.370 align:middle line:84%
>>HOST: Were you walking
about outside or what?

00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:31.570 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN TASSEL: No, I was sound
asleep when he awakened me.

00:43:31.570 --> 00:43:32.830 align:middle line:90%
>>HOST: This man awakened you?

00:43:32.830 --> 00:43:34.579 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN TASSEL: Well,
something awakened me.

00:43:34.579 --> 00:43:36.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HOST: So you get
up out of your bed.

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:38.696 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN TASSEL: I got out of my
bed and went aboard the ship

00:43:38.696 --> 00:43:39.640 align:middle line:90%
at his request.

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:41.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HOST: This man,
in what language

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:42.366 align:middle line:90%
did he converse with you?

00:43:42.366 --> 00:43:44.865 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN TASSEL: He talked to me
in the best English equivalent

00:43:44.865 --> 00:43:46.480 align:middle line:90%
to Ronald Coleman.

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:48.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HOST: And he met you
there, and what did he say?

00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:50.554 align:middle line:90%
Come with me to my ship or what?

00:43:50.554 --> 00:43:51.970 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN TASSEL: No,
I asked him what

00:43:51.970 --> 00:43:54.190 align:middle line:84%
he wanted, because we
have a lot of people

00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:58.220 align:middle line:84%
come in, stuck in the sand,
and broken axles and whatnot.

00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:00.020 align:middle line:90%
And I asked him what he wanted.

00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And he said, my
name is Solganda,

00:44:01.570 --> 00:44:03.910 align:middle line:84%
and I would be pleased
to show you our craft.

00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:06.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us about the
contactee case of George Van

00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:07.030 align:middle line:90%
Tassel.

00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:08.571 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: Boy, that's
a classic case.

00:44:08.571 --> 00:44:11.620 align:middle line:84%
Again, he was sleeping out
in the desert in a bed roll,

00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:14.330 align:middle line:84%
and he was awakened early
in the morning, as he said,

00:44:14.330 --> 00:44:15.130 align:middle line:90%
at 2 o'clock.

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:17.590 align:middle line:84%
And he felt a presence
standing at his bed roll.

00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:21.040 align:middle line:84%
And he awoken, and he saw this
being who identified himself

00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:24.280 align:middle line:84%
as Solganda, and took
him to see other planets

00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:26.500 align:middle line:84%
in our solar system,
and gave him plans

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:29.110 align:middle line:84%
for a device which
became built and is

00:44:29.110 --> 00:44:30.310 align:middle line:90%
known as the Integratron.

00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:32.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Near Joshua
Tree, California, right?

00:44:32.290 --> 00:44:34.600 align:middle line:10%
>>CHILLE: It's in
Landers, California.

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And George Van Tassel
started building it,

00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:39.970 align:middle line:84%
and he had four daughters,
but his daughters

00:44:39.970 --> 00:44:41.650 align:middle line:90%
married individuals.

00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:44.680 align:middle line:84%
I got a chance to meet
one of the sons-in-law.

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:47.740 align:middle line:84%
His name was Daniel
Boone, a direct descendant

00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:49.720 align:middle line:84%
of the pioneer,
Daniel Boone, who

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:51.350 align:middle line:90%
lived in Landers, California.

00:44:51.350 --> 00:44:54.280 align:middle line:84%
Another son-in-law who married
one of the Van Tassel daughters

00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:57.470 align:middle line:90%
is named Norman Paulson.

00:44:57.470 --> 00:44:59.470 align:middle line:84%
He wrote a book called
"Return of the Ancients,"

00:44:59.470 --> 00:45:02.590 align:middle line:84%
talking about his experiences
in the desert, the building

00:45:02.590 --> 00:45:04.570 align:middle line:84%
of the Integratron, and
meeting the visitors.

00:45:04.570 --> 00:45:07.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was Van Tassel
looked at as a quack

00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:09.940 align:middle line:84%
or as somebody who
might be the real deal?

00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:12.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: He was
looked at as both.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.610 align:middle line:84%
But he was threatened
because this Integratron

00:45:15.610 --> 00:45:18.610 align:middle line:84%
was going to have the ability
of rejuvenating the body.

00:45:18.610 --> 00:45:21.080 align:middle line:84%
It was going to generate the
world's largest negative ion

00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:21.880 align:middle line:90%
generator.

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:24.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're supposed
to stand in the middle?

00:45:24.070 --> 00:45:25.390 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: There was going to
be a group of people in there.

00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:27.010 align:middle line:90%
You could not wear any metal.

00:45:27.010 --> 00:45:29.564 align:middle line:84%
People would go in
there wearing cloaks.

00:45:29.564 --> 00:45:30.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a huge magnet.

00:45:30.730 --> 00:45:31.540 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: Yes.

00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And the wiring diagram
was given to Daniel Boone.

00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:37.020 align:middle line:84%
He told me when I
went to visit him,

00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:38.770 align:middle line:84%
he said, one day he
was visiting when they

00:45:38.770 --> 00:45:40.360 align:middle line:90%
were building the Integratron.

00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:42.443 align:middle line:84%
And he said, there were
three young fellows there,

00:45:42.443 --> 00:45:44.840 align:middle line:84%
and one fellow was sitting
on George Van Tassel's--

00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:46.010 align:middle line:90%
the bed of his pickup truck.

00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:49.130 align:middle line:84%
He had a piece of copper wire,
and he coiled the copper wire

00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:51.980 align:middle line:84%
in a strange configuration,
and he said to Daniel,

00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:53.150 align:middle line:90%
touch the end of it.

00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:54.530 align:middle line:84%
And Daniel touched
the end of it,

00:45:54.530 --> 00:45:57.320 align:middle line:84%
and he said to Daniel,
how does it feel?

00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:58.299 align:middle line:90%
He said, it feels hot.

00:45:58.299 --> 00:45:59.840 align:middle line:84%
He said, anything
that generates heat

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:02.211 align:middle line:90%
is a negative use of energy?

00:46:02.211 --> 00:46:03.710 align:middle line:84%
He straightened out
the copper wire.

00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:07.107 align:middle line:84%
He reconfigured it again, and
he told Daniel to touch it.

00:46:07.107 --> 00:46:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Daniel,
how does it feel?

00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:10.160 align:middle line:90%
And he said, it feels cool.

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And he said, anything
that creates cold

00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:14.150 align:middle line:90%
is a positive use of energy.

00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we want
you to remember this.

00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:19.040 align:middle line:84%
Daniel was given
a wiring diagram

00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:21.950 align:middle line:84%
for the inside of
the Integratron.

00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And he said, when
mankind is ready,

00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:26.150 align:middle line:90%
they will be given to them.

00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:27.650 align:middle line:84%
Everything regarding
the Integratron

00:46:27.650 --> 00:46:29.490 align:middle line:84%
was all built with
donations from people.

00:46:29.490 --> 00:46:30.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's still available.

00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:31.420 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: It's still available.

00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:33.110 align:middle line:90%
People can go out and visit it.

00:46:33.110 --> 00:46:35.750 align:middle line:84%
I had a chance to
go out and visit it.

00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:37.640 align:middle line:84%
My brother Simon,
who is an architect,

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:39.350 align:middle line:84%
was drawn to go
out to California.

00:46:39.350 --> 00:46:41.760 align:middle line:84%
He was living in New
York at the time.

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And he was drawn
to go out there.

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:46.330 align:middle line:84%
George Van Tassel's idea was to
have the College of Universal

00:46:46.330 --> 00:46:47.130 align:middle line:90%
Wisdom.

00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:50.510 align:middle line:84%
He was going to have an
observatory there and buildings

00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:52.940 align:middle line:84%
around it, where they
would teach cosmic truths,

00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:56.060 align:middle line:84%
universal truths that the
space visitors had given.

00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:58.130 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, Van Tassel
has passed away, like,

00:46:58.130 --> 00:47:00.380 align:middle line:84%
six months before my
brother Simon could go out.

00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:03.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did Van Tassel ever
get lifted off the planet?

00:47:03.650 --> 00:47:04.880 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: Many times.

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:05.960 align:middle line:90%
Many times, yes.

00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:09.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He reminds me of
George Adamski, that case, too,

00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:11.450 align:middle line:84%
who claims that he
went to Venus a lot.

00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:13.430 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: Yes, early contactees.

00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And those Giant
Rock UFO Conventions

00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:17.810 align:middle line:84%
that occurred, they started
in the '50s, Van Tassel

00:47:17.810 --> 00:47:19.430 align:middle line:84%
was the first one
who started them.

00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:23.220 align:middle line:84%
Matter of fact, he was one of
the wingmen of Howard Hughes.

00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:24.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:25.978 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: Howard Hughes
would come to visit him

00:47:25.978 --> 00:47:27.880 align:middle line:90%
after the war ended.

00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:29.780 align:middle line:84%
Van Tassel's wife
would make pies.

00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:32.030 align:middle line:84%
They had a little
luncheonette there.

00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:34.250 align:middle line:84%
He would fly in, his
wife would make pies,

00:47:34.250 --> 00:47:36.860 align:middle line:84%
and Howard Hughes would
take pies home with him.

00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:39.620 align:middle line:84%
Van Tassel would say that
Howard Hughes knew a lot

00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:42.200 align:middle line:84%
more about saucers than he
ever talked about either.

00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:43.430 align:middle line:90%
That he was also an insider.

00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:44.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He kept it quiet.

00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:45.170 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: He kept it quiet.

00:47:45.170 --> 00:47:46.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He kept it quiet.

00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:46.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: Yes.

00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:49.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When Van
Tassel died, did he

00:47:49.070 --> 00:47:56.060 align:middle line:84%
die peacefully at an old age,
or did something happen to him?

00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:58.320 align:middle line:90%
I've heard both stories.

00:47:58.320 --> 00:47:59.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: The story
that we were told

00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:03.260 align:middle line:84%
is that he was taken on board
a craft, that an Android

00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:04.960 align:middle line:90%
body was replaced here.

00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:07.550 align:middle line:84%
That the Android body that
was replaced down here

00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:09.350 align:middle line:90%
is what had expired.

00:48:09.350 --> 00:48:12.980 align:middle line:84%
His wife, Doris,
told us this story.

00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:17.292 align:middle line:84%
When I moved out to California,
I was married at the time.

00:48:17.292 --> 00:48:18.750 align:middle line:84%
My brother, Simon,
said, Frank, you

00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:20.749 align:middle line:84%
have to come out here and
meet Doris Van Tassel.

00:48:20.749 --> 00:48:23.050 align:middle line:84%
There's something
extraordinary going on here.

00:48:23.050 --> 00:48:26.370 align:middle line:84%
So I went away for the weekend
and went there for a Friday

00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:27.570 align:middle line:90%
and Saturday night.

00:48:27.570 --> 00:48:30.150 align:middle line:84%
Doris made dinner for
Simon and I. After dinner--

00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:32.730 align:middle line:84%
she was a chiropractor-- she
gave us chiropractor treatment.

00:48:32.730 --> 00:48:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And she said, Frank and
Simon, be very careful

00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:36.120 align:middle line:90%
during the night.

00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:37.828 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, people come
out of the desert,

00:48:37.828 --> 00:48:38.970 align:middle line:90%
and they knock on the door.

00:48:38.970 --> 00:48:41.520 align:middle line:84%
Just be very careful who
you let into the house.

00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:42.775 align:middle line:90%
We said we would.

00:48:42.775 --> 00:48:43.650 align:middle line:90%
We had sleeping bags.

00:48:43.650 --> 00:48:46.830 align:middle line:84%
We were laying out in the
living room in sleeping bags.

00:48:46.830 --> 00:48:48.600 align:middle line:84%
She had a bow window
that looked out

00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:52.260 align:middle line:84%
into the desert towards
the Integratron.

00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:54.840 align:middle line:84%
We were talking for maybe
about an hour, hour and a half.

00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:58.170 align:middle line:84%
Maybe about 1 o'clock
in the morning,

00:48:58.170 --> 00:49:01.260 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden, the living room
was enveloped in white light.

00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:02.700 align:middle line:90%
There was no noise at all.

00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:05.070 align:middle line:84%
Everything in the living
room was white light.

00:49:05.070 --> 00:49:06.390 align:middle line:90%
Simon and I were frozen.

00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:07.260 align:middle line:90%
We could not move.

00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:08.280 align:middle line:90%
We were in our bed roll.

00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:09.270 align:middle line:90%
We could hear.

00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:10.620 align:middle line:90%
We could see.

00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:12.060 align:middle line:90%
We just couldn't move.

00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:15.850 align:middle line:84%
We heard the door from outside
to the kitchen open up.

00:49:15.850 --> 00:49:19.650 align:middle line:84%
We heard footsteps come in,
go to Dorris's bedroom door.

00:49:19.650 --> 00:49:22.980 align:middle line:84%
We heard the door, knock on
the door, and the door opened.

00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And we heard two voices talking
for about 10 or 15 minutes.

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:28.380 align:middle line:84%
After that, the door
opened from the bedroom.

00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:30.840 align:middle line:84%
We heard somebody walk
across the kitchen,

00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:33.360 align:middle line:90%
out the kitchen door, outside.

00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden, there
was a blast of white light.

00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And Simon and I
could move again.

00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:39.930 align:middle line:90%
We were immobilized.

00:49:39.930 --> 00:49:41.070 align:middle line:90%
I was so excited.

00:49:41.070 --> 00:49:42.690 align:middle line:90%
I said to Simon, what happened?

00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:43.490 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:49:43.490 --> 00:49:44.730 align:middle line:90%
What did we just experience?

00:49:44.730 --> 00:49:46.355 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't wait for
Dorris to wake up.

00:49:46.355 --> 00:49:48.220 align:middle line:84%
We wanted to find
out what went on.

00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:50.310 align:middle line:84%
So we spoke for about
another 90 minutes.

00:49:50.310 --> 00:49:51.930 align:middle line:90%
Simon drifted off to sleep.

00:49:51.930 --> 00:49:54.900 align:middle line:84%
About 3 o'clock in the morning,
I heard a knock on the door.

00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:56.020 align:middle line:90%
I went over to the door.

00:49:56.020 --> 00:50:00.550 align:middle line:84%
She had a porch screen door,
and there was a porch outside.

00:50:00.550 --> 00:50:01.680 align:middle line:90%
I went out onto the porch.

00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:02.809 align:middle line:90%
There was nobody there.

00:50:02.809 --> 00:50:03.850 align:middle line:90%
I opened the screen door.

00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:05.058 align:middle line:90%
And it was a beautiful night.

00:50:05.058 --> 00:50:06.420 align:middle line:90%
It was not a moon out.

00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:08.001 align:middle line:90%
It was a beautiful night sky.

00:50:08.001 --> 00:50:09.000 align:middle line:90%
You could see the stars.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.350 align:middle line:90%
You could see the Milky Way.

00:50:10.350 --> 00:50:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And off into the distance, I
saw two lights in the distance

00:50:13.950 --> 00:50:16.050 align:middle line:90%
on the horizon, two red lights.

00:50:16.050 --> 00:50:17.400 align:middle line:90%
And it came up from the horizon.

00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:19.350 align:middle line:84%
It came up over the
top of the house

00:50:19.350 --> 00:50:20.806 align:middle line:90%
and went from north to south.

00:50:20.806 --> 00:50:22.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you a
contactee yourself, Frank,

00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:23.627 align:middle line:90%
or just a researcher?

00:50:23.627 --> 00:50:24.960 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: No, just a researcher.

00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:27.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The great
investigators of the past--

00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:31.540 align:middle line:90%
Budd Hopkins, Dr. John Mack--

00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:32.430 align:middle line:90%
they're gone.

00:50:32.430 --> 00:50:33.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: Yes.

00:50:33.990 --> 00:50:36.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're one
of the last ones left.

00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:37.582 align:middle line:90%
What happens afterward?

00:50:37.582 --> 00:50:38.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: No, there's others.

00:50:38.790 --> 00:50:42.650 align:middle line:84%
There's people that are doing
extraordinary work out there.

00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:43.734 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they younger?

00:50:43.734 --> 00:50:45.566 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: There are
some younger than myself

00:50:45.566 --> 00:50:47.310 align:middle line:84%
that are involved in
this work, perhaps

00:50:47.310 --> 00:50:50.150 align:middle line:84%
at other times, who could
explore some of these stories.

00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:52.782 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But who's going
to carry this ball?

00:50:52.782 --> 00:50:54.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: I believe
we're so close.

00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:57.330 align:middle line:84%
We're on the cusp right now of
a lot of this being revealed.

00:50:57.330 --> 00:50:59.137 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that the
Navy is behind a lot

00:50:59.137 --> 00:50:59.970 align:middle line:90%
of this information.

00:50:59.970 --> 00:51:00.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Navy?

00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:01.300 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: The Navy.

00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:01.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:03.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: I've had
people who told me

00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:06.480 align:middle line:84%
that have had very high
security clearances that the Air

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:08.390 align:middle line:84%
Force has always been
the foil on this.

00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:11.310 align:middle line:84%
That the blame for
the secrecy of UFOs

00:51:11.310 --> 00:51:13.530 align:middle line:84%
was put off to the Air
Force, but the Navy

00:51:13.530 --> 00:51:15.738 align:middle line:84%
has been the controlling
influence behind the scenes.

00:51:15.738 --> 00:51:18.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Honestly, I had a top
secret clearance with the Navy,

00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:22.380 align:middle line:84%
but I never knew that they were
involved in UFO investigations,

00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:24.000 align:middle line:90%
except one case.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And that was a group of
people, sailors, on a ship.

00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And they saw a submerged
UFO go right past them.

00:51:32.580 --> 00:51:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And we were baffled
by that, because what

00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:40.590 align:middle line:84%
they saw was a light going
right next to the ship

00:51:40.590 --> 00:51:42.540 align:middle line:90%
about 20 feet underwater.

00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And it just went and just
kept going, and it was gone.

00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:47.040 align:middle line:90%
And it was gone.

00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:50.250 align:middle line:84%
Some people claimed it came
out of the sea and took off.

00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:52.130 align:middle line:84%
Others claimed they
didn't see that.

00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:53.650 align:middle line:90%
That it just kept staying.

00:51:53.650 --> 00:51:57.220 align:middle line:84%
But that's my Navy
episode UFO case.

00:51:57.220 --> 00:51:58.020 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:51:58.020 --> 00:51:58.560 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: Who knows?

00:51:58.560 --> 00:51:59.360 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:01.210 align:middle line:84%
There's so much more
yet to be discovered.

00:52:01.210 --> 00:52:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And again, as long as we
remain open and receptive

00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:07.441 align:middle line:84%
and show that we're not
prejudiced to this information,

00:52:07.441 --> 00:52:09.690 align:middle line:84%
I've been told many times
that a lot of the contactees

00:52:09.690 --> 00:52:13.110 align:middle line:84%
feel that the most difficult
obstacle to overcome

00:52:13.110 --> 00:52:15.006 align:middle line:90%
is the fundamentalists.

00:52:15.006 --> 00:52:16.380 align:middle line:84%
The beings that
are visiting here

00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:21.110 align:middle line:84%
don't want to be recognized
as supermen or superwomen.

00:52:21.110 --> 00:52:24.280 align:middle line:84%
That want to be recognized as
gods, just more aware brothers

00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:25.080 align:middle line:90%
and sisters.

00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:26.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think is happening.

00:52:26.250 --> 00:52:27.050 align:middle line:90%
Frank?

00:52:27.050 --> 00:52:28.560 align:middle line:90%
What's happening to this planet?

00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:31.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: I feel that we're
being nudged into wakefulness

00:52:31.890 --> 00:52:35.250 align:middle line:84%
and that the graduation
day is about here.

00:52:35.250 --> 00:52:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And more people are
going to come forward

00:52:37.530 --> 00:52:38.532 align:middle line:90%
with their stories.

00:52:38.532 --> 00:52:39.740 align:middle line:90%
And there is a tipping point.

00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:41.580 align:middle line:84%
I feel we're at a
tipping point, George,

00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:44.520 align:middle line:84%
where there's going to be more
receptivity to this information

00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:45.801 align:middle line:90%
than ever before.

00:52:45.801 --> 00:52:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's being shown
in some of the programming now.

00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:49.830 align:middle line:90%
It's more positive.

00:52:49.830 --> 00:52:53.040 align:middle line:84%
The films and television shows
are a little bit more positive.

00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:54.373 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It seems more accepted.

00:52:54.373 --> 00:52:56.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: More accepted, yes.

00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:59.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yet we don't have
the far-fetched stories

00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:01.680 align:middle line:90%
of the George Van Tassels.

00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:03.999 align:middle line:90%
Like we had in those days.

00:53:03.999 --> 00:53:05.040 align:middle line:90%
We don't have them today.

00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:06.979 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:53:06.979 --> 00:53:08.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: Again, I
believe that the people,

00:53:08.770 --> 00:53:11.230 align:middle line:84%
such as Valient Thorr and
others that are visiting here,

00:53:11.230 --> 00:53:12.910 align:middle line:84%
are going to make
their presence known.

00:53:12.910 --> 00:53:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And when that does occur,
there will no longer

00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:19.810 align:middle line:84%
be the need for doubt,
or fear, or ridicule.

00:53:19.810 --> 00:53:24.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you see the day
that we, as people, will truly

00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:27.610 align:middle line:84%
understand we've been
contacted by extraterrestrials?

00:53:27.610 --> 00:53:29.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: I believe that
with every fiber of my being.

00:53:29.860 --> 00:53:32.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how
will we handle it?

00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:34.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: I am hoping,
with acceptance.

00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:37.142 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping, with acceptance
and without fear.

00:53:37.142 --> 00:53:38.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
about the Church?

00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:39.800 align:middle line:90%
What will the Church do?

00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:40.640 align:middle line:90%
The Catholic church.

00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:42.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: I believe, I've
heard several stories

00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:44.870 align:middle line:84%
that the disclosure
process is going

00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:47.840 align:middle line:84%
to incorporate using the
world's religions that they're

00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:51.290 align:middle line:84%
being coached to come
forward with this information

00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:54.140 align:middle line:84%
and that they're going
to help to overcome

00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:59.220 align:middle line:84%
the fundamentalist attitude
towards this being a doomsday

00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:00.020 align:middle line:90%
event.

00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:01.160 align:middle line:90%
It's not a doomsday event.

00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:04.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They had, at
some time, an expert

00:54:04.130 --> 00:54:07.730 align:middle line:84%
within the Vatican,
Father Balducci, who

00:54:07.730 --> 00:54:10.400 align:middle line:90%
would investigate UFO cases.

00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:11.970 align:middle line:90%
That's weird, isn't it?

00:54:11.970 --> 00:54:14.070 align:middle line:84%
They would have somebody
dedicated for this?

00:54:14.070 --> 00:54:14.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: Yes.

00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:16.520 align:middle line:84%
I had heard a story
by somebody who

00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:20.120 align:middle line:84%
had a close association
with the Vatican

00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:23.900 align:middle line:84%
that the current pope
had a visit with one

00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:26.889 align:middle line:84%
of the beings who looks exactly
like us for about an hour.

00:54:26.889 --> 00:54:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And when he came back, when
he came out of the meeting,

00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:32.960 align:middle line:84%
he was telling other Cardinals,
there's nothing to fear.

00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:35.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think the alien greys are?

00:54:35.810 --> 00:54:38.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: I think that
they are a diversion.

00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:41.660 align:middle line:84%
I think that they're
self-serving.

00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:44.680 align:middle line:84%
I'd heard that there had been
meetings with Eisenhower,

00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:46.580 align:middle line:84%
that there were four
meetings-- two of them

00:54:46.580 --> 00:54:49.400 align:middle line:84%
with beings that look like us
and to them with the greys.

00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:51.140 align:middle line:84%
And the beings that
look like us told

00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:52.760 align:middle line:84%
them to be very
careful of the greys,

00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:53.886 align:middle line:90%
that they can be deceptive.

00:54:53.886 --> 00:54:54.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:56.930 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: And apparently,
we formed an agreement

00:54:56.930 --> 00:55:00.560 align:middle line:84%
with the greys that was
not in our best interest.

00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:02.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this planet
going to survive?

00:55:02.570 --> 00:55:04.700 align:middle line:90%
Will there be a false flag?

00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:09.320 align:middle line:84%
Will there be, like,
"Independence Day,"

00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:11.810 align:middle line:84%
the movie, where we
wake up in the morning,

00:55:11.810 --> 00:55:15.320 align:middle line:84%
and there are huge
UFOs over cities that

00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:16.940 align:middle line:90%
are trying to take us over?

00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:18.044 align:middle line:90%
Could that happen?

00:55:18.044 --> 00:55:19.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: I've
been told by people

00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:21.380 align:middle line:84%
that are very clairvoyant,
and a lot of women

00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:24.430 align:middle line:84%
have told me this, that when
they look up into the sky,

00:55:24.430 --> 00:55:25.680 align:middle line:90%
they could barely see the sky.

00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:27.380 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
craft there that are

00:55:27.380 --> 00:55:29.360 align:middle line:84%
ready to make their
existence known,

00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:33.770 align:middle line:84%
that are here for a graduation
ceremony and an acceptance

00:55:33.770 --> 00:55:36.680 align:middle line:84%
ceremony of us being brought
back into the cosmic family.

00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:39.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you go on a
craft if you were invited?

00:55:39.090 --> 00:55:39.890 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: Yes.

00:55:39.890 --> 00:55:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you
leave the planet?

00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:43.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: I believe
my work is here.

00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:44.304 align:middle line:90%


00:55:44.304 --> 00:55:45.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You'd want to stay?

00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:47.803 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: I'd want to stay
and help bring more people up

00:55:47.803 --> 00:55:49.940 align:middle line:90%
to that level of awareness.

00:55:49.940 --> 00:55:51.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
say to the skeptic,

00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:55.670 align:middle line:84%
the person who doesn't
believe, who says to you,

00:55:55.670 --> 00:56:01.950 align:middle line:84%
come on, these contactees, they
were never picked up by craft.

00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:03.467 align:middle line:90%
They didn't do this.

00:56:03.467 --> 00:56:04.800 align:middle line:90%
What do you say to these people?

00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:07.950 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: I say to
them, remain open.

00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:10.920 align:middle line:84%
Don't accept everything that
you're being told right now.

00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:13.170 align:middle line:84%
Just allow it to come
into your consciousness.

00:56:13.170 --> 00:56:15.390 align:middle line:84%
Put it maybe on the back
burner of your thinking,

00:56:15.390 --> 00:56:17.010 align:middle line:90%
and allow room for expansion.

00:56:17.010 --> 00:56:19.470 align:middle line:84%
It may give you an opportunity
to bridge from one concept

00:56:19.470 --> 00:56:22.950 align:middle line:84%
to another that may make it
easier for you to be accepting

00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:24.220 align:middle line:90%
of what's going to be--

00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
hopeful for the future?

00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:26.140 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: I am.

00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:27.370 align:middle line:90%
I am.

00:56:27.370 --> 00:56:28.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And excited about it?

00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:30.352 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: I rush
to every new day.

00:56:30.352 --> 00:56:32.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you glad you're
doing what you're doing?

00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:34.101 align:middle line:84%
>>CHILLE: I'm happy
to be of service.

00:56:34.101 --> 00:56:36.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what does
the future hold for you?

00:56:36.570 --> 00:56:38.460 align:middle line:10%
>>CHILLE: A joy
that we can finally

00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:41.781 align:middle line:10%
say that we're one with
those who have presented

00:56:41.781 --> 00:56:44.280 align:middle line:10%
their images to us, like through
the work of Celaya Winkler,

00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:47.034 align:middle line:10%
and through George Van
Tassel, and through others.

00:56:47.034 --> 00:56:48.450 align:middle line:84%
I really believe
that they're here

00:56:48.450 --> 00:56:50.544 align:middle line:84%
for our benefit
and our well-being.

00:56:50.544 --> 00:56:52.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Frank, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:53.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CHILLE: Thank you.

00:56:53.250 --> 00:56:55.000 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It is so great
having researchers

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:59.160 align:middle line:10%
like Frank Chille who can
investigate, probe, and look

00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:01.680 align:middle line:10%
at these abductee cases.

00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:05.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
