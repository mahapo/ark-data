>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.200 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

What a great program
we have for you.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.760 align:middle line:10%
Jonathan Zap is an author,
philosopher, journalist,

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.910 align:middle line:10%
teacher, who has written
extensively on psychology

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.650 align:middle line:10%
and contemporary mythology.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.620 align:middle line:84%
His most recent book is called
"Crossing the Event Horizon."

Jonathan, welcome back
to "Beyond Belief."

>>JONATHAN ZAP: Good to be back.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were last with us
about three, four years ago,

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:46.870 align:middle line:90%
weren't you?

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.438 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: 2017, I believe.

00:00:48.438 --> 00:00:49.980 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I had a
great time with you.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
have another one today.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:52.880 align:middle line:90%
What's new with you?

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.370 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: Well I've been
working on the subject

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.710 align:middle line:84%
of interdimensional
communication

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.230 align:middle line:84%
and then also working
on a fantasy epic

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.410 align:middle line:90%
called, "Parallel Journeys."

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.930 align:middle line:84%
I've been working
on for decades,

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.370 align:middle line:90%
but I'm finally getting close.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:05.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.718 align:middle line:84%
What are interdimensional
relationships and entities?

00:01:09.718 --> 00:01:11.010 align:middle line:90%
What are we talking about here?

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.470 align:middle line:10%
>>ZAP: Well, I mean the most
familiar example, of course,

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.340 align:middle line:10%
is communicating
with the deceased.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.620 align:middle line:10%
But there are many
other types where

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.540 align:middle line:10%
it can also be ambiguous, what
the source of the other entity

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.530 align:middle line:10%
is.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.770 align:middle line:84%
So they can be, for example,
alternate personalities,

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.260 align:middle line:84%
like in multiple personality
disorder, now called

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.580 align:middle line:90%
dissociative identity disorder.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.000 align:middle line:10%
You can have multiple psyches.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.420 align:middle line:10%
The human body, the
human being can support

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.520 align:middle line:10%
more than one personality.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And so those are
interdimensional in the sense

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.860 align:middle line:84%
of sort of being
intrapsychic relationships.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.830 align:middle line:84%
But the most classic
would be what

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.810 align:middle line:84%
appears to be communication
with the deceased.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.185 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
we tap into this?

00:01:52.185 --> 00:01:54.110 align:middle line:90%
How do we communicate with them?

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: Well, I didn't
go looking for that.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.190 align:middle line:90%
For me, it just happened.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And it will spontaneously
happen for a great many people.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.860 align:middle line:90%
They did a scientific poll.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.480 align:middle line:84%
Maybe, it was a
Gallup Poll that found

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.150 align:middle line:84%
something like 80%
of all Americans

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.030 align:middle line:84%
have had some kind of experience
at some point in their life,

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.500 align:middle line:84%
where they felt
very strongly, it

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.440 align:middle line:84%
was communication from
a deceased loved one,

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.677 align:middle line:84%
usually happening shortly
after they passed.

00:02:17.677 --> 00:02:19.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now this communication
with them, though,

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.660 align:middle line:84%
when you say it just
kind of happens,

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.160 align:middle line:84%
so is it like a phone
call in the head?

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.560 align:middle line:90%
How does that come about?

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: Well, often, it happens
when people are driving.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.850 align:middle line:84%
It happened because
they're sort of occupied.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.412 align:middle line:84%
You can sort of
drive on autopilot,

00:02:34.412 --> 00:02:35.870 align:middle line:84%
but you're sort of
doing something.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.170 align:middle line:84%
So you can sort of let
your mind float free.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.330 align:middle line:84%
For other people, it
could happen in the shower

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.810 align:middle line:90%
or that kind of thing.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously, there are
ways of meditating and trying

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.680 align:middle line:90%
to invite in such a presence.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.200 align:middle line:84%
But I think for
most people who have

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.280 align:middle line:84%
had strong experiences of it,
it's happened spontaneously.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it's not something
where you have to meditate on

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:57.920 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that?

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.290 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: I mean, people
recommend meditation.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.210 align:middle line:90%
I personally don't do that.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.280 align:middle line:90%
It's just hasn't been necessary.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.940 align:middle line:84%
But it can happen in many
different circumstances,

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.080 align:middle line:84%
often in something that may seem
like a dream or while asleep.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.480 align:middle line:10%
For example, there's the
so-called "Peak in Darien"

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.363 align:middle line:10%
experiences where--

00:03:15.363 --> 00:03:16.280 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What is that?

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.610 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: Well, that's
where someone is deceased

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.260 align:middle line:84%
but they're not known to be
deceased by the person who

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.060 align:middle line:90%
experiences--

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At that time.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: --a spectral
presence, right?

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.140 align:middle line:84%
So for example, a young college
student dies in a car accident.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.410 align:middle line:84%
And now his 12-year-old brother
comes down to breakfast,

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.855 align:middle line:90%
and says, I just saw Sammy.

00:03:35.855 --> 00:03:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, what
are you talking about?

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:38.550 align:middle line:90%
He's at school.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.400 align:middle line:84%
I know he was just
standing in my bedroom.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.290 align:middle line:84%
And he said everything's
going to be OK.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And then they get
the phone call.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.240 align:middle line:84%
So there are quite a number
of those experiences that

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:53.600 align:middle line:84%
seem impressively evidential in
that the precipient, the person

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.470 align:middle line:84%
having the experience, did not
know that the person passed.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And they weren't
somebody who was expected

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.990 align:middle line:84%
to pass like somebody on
their deathbed or something

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.270 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.645 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jonathan, how do we
know that that individual is

00:04:02.645 --> 00:04:05.570 align:middle line:84%
not hallucinating or something
just happening to them?

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:06.960 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: So that's the thing.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.110 align:middle line:84%
If we really want to
approach the paranormal

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.930 align:middle line:84%
with intellectual rigor,
which I try and do,

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.200 align:middle line:84%
we really can never
completely eliminate ambiguity

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.430 align:middle line:90%
about almost anything.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.529 align:middle line:84%
So there's an idea of
competitive plausibility, where

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:24.170 align:middle line:84%
after a certain point,
you have so much evidence

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:29.150 align:middle line:84%
that the survival hypothesis
seems like the one that

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.860 align:middle line:90%
would be the most likely.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.750 align:middle line:84%
But there are these
other explanations,

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.150 align:middle line:84%
like supersized
explanations, are called,

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.150 align:middle line:84%
where somebody is tapping
into the Akashic record

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.430 align:middle line:84%
or some universal
field of knowledge,

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.680 align:middle line:84%
where they could know
things in other ways.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.382 align:middle line:84%
And so you really,
at a certain point,

00:04:46.382 --> 00:04:48.590 align:middle line:84%
have to approach things--
or I try to approach things

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.920 align:middle line:84%
from what's called the
phenomenological point of view

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.290 align:middle line:84%
where you just sort of
relate to the experience

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.240 align:middle line:84%
on its own terms, and maybe more
with your heart than your head.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.540 align:middle line:84%
Because I can endlessly,
using my head,

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.360 align:middle line:84%
come up with counter
explanations.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.240 align:middle line:84%
So for example, I have a
relationship with somebody

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.970 align:middle line:84%
who I knew in life but
who is now deceased.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And if he were to tell
me, well, since you're

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.470 align:middle line:84%
doubting whether it's really
me or not, pull out a coin.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:19.790 align:middle line:90%
Flip it 12 times.

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.080 align:middle line:84%
I predict it will end on
tails, 12 times in a row.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.610 align:middle line:84%
And let's say I carry out the
experiment, and that happens.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, did that prove that
my deceased friend exists?

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:31.710 align:middle line:90%
Well, no.

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.620 align:middle line:84%
Because this is the dirty little
secret of paranormal research.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.320 align:middle line:84%
You can't eliminate all kinds
of other paranormal vectors.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.910 align:middle line:84%
Maybe, telekinetically,
I did it.

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And probability.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.495 align:middle line:90%
Even though, it's enormous.

00:05:42.495 --> 00:05:44.140 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: It's extremely low.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.920 align:middle line:84%
But that would be
a tiny possibility.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.990 align:middle line:84%
But really, one of
the more likely ones

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.570 align:middle line:84%
would be short-term
clairvoyance about when

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.030 align:middle line:90%
to conduct an experiment.

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.830 align:middle line:84%
It's called decision
augmentation theory.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.820 align:middle line:84%
Because we have the strongest
evidence in paranormal research

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.470 align:middle line:90%
for short-term clairvoyance.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.190 align:middle line:84%
Quite a number of people
and triple-blind studies

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:10.200 align:middle line:84%
will be able to show
physiological stress responses

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.233 align:middle line:84%
before a computer generates
an upsetting image,

00:06:13.233 --> 00:06:15.150 align:middle line:84%
that even the computer
didn't know was coming.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.620 align:middle line:84%
They're just being chosen
by randomizing algorithms

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:18.420 align:middle line:90%
in microseconds.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sounds like
Dr. Dean Radin's work.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:21.720 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Dean Radin, exactly.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:22.887 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That kind of stuff.

00:06:22.887 --> 00:06:25.920 align:middle line:84%
On the Gaia program, "Cosmic
Disclosure," Emery Smith

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.560 align:middle line:84%
talked about
interdimensional beings.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.230 align:middle line:84%
Emery, when we talk about
interdimensional beings,

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.460 align:middle line:90%
what are we talking about.?

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.870 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: We're talking
about a race of beings

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.960 align:middle line:10%
a hundreds of millions
of years ahead of us,

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.710 align:middle line:10%
that have already
been able to master

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.350 align:middle line:10%
how to change their form.

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:49.320 align:middle line:84%
They are allowed to switch
their atoms and photons around

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.870 align:middle line:84%
to take almost any form
they want and travel

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.760 align:middle line:90%
through time and space.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.510 align:middle line:84%
It can go from a light
body to a 3-D body.

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:00.210 align:middle line:84%
It can change its
frequency at will

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:02.370 align:middle line:90%
to go to another dimension.

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.520 align:middle line:84%
It can phase in,
phase out, lead in,

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.890 align:middle line:90%
Lead out of multiple dimensions.

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:09.960 align:middle line:84%
That makes it an
interdimensional being.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At any time?

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: At any time
by its own will.

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:18.065 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they physical, or
are they somewhat ghostlike?

00:07:18.065 --> 00:07:19.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, that's
a great question.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:20.490 align:middle line:90%
I get that a lot.

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.700 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of these
sightings and things people

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.580 align:middle line:84%
are referring to them
as ghosts or people

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.800 align:middle line:84%
report ghosts being
seen when they're really

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.480 align:middle line:90%
these interdimensional beings.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.790 align:middle line:84%
The interesting
science behind this

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:36.210 align:middle line:84%
is that when an interdimensional
being enters our dimension,

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:40.290 align:middle line:84%
he falls under the laws of
our three-dimensional reality.

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.870 align:middle line:84%
So he has to take
some sort of form.

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:45.420 align:middle line:84%
But don't forget
light is form, too.

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.990 align:middle line:10%
So that can be visualized
by our five senses

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:52.980 align:middle line:10%
here on planet Earth, or
through our solar system,

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.840 align:middle line:10%
in this universe,
in this dimension.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.490 align:middle line:84%
So as they come through, they
might change from a light being

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:01.890 align:middle line:90%
into a form of their choice.

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:04.860 align:middle line:84%
Or they also could
stay in the light form.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:08.760 align:middle line:84%
So many accounts of you have
heard around in history books

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.340 align:middle line:84%
and around the planet of these
ghost like sightings-- now,

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:16.410 align:middle line:84%
some are ghost, which means if
you are to pass away right now,

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:21.550 align:middle line:84%
your photons will still be in
that chair for 30 days or more.

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And so this is what
I'm getting at.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:28.860 align:middle line:84%
The photons of the genetic make
up of the DNA is always there.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:31.050 align:middle line:84%
Even when we leave
our seats right now

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:34.049 align:middle line:84%
and come back tomorrow morning,
we're still going to have--

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:37.135 align:middle line:84%
our resident energy is
still going to be here.

00:08:37.135 --> 00:08:38.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You agree
with that, Jonathan?

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.440 align:middle line:84%
Your energy is still
going to be there.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.392 align:middle line:90%
You get up and leave.

00:08:41.392 --> 00:08:43.600 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to be there
for another couple of days?

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: Well, I don't know about
the residual photon theory.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:50.370 align:middle line:84%
But we do know that information
cannot be destroyed.

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.900 align:middle line:10%
That's what the so-called
black hole wars were about,

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:56.580 align:middle line:10%
between the physicist Leonard
Susskind and Stephen Hawking,

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.290 align:middle line:10%
and Leonard Susskind won.

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:00.220 align:middle line:10%
Because Stephen Hawking--
he was very upset.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:02.610 align:middle line:10%
He went to a lecture
that Stephen Hawking

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:05.010 align:middle line:10%
gave about 25 years ago,
where Stephen Hawking said,

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:07.920 align:middle line:10%
in a black hole, even
information is destroyed.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.620 align:middle line:84%
And that sort of hit Leonard
Susskind like a thunderbolt.

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And he set out to prove--
he bet a bottle of wine.

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:14.520 align:middle line:90%
He eventually collected that.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not a bad bet.

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:20.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: So the universe's
information is conserved.

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:24.150 align:middle line:84%
So whether it's residual
photons or not, I don't know.

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:27.570 align:middle line:84%
But definitely, we
see many evidences

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:31.420 align:middle line:84%
that there's a complete
record of our lives,

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:33.990 align:middle line:84%
even more than
what we could have

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.500 align:middle line:90%
perceived through our senses.

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:38.190 align:middle line:84%
So when people have a near-death
experience and they have a life

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:42.360 align:middle line:84%
review, they may
see what things--

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.490 align:middle line:84%
they may telepathically
sense what

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:47.740 align:middle line:84%
other people were feeling while
they were talking to them.

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:49.500 align:middle line:84%
They may have been
blind since birth.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.410 align:middle line:10%
This is discussed in a
book called "Mindsight,"

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:54.240 align:middle line:10%
congenitally blind
since birth and have

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.260 align:middle line:10%
a highly visual experience
in your life review

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.190 align:middle line:10%
and be able to comprehend that.

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:04.560 align:middle line:84%
So this really suggests that
the system itself, the universe,

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.940 align:middle line:84%
the cosmos, is sort of storing
a complete record of everything

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:14.250 align:middle line:84%
that in the right state, the
individual entity or living

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:16.540 align:middle line:84%
person even
sometimes can access.

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:19.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this supernatural,
or is there a science behind

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:21.180 align:middle line:90%
it?

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:25.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: Well, I think the word
supernatural just means nature

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:29.080 align:middle line:84%
that we don't understand or that
science hasn't comprehended.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:32.230 align:middle line:84%
Because nothing can really
be outside of nature.

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:36.580 align:middle line:84%
We happen to live in a time
when a whole vast cryptozoology

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:39.250 align:middle line:84%
of life forms has
become visible,

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:41.500 align:middle line:84%
and we're understanding
about them.

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.720 align:middle line:84%
But in the
Renaissance, they would

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.490 align:middle line:84%
have no idea what
you're talking about

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:48.470 align:middle line:84%
if you said virus, or bacteria,
or anything like that.

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:50.830 align:middle line:84%
So I think science may
eventually catch up

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:54.820 align:middle line:84%
with these more
energetic forms of life

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:58.780 align:middle line:84%
that are present
instruments don't locate.

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:01.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jonathan,
what is a tulpa?

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.950 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Well, a tulpa is--

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:06.100 align:middle line:84%
I think it literally means
mind-made entity, or something

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:07.270 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And there are different
versions in different mystical

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:11.900 align:middle line:84%
traditions, like the
Jewish tradition,

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:13.630 align:middle line:90%
you talk about dybbuks.

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:18.467 align:middle line:84%
And basically, it's where you
set out to create an entity,

00:11:18.467 --> 00:11:20.050 align:middle line:84%
not to summon one
from the other side.

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:21.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The
individual creates it?

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:23.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: Exactly, or sometimes
a group of individuals.

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:27.640 align:middle line:84%
For example, there was a group
of British spiritualists,

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:29.530 align:middle line:84%
very educated people,
and they decided

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:34.447 align:middle line:84%
to create an entity, a human
being with a whole history.

00:11:34.447 --> 00:11:36.280 align:middle line:84%
They made up the name,
almost like a fiction

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:36.670 align:middle line:90%
writer, the whole history.

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:37.962 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The create or conjure.

00:11:37.962 --> 00:11:39.130 align:middle line:90%
Two different things, right?

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:40.150 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Not conjure, create.

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:42.177 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: So in other
words, completely out

00:11:42.177 --> 00:11:44.050 align:middle line:84%
of their own
collective imagination.

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:44.980 align:middle line:90%
They gave him a name.

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:46.300 align:middle line:90%
They gave him a history.

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:50.530 align:middle line:84%
But then they found that once
they had put enough energy

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:52.690 align:middle line:84%
into him, that he
started to have

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:55.480 align:middle line:84%
his own personality
and preferences,

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:59.080 align:middle line:84%
and as if he had an
independent autonomous life.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that
fiction writers, for example,

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:02.390 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:04.305 align:middle line:90%
I'm a fiction writer myself.

00:12:04.305 --> 00:12:05.680 align:middle line:84%
After a certain
point, characters

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.180 align:middle line:84%
take on a life of
their own and may

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:11.050 align:middle line:84%
do things that are inconvenient
to the plot of the story.

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:13.500 align:middle line:84%
But there's a whole movement
of people right now.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.000 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot about it online,
where people are creating

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.030 align:middle line:84%
these entities, and
investing them with life,

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:21.940 align:middle line:84%
and using them for
different purposes,

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:23.450 align:middle line:90%
and that kind of thing.

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And after a certain point,
they seem to become autonomous.

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And you can look at
it from the point

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:34.900 align:middle line:84%
of view of multiple personality
disorder kind of situation.

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.730 align:middle line:84%
But there seems like there may
be something even more to it

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:38.530 align:middle line:90%
than that.

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:40.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why would
somebody want to create

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.000 align:middle line:90%
an interdimensional being?

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.370 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: Well, it could
be for many reasons.

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:49.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, first of all, we
are a creative species.

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:51.820 align:middle line:84%
If there's anything
that we can do,

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:53.410 align:middle line:84%
somebody is going
to try and do it.

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And it could be for good
reasons or bad reasons.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.370 align:middle line:84%
Some people may want to create
such a being as a companion,

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:05.410 align:middle line:84%
a companion that is more
designed perfectly for them,

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:08.973 align:middle line:84%
which many ordinary
relationships aren't.

00:13:08.973 --> 00:13:11.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Somebody actually
would have a relationship

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:13.400 align:middle line:90%
with an interdimensional being?

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:14.200 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Yeah.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.973 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean people
do all the time.

00:13:15.973 --> 00:13:17.890 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there
could be many categories.

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:20.020 align:middle line:90%
But the tulpa idea--

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.970 align:middle line:84%
and I don't think
that's what I'm doing,

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:25.210 align:middle line:84%
but I mean I have to
consider that possibility--

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:27.700 align:middle line:90%
is a being that you create.

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And I guess the
closest analogy would

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:31.900 align:middle line:84%
be like what a fiction
writer would do,

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.240 align:middle line:84%
where, maybe, let's say
the fiction writer likes

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.410 align:middle line:90%
their character so much.

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:38.230 align:middle line:84%
They sort of keep them around
and start having conversations

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:39.790 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And they may have very
novel perspectives,

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:44.440 align:middle line:90%
and this type of thing.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.120 align:middle line:84%
But it may also be
possible that they're

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:49.090 align:middle line:84%
able to give them
autonomous life.

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:53.398 align:middle line:84%
Because when we
think about who we,

00:13:53.398 --> 00:13:56.050 align:middle line:84%
we are not really so
physical as we think.

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:59.440 align:middle line:84%
We know from mainstream
physics that if we

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.590 align:middle line:84%
were to take all the empty
space out of all the atoms,

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:04.480 align:middle line:84%
all seven billion
people on this Earth

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.300 align:middle line:90%
would fit into one sugar cube.

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.100 align:middle line:90%


00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:12.280 align:middle line:84%
How do we create
life biologically?

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a pretty
mysterious process.

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we don't actually
need a carbon-based chemistry

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:21.100 align:middle line:90%
in order to create a new psyche.

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jonathan, is
there anything weird

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:25.930 align:middle line:84%
about creating an
interdimensional being?

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:28.110 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: Well, it's
extremely weird.

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:29.503 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I knew it.

00:14:29.503 --> 00:14:31.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: And that may be
part of the attraction,

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:35.240 align:middle line:84%
is that people may be bored
with conventional relationships.

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you
don't see them, right?

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.280 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Well, yes, and no.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:42.280 align:middle line:84%
So for example, when we're
talking about-- let's say

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.680 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about after
death relationships,

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:47.050 align:middle line:84%
now sometimes people
just sense a presence.

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:50.800 align:middle line:84%
Other times people
have a full on ocular

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.840 align:middle line:84%
experience, where it
seems like they're

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:59.560 align:middle line:84%
seeing this deceased person
as vividly as I'm seeing you.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:02.380 align:middle line:84%
In other cases, it's sort
of like you're seeing them

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:04.180 align:middle line:90%
with your mind's eye.

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:07.370 align:middle line:84%
And in the relationship
that I have, for example,

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:12.790 align:middle line:84%
that seems like an after
death relationship, at first,

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:14.625 align:middle line:84%
the visualization
was very unstable.

00:15:14.625 --> 00:15:19.420 align:middle line:84%
It was sort of like looking
at a Picasso cubist painting.

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:20.810 align:middle line:90%
I tried to stare too fixedly.

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:23.690 align:middle line:84%
It would sort of split
into multiple perspectives.

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And it would seem take
a lot of cognitive load

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:29.530 align:middle line:84%
for me to consistently
visualize him.

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:32.020 align:middle line:84%
But since then,
there's been some kind

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:34.120 align:middle line:84%
of learning, or
symbiosis, or something,

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:37.310 align:middle line:84%
where now the
visualization is very easy.

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:38.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:40.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: But it's not
full on ocular vision.

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:43.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm not seeing him with
the meat camera eyes,

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:46.060 align:middle line:90%
but sort of with my mind's eye.

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it
would be easier

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:51.640 align:middle line:84%
to see him in a situation
where the lighting is muted

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:54.730 align:middle line:84%
and where it's not competing,
like I'm in busy traffic,

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:58.610 align:middle line:84%
and I have to keep my focus
on what my meat camera

00:15:58.610 --> 00:15:59.410 align:middle line:90%
eyes are seeing.

00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:02.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If somebody is having
problems with relationships,

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:05.410 align:middle line:84%
in human relationships,
do they then

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:10.240 align:middle line:84%
create these interdimensional
relationships to offset that?

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:13.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: Well, a classic
example would be the child

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:14.540 align:middle line:90%
who has an imaginary friend.

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:15.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:17.523 align:middle line:90%
And most do.

00:16:17.523 --> 00:16:18.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: And many
parents will think

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:22.630 align:middle line:84%
that they should discourage
that, which I'm not

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:23.890 align:middle line:90%
so sure that they should.

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:24.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I agree.

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:25.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: I mean, I
think it depends on--

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:26.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let it happen.

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:26.710 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: I mean, yeah.

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:29.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think it's just like
having a regular friendship.

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some friends
are trouble and may

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:34.600 align:middle line:84%
get the kid into trouble,
and others are quite healthy.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:37.745 align:middle line:90%
But imaginary friends are real.

00:16:37.745 --> 00:16:40.120 align:middle line:10%
And let me explain, because
this is what they always say,

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.380 align:middle line:10%
they're not real.

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:44.620 align:middle line:84%
But it's really sort of
a cultural prejudice.

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:48.670 align:middle line:84%
Because let's say I ask you
to think of a pink elephant,

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:49.870 align:middle line:90%
and you do.

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:52.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's a factual
actuality that you

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:56.800 align:middle line:84%
had that image pop into your
mind at that particular moment.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.930 align:middle line:84%
The history of the
unfolding of the universe

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:01.690 align:middle line:84%
has to include the fact that
you thought of a pink elephant

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:05.800 align:middle line:84%
and not a blue Toyota 4Runner
at that particular moment.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.430 align:middle line:90%
Or it would be inaccurate.

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:09.400 align:middle line:84%
So imaginary
objects-- this is what

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.670 align:middle line:84%
Jung called his great discovery,
that the psyche was real.

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:14.890 align:middle line:90%
Imaginary objects are real.

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:16.180 align:middle line:90%
They are factual.

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.700 align:middle line:84%
They don't have the
physical substrate

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:22.290 align:middle line:84%
that an object that we see
with our ocular vision does.

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:24.040 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't mean
that they're not real.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.750 align:middle line:90%
Anything that exists is real.

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:27.880 align:middle line:84%
That exists in
imagination, it's real,

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.280 align:middle line:84%
and that can be a very
powerful place for things

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.570 align:middle line:90%
to exist as it turns out.

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:33.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you've
had relationships

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.550 align:middle line:84%
with these dimensional
beings that you've created.

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:39.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: Well, I don't know
if I've created them.

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:41.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can in the
sense that they...

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:42.430 align:middle line:90%
Hmm?

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:44.263 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they've
been around you, right?

00:17:44.263 --> 00:17:48.190 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: Yeah, where it's still
ambiguous what the source is.

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:52.030 align:middle line:84%
So for example, the
one that appears

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:54.190 align:middle line:84%
to have continuity,
which he insists on

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:59.710 align:middle line:84%
with my deceased friend, if
I start to be intellectually

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:02.982 align:middle line:84%
rigorous, I can't
remove all the ambiguity

00:18:02.982 --> 00:18:04.690 align:middle line:84%
because if you know
somebody really well,

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:07.120 align:middle line:84%
you sort of have a
holographic memory of them.

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.490 align:middle line:84%
If I asked you
like, imagine what

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:12.370 align:middle line:84%
your mom would say in regard
to a certain question,

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:14.650 align:middle line:84%
you could probably hear
her voice, her laugh.

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:16.420 align:middle line:84%
You could visualize
the whole thing

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:21.100 align:middle line:84%
because you have this complex
holographic memory of her.

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:23.860 align:middle line:84%
So if you know somebody
well enough, you have that.

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:27.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, maybe I created an
imaginary friend, like a tulpa,

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:29.770 align:middle line:90%
based on my holographic memory.

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:32.230 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of evidence
that seems to point more

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:34.180 align:middle line:84%
toward the continuity
hypothesis,

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:38.360 align:middle line:84%
but I can't absolutely prove
that because you never really

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:39.160 align:middle line:90%
can.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.470 align:middle line:84%
You can always come up with
a super-sci explanation

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:43.310 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:45.520 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
there are beings,

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:49.270 align:middle line:84%
like in my fiction writing or in
certain imaginative exercises,

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:53.178 align:middle line:84%
where I absolutely am
creating another entity,

00:18:53.178 --> 00:18:54.220 align:middle line:90%
or at least I think I am.

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:55.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On your own?

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:56.010 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Right.

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:56.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:58.183 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: So that's what
a fiction writer does.

00:18:58.183 --> 00:18:59.980 align:middle line:84%
But even then, you
never really know

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:02.380 align:middle line:84%
because maybe this
vivid character

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:07.360 align:middle line:84%
is somebody who lives somewhere
else that I haven't met,

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.310 align:middle line:90%
who will live somewhere else.

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:11.680 align:middle line:84%
We don't really
know what the source

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:15.610 align:middle line:84%
is of these different entities
that come into being even,

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:17.410 align:middle line:84%
if we think we've
just imagined them.

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:18.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
Jonathan, earlier you

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:21.050 align:middle line:84%
said they could be good
things or bad things.

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:21.850 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Sure.

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:24.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If they're
bad, what are they?

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:26.410 align:middle line:90%
Have we created demons, or what?

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:29.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: Well, there could
be many possibilities.

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:32.020 align:middle line:84%
One could be that
we've split off

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:34.450 align:middle line:84%
what Jung would call the
shadow, like a darker

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:36.370 align:middle line:84%
part of our own
personality, and now we

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:39.370 align:middle line:84%
have like, a
doppelganger or a double.

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:42.040 align:middle line:84%
There have been a lot
of stories about that.

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:43.870 align:middle line:84%
But another
possibility is that you

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:49.940 align:middle line:84%
have a parasitic entity that
is manipulating us or having

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:50.740 align:middle line:90%
negative effects.

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:52.810 align:middle line:84%
I have a huge number
of writings about that.

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:55.010 align:middle line:84%
We did a show on
this possibility.

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:57.940 align:middle line:84%
And so many of these
interdimensional relationships

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:00.160 align:middle line:90%
are negative or dangerous.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:04.270 align:middle line:84%
They need to be judged with
a lot of the same discernment

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:08.510 align:middle line:84%
that you would use to judge a
fully physical relationship.

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:10.600 align:middle line:84%
So if we say, are
relationships good or bad?

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.730 align:middle line:90%
We would have to say yes.

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:15.730 align:middle line:84%
Just like regular, full,
meat-bodied relationships

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:19.450 align:middle line:84%
can be wonderful or terrible,
so can interdimensional

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:22.060 align:middle line:84%
relationships, so you would
judge them in similar ways.

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:25.020 align:middle line:84%
If the entity or
the physical person

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:27.420 align:middle line:84%
is doing things
without your consent

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:30.690 align:middle line:84%
and compromising your
free will, or trying

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:33.870 align:middle line:84%
to put you in a state
of negative emotion

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:36.570 align:middle line:84%
and feed off of that,
which a drama queen could

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:42.570 align:middle line:84%
do in regular
life, you would not

00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:44.040 align:middle line:84%
want to further
that relationship.

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.840 align:middle line:84%
You would want to
put up boundaries.

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:48.360 align:middle line:84%
So you really can judge
them with the same kind

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.490 align:middle line:84%
of skills of discernment
you would use

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:52.440 align:middle line:90%
to judge other relationships.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:56.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some people who are
psychotic, dual personalities--

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:57.375 align:middle line:90%
might this be the cause?

00:20:57.375 --> 00:21:00.130 align:middle line:90%


00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:03.000 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: So this is
a complex question.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000 align:middle line:84%
People with MPD, multiple
personality disorder,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.400 align:middle line:84%
or dissociative
identity disorder,

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:11.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if they're
classified as psychotic.

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:16.730 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot depends on whether
they have different alters

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:19.200 align:middle line:84%
but they maybe have one
consistent central personality

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.320 align:middle line:84%
that's aware of when the
different alters take over.

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:25.530 align:middle line:84%
We assume that they have
split off their own psyche

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:27.930 align:middle line:84%
into multiple personalities,
but maybe these

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:31.470 align:middle line:84%
are other souls
waiting to incarnate

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:33.270 align:middle line:84%
and that are happening
to share a body.

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:36.720 align:middle line:84%
There is a wonderful movie made
a couple of years ago called

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.570 align:middle line:84%
"Jonathan," strangely enough,
that's about a young man--

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:40.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Probably
after you, right?

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:42.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: Well, there were a lot
of synchronistic connections

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:42.860 align:middle line:90%
to my case.

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:46.620 align:middle line:84%
But there's one body
but two psyches,

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:49.770 align:middle line:84%
and they each split
a 12-hour shift.

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And so it's sort of a dramatic
case of multiple personality.

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very.

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:58.820 align:middle line:84%
In your situation with your
friend who was deceased,

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:02.330 align:middle line:84%
what did you create with
him as an interdimensional

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:03.950 align:middle line:90%
relationship?

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:09.107 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: Well, within 30 minutes
of meeting him in real life--

00:22:09.107 --> 00:22:10.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In the real life.

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:12.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: --in the
real life, we found

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:15.740 align:middle line:84%
that we were obsessed
with the same story, which

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:17.150 align:middle line:90%
I call "Parallel Journeys."

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:20.960 align:middle line:84%
That's my version of it, which I
began writing in the early '80s

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:23.100 align:middle line:90%
to give you an idea.

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:25.730 align:middle line:84%
He described a story
that was haunting him.

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:27.170 align:middle line:84%
It was the same
story, it was just

00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:29.250 align:middle line:90%
sort of a simpler version of it.

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:31.880 align:middle line:10%
And so I have a number of
emails from him where he said,

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:34.970 align:middle line:10%
I really want to help you
with "Parallel Journeys"

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:37.560 align:middle line:10%
because maybe that'll
help me write my story.

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:41.000 align:middle line:84%
So that's something that we seem
to be collaborating on right

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.340 align:middle line:90%
now, which is great because--

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:44.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is he helpful?

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:46.730 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: It's extremely helpful.

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:49.430 align:middle line:84%
And so it can feel
like I'm writing now

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:50.960 align:middle line:90%
with a four-hemisphere brain.

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.960 align:middle line:84%
Of course, somebody else
might read it and think

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.350 align:middle line:90%
it was half of one hemisphere.

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:55.910 align:middle line:90%
That's for others to judge.

00:22:55.910 --> 00:23:01.020 align:middle line:84%
But he has a different type
of language skills than I do,

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:05.780 align:middle line:84%
so it helps to balance out
some of my deficiencies

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:07.200 align:middle line:90%
as a fiction writer.

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:08.820 align:middle line:84%
So that's an example
of something,

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:10.400 align:middle line:84%
but there are many other things
that we work on, as well.

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:12.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
communicate with him?

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:13.140 align:middle line:90%
Telepathy?

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:15.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: Well, it's
telepathic communication.

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:20.750 align:middle line:84%
Conventionally, we think
of telepathy as just words,

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:23.300 align:middle line:84%
but it could also be
visual, and that's

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:26.120 align:middle line:84%
a lot of what my work on the
singularity archetype is about.

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:29.270 align:middle line:84%
Is that there's evidence
of our moving toward a more

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:31.570 align:middle line:90%
visual telepathy.

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:34.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, in his case,
the visual telepathy

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:39.210 align:middle line:84%
might just be a subtle
change in his appearance,

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:41.390 align:middle line:84%
just like you could
change your body language

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:43.850 align:middle line:84%
to communicate something
to me visually in addition

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:46.790 align:middle line:90%
to your words.

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:51.060 align:middle line:84%
But he keeps his physical
presentation pretty consistent.

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:52.580 align:middle line:84%
We were just listening
to Emery talk

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:55.640 align:middle line:84%
about how the interdimensional
beings can appear,

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:56.810 align:middle line:90%
can be shapeshifters.

00:23:56.810 --> 00:24:00.230 align:middle line:84%
They can appear in a whole
variety of different ways.

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:02.960 align:middle line:84%
But usually when we're talking
about the human deceased,

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.910 align:middle line:84%
they usually don't
appear to somebody

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:08.000 align:middle line:84%
as a glowing octopi or something
like that, they usually

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.910 align:middle line:84%
look like a 25-year-old,
extremely healthy and radiant

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:13.800 align:middle line:84%
version of themselves, even
if they died aged and sick.

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:14.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.153 align:middle line:84%
They always come
back, don't they?

00:24:16.153 --> 00:24:17.070 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: They come back.

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:21.080 align:middle line:84%
They want to look familiar to
you so you can recognize them,

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:24.240 align:middle line:84%
but they'll usually be
in a sort of ideal state

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:28.730 align:middle line:84%
because now they are in an
ideoplastic, thought-responsive

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:31.760 align:middle line:84%
body, much like
the avatar that you

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.505 align:middle line:90%
might have in virtual reality.

00:24:34.505 --> 00:24:37.220 align:middle line:84%
Most of us would
idealize our appearance

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.410 align:middle line:84%
if we were going
to create an avatar

00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:44.870 align:middle line:84%
to play a video game like
"World of Warcraft," right?

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:47.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I got to tell you, on
the "Spirit Talk" Gaia show,

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:51.753 align:middle line:84%
medium James Van Praagh had
his thoughts on telepathy.

00:24:51.753 --> 00:24:53.420 align:middle line:84%
>>JAMES VAN PRAAGH:
And the spirit world

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:57.410 align:middle line:84%
know that they are in charge
of sending the signal to me,

00:24:57.410 --> 00:25:00.440 align:middle line:84%
transmitting the signal,
transmitting the code.

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is they have to
send that thought in such a way

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:08.550 align:middle line:84%
that I the medium am able to
receive it in a certain way.

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:11.750 align:middle line:84%
So I like to think of it
sometimes like a radio

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:15.200 align:middle line:84%
bandwidth, and we have
over here and over here,

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.460 align:middle line:90%
this limit to this limit.

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And they have to come somewhere
in between that bandwidth

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:22.730 align:middle line:84%
in order for me to receive it
because my bandwidth is just

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:24.680 align:middle line:84%
this way, and they
have to come in that.

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:27.170 align:middle line:84%
If they send the
thought too quickly,

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:28.910 align:middle line:90%
it'll go beyond my bandwidth.

00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:31.920 align:middle line:84%
If it's too slow, I won't
be able to pick it up.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:36.200 align:middle line:84%
So they really have to project
that signal in a certain way

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.520 align:middle line:90%
that I receive it.

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:42.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, very interestingly, I find
that the best signals I receive

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:45.440 align:middle line:84%
from the spirit world are the
ones that are coming not only

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:48.300 align:middle line:84%
from them-- identification,
who they are--

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:50.660 align:middle line:84%
but if that signal
is sent with love.

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:52.980 align:middle line:84%
When there's a
signal with emotion,

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:54.560 align:middle line:90%
it comes through stronger.

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:57.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that's
an interesting take.

00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:00.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: What I find
is that when having

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:03.450 align:middle line:84%
telepathic communication,
something that

00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:08.660 align:middle line:84%
makes it a little bit more
complex is that what's sent out

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:11.630 align:middle line:84%
can sometimes be the
sort of linguistic intent

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:13.820 align:middle line:84%
before it's actually
turned into words.

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:17.810 align:middle line:84%
Like when I'm creating these
words that I'm speaking,

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:19.890 align:middle line:84%
I sort of have an
idea before I've

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:22.190 align:middle line:84%
turned them into
a sentence of what

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:24.360 align:middle line:90%
I want to communicate to you.

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:27.290 align:middle line:84%
So when you're in a state
of telepathic melding

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:30.890 align:middle line:84%
with another entity,
you can actually

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:35.930 align:middle line:84%
use each other's capacity
to turn things into words.

00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:38.760 align:middle line:84%
So because I'm pretty good
at turning things into words,

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:41.600 align:middle line:84%
if it's a complex
subject, then my friend,

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.820 align:middle line:84%
there's really two beings
that I'm in touch with,

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:48.080 align:middle line:84%
can tap into my
vocabulary and my ability

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:53.030 align:middle line:84%
to use precision to describe
some fairly complex things.

00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:55.480 align:middle line:84%
Other times, it's
completely their voice

00:26:55.480 --> 00:27:00.850 align:middle line:84%
and it's very characteristic of
them and their personalities.

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And they'll even
say, like, if you

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:10.030 align:middle line:84%
think that sounds like you,
we were melding and sharing

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:12.900 align:middle line:84%
linguistic functions,
and that kind of thing.

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:15.940 align:middle line:84%
So that's a little
bit of a twist

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:19.540 align:middle line:84%
on how telepathic
communication can

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:25.190 align:middle line:84%
be sort of like when jazz
musicians synchronize and stuff

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:25.990 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:28.780 align:middle line:84%
Where you kind of share
abilities and come up

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:31.480 align:middle line:84%
with one stream of
language that can

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:35.710 align:middle line:84%
reflect a kind of melded
point of view sometimes.

00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:38.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we doing this,
Jonathan, because we're lonely?

00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:40.540 align:middle line:90%
Tapping into these beings?

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:42.700 align:middle line:90%
Why are we doing this anyway?

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: Well, this is something
I've sometimes pointed out

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:49.210 align:middle line:84%
because it would sound like
to somebody else who might be

00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:51.460 align:middle line:84%
listening, because I'm kind
of an eccentric guy, well,

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:53.890 align:middle line:84%
this is an older,
lonely guy so he's

00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:55.360 align:middle line:90%
making up an imaginary friend.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:55.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:58.115 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: But the thing is that
the whole time when this was

00:27:58.115 --> 00:28:03.880 align:middle line:84%
happening, I was surrounded by
vibrant relationships of all

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:07.505 align:middle line:84%
kinds with young people,
with all kinds of--

00:28:07.505 --> 00:28:08.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Human types?

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:09.830 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Human relationships.

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:14.540 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, it wasn't
for lack of other relationships.

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:18.590 align:middle line:84%
But I found that this
relationship provides

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:21.080 align:middle line:90%
a type of continuous energy.

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:22.970 align:middle line:84%
So for example, I
didn't do something

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:29.420 align:middle line:84%
that I promised to do for
my friend, the deceased one,

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:31.700 align:middle line:84%
maybe showing up for a
writing session or whatever--

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:33.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And does
he angry with you?

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.010 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Well, sure.

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:35.960 align:middle line:90%
He has all the emotions.

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.280 align:middle line:90%
He's not often angry.

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:42.410 align:middle line:84%
He was more often angry in
real life, in ordinary life.

00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:46.070 align:middle line:84%
But he just withdrew his
presence for like, four hours,

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:48.210 align:middle line:84%
and it was a tremendous
drop in my energy level.

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:49.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:50.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: And during
that four hours,

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:54.380 align:middle line:84%
a young, vibrant,
high-energy person

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:58.850 align:middle line:84%
came over that I'm friends
with, and that relationship

00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:03.080 align:middle line:84%
was no substitute for
the loss of his presence,

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:06.320 align:middle line:84%
and even a certain
sensory vitality

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:09.260 align:middle line:84%
because I've given him
permission to experience

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:10.840 align:middle line:90%
my life through my senses.

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And so it can feel like my
senses have a double detention.

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:18.650 align:middle line:84%
And so there's sort of a
continuous level of energy

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:22.520 align:middle line:84%
that I get from
that relationship.

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:24.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you walking
around the house talking

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:27.170 align:middle line:90%
to this entity out loud?

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:28.880 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Not out loud.

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:32.990 align:middle line:84%
And there may be communication
when I'm doing things,

00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:35.270 align:middle line:84%
but really, the
highest-quality communication

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:40.910 align:middle line:84%
happens when I am in my study
with the computer turned on

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:42.020 align:middle line:90%
and I can write it down.

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:46.310 align:middle line:84%
Because being able to write it
down makes it more definite.

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And we can kind of meld
because we're both writers,

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:55.430 align:middle line:84%
and I get a higher-quality
communication.

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:56.930 align:middle line:84%
There are other
cases, though, where

00:29:56.930 --> 00:30:01.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm not thinking about either
of my two companions at all.

00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:04.760 align:middle line:84%
I've had this happen a lot with
situations of exotic travel.

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, they will step
forward very dramatically.

00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:10.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's
exotic travel, per se?

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:12.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: For example,
I was traveling

00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:14.330 align:middle line:90%
with a friend in Paris.

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:17.930 align:middle line:84%
We split up because the
friend had to see a relative.

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And I'm waiting in line
to go into the catacombs.

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And the night before
was the anniversary

00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:26.840 align:middle line:84%
of this deceased
friend's passing,

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:29.313 align:middle line:84%
and I remember saying to my
friend, the one who split off,

00:30:29.313 --> 00:30:30.980 align:middle line:84%
you know, I was going
to light a candle,

00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:32.660 align:middle line:84%
but I haven't heard
from him in months.

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:34.663 align:middle line:84%
I think he must have
moved on, and so forth.

00:30:34.663 --> 00:30:36.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
really felt that?

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:37.070 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Yeah.

00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:38.060 align:middle line:90%
The line felt dead.

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:39.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just waiting
in line, looking

00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:42.290 align:middle line:84%
at my phone or
something, and suddenly,

00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:44.120 align:middle line:90%
just as clear as a bell.

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:48.170 align:middle line:84%
And it was also, when he appears
or when the other one appears,

00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:52.970 align:middle line:84%
even if I can't visually see
them very vividly at first,

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:54.110 align:middle line:90%
it's always spatial.

00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:57.020 align:middle line:84%
Like he's over there, he's not
over there, that kind of thing.

00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:57.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:00.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: And so he showed up
at a significant distance,

00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:06.050 align:middle line:84%
like 25 feet, but the telepathic
voice was so decisive,

00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:08.750 align:middle line:84%
and it was like, this is
the closest you're ever

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:11.810 align:middle line:84%
going to get to see what it's
like in the lower astral.

00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:13.240 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, wow.

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:14.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:15.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: I'm just kind of
like in tourist mode.

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:16.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Almost like
putting you down.

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:17.480 align:middle line:90%
Was he?

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:19.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: Well, no,
he was just being

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:22.640 align:middle line:84%
very dramatic and very dark
because he had spent time

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:23.480 align:middle line:90%
in the lower astral.

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:27.380 align:middle line:84%
I had dreams of him
in the lower astral

00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:30.080 align:middle line:84%
the day that he died
and 12 days before,

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:33.000 align:middle line:84%
not knowing that he was
suicidal or anything like that.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.510 align:middle line:84%
I had no contact with him the
last eight months of his life,

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:38.030 align:middle line:84%
but I had these
premonitory dreams.

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:41.155 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, and then I'm
going down into the catacombs.

00:31:41.155 --> 00:31:42.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
you've ever been.

00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:43.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:48.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: But nothing prepared
me for how intense that was.

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:53.510 align:middle line:84%
Beneath Paris is this labyrinth
with 6 million skeletons,

00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:56.773 align:middle line:84%
and it is the most
intense thing imaginable.

00:31:56.773 --> 00:31:58.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You could
feel it, right?

00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:59.930 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: You feel it, absolutely.

00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:02.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure he was right.

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:05.390 align:middle line:90%
And I had never been there.

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:07.590 align:middle line:84%
I had just read a few
things in, you know,

00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:10.040 align:middle line:84%
touristy Tripadvisor
or whatever.

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:14.300 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't expecting to have
such a dramatic experience,

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:17.840 align:middle line:90%
but he knew what was coming.

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:20.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's something else that's
characterized this relationship

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:24.080 align:middle line:90%
even from the first day of it.

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:25.790 align:middle line:84%
When you're on the
other side, you

00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:29.220 align:middle line:84%
have access to an additional
dimension of time.

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:33.080 align:middle line:84%
They know things that are
coming that you don't know,

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:36.920 align:middle line:84%
and can sort of play little
tricks and anticipate things,

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:39.920 align:middle line:84%
much like people with
access to a higher dimension

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:42.968 align:middle line:84%
if you've ever read
the novella "Flatland."

00:32:42.968 --> 00:32:44.510 align:middle line:84%
If you're a
three-dimensional person,

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:47.122 align:middle line:84%
you can play tricks on
two-dimensional beings

00:32:47.122 --> 00:32:48.080 align:middle line:90%
and that kind of thing.

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:50.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they enjoy
these little tricks?

00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:53.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: He definitely took
a great deal of pleasure

00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:56.630 align:middle line:84%
in the one that happened
within the first hour or two

00:32:56.630 --> 00:33:00.470 align:middle line:84%
of the after-death
relationship beginning.

00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very complex thing,
and he laughed quite a bit

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:08.630 align:middle line:90%
at what he did.

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On Gaia's
"Buzzsaw" show,

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:14.150 align:middle line:84%
the astral traveler
and author Jason Quitt

00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:15.950 align:middle line:84%
talked about his
experiences with

00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:18.380 align:middle line:84%
these interdimensional beings
and whether they're here

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:19.400 align:middle line:90%
to help us.

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:21.110 align:middle line:84%
>>JASON QUITT: The
most amazing thing

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:26.000 align:middle line:84%
that I find about my experiences
is that I can sense and feel

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.920 align:middle line:84%
that something is
in the room with me,

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:30.800 align:middle line:84%
but I can't see them
with my physical eyes.

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:33.360 align:middle line:84%
But I have the ability
to leave my body,

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:37.220 align:middle line:84%
so once I look out of my
body, suddenly those beings

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:40.640 align:middle line:84%
are standing in this room and
I could see them clear as day.

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:42.890 align:middle line:10%
So from my understanding,
those beings,

00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:46.340 align:middle line:10%
like I've seen what
people refer to as

00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:48.890 align:middle line:10%
the greys or the
reptilians or insectoids

00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:52.520 align:middle line:10%
or a whole list of
characters, I only

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:54.960 align:middle line:10%
saw them once I left my body.

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:57.410 align:middle line:84%
So for me, they were never
a physical being for me,

00:33:57.410 --> 00:33:59.298 align:middle line:90%
they were a dimensional being.

00:33:59.298 --> 00:34:01.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN STONE: And of those
beings you talk about,

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:04.250 align:middle line:84%
the reptoids and the
mantids and the greys,

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:06.170 align:middle line:84%
did you find that
they are nefarious,

00:34:06.170 --> 00:34:07.280 align:middle line:90%
as many people claim?

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:09.889 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: I've had
both experiences.

00:34:09.889 --> 00:34:12.500 align:middle line:84%
I've had experiences
which are terrible

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:16.550 align:middle line:84%
and I've had experiences
which are very positive.

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:19.130 align:middle line:84%
So I really have come
to the conclusion

00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:21.290 align:middle line:84%
that you have to
treat every alien,

00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:24.500 align:middle line:84%
or I wouldn't say alien,
every being the same

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:26.600 align:middle line:90%
as you would treat a human.

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:28.070 align:middle line:84%
You have to treat
them with respect

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:29.900 align:middle line:90%
and honor right off the bat.

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:33.260 align:middle line:84%
You don't show fear,
you just stay very calm,

00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:36.110 align:middle line:84%
because there's some that
are very beneficial to you,

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:37.550 align:middle line:90%
which are great teachers.

00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:42.139 align:middle line:84%
And there's some that, like you
say, want to take your energy

00:34:42.139 --> 00:34:44.510 align:middle line:84%
and use you and
manipulate you, which

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:46.940 align:middle line:84%
happens a lot in the
lower astral realms.

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And I feel right now
in this industry,

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:54.050 align:middle line:84%
right now in this
time, many people

00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:57.230 align:middle line:84%
are being taken by
these manipulations.

00:34:57.230 --> 00:35:00.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's precisely what
you've been talking about,

00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:03.440 align:middle line:84%
entities that are doing
things that are beneficial

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:05.660 align:middle line:90%
and some that are pretty dark.

00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:07.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Right.

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:09.470 align:middle line:84%
The two main ones that I
have a relationship with

00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:14.630 align:middle line:84%
are pretty consistently
benign, but I've had encounters

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:16.160 align:middle line:90%
with dark entities.

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:18.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't develop
relationships with them

00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:20.030 align:middle line:84%
because I want to
put up boundaries.

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:20.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:22.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: And in recent
years, I think

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:24.710 align:middle line:84%
they've, if anything, stayed
away from me because they

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:25.752 align:middle line:90%
know I'll write about it.

00:35:25.752 --> 00:35:30.890 align:middle line:84%
But I have had encounters
with parasitic beings,

00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:32.450 align:middle line:84%
and that's been a
subject that I've

00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:34.653 align:middle line:84%
done a lot of writing and
talking about, as well.

00:35:34.653 --> 00:35:37.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And these are the
type that attach to you, right?

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:37.320 align:middle line:90%
Or try to.

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Yeah.

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:39.570 align:middle line:90%
There are many different types.

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:45.200 align:middle line:84%
Some are maybe very
primitive, others

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:48.710 align:middle line:84%
may be more sophisticated
and manipulative

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:49.760 align:middle line:90%
and that kind of thing.

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:52.430 align:middle line:84%
It's a whole vast
subject in itself.

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:54.230 align:middle line:84%
I've kind of branched
off into talking

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:56.570 align:middle line:84%
about symbiotic
interdimensional relationships

00:35:56.570 --> 00:35:59.930 align:middle line:84%
because they're much
healthier and more positive,

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:03.920 align:middle line:84%
and the literature in
them is a little bit

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:05.360 align:middle line:90%
scarcer, if anything.

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:06.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:10.160 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty dramatic I mean, the
next time I see somebody like,

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:14.780 align:middle line:84%
mumbling to themselves, maybe
they're not nuts, right?

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:17.240 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Exactly.

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:20.750 align:middle line:84%
There was a book by Julian
Jaynes in the '70s called

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:24.230 align:middle line:84%
"The Origins of Consciousness in
the Breakdown of the Bicameral

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:29.300 align:middle line:84%
Mind," and what it was
about is that for most

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:31.610 align:middle line:84%
of human evolution,
he believed, we all

00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:33.300 align:middle line:90%
heard voices in our heads.

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:35.610 align:middle line:84%
And then the Greeks,
the ancient Greeks,

00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:37.610 align:middle line:84%
they went through a period
where so many of them

00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:40.850 align:middle line:84%
would talk about why have
the gods grown silent?

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:42.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, according
to Julian Jaynes,

00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:45.530 align:middle line:84%
this is because of the
breakdown of bicamerality,

00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:47.960 align:middle line:84%
where you would hear
these voices in your head.

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And of course, people
who are classified

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:54.080 align:middle line:84%
as mentally ill in our society
hear voices in their head,

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:56.420 align:middle line:84%
but also some of the most
high-functioning people

00:36:56.420 --> 00:37:00.450 align:middle line:84%
had daemons or had
voices or beings

00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:01.700 align:middle line:90%
that worked alongside of them.

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:03.470 align:middle line:90%
Socrates is a famous example.

00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:05.210 align:middle line:84%
He had his daemon
who would usually

00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:07.700 align:middle line:84%
just tell him no if he was
going to do something foolish.

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:10.520 align:middle line:84%
Napoleon had a sphere
of shining light,

00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:13.013 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes it would appear
as a dwarf in red clothing.

00:37:13.013 --> 00:37:14.055 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How about Plato?

00:37:14.055 --> 00:37:17.630 align:middle line:90%


00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:19.850 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: I haven't heard
about Plato having a daemon.

00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:22.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:24.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: But many
people have had these.

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:28.820 align:middle line:84%
If somebody is dysfunctional
and they're hearing voices,

00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:30.998 align:middle line:84%
then we may call them
psychotic or schizophrenic.

00:37:30.998 --> 00:37:32.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Schizophrenic,
that's right.

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:34.832 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: But it doesn't mean
that they're not necessarily

00:37:34.832 --> 00:37:38.810 align:middle line:84%
in contact with real entities,
but that their relationship

00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:41.240 align:middle line:84%
with them and with
their own psyche

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:44.840 align:middle line:84%
has made it hard for
them to function.

00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:49.160 align:middle line:84%
But it's assumed by
materialist psychiatry

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:53.000 align:middle line:84%
that oh, well, this is purely
an internal experience.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.740 align:middle line:90%
But we really don't know that.

00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:56.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And nowadays
with technology, you

00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:57.980 align:middle line:90%
don't know what's going on.

00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:01.490 align:middle line:84%
I saw somebody walking down
the street a few weeks ago,

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:05.340 align:middle line:84%
arms are flailing and
talking to themselves saying,

00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:06.140 align:middle line:90%
what do you mean?

00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:06.940 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:08.810 align:middle line:90%
I thought the person was insane.

00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:11.010 align:middle line:84%
He had a cell phone
with a little earpiece.

00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:11.810 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Exactly.

00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:13.550 align:middle line:84%
But speaking of
technology, they've

00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:17.660 align:middle line:84%
done functional MRIs of people
with multiple personality

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:22.310 align:middle line:84%
disorder, and they find that
the imaging of their brains

00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:25.190 align:middle line:84%
looks dramatically different
when different personalities

00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:26.150 align:middle line:90%
take over.

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:27.692 align:middle line:84%
Some of those
different personalities

00:38:27.692 --> 00:38:29.690 align:middle line:84%
have different blood
pressures and allergies

00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:32.420 align:middle line:84%
and there are lots of
physiological changes

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:33.450 align:middle line:90%
that happen.

00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:35.720 align:middle line:84%
So one thing that I would
disagree a little bit

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:38.450 align:middle line:84%
with the clip that
we just saw is

00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:40.250 align:middle line:84%
he talked about
are they physical

00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:41.870 align:middle line:90%
or are they dimensional?

00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:45.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, my companions-- I was just
going through some of my 5,000

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:46.220 align:middle line:90%
pages of notes--

00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:47.780 align:middle line:84%
one of the most
consistent themes

00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:50.900 align:middle line:84%
is that he insists that
he is still physical.

00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:54.500 align:middle line:84%
That an astral body is
still a physical body

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:56.540 align:middle line:90%
even if it's not carbon-based.

00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:58.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right, and
we don't see it.

00:38:58.040 --> 00:38:58.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Right.

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, for example,
I can always locate spatially

00:39:02.450 --> 00:39:07.640 align:middle line:84%
where they are, and sometimes
I can image him better

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:08.660 align:middle line:90%
than others.

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:13.550 align:middle line:84%
But they're in a
kind of liminal zone

00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:16.130 align:middle line:84%
where there are
physical aspects,

00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:19.970 align:middle line:84%
but they're not physical in a
conventional meat-bodied way.

00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:21.380 align:middle line:90%
But sometimes they show up.

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:24.800 align:middle line:84%
We saw in that first clip
where there's a picture.

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:26.870 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the
veracity of that picture,

00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:31.550 align:middle line:84%
but you post them on your
website all the time.

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:34.700 align:middle line:84%
There are many pictures
taken and sometimes there

00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:37.400 align:middle line:84%
are physical traces
of these beings.

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:39.560 align:middle line:84%
So they seem to be
in a boundary place

00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:42.500 align:middle line:84%
where they are not bound
by the conventional physics

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:45.240 align:middle line:84%
of solid objects and
Newtonian physics,

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:47.720 align:middle line:84%
but they definitely
have physical effects.

00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:49.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would there
ever be a time, Jonathan,

00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:53.450 align:middle line:84%
that you would not
recommend that somebody tap

00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:55.460 align:middle line:90%
into this other dimension?

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:56.270 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Absolutely.

00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:59.150 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing like
with regular relationships.

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:01.730 align:middle line:84%
You have to evaluate on
a case by case basis,

00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:05.960 align:middle line:84%
like a child's imaginary friend
or a regular relationship.

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:08.420 align:middle line:84%
If your relationship
is starting to make

00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:11.480 align:middle line:84%
you unable to function
in your job or you

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:13.160 align:middle line:84%
neglect your other
relationships,

00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:15.050 align:middle line:84%
or you just become
so obsessed with it

00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:18.240 align:middle line:84%
that it seems to be
overall having a bad effect

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:19.040 align:middle line:90%
on your viability--

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:20.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's hurting
your life, basically.

00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:22.190 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: If it's
hurting your life,

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:25.580 align:middle line:84%
the same discernment would apply
to these other relationships.

00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:27.530 align:middle line:84%
If they're inspiring
you, if they're

00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:30.560 align:middle line:84%
helping you to write novels
or create philosophies

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:32.520 align:middle line:90%
like Socrates, that's great.

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:34.730 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
some people may

00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:36.890 align:middle line:90%
be helped to do dark things.

00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:39.197 align:middle line:84%
Like was Napoleon a
good guy or a bad guy?

00:40:39.197 --> 00:40:41.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, I guess that
depends on whether you're

00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:42.920 align:middle line:84%
on the other side
of the battlefield.

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:43.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:44.230 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:47.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ZAP: And so Hitler
was hearing voices.

00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:50.780 align:middle line:10%
Hitler and Churchill
both heard voices

00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:53.690 align:middle line:10%
that told them not to get out
of a certain side of the car

00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:56.420 align:middle line:10%
that they would have
gotten out of normally,

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:58.700 align:middle line:10%
and thereby avoided a landmine.

00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:01.250 align:middle line:10%
And both of them were allowed
to continue their careers

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:03.810 align:middle line:10%
because of voices they
heard in their heads.

00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:07.490 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that all
of these entities

00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:09.698 align:middle line:84%
always have a good
agenda at all.

00:41:09.698 --> 00:41:11.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jonathan, thanks
for being on "Beyond Belief."

00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.740 align:middle line:90%
>>ZAP: Thank you.

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:15.240 align:middle line:84%

more about what Jonathan does,
