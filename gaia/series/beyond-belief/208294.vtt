00:00:10.803 --> 00:00:12.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: How
did you get involved

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:13.910 align:middle line:90%
in spiritual awakening?

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SUZANNE ROSS: I heard a voice
resonate within me and all

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.540 align:middle line:90%
around me.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And it simply said, can't
you see you've come home?

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.270 align:middle line:84%
You'll stay here and heal
yourself and many others.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.690 align:middle line:84%
Reality is just
waves of potential

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.580 align:middle line:90%
until someone looks at it.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's only when
a conscious observer

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.850 align:middle line:84%
looks at it that
the waves collapse

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.100 align:middle line:90%
into particles to create form.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.240 align:middle line:84%
Reality requires a
conscious observer

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.660 align:middle line:90%
in order to materialize.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.940 align:middle line:84%
This reality that
we're experiencing

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.540 align:middle line:84%
and even our beings are
projections of a higher reality

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.800 align:middle line:90%
in a higher dimension.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.893 align:middle line:90%


00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:02.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, welcome to this
edition of "Beyond Belief."

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.970 align:middle line:10%
Suzanne Ross is
a spiritual guide

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.750 align:middle line:10%
who has dedicated her life
to spiritual awakening,

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.410 align:middle line:10%
energetic healing, and the
soul ascension process.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.130 align:middle line:90%
Suzanne, welcome to the program.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.450 align:middle line:90%
Good to have you with us.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.610 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Thank you, George.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.688 align:middle line:84%
I'm so delighted
to be here today.

00:01:18.688 --> 00:01:20.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is going to
be informative and fun.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking forward to this.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.270 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Definitely fun.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
you get involved

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.600 align:middle line:90%
in spiritual awakening?

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Well, it started with a
profound awakening experience.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened?

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: I was working in the
corporate world back East

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.230 align:middle line:84%
and feeling very misaligned
with my true calling

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.510 align:middle line:90%
and displaced on the East Coast.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And during a visit to
Southern California,

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.480 align:middle line:84%
I ran to the top
of a mountaintop,

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.680 align:middle line:84%
threw my arms up to
the sky, and said,

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.120 align:middle line:84%
I am miserable in the
extreme and see no way out.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment, I
felt a total sense of calm

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.100 align:middle line:90%
wash over me.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That second, huh?

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: At that second that I
surrendered to a higher power.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.360 align:middle line:84%
I heard a voice resonate
within me and all around me.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And it simply said, can't
you see you've come home?

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.400 align:middle line:84%
You'll stay here and heal
yourself and many others.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment, I knew that
was the absolute truth for me.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.480 align:middle line:84%
All of the anxiety
and depression

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.900 align:middle line:84%
were replaced by
excitement and enthusiasm

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.200 align:middle line:84%
over my new life in
the desert as a healer.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And in a matter of two
weeks, I completely

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.600 align:middle line:84%
transformed my life from
being a stressed out executive

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.540 align:middle line:84%
on the East Coast to a healer
in the desert of Southern

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.410 align:middle line:90%
California.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.118 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, was the
stressed out healer

00:02:38.118 --> 00:02:40.550 align:middle line:90%
making a pretty good living?

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.440 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: The stressed
out corporate executive

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.410 align:middle line:84%
was making some good
dough and married

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:46.940 align:middle line:90%
to a corporate executive.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And we were meant to be
living the American dream.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.785 align:middle line:84%
But for me, it felt
more like a nightmare.

00:02:51.785 --> 00:02:52.070 align:middle line:90%
I just--

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.195 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You weren't happy?

00:02:53.195 --> 00:02:58.640 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: --wasn't suited to
this materialistic life with

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.660 align:middle line:84%
the Porsche and the pool and
the mean spirited politics

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.700 align:middle line:84%
in the corporate world
just did not align with--

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.033 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's just material
things, that's all they are.

00:03:07.033 --> 00:03:10.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: --my funny self,
always was very outdoorsy

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.080 align:middle line:90%
and spiritually inclined.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And so this just wasn't the
life that was suited for me.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And during this profound
awakening in the desert,

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.720 align:middle line:84%
I was realigned with my true
calling and higher self.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And I had a hypnotic regression
with Laurie McDonald.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:27.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.430 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: And--

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Does a good job.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.280 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Right.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.510 align:middle line:84%
I always wondered,
what the heck happened?

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.810 align:middle line:84%
What was with this light
and who is the voice?

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.650 align:middle line:10%
And in this regression,
we were shown

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.340 align:middle line:10%
that two beings surfaced
on the mountaintop that day

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.120 align:middle line:10%
and they had a woman in between
them that looked just like me.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.365 align:middle line:90%
And they said, may she--

00:03:48.365 --> 00:03:48.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:49.890 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: --walk into you?

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.170 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yes.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.730 align:middle line:84%
And this woman walked into me,
turned around, and looked out.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.822 align:middle line:84%
That made so much sense
to me, George, because--

00:03:57.822 --> 00:03:59.165 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that has
made world a difference.

00:03:59.165 --> 00:03:59.965 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:03:59.965 --> 00:04:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: In a moment,
I just became

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.800 align:middle line:90%
a higher version of myself.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.280 align:middle line:84%
I was spontaneously healed
of different illnesses

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.020 align:middle line:84%
that I was suffering
from, including

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.230 align:middle line:84%
anxiety and
different respiratory

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.600 align:middle line:90%
conditions, what have you.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.180 align:middle line:84%
But in a moment of
spontaneous healing

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.200 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual awakening, I
experienced what I think--

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Traumatic.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.675 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: --was a rebirth.

00:04:24.675 --> 00:04:25.475 align:middle line:90%
A dark night--

00:04:25.475 --> 00:04:25.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I bet.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.140 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: --that led to a rebirth.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And this has really
been a general theme

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.900 align:middle line:84%
throughout my life and I think
throughout the lives of many.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This awakening
that occurred with you, that

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.390 align:middle line:90%
came relatively instant, right?

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.350 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
know that it changed you?

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.610 align:middle line:90%
Did you feel something?

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.180 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.694 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: I felt totally
different than I had before.

00:04:50.694 --> 00:04:53.200 align:middle line:84%
Before, I was
suffering from anxiety,

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.630 align:middle line:84%
being rushed to the hospital
for anxiety attacks.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:02.260 align:middle line:84%
I was feeling like my life
lacked meaning and purpose.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, not only
was I spontaneously healed,

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:12.310 align:middle line:84%
but I had this overwhelming
enthusiasm about life

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.080 align:middle line:90%
like I had never felt before.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.800 align:middle line:84%
I ran down that mountain
and headed into my new life.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And as I did, everything
fell into place perfectly

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.230 align:middle line:84%
as if I had stepped into
this divine synchronicity.

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And the people, the
places, and the things

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.280 align:middle line:84%
I needed to become a
healer in the desert just

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.750 align:middle line:90%
fell into place.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And I stepped onto a path of
becoming a health and wellness

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.850 align:middle line:90%
practitioner.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.080 align:middle line:90%
And I've never looked back.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was your dark
night of the soul experience?

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:48.880 align:middle line:90%
What was that?

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: So this then was
a second death and rebirth

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.980 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That happened to you?

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:57.070 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.980 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't like an NDA.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:03.850 align:middle line:84%
It was a death of my old
soul and then reawakening

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.440 align:middle line:84%
to another higher
version of my new self.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Spiritually speaking.

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Spiritually
speaking, yes.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And so I attune to theosophy,
which talks about initiations.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:22.000 align:middle line:10%
And in these initiations,
you come to a certain point

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.230 align:middle line:10%
where you learn something like
mastery of the physical body.

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And then at the end
of that initiation,

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.890 align:middle line:84%
you go through somewhat
of a death and rebirth

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.710 align:middle line:84%
where you may have a dark
night of the soul only

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.520 align:middle line:84%
to awaken into your
next initiation.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's somewhat of a
leap in consciousness.

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.260 align:middle line:84%
Now for this next
initiation, you

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.260 align:middle line:84%
may be focused on mastery
of the emotional body.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And so this dark
night of the soul

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:56.380 align:middle line:84%
was a spiraling downward as
a result of an economic crash

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.620 align:middle line:84%
that took place
in 2008 and I lost

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.520 align:middle line:84%
my business and the town
where my dream came true in

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.180 align:middle line:90%
became somewhat of a ghost town.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:05.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And I went into a
dark, a classic dark night

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:10.090 align:middle line:90%
of the soul.

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:14.380 align:middle line:84%
But I also call it
another awakening

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.140 align:middle line:84%
because I survived
the dark night

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.270 align:middle line:84%
and I stepped into a
light that was bigger

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:21.320 align:middle line:90%
and brighter than ever before.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.860 align:middle line:84%
So I often say, the dark
night is a great gift.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Suzanne, we
have a clip of yours

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.740 align:middle line:84%
that you produced which
facilitated your awakening.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.060 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:35.680 align:middle line:84%
>> One day, I walked into a
church and saw light pouring

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.470 align:middle line:90%
out of Mother Mary's hands.

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:41.320 align:middle line:10%
This turned me away
from the darkness

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:45.280 align:middle line:10%
and into the light
once and for all.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:50.290 align:middle line:84%
I dove in to spirituality
on a much deeper level

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:53.200 align:middle line:90%
and began meditating daily.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.920 align:middle line:84%
I began taking long
walks out in nature

00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:00.040 align:middle line:84%
where I felt a profound
sense of oneness

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:03.520 align:middle line:84%
with all living
things and beings.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.150 align:middle line:84%
I dove into reading
everything I could

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:11.110 align:middle line:84%
about science and spirituality,
searching for the meaning

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:13.180 align:middle line:90%
and purpose of life.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.720 align:middle line:10%
But it was one day when
I looked up in the sky

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:21.430 align:middle line:10%
and saw sky writing, telling
me that the meaning of life

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:24.790 align:middle line:10%
was to create and the
purpose was to evolve,

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:28.950 align:middle line:10%
that I understood the
simplicity of it all.

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:34.030 align:middle line:84%
I began doing
merkaba meditations

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:37.970 align:middle line:84%
and taking journeys
through the cosmos.

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:41.710 align:middle line:84%
I practiced lucid
dreaming, which

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:45.700 align:middle line:84%
allowed me to be conscious
in my dream state.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:48.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You sound happy there.

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:49.810 align:middle line:90%
You do.

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:50.650 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Thank you.

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:53.710 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I feel joyful.

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:57.100 align:middle line:84%
Every moment of every day
I feel is a precious gift

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:58.240 align:middle line:90%
that we've been given.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And one way we can
show our appreciation

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.670 align:middle line:84%
for this precious gift is
to embrace every moment

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:07.473 align:middle line:84%
with joy and spread
peace and love and light.

00:09:07.473 --> 00:09:08.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are
a lot of people

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:11.840 align:middle line:84%
out there, Suzanne,
who aren't happy.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.860 align:middle line:84%
They're frustrated, things
aren't going the way

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:16.840 align:middle line:90%
they want in their life.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:17.830 align:middle line:90%
Are they trapped?

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:19.630 align:middle line:90%
What do they do?

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:21.400 align:middle line:90%
How do they pull out of it?

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.440 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Well,
hopefully, they are

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:29.650 align:middle line:84%
open to seeking ways that
can enhance their life,

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:32.980 align:middle line:84%
like spirituality,
maybe engaging

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.680 align:middle line:90%
in some stillness meditation.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.480 align:middle line:84%
Running energy
through the chakras

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:41.290 align:middle line:84%
is a very powerful
way to cleanse

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:46.060 align:middle line:84%
the shadows and blockages that
can get seated on those wheels.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:49.270 align:middle line:10%
Also, taking long
walks out in nature

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:51.910 align:middle line:10%
and connecting with
creation always

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:54.820 align:middle line:10%
feels very uplifting
and elevating to me.

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:58.510 align:middle line:84%
With the bright sunshine
blaring down on us

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:01.990 align:middle line:84%
and receiving some of those
supercharged photons of light

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:03.015 align:middle line:90%
is another way to--

00:10:03.015 --> 00:10:04.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a
powerful way of--

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:04.720 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: --enlighten.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --generating
yourself, isn't it?

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.300 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's important.

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:13.700 align:middle line:84%
You moved to Sedona and it
made a tremendous difference

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:14.500 align:middle line:90%
for you.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:18.360 align:middle line:84%
What caused you
to make that move?

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:22.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: So I was in
meditation in 2014

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:28.070 align:middle line:84%
and I had a vision of this
city full of red rocks.

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And I had never even
heard of Sedona.

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:31.400 align:middle line:90%
But after this--

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:31.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:32.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: --vision-- I know.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.490 align:middle line:84%
Being in the
spiritual world, you

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:36.620 align:middle line:84%
think I'd be familiar with the
spiritual Mecca of Sedona,--

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:37.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:38.260 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:39.560 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: --but I wasn't.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.410 align:middle line:84%
After that, I went to work
and I worked at a large health

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:43.460 align:middle line:90%
and wellness complex.

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And all these people
started coming up to me,

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.810 align:middle line:84%
showing me their
pictures of Sedona.

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:50.900 align:middle line:84%
I would see Sedona t-shirts
and bumper stickers.

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.640 align:middle line:84%
So Sedona just
started coming at me.

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:53.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Popping up.

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:55.940 align:middle line:84%
Somebody was telling
you something.

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:56.780 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Right.

00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And then in 2014, my husband
took me to the Grand Canyon

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.070 align:middle line:84%
and I said, can we go through
this town called Sedona

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:05.720 align:middle line:90%
on our way to the Grand Canyon?

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.130 align:middle line:90%
And we did.

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And when we pulled
in through Oak Creek

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:13.893 align:middle line:84%
Canyon and I saw these
magnificent red rock temples,--

00:11:13.893 --> 00:11:14.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There you go.

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:18.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: --I just wept and I
was breathless and speechless.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.617 align:middle line:84%
And I had a sense
that I had come home.

00:11:20.617 --> 00:11:22.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we have
another clip of you talking

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.370 align:middle line:90%
about those experiences.

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:31.610 align:middle line:84%
>> After moving to Sedona,
Arizona in 2015 and practicing

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:36.110 align:middle line:84%
meditation in the
vortex day and night,

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:43.550 align:middle line:84%
my psychic awareness became
amplified and I was able

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:49.850 align:middle line:84%
to download information from
the field like never before.

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:52.820 align:middle line:84%
Then one night, a
couple of friends and I

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:56.630 align:middle line:84%
decided to call
upon the Arcturians.

00:11:56.630 --> 00:12:00.710 align:middle line:84%
After seeing anomalous
lights in the sky,

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:06.440 align:middle line:84%
we realized that we
lost four hours of time.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:10.070 align:middle line:84%
Later, in a psychic
reading, I was

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:15.500 align:middle line:84%
told that three Arcturians
took us aboard a ship

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:19.850 align:middle line:84%
where we were downloaded with
advanced knowledge and wisdom

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:22.760 align:middle line:90%
to be revealed over time.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:27.260 align:middle line:10%
Shortly after that,
I realized that I

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:31.460 align:middle line:10%
could connect into
multidimensional realities

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:37.280 align:middle line:10%
and reveal who I was being in
these different dimensions.

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:41.450 align:middle line:10%
Soon I realized I could
do it for others as well.

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:45.680 align:middle line:10%
I became so curious about
these other dimensions.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:51.710 align:middle line:10%
And then I found an obscure
book called "The Bilgi Kitabi,"

00:12:51.710 --> 00:13:00.720 align:middle line:10%
which explained these dimensions
exactly as I was being shown.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So you were abducted?

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:05.990 align:middle line:90%


00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:10.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: This is what a psychic
revealed to me and my two

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:12.710 align:middle line:90%
friends who were with me.

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:15.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did it close
the gap on some things

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:19.100 align:middle line:84%
you were looking for knowing
what had happened to you?

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:22.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Well, if we want to
back up just a little bit

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:24.927 align:middle line:84%
to my father's missing
time experience--

00:13:24.927 --> 00:13:25.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:26.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: --before--

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:26.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That
happened to him too?

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:28.220 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: --I was even
born too, it can.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:29.762 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they've
been watching you

00:13:29.762 --> 00:13:30.980 align:middle line:90%
since you were a little girl?

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:31.780 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Right.

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:34.640 align:middle line:84%
I do think it can be
multigenerational.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And so my father had this
four-hour missing time

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:40.790 align:middle line:84%
experience in
Saskatchewan, Canada,

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:42.560 align:middle line:84%
in this little
town called Leader.

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:44.150 align:middle line:90%
And he was only 18.

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:46.970 align:middle line:84%
Him and some buddies were flying
down a dirt road one night

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:49.910 align:middle line:84%
after dinner, they
saw a white light out

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:53.010 align:middle line:84%
in the field in front of
the car, behind the car.

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:54.760 align:middle line:90%
They got out to check it out.

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.320 align:middle line:84%
The next thing they knew they
were all sitting in their car.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And then they saw this white
light race across the field,

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:04.230 align:middle line:84%
merged with a large orange
light and take off into space.

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And so they knocked on
the nearest farmhouse door

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.250 align:middle line:84%
and the woman was furious,
they were knocking on her door

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:11.420 align:middle line:90%
after midnight.

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:13.370 align:middle line:84%
They were shocked
that it was midnight

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:15.290 align:middle line:84%
because they had
left their house down

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:15.680 align:middle line:90%
the street around 7:00.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:16.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're lucky
they didn't come out

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:18.920 align:middle line:84%
with a shotgun for
crying out loud.

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Right.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:24.050 align:middle line:84%
The next day, my father realized
that he had a triangular shaped

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:25.707 align:middle line:90%
metallic object in his wrist.

00:14:25.707 --> 00:14:26.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:29.480 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Growing up, he
called it his alien chip

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.110 align:middle line:90%
and he would hold it.

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:32.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He kept it in his body?

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.320 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:38.900 align:middle line:84%
It was a slightly raised
grayish appearance on his wrist.

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Could you feel it?

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:41.870 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: It was slightly raised.

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:43.290 align:middle line:90%
He never had it--

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:44.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Removed.

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:45.245 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: --X-rayed or anything.

00:14:45.245 --> 00:14:46.078 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or removed.

00:14:46.078 --> 00:14:49.040 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: He protected it and he
just called it his alien chip.

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.680 align:middle line:84%
But shortly after
that experience,

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:56.120 align:middle line:84%
he was recruited by NCR,
National Cash Register company.

00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:00.470 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, we were moved to
Mount Shasta where I was born.

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:03.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Another really
tremendous place.

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:04.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Right.

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:05.705 align:middle line:90%
Growing up in the woods of--

00:15:05.705 --> 00:15:06.505 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Spiritual.

00:15:06.505 --> 00:15:07.610 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: --Mount Shasta.

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:11.330 align:middle line:84%
I would see fairies
and elementals.

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And I had many
invisible friends.

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:19.070 align:middle line:84%
But then my father was
transferred to Dayton, Ohio

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:22.740 align:middle line:84%
to work for NCR right near
Wright-Patterson Air Force

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:23.540 align:middle line:90%
Base.

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where Roswell
wreckage was taken.

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:26.780 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Right.

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:28.070 align:middle line:90%
He spoke German.

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:29.360 align:middle line:90%
His mother was German.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.180 align:middle line:84%
And on Sunday evenings,
these German men

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:33.620 align:middle line:90%
would come to our house.

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.630 align:middle line:84%
And my mother would
usher my sister and I

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:38.660 align:middle line:84%
into the back bedrooms as
these German men poured

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:40.940 align:middle line:90%
over plans and blueprints.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For what?

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:43.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Right.

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:47.330 align:middle line:84%
My father was quite secretive
about the work that he did.

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:50.360 align:middle line:84%
But he was always
very fascinated

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.640 align:middle line:90%
by life in the cosmos.

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And he was always
pointing to the sky

00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:58.340 align:middle line:84%
and explaining
constellations and nebula

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:01.520 align:middle line:90%
like Orion and the Pleiades.

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:05.480 align:middle line:84%
Different anomalous things
would happen around our house.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:10.070 align:middle line:84%
Fireballs would fly
through our yard.

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And so I was always
curious about what happened

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:15.950 align:middle line:90%
during my dad's experience.

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:20.090 align:middle line:84%
But we all felt that this
experience and his alien chip

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:21.900 align:middle line:84%
had everything to do
with him becoming--

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:22.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:25.490 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: --a pioneer on the front
lines of the emerging computer

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:27.130 align:middle line:90%
age.

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:31.420 align:middle line:84%
Also then, I had my
missing time experience.

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And a psychic told us the story
that was revealed in the video

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:41.320 align:middle line:84%
and how after that,
I gained the ability

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:44.110 align:middle line:90%
to see interdimensionally.

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered that not only
could I see into these realms,

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:56.110 align:middle line:84%
but I could experience them
as who I was being there.

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:57.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was this genetic?

00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:00.220 align:middle line:84%
Did you get this
from your father?

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Possibly.

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:05.440 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's conceivable
that they watched him

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:08.670 align:middle line:10%
as a little boy, watched you.

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:09.690 align:middle line:90%
Do you have children?

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:10.319 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: I don't.

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:10.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't.

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:12.562 align:middle line:84%
Because I was wondering
if they would going

00:17:12.562 --> 00:17:14.160 align:middle line:90%
to watch them, if this just--

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:14.960 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Right.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.869 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --goes
on and on and on.

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:19.940 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
they wanted with you?

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:24.109 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: I feel that they were
giving me and my two friends

00:17:24.109 --> 00:17:31.040 align:middle line:84%
an upgrade in order so that we
could serve at a higher level.

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:34.310 align:middle line:84%
I was going to go and
talk about this experience

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:37.680 align:middle line:84%
and how I was seeing into
these multidimensional rounds,

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:41.720 align:middle line:84%
and as such, now offering
soul reunions for people,

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.740 align:middle line:84%
revealing who they're
being in other dimensions.

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:44.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:46.640 align:middle line:10%
>>ROSS: But the morning
before this conference

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.320 align:middle line:10%
that I was going
to speak at, I was

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:54.320 align:middle line:10%
shown this holographic
image of how

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:57.470 align:middle line:10%
in each of these
higher dimensions,

00:17:57.470 --> 00:18:00.890 align:middle line:10%
it's not just a soul
merge that's taking place.

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:05.240 align:middle line:84%
When you merge with higher
dimensional aspects of who

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:08.150 align:middle line:84%
you're being in a
higher dimension, then

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:11.030 align:middle line:84%
it ignites dormant
DNA within your being,

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:16.280 align:middle line:84%
because you see you're merging
within a more advanced version

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:17.510 align:middle line:90%
of yourself.

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:22.860 align:middle line:84%
And as such, this awakens
innate gifts and abilities.

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And so this is really what
I'm doing with people when

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:29.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm merging them with their
higher dimensional self,

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:32.630 align:middle line:84%
it activates dormant
DNA within their being

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:34.610 align:middle line:90%
and they become more advanced.

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:36.980 align:middle line:84%
And I feel this is what
I'm being called to do,

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:39.260 align:middle line:84%
and this is the type
of sessions I offer.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
get into this mode

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.570 align:middle line:84%
and an individual gets
into this higher realm,

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:48.050 align:middle line:90%
do they instantly feel a change?

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:49.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: It depends
on the individual.

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:52.970 align:middle line:84%
If I have someone
that's newer to this,

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:58.570 align:middle line:84%
I may be guiding the session
entirely and transmitting

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:06.430 align:middle line:84%
these energies as I do, and
then it's a gradual evolution.

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:12.070 align:middle line:84%
It's a gradual advancement,
then I follow them and I

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:14.170 align:middle line:90%
follow their progress.

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:15.980 align:middle line:84%
With someone who's
more advanced,

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:20.045 align:middle line:84%
they may, after I put them in
a light hypnotic trance state,

00:19:20.045 --> 00:19:20.845 align:middle line:90%
actually reveal--

00:19:20.845 --> 00:19:21.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do that.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:25.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: --to me who
know what they're seeing

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:31.090 align:middle line:84%
and describe to me who they're
being in these other higher

00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:32.080 align:middle line:90%
realms.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:35.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does this make them,
Suzanne, a better person

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:38.920 align:middle line:90%
by able to tap into this?

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:44.590 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: I would say it
makes them more advanced

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:50.140 align:middle line:84%
spiritually and capable
of using their gifts

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:54.440 align:middle line:84%
and abilities for selfless
service to humankind.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:58.570 align:middle line:84%
It may uplift them and
elevate them in a way

00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:01.990 align:middle line:84%
that they have a
greater desire to be

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:05.770 align:middle line:84%
of service and to
selflessly serve the light.

00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:08.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
consciousness mean to you?

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:10.300 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Consciousness
is everything.

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:12.838 align:middle line:84%
And even quantum
physicists now--

00:20:12.838 --> 00:20:14.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So whole
ballgame, isn't it?

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:16.300 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: --are discovering
that consciousness

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.670 align:middle line:90%
is fundamental to everything.

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Where before, they
thought consciousness

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.680 align:middle line:90%
might arise from the brain.

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:27.190 align:middle line:84%
Cognitive brain scientists
and quantum physicists alike

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:31.220 align:middle line:84%
are coming down to saying,
consciousness is fundamental.

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:32.590 align:middle line:90%
It's the source of all that is.

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:36.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is science beginning
to realize what it is?

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: As the fundamental
platform upon which

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:43.250 align:middle line:90%
everything else emerges.

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And this would be
called emergence theory

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:48.860 align:middle line:84%
that physicists are
playing with now.

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:52.670 align:middle line:84%
There's a group in LA called
the Quantum Gravity Research

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:53.840 align:middle line:90%
Institute.

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:58.010 align:middle line:84%
And they're actually discovering
through emergence theory

00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:00.650 align:middle line:84%
and that everything
arises or emerges

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:07.790 align:middle line:84%
from consciousness, that this
E8 crystal that was actually

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:12.080 align:middle line:84%
discovered by Garrett Lisi,
a physicist in Hawaii,

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:17.840 align:middle line:84%
is actually projecting
the realities that we're

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:23.370 align:middle line:84%
experiencing in these third
dimensional Earth spheres.

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:25.490 align:middle line:84%
So it's very interesting
how they're now

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:31.070 align:middle line:84%
realizing that this reality
that we're experiencing

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:37.010 align:middle line:84%
and even our beings are
projections of a higher

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:39.140 align:middle line:90%
reality in a higher dimension.

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it like we're living
in a holographic universe?

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:43.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Absolutely.

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:45.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have
tied in a connection

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:47.480 align:middle line:90%
between consciousness and DNA.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:50.030 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at that.

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:53.190 align:middle line:84%
>> We know that we
are love light beings.

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:57.170 align:middle line:84%
And now, scientifically,
we can prove it.

00:21:57.170 --> 00:22:00.410 align:middle line:84%
Frontier physicist,
Fritz-Albert Popp,

00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:04.170 align:middle line:84%
coined the term
biophoton emissions.

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:07.940 align:middle line:84%
He proved that quantum
processes do take place

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:10.550 align:middle line:90%
in biological entities.

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:14.810 align:middle line:84%
He was able to show how
subatomic particles collide

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:18.590 align:middle line:84%
to create photons of light
within the physical body.

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And this light contains
information imprinted

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:27.200 align:middle line:84%
upon our DNA that facilitates
cell communication

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.060 align:middle line:90%
within our beings.

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:33.410 align:middle line:84%
This is a language of
light encoded upon our DNA

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:37.820 align:middle line:84%
like our own unique symphony,
our own personal signature

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:41.720 align:middle line:90%
frequency, our soul song.

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:45.440 align:middle line:84%
Scientific research has proven
that we are energetic light

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:48.620 align:middle line:84%
beings and that photons
of light are being emitted

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:50.180 align:middle line:90%
from our energy centers.

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And from within, the
nucleus of our self,

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:57.980 align:middle line:90%
it's being emitted from our DNA.

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:02.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Suzanne, if
somebody does not tune in,

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:04.210 align:middle line:84%
like you've been
able to teach people,

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:07.660 align:middle line:84%
but if they aren't able to
connect, what happens to them?

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:10.090 align:middle line:90%
What do they lose?

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:13.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: They remain under
the veil of forgetting

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:20.860 align:middle line:84%
and they are then solely focused
on this incarnation alone.

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:27.700 align:middle line:84%
Although they might get nudges
from their higher self at times

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:28.510 align:middle line:90%
that--

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:29.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kind of
push them along?

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:30.660 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Right.

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:34.750 align:middle line:84%
That inspire them maybe
to be a better person,

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:39.460 align:middle line:84%
maybe to be kinder, maybe
to be more compassionate.

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:43.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We need more of that,
don't we, in this world today?

00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:44.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Certainly.

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:46.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are we lacking?

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:48.955 align:middle line:84%
Because not everybody
feels that way.

00:23:48.955 --> 00:23:50.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: I believe
that everyone's

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:53.090 align:middle line:84%
on their own individual
journey, and of course, we're

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:55.560 align:middle line:84%
here together on a
collective journey.

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:58.290 align:middle line:84%
Some people may be new
to this dimension and--

00:23:58.290 --> 00:23:59.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:01.190 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: --they're
looking forward

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:06.050 align:middle line:84%
to their lessons in the
realm of the 3D duality.

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:09.380 align:middle line:84%
Others of us are done
learning through separation

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:10.190 align:middle line:90%
and suffering.

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And we're ready to
expand and ascend

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:15.230 align:middle line:84%
into a new hire way
of living and being,

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:17.630 align:middle line:90%
in unity and peace and harmony.

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And so it depends on where the
person's at on their journey.

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:24.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
double-slit experiment?

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And so this
groundbreaking experiment

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:29.390 align:middle line:90%
that happened long, long ago.

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:31.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you create it?

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:33.020 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Certainly not.

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:35.450 align:middle line:84%
But it's a very
famous experiment

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:40.700 align:middle line:84%
that allowed us
to understand how

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:46.760 align:middle line:84%
it takes a conscious observer
to collapse wave function.

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:51.740 align:middle line:84%
In other words, reality
is just waves of potential

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:53.660 align:middle line:90%
until someone looks at it.

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's only when
a conscious observer

00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:59.900 align:middle line:84%
looks at it that
the waves collapse

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:02.120 align:middle line:90%
into particles to create form.

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:06.710 align:middle line:84%
So reality requires
a conscious observer

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:09.680 align:middle line:90%
in order to materialize.

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we get to
these points on our own?

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:13.370 align:middle line:90%
You did.

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:15.440 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you had
some help, I guess.

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.380 align:middle line:84%
But do we need
helpers, or can we

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:21.030 align:middle line:90%
get into this state on our own?

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:23.040 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Certainly
with our own seeking

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:27.480 align:middle line:84%
and our own dedication
to a spiritual path,

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.880 align:middle line:84%
to studying everything
we can get our hands

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:33.850 align:middle line:84%
on about science, quantum
physics, religion,

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:37.770 align:middle line:84%
whatever inspires you,
then naturally, you'll

00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:41.460 align:middle line:84%
start to have a more advanced
understanding about who

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:44.928 align:middle line:84%
you are, why you
are, where you are.

00:25:44.928 --> 00:25:47.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's say an individual
comes to you, Suzanne,

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:51.570 align:middle line:84%
and he's just totally lost,
unhappy with a relationship,

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:54.000 align:middle line:84%
unhappy in their
job, but they're

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.750 align:middle line:84%
just lost, how do you put
that together for them?

00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:00.810 align:middle line:84%
How do you make them
realize there's more

00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:03.810 align:middle line:90%
than whatever they're missing?

00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:06.740 align:middle line:10%
>>ROSS: So I do
spiritual counseling.

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:08.500 align:middle line:90%
And that's how we'll start.

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:13.640 align:middle line:84%
We'll start by exploring where
they're at in their life now

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:15.050 align:middle line:90%
and why.

00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:21.590 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes by understanding
the repeating patterns that

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:27.110 align:middle line:84%
are leading to their continued
unhappiness or unfulfillment,

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:31.580 align:middle line:84%
then we may do a
past life regression

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:36.050 align:middle line:84%
and understand that some
of these things that

00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:40.395 align:middle line:84%
are keeping them trapped in
patterning may be coming from--

00:26:40.395 --> 00:26:41.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Other lives.

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:42.620 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: --another life.

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:45.740 align:middle line:84%
Then we can clear
that in that life.

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that
why someone who may

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:51.230 align:middle line:84%
have drowned in another life
may be petrified of swimming

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:52.460 align:middle line:90%
in this life?

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:53.300 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Definitely.

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:54.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That kind of thing?

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:55.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yeah.

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And we can go back
and rewrite the script

00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:58.700 align:middle line:90%
so that they didn't drown.

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:00.743 align:middle line:84%
And in this life, it
eliminates their fear--

00:27:00.743 --> 00:27:01.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's interesting.

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:03.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: --of swimming.

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:08.762 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What causes
people to just not get it?

00:27:08.762 --> 00:27:10.220 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
people out there

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:13.610 align:middle line:84%
that just don't
understand themselves.

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:15.340 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:18.160 align:middle line:84%
They're not taught that
in school, their parents

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:20.540 align:middle line:90%
don't teach them.

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:22.200 align:middle line:90%
What are they missing?

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:25.610 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Well, it takes
a dedicated effort

00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:30.170 align:middle line:84%
in order for someone
to release themselves

00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:32.780 align:middle line:90%
from their own entrapment.

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Some people are just at
that point on their journey

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:40.340 align:middle line:84%
where they're having the type
of experience that maybe they

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:42.980 align:middle line:84%
were destined to
have in this lifetime

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:45.680 align:middle line:90%
and they are learning lessons.

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:50.480 align:middle line:84%
Lessons can be learned through
suffering and separation.

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And we have volunteered to
come here to this 3D reality

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:56.990 align:middle line:84%
to experience both
suffering and joy.

00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:59.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now let's take a
look at spiritual avatars.

00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:02.430 align:middle line:84%
And then I want you to
explain exactly what they are,

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:05.560 align:middle line:90%
because you've looked at this.

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:11.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Are we avatars being
programmed by our source self

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:18.160 align:middle line:84%
who's experiencing these virtual
realities through us as us?

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:23.860 align:middle line:84%
Is our source self seated
behind a computer screen

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:28.900 align:middle line:84%
and choosing different
projections of itself

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:33.460 align:middle line:84%
as different personalities
in different timelines

00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:35.560 align:middle line:90%
and dimensions?

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:42.820 align:middle line:10%
Is our source self using DNA
codes to program these avatars?

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:46.300 align:middle line:10%
And is there an
architect writing code

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:51.100 align:middle line:10%
for all of these
programmed realities?

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:54.910 align:middle line:10%
Beyond digital
consciousness, I began

00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:59.290 align:middle line:10%
to wonder about sacred
geometry and how

00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:03.590 align:middle line:10%
that was being used to create
the forms in our reality.

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:08.500 align:middle line:84%
And then I discovered
emergence theory.

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:12.040 align:middle line:10%
This theory combines
sacred geometry

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:16.690 align:middle line:10%
and multidimensionality
to create

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:21.760 align:middle line:10%
a pixelated spacetime
programmed reality.

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:27.070 align:middle line:84%
In this theory, there
is an E8 crystal

00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:31.150 align:middle line:84%
being projected from
the 8th dimension

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:36.790 align:middle line:84%
onto the fourth dimension to
create a quasi crystal in order

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:42.100 align:middle line:90%
to derive 3D spacetime.

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:44.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That may be the
key to all of this, love.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:45.822 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Absolutely.

00:29:45.822 --> 00:29:46.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You know what?

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:48.550 align:middle line:90%
Something we lack a lot.

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:51.190 align:middle line:84%
I keep saying that a
lot because I see what's

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:53.170 align:middle line:90%
happening on the planet today.

00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's just not going
the way most people want.

00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:00.670 align:middle line:84%
Is it easy or difficult
to pull yourself out

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:05.110 align:middle line:84%
of what is happening day to
day and create this environment

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:07.480 align:middle line:90%
that you're after?

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:12.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: It can be challenging
to look away from the darkness

00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:15.580 align:middle line:90%
and turn toward the light.

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:20.990 align:middle line:84%
But I always tell people
where your attention goes,

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:22.240 align:middle line:90%
energy flows.

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:26.050 align:middle line:84%
So do you want to
give this small energy

00:30:26.050 --> 00:30:30.670 align:middle line:84%
and look into the darkness
and keep spiraling into that,

00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:36.890 align:middle line:84%
or would you prefer to send
your attention into the light

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:40.410 align:middle line:84%
and have your energy
flow in that direction?

00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And so it takes a concentrated
effort to look to the light

00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:48.320 align:middle line:84%
and to seek a higher
way of living and being.

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:53.270 align:middle line:84%
But once you do, it's so
fulfilling and gratifying

00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:55.860 align:middle line:84%
when you start to awaken the
light within and share it

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:56.660 align:middle line:90%
with others.

00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:58.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there
forces, Suzanne, that

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:01.780 align:middle line:90%
are trying to pull us down?

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:02.580 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Certainly.

00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:05.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To keep us from
getting into the good mode

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:06.600 align:middle line:90%
that you talk about?

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:08.760 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: In this
reality of duality,

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:12.330 align:middle line:84%
there has to be both
light and dark forces.

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And so some people are playing
the role of the dark force

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:19.740 align:middle line:84%
and some people are playing
the role of the light force,

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:21.720 align:middle line:84%
keeping this reality
of duality balance.

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:23.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it our choice?

00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:24.390 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Absolutely.

00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:26.730 align:middle line:84%
And I believe we're in
that realm of choice

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:29.100 align:middle line:84%
now, that we're actually
in what you might

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:31.140 align:middle line:90%
call the fourth dimension now.

00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is the realm
of choice, where

00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:37.555 align:middle line:84%
you choose to serve the
light selflessly or you--

00:31:37.555 --> 00:31:38.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or you don't

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:40.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: --choose to continue
to dwell in the darkness.

00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And there's really no
judgment about that.

00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:44.760 align:middle line:84%
It's just where you're
at on your journey.

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:46.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Give me
a story of someone

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:48.540 align:middle line:84%
who may have gone
to you and they

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:52.290 align:middle line:84%
were living on the dark side
and you pull them out of it.

00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:54.630 align:middle line:90%
Kind of tell us what happened.

00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:56.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And so, yes,
people do come to me

00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:59.970 align:middle line:84%
and they're very much caught
up in the drama of their lives

00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:03.690 align:middle line:84%
and focused in a victim
mindset on everything

00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:05.880 align:middle line:90%
that has happened to them.

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:08.940 align:middle line:84%
And through a series
of energetic practices,

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:12.630 align:middle line:84%
like I said before, with
the shock rejourney,

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:15.300 align:middle line:84%
illuminating and
cleansing their chakras.

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:19.110 align:middle line:84%
I do sound healing as
well as talk therapy

00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:23.850 align:middle line:84%
and start to shift
them out of that space

00:32:23.850 --> 00:32:29.820 align:middle line:84%
where now, they have a more
empowered mindset about all

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:32.520 align:middle line:84%
that they can do
and be and have.

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:36.240 align:middle line:84%
I guide spiritual journeys
in Sedona, Arizona,

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:39.460 align:middle line:84%
and people can have a personal
or spiritual retreat with me

00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:40.260 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And I've taken hundreds
of people out on the land

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:48.240 align:middle line:84%
and in indoor sessions
and shown them

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:53.310 align:middle line:84%
who they truly are as a divine
love light being capable

00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:56.090 align:middle line:84%
of doing and having and being
anything that they desire.

00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:57.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That they want to be.

00:32:57.340 --> 00:33:01.350 align:middle line:84%
Does this metamorphosis
happen quickly or over time?

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: It depends
on the person.

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:06.570 align:middle line:84%
But it can be
somewhat spontaneous

00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:10.590 align:middle line:84%
with the combination of
talk therapy, sound healing,

00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:12.540 align:middle line:90%
and chakra cleansing.

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:15.450 align:middle line:84%
Of course, also the
past life experiences,

00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:18.510 align:middle line:84%
where we cleanse any
shadows from past lives,

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:22.200 align:middle line:84%
and then we can progress into
the multidimensional soul

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:25.800 align:middle line:84%
reunion and actually
activate some dormant DNA,

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:27.540 align:middle line:84%
bringing more of
their brain online

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:30.270 align:middle line:84%
so they actually become
a greater expression

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:31.570 align:middle line:90%
of themselves.

00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:33.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So this, Suzanne,
for you personally,

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:36.630 align:middle line:84%
what has been the most
gratifying thing you've

00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:39.630 align:middle line:90%
done for yourself?

00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:41.172 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Marrying
the love of my life.

00:33:41.172 --> 00:33:42.422 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, how about that.

00:33:42.422 --> 00:33:43.410 align:middle line:90%
How nice is that?

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:46.260 align:middle line:90%


00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:48.030 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes, love is the key.

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:51.245 align:middle line:84%
And when you're supported with
unconditional love every day,

00:33:51.245 --> 00:33:52.045 align:middle line:90%
day in--

00:33:52.045 --> 00:33:53.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can feel that.

00:33:53.170 --> 00:33:55.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: --and day out, then
you feel blessed every day

00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:57.660 align:middle line:84%
and just want to share
it with the world.

00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:01.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has your life changed
over the years dramatically?

00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:01.830 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:06.630 align:middle line:84%
And it has been that dedication
to the spiritual path

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:10.199 align:middle line:84%
and the advances I've
made along the way, also,

00:34:10.199 --> 00:34:12.510 align:middle line:84%
that I can be of higher
service to others.

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:18.040 align:middle line:84%
I sincerely love all of humanity
and enjoy serving in this way.

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:21.719 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you say
to somebody who says,

00:34:21.719 --> 00:34:23.949 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to get
involved in this.

00:34:23.949 --> 00:34:25.800 align:middle line:84%
I don't want a
spiritual awakening.

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.739 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy the way I am.

00:34:27.739 --> 00:34:29.489 align:middle line:90%
Bleh.

00:34:29.489 --> 00:34:32.340 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Well, it's funny because
I do these spiritual journeys

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:33.972 align:middle line:84%
in Sedona and
sometimes I'll have--

00:34:33.972 --> 00:34:34.889 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You get that?

00:34:34.889 --> 00:34:35.260 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yeah.

00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:35.699 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You get that.

00:34:35.699 --> 00:34:37.239 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: People show
up and they'll say,

00:34:37.239 --> 00:34:39.281 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to hear
anything about spirituality.

00:34:39.281 --> 00:34:41.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm da da da da,
woo, woo, stuff.

00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And as we continue on
the journey surrounded

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:47.460 align:middle line:84%
by these magnificent
red rock temples

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:51.649 align:middle line:84%
and I start to talk about
some of these things in a very

00:34:51.649 --> 00:34:56.730 align:middle line:84%
lighthearted way, they
get sort of drawn in.

00:34:56.730 --> 00:34:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And before I know it,
they're telling me

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:06.180 align:middle line:84%
about how they experienced
maybe their mother soul leaving

00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:09.348 align:middle line:84%
her body when she passed on, or
these remarkable things that--

00:35:09.348 --> 00:35:10.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That changes,
that'll do it.

00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:11.690 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Right.

00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:13.560 align:middle line:84%
They've witnessed
and experienced.

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And before you know
it, we're having a more

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:18.540 align:middle line:84%
spiritual conversation
and they're

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:22.960 align:middle line:84%
leaving, walking lighter on
air than before being so heavy

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:23.760 align:middle line:90%
and dense.

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:25.177 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's
your next mission?

00:35:25.177 --> 00:35:26.870 align:middle line:90%
What's your goal?

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:28.590 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Thank you
for asking that.

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:30.890 align:middle line:90%
I have created ONE--

00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:32.690 align:middle line:90%
OperationNewEarth.

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:35.910 align:middle line:84%
It's an acronym that
came to me one morning.

00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And so this OperationNewEarth
is a project to bring those who

00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:46.310 align:middle line:84%
are spiritually inspired to
co-create a new higher way

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:50.340 align:middle line:84%
of living and being
here on Earth and--

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:51.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exciting.

00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:52.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: --looking for ways--

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:57.530 align:middle line:84%
governmental, societal,
economical, ecological--

00:35:57.530 --> 00:36:02.960 align:middle line:84%
ways that we can rise above
this darker agenda, and as

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:05.030 align:middle line:84%
a countermeasure to
the New World Order,

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:07.385 align:middle line:90%
create one OperationNewEarth.

00:36:07.385 --> 00:36:09.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:10.343 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Thank you, George.

00:36:10.343 --> 00:36:11.420 align:middle line:90%
I so appreciate it.

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:14.090 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: If you haven't had
your spiritual awakening yet,

00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:17.930 align:middle line:10%
you're in for a big surprise,
and people like Suzanne Ross

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:21.020 align:middle line:10%
will get you there like that.

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:22.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:24.820 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:30.000 align:middle line:90%
