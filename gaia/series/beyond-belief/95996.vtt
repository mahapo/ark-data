00:00:05.274 --> 00:00:07.440 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.221 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:09.221 --> 00:00:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to to keep on

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.470 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.550 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.294 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.294 --> 00:00:26.710 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY:
Well, welcome back

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.430 align:middle line:10%
to another edition
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.660 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.310 align:middle line:10%
And of course, as you
know, watching this program

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.660 align:middle line:10%
over the years, we dive
into all kinds of subjects,

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.270 align:middle line:10%
including, of course,
after-death experiences.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.120 align:middle line:84%
What happens to the human
body, what happens to the soul

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.420 align:middle line:84%
when it ceases to exist
in the physical plane?

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.050 align:middle line:90%
We don't die, do we?

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.310 align:middle line:84%
That's the story of
Sandra Champlain.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:57.340 align:middle line:90%
An incredible work.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDRA CHAMPLAIN:
Thank you, George.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.058 align:middle line:90%
Happy to be here.

00:00:59.058 --> 00:01:02.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So Sandra, we
really don't die, do we?

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: We don't.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.874 align:middle line:10%
It's an illusion to
think that we die.

00:01:05.874 --> 00:01:07.540 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What is on
the other side then?

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.339 align:middle line:10%
What's over there?

00:01:08.339 --> 00:01:09.630 align:middle line:10%
>>CHAMPLAIN: What's over there?

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.880 align:middle line:10%
I think our lives here are
for a purpose-- to love,

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.380 align:middle line:10%
to learn, to grow, to
experience emotions.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.609 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Maybe.

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:18.400 align:middle line:10%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Right.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.025 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe.

00:01:19.025 --> 00:01:21.680 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm convinced
that science

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.960 align:middle line:90%
has no idea why we're here.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.340 align:middle line:10%
>>CHAMPLAIN: I think you
may be onto something there.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.560 align:middle line:10%
However, the attitude that
I take is what I learn,

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.727 align:middle line:10%
what I share empowers
people in their life now.

00:01:34.727 --> 00:01:36.810 align:middle line:10%
And I don't ever push any
of my beliefs on people.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:37.410 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Good.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.840 align:middle line:10%
>>CHAMPLAIN: But it's like
these are my experiences,

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.340 align:middle line:10%
and these things have helped me.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.660 align:middle line:10%
So heaven, I think,
is a place that

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.170 align:middle line:10%
is very close to where
we are right now.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.300 align:middle line:10%
I think that we are all made up
of energy-- science has proven

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.980 align:middle line:10%
this, this is not just
coming from my head--

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:01.270 align:middle line:10%
and that we can change our form,
like a pond or a little puddle

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.290 align:middle line:10%
after rainstorm will dry up
when a sunshiny day comes.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.840 align:middle line:10%
And although the puddle
no longer exists,

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.380 align:middle line:10%
that water still does
exist in just another form.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.290 align:middle line:10%
When we die, our
bodies may be gone.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.110 align:middle line:10%
We can't see them or
touch them, feel them.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.150 align:middle line:10%
However, the George Noory,
the Sandra Champlain

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.470 align:middle line:10%
that loves to laugh, that
loves to love, our personality,

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.720 align:middle line:10%
we go on.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.060 align:middle line:10%
So heaven is also called
many different names.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.610 align:middle line:10%
But I really love
the word "hereafter,"

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.900 align:middle line:10%
because from my investigations,
I really do think it is here,

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.060 align:middle line:10%
and I mean right here,
just after we're gone,

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.490 align:middle line:10%
that our energy survives
in an invisible place.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.240 align:middle line:10%
And there are
things that we know

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.060 align:middle line:10%
are real in the invisible place,
like radio waves and television

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.060 align:middle line:10%
signals and our wireless
internet-- very, very real,

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.120 align:middle line:10%
but we can't see
them with our eyes.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.030 align:middle line:10%
And some of my investigations
into the world of mediumship

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.890 align:middle line:10%
and electronic voice
phenomena has proved to me

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.420 align:middle line:10%
that our loved ones
must be right here

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.890 align:middle line:10%
to make these things
happen so immediately.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.870 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What kind of a
genius could concoct a plan

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.630 align:middle line:10%
where everything like this would
work-- that a soul would enter

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.810 align:middle line:10%
a physical body, that the soul
would leave the physical body

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.270 align:middle line:10%
upon its physical death?

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.530 align:middle line:10%
Who could come up with
something like that?

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.760 align:middle line:10%
>>CHAMPLAIN: That is the
question of the ages,

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.280 align:middle line:10%
and so incomprehensible
that I don't know.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.750 align:middle line:10%
But I do know, just from my
life and my synchronicities--

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.290 align:middle line:10%
and I call many
of them miracles--

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.370 align:middle line:10%
that there has to be a
much wiser being or beings,

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.114 align:middle line:10%
however-- the universe,
god, whatever you personally

00:03:52.114 --> 00:03:52.780 align:middle line:10%
want to call it.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:53.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whatever it is.

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: It's the real deal.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.130 align:middle line:90%
It exists.

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.060 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: When you
were a skeptic,

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.690 align:middle line:10%
before you wrote "We Don't
Die," and then things

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.120 align:middle line:10%
started to change
for you and involve,

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.160 align:middle line:10%
were you in shock that you
believed it all of a sudden?

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.890 align:middle line:10%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Oh, in shock.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.970 align:middle line:10%
Can I tell you the first
medium experience I had?

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:13.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.470 align:middle line:90%
Love to hear it.

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.430 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: It was-- holy cow.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.177 align:middle line:10%
I very secretly took a course
with Dr. Doreen Virtue.

00:04:21.177 --> 00:04:22.010 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: She's good.

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.360 align:middle line:10%
>>CHAMPLAIN: She's real good.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.950 align:middle line:10%
And her promise of
the course-- if you

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.060 align:middle line:10%
felt drawn to be
in her course, you

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.670 align:middle line:10%
are someone who can accurately
tell the deceased people

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.727 align:middle line:10%
around others.

00:04:33.727 --> 00:04:35.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sense them or see them?

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.270 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: See them.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.040 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.797 align:middle line:10%
So skeptic Sandra was like--

00:04:39.797 --> 00:04:40.380 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.130 align:middle line:10%
Right.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.730 align:middle line:10%
Ha, ha, ha.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.850 align:middle line:10%
>>CHAMPLAIN: I also
had a fear of dying.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.170 align:middle line:10%
So the fear of dying
and looking for proof

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.890 align:middle line:10%
is what actually had
me take the course.

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:48.260 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.926 align:middle line:10%
>>CHAMPLAIN: And I
knew that I was never

00:04:49.926 --> 00:04:51.500 align:middle line:10%
going to tell
anybody this story.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.730 align:middle line:10%
So I could just secretly
go take this course.

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And I told people
in my life that I

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.090 align:middle line:84%
was taking some
self help course.

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.650 align:middle line:10%
But I lied.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And when I was greeted by
Doreen and maybe 20 of us

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.350 align:middle line:84%
in the class, she
explained how mediumship

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.850 align:middle line:84%
works, how our loved
ones are around us,

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.240 align:middle line:84%
how our personalities
are the same.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.140 align:middle line:84%
You have to use the same
manners you do in regular life.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.530 align:middle line:84%
You can't just be demanding
that you want a sign

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:19.460 align:middle line:90%
or you want a message.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And so she says, this is
what we're going to do.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.730 align:middle line:84%
She says, we're going to
play make believe medium.

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.470 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to just
talk you through how

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:26.560 align:middle line:90%
we are going to do it.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.020 align:middle line:84%
But we're not really going to
do medium readings right now.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.200 align:middle line:84%
So she says, everybody
grab a partner.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.750 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.315 align:middle line:90%
So I pick a lady.

00:05:34.315 --> 00:05:35.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A human.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.090 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Human.

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:37.300 align:middle line:90%
We sat knee to knee.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.812 align:middle line:90%
She says, somebody go first.

00:05:38.812 --> 00:05:41.020 align:middle line:84%
We're going to just use the
power of our imagination.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: I'm very
creative, so I can do this.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:44.901 align:middle line:90%
So I said, well, I'll go first.

00:05:44.901 --> 00:05:46.660 align:middle line:84%
She says, I want you
to close your eyes.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:47.477 align:middle line:90%
Hold hands.

00:05:47.477 --> 00:05:49.060 align:middle line:84%
She says, I want you
to imagine you're

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:54.250 align:middle line:84%
in a safe space protected
by a bubble of white energy.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.670 align:middle line:90%
Have a lot of love in the air.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.440 align:middle line:84%
Quiet your mind,
because we always

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.870 align:middle line:84%
have this internal mind
that never stops talking.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.430 align:middle line:84%
Imagine your hearts
are connected

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.660 align:middle line:90%
by this invisible energy.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And we had to say a
prayer-- whether you believe

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.720 align:middle line:84%
in god or the almighty or the
universe, that it's very safe,

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.190 align:middle line:84%
and that this will happen--
and very respectively ask,

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:18.400 align:middle line:84%
is there anybody who
belongs to this person that

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.060 align:middle line:90%
might want to give a message?

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.280 align:middle line:84%
So she's coaching us through
this as we're doing it.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.750 align:middle line:90%
And my eyes are closed.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.090 align:middle line:84%
And so she says, very
often, you see a person.

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:27.490 align:middle line:90%
You might hear a name.

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.690 align:middle line:84%
You might know what the
person died of or some things.

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.300 align:middle line:84%
Or very often, there's
a profound message

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.320 align:middle line:90%
that comes through.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.560 align:middle line:90%
So I've got my eyes closed.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.760 align:middle line:90%
And I'm thinking.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.600 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And I'm inventing
now, I said, you've

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.850 align:middle line:84%
got a grandfather
standing behind you.

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:44.770 align:middle line:90%
It's your mom's dad.

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And I saw a fishing
boat my mind.

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:51.140 align:middle line:84%
And I said he's a fisherman
in Denmark, or he was.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.830 align:middle line:84%
He's got sandy blond
hair, wind burned

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:58.090 align:middle line:84%
skin, big gap between
his front teeth.

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:59.380 align:middle line:90%
His name is Jan.

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:00.530 align:middle line:90%
That came to my mind.

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.670 align:middle line:90%
And he died of lung cancer.

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And I saw him puffing
away in my imagination.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And I said, he never told
your mom that he loved her.

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.114 align:middle line:84%
So he wants you to tell
her that he loves her.

00:07:12.114 --> 00:07:13.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He never said that?

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.363 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Never-- he's
one of those tough dads.

00:07:15.363 --> 00:07:17.590 align:middle line:84%
So mind you, I've got my
eyes closed this whole time.

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:19.070 align:middle line:90%
And I'm just doing my part.

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:20.740 align:middle line:90%
So then I open my eyes.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:21.990 align:middle line:90%
And I say, OK, it's your turn.

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:23.190 align:middle line:90%
You go next.

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And there's just streams of
tears coming down her cheeks.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:29.680 align:middle line:90%
Her grandfather's name was Jan.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.150 align:middle line:90%
He was a fisherman in Denmark.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:32.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Truly amazing.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:34.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Chain smoker,
died of lung cancer,

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.070 align:middle line:84%
and never did tell his own
daughter that he loved her.

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:39.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And this was
just coming to you.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.890 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: As if I made it up.

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:42.589 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:44.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: I've got
goosebumps right now.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.671 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you in shock too?

00:07:45.671 --> 00:07:48.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: I was in
shock, because first of all,

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:52.100 align:middle line:84%
if this stuff is possible, why
would it be happening to me?

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:53.920 align:middle line:90%
I don't have any special gifts.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.129 align:middle line:84%
And that told me we don't
have to have special gifts.

00:07:56.129 --> 00:07:58.294 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did you tune
into to pick all that up?

00:07:58.294 --> 00:07:59.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Correct.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't do research on the
internet, who my partner was,

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.830 align:middle line:90%
or any of that nonsense.

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:05.852 align:middle line:90%
It was the real deal.

00:08:05.852 --> 00:08:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And then she turned to me
and she did the same thing.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.935 align:middle line:84%
She saw my grandfather, his
German Shepard, the cane

00:08:10.935 --> 00:08:12.180 align:middle line:90%
that he always used.

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:13.990 align:middle line:90%
She knew his name was John.

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:15.105 align:middle line:90%
It is mind blowing.

00:08:15.105 --> 00:08:15.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Remarkable.

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:16.510 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Remarkable.

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:17.676 align:middle line:90%
And then I just wanted more.

00:08:17.676 --> 00:08:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
I was wrong as much

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:24.510 align:middle line:84%
as I was right, because
our imagination looks like,

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:27.500 align:middle line:84%
when we get these messages
from deceased loved ones--

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.980 align:middle line:90%
and there's fabulous mediums.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:34.159 align:middle line:84%
And I've studied lot of
James van Praagh's things.

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:35.210 align:middle line:90%
He's brilliant.

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:37.309 align:middle line:84%
And I think there
are people that

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:40.270 align:middle line:90%
are gifted with mediumship.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.066 align:middle line:84%
Some people are
born child prodigies

00:08:42.066 --> 00:08:43.440 align:middle line:84%
and they can play
the piano right

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.920 align:middle line:90%
off the bat at the age of five.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:45.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a gift.

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:46.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: And
there's others that

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.180 align:middle line:84%
need to really practice,
practice, practice.

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:49.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.880 align:middle line:90%
And they're still not as good.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:51.671 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Right.

00:08:51.671 --> 00:08:55.130 align:middle line:84%
I think we all have inherit
ability to tap into something.

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And then there are those
that are really gifted in it.

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:02.270 align:middle line:84%
But I believe we can
all interact and get

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:04.460 align:middle line:84%
in touch with our loved
ones who have crossed over.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:05.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you think it is?

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.061 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: What
do I think what is?

00:09:07.061 --> 00:09:08.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The other side.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: I think it's great.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.680 align:middle line:90%
I think it's a place--

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.014 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they all walking
around in robes and pipes?

00:09:16.014 --> 00:09:17.263 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: I don't think so.

00:09:17.263 --> 00:09:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And you know, what's funny
too, that comes to mind

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:21.520 align:middle line:84%
is-- you know I have
a sense of humor.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.580 align:middle line:84%
Somebody wrote a book
"Do Dead People Watch

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:24.785 align:middle line:90%
Me in the Shower?"--

00:09:24.785 --> 00:09:25.868 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They probably do.

00:09:25.868 --> 00:09:28.167 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Because it's a
very scary thing to think--

00:09:28.167 --> 00:09:29.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And other places.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:32.230 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Yes-- that we're
not alone and what is it like?

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And after we die are we
just in this middle space

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.790 align:middle line:84%
that we're haunting the
people in our lives?

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:39.900 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.440 align:middle line:90%
I think we go forward.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And I've interviewed my
share of people, as well,

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:48.040 align:middle line:84%
and done my studies--
that this life has

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:53.940 align:middle line:84%
a reason and the purpose of our
soul of growing of learning.

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:56.900 align:middle line:84%
So often, they
say that our souls

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:00.900 align:middle line:90%
reincarnate around each other.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.690 align:middle line:84%
My sister could have been my
father in a past lifetime--

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:04.550 align:middle line:90%
things like that.

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, and
you're together

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:05.380 align:middle line:90%
with friends or whatever.

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:06.540 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: We are.

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:07.880 align:middle line:90%
And we even know that in life.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.372 align:middle line:84%
When we experience new
things with people we love,

00:10:11.372 --> 00:10:13.890 align:middle line:84%
it's a much greater
value than sometimes when

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:15.850 align:middle line:84%
we meet somebody
for the first time.

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:19.320 align:middle line:84%
And so if we do come
back around each other,

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.690 align:middle line:90%
we all have our different parts.

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And we all have different
things to learn and to grow.

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:26.060 align:middle line:90%
But I think it's a great place.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:34.570 align:middle line:84%
People say that our senses
are tuned up like 100 times.

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:37.070 align:middle line:84%
There are colors in heaven that
there are no colors for here

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:42.320 align:middle line:84%
on Earth-- that our vision isn't
just what we see with our eyes.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.290 align:middle line:90%
We could see 360.

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:47.850 align:middle line:84%
We can see all around
us, and this knowing.

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:51.570 align:middle line:84%
And I've often wondered,
well, do we have bodies?

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And we do, in a way,
because we recognize people,

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:57.210 align:middle line:84%
and we have these
ethereal bodies

00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:00.422 align:middle line:84%
that can still feel
a hug or hear music.

00:11:00.422 --> 00:11:02.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's whatever
body you want, isn't it?

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:03.550 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Yeah, it is.

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And some people, when
they die, they see Jesus.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:09.150 align:middle line:84%
Some people from different
cultures see different things.

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:15.180 align:middle line:84%
And I think there can't be one
heaven that fits all people.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:18.830 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a lot of our
beliefs and our feelings.

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:20.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is heaven?

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.100 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: What
is heaven-- wow.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.880 align:middle line:90%
I think it's part of a--

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.999 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sort of
repository for the good?

00:11:27.999 --> 00:11:28.790 align:middle line:90%
And then if it is--

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:29.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: It's a
hard question to answer.

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:31.010 align:middle line:90%

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:31.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Yeah.

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, is
some evil person,

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:36.960 align:middle line:84%
some serial killer,
going to be mixed

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.510 align:middle line:90%
up there with the good people?

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:40.580 align:middle line:90%
I think not.

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:41.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: I think not.

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:45.620 align:middle line:84%
But I don't personally
believe that there's

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:48.260 align:middle line:84%
someone judging us-- that
you've had a great life,

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:49.980 align:middle line:90%
so you get to go over here.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.640 align:middle line:90%
And you, not so much.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:52.800 align:middle line:90%
You're going over here.

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.383 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's got
to be punishment.

00:11:54.383 --> 00:11:57.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: There has
to be but is it more

00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.560 align:middle line:90%
of an internal punishment?

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:05.190 align:middle line:84%
I spoke to a professor who was
an atheist who had a near death

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.830 align:middle line:90%
experience--

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:07.032 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Most are.

>>CHAMPLAIN: Yes.

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And I also spoke to a doctor
who was head of anesthesiology

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:16.380 align:middle line:84%
at a prominent hospital who was
very honest that his life was

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:17.670 align:middle line:90%
about money.

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:19.860 align:middle line:84%
He was making jokes
in the operating room.

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:20.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: About money?

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:21.833 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: About people.

00:12:21.833 --> 00:12:24.350 align:middle line:84%
He could care less about who
was on the operating table.

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:25.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unbelievable.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.083 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Unbelievable.

00:12:26.083 --> 00:12:29.480 align:middle line:84%
He said he drove a
real expensive Mercedes

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.610 align:middle line:90%
and had a Hummer.

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:35.910 align:middle line:84%
His house, he paid an $11,000
a month mortgage payment.

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And both of those two gentlemen,
when they had their near death

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:43.730 align:middle line:84%
experiences, were-- "greeted"
is not the right word.

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:45.530 align:middle line:90%
It felt like hell to them.

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:46.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Visited.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:47.020 align:middle line:90%

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:59.000 align:middle line:84%
is being responsible for
the impact we've had.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.990 align:middle line:84%
So they saw their
life, the impact

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:06.010 align:middle line:84%
on other people from other
people's point of view,

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:07.020 align:middle line:90%
from their perspective.

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:09.130 align:middle line:90%
And it really intensified.

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And both of them, for the
first time, actually prayed.

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And this is amazing
that they said this.

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And so out of this
darkness, where they really

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:23.280 align:middle line:84%
saw the impact of their
actions, came a little pin prick

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:27.560 align:middle line:84%
of light that grew bigger
and bigger the more they

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.310 align:middle line:90%
prayed about it.

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they even
know what prayer was?

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:31.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: They
instinctively knew,

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:34.080 align:middle line:84%
because when you're
faced with so much fear,

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:39.470 align:middle line:84%
it was-- they just wanted to
believe in good at that point.

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And so the doctor
was actually Hindu.

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is amazing,
because what

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:48.410 align:middle line:84%
came to him was
Jesus and angels.

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:49.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not Krishna?

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:51.282 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: And
his wife said, well,

00:13:51.282 --> 00:13:52.740 align:middle line:84%
what happened about
the 1,000 gods?

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:54.771 align:middle line:90%
He's like, I don't know.

00:13:54.771 --> 00:13:55.770 align:middle line:90%
And maybe it's because--

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:56.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is the
one that happened.

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:59.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: --he's been in
the United States long enough.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And even the
professor, same thing--

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:04.790 align:middle line:84%
he ended up becoming a
minister and totally changed

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:05.889 align:middle line:90%
their lives around.

00:14:05.889 --> 00:14:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Hindu
became a minister?

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:09.221 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: No, the
Hindu changed his life

00:14:09.221 --> 00:14:10.490 align:middle line:90%
to become a good doctor.

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And actually, he talks about
waking people up as opposed

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:15.710 align:middle line:84%
to putting them asleep,
being an anesthesiologist.

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:18.220 align:middle line:84%
But they both made their lives
about making a difference.

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And so they say that the hell
was what they experienced.

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:23.360 align:middle line:90%
But there is a way out.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.230 align:middle line:84%
It's not like there's a
place of eternal doom.

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:27.880 align:middle line:90%
But they really got the impact.

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:32.437 align:middle line:84%
And that was their punishment--
was self created punishment.

00:14:32.437 --> 00:14:33.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:38.260 align:middle line:84%
Electronic voice phenomenon--
we are baffled it.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:39.500 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: I know.

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I try to play these
sounds on Coast to Coast.

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:42.220 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Yeah.

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:43.130 align:middle line:90%
hard to hear, though.

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:44.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're hard to hear.

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:44.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Sure.

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:49.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can clearly-- you
know there's something there.

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:50.610 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you'll hear it.

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:53.780 align:middle line:84%
The investigator will
say say, say something,

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:55.172 align:middle line:84%
and you'll hear--
[STATIC NOISE].

00:14:55.172 --> 00:14:55.880 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Yes.

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something comes in.

00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:58.660 align:middle line:90%
What do you think they are?

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:02.190 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: I think-- and
this took me, actually,

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:03.440 align:middle line:90%
taking a course in this.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:07.220 align:middle line:84%
You've spoken with Tom and Lisa
Butler, who are awesome people.

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:08.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The GIS people.

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:11.119 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Yeah, they're
the ATransC people.

00:15:11.119 --> 00:15:11.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:14.710 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Yeah-- Association
of TransCommunication--

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:17.310 align:middle line:84%
because it all sounds well
and good that we don't die,

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:18.430 align:middle line:90%
but where's the proof?

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:21.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really-- besides what
I can see in my mind's eye.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:26.650 align:middle line:84%
So if I can share my course in
electronic voice phenomena, Tom

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:29.860 align:middle line:84%
and Lisa Butler-- regular
folks, real nice--

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:32.690 align:middle line:84%
were explaining
that because we are

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:37.130 align:middle line:84%
all energy that our deceased
loved ones can rearrange

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:40.880 align:middle line:84%
the sound that has been
recorded on a recorder,

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.937 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a tape
recorder-- I don't know

00:15:42.937 --> 00:15:44.145 align:middle line:90%
if it works on their iPhones.

00:15:44.145 --> 00:15:44.853 align:middle line:90%
It probably does.

00:15:44.853 --> 00:15:46.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're better
on digital recorders.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:48.980 align:middle line:90%
as opposed to the old tape.

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:50.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Yeah, but
it's still works on--

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:51.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It still works.

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:53.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN:
--different mediums.

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:55.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you don't
hear it with a normal ear

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:56.920 align:middle line:90%
until you play it back, correct?

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:57.795 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Correct.

00:15:57.795 --> 00:16:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And I know there's people
that are into bunches

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:03.000 align:middle line:84%
of other spirit boxes and
ways you can hear things

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:03.680 align:middle line:90%
a lot of time.

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:04.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's listen
to one of them, Sandra.

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll come back
and talk about that.

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:07.506 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: OK.

00:16:07.506 --> 00:16:09.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's
listen to this EVP.

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:12.568 align:middle line:10%
>>CHAMPLAIN: And to listen--

00:16:12.568 --> 00:16:22.010 align:middle line:10%
[INDISTINCT SOUND]

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:25.780 align:middle line:84%
--gives me goosebumps
to just do that.

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.130 align:middle line:90%
Who am I listening to?

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:30.690 align:middle line:84%
I had the intention in my
mind for my aunt and uncle

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:34.100 align:middle line:84%
and grandmother and
grandfather to come through.

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And I can distinctly hear two
male voices and two women--

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:43.860 align:middle line:84%
at least two women's voices
right here in the middle.

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:50.450 align:middle line:84%
And from what I've
been told, the energy

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:53.450 align:middle line:84%
can change it from a male
voice to a female voice.

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:56.280 align:middle line:84%
To me, it sounds
very computerized,

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.900 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily like the
voice of my grandmother

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:02.370 align:middle line:84%
or grandfather--
not that I remember

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:04.550 align:middle line:90%
what their voices sounded like.

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:06.990 align:middle line:90%
But it's really cool.

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:13.432 align:middle line:84%
To hear that and know that
I just can't see them,

00:17:13.432 --> 00:17:15.140 align:middle line:84%
but there's this
phenomenon, that they're

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:21.040 align:middle line:84%
able to rearrange sound to have
recorded now for eternity--

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:25.402 align:middle line:90%
this will be available to hear.

00:17:25.402 --> 00:17:28.699 align:middle line:10%
[INDISTINCT SOUND]

00:17:28.699 --> 00:17:29.850 align:middle line:90%


00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:36.030 align:middle line:84%
How I got this EVP was in this
weekend retreat about EVPs.

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:38.270 align:middle line:10%
Our homework on
this weekend course

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:42.130 align:middle line:10%
was to go back to our rooms and
practice trying to get an EVP.

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:45.810 align:middle line:10%
And so me, as the person
trying to get the EVP,

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:48.600 align:middle line:10%
had to create this
safe space around me,

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.710 align:middle line:10%
had to imagine
that there was just

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:55.800 align:middle line:10%
really intense energy around
me, because people get signs

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.450 align:middle line:10%
all the time, whether the
lights are flashing on and off

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:00.170 align:middle line:10%
or the television comes on.

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:02.800 align:middle line:84%
And I believe our loved
ones manipulate energy

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:03.997 align:middle line:90%
to make things happen.

00:18:03.997 --> 00:18:06.080 align:middle line:84%
So they're manipulating
energy to get these sounds

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.110 align:middle line:90%
on the recorder.

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:09.660 align:middle line:84%
So on my digital
tape recorder, I'm

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:13.310 align:middle line:84%
sitting alone in a cabin at the
Omega Center in Rhinebeck, New

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:13.930 align:middle line:90%
York.

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:17.122 align:middle line:84%
And outside is
just pouring rain.

00:18:17.122 --> 00:18:18.580 align:middle line:84%
And they always
talk about you need

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:21.480 align:middle line:84%
some kind of white noise,
some kind of a static noise

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:25.400 align:middle line:84%
that gets recorded so our loved
ones can manipulate that sound.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:27.860 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, well, maybe
the raindrops would do.

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:29.360 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
know, I must have

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:32.880 align:middle line:84%
tried 20 times prior to
this to hear anything.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.120 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't hear anything.

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You taped
it, played it back.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:35.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: I played it back.

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:36.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Taped it,
played it back.

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:37.623 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Taped
it, played it back.

00:18:37.623 --> 00:18:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And Tom Butler would put the
recordings into his computer,

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:45.114 align:middle line:84%
really jack up the
sound, and then loop it

00:18:45.114 --> 00:18:46.530 align:middle line:84%
so we hear it over
and over again.

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:47.817 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing, yeah.

00:18:47.817 --> 00:18:49.650 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: So on this
particular occasion,

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:52.200 align:middle line:84%
I've got my digital
tape recorder.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting on
my bed in the cabin

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:56.000 align:middle line:84%
all by myself with
just raindrops.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:56.584 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mmhm.

00:18:56.584 --> 00:18:57.708 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: And I'm like--

00:18:57.708 --> 00:18:58.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A little weird.

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:00.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Yeah,
weird, but truthfully,

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.055 align:middle line:90%
I felt like I'm just by myself.

00:19:02.055 --> 00:19:03.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And I imagine my grandmother,
grandfather, aunt, and uncle

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:08.120 align:middle line:90%
at the foot of the bed.

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:10.470 align:middle line:84%
I press record after
doing the prayer

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:12.390 align:middle line:90%
and creating the safe space.

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And I say, if you
guys are really here

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.400 align:middle line:84%
and I'm supposed to do something
with this and help people--

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pop up.

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:20.283 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: --I need
you to talk loud.

00:19:20.283 --> 00:19:21.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Now.

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:23.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: And again, I
think I'm talking to myself.

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:25.545 align:middle line:84%
So I said, I'm going to let
this record just a minute.

00:19:25.545 --> 00:19:26.460 align:middle line:90%
Then I'm gonna say good night.

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:27.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is from a woman
who used to be a skeptic.

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:28.400 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Correct.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On everything.

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:30.129 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Everything.

00:19:30.129 --> 00:19:32.760 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I didn't even tell people
I went to this EVP course.

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:36.070 align:middle line:84%
The cab driver who took me
there was the only one who knew.

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:37.324 align:middle line:90%
So it's scary.

00:19:37.324 --> 00:19:38.490 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to jeopardize--

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:40.448 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he's now
written a book about you.

00:19:40.448 --> 00:19:41.610 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Probably so.

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:43.740 align:middle line:90%
So anyways, I do this recording.

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:45.150 align:middle line:90%
I say, OK, goodnight.

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:46.490 align:middle line:90%
And I turn it off.

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:47.740 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't have the computer.

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:49.720 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have any way
to loop it around.

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:50.345 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:19:50.345 --> 00:19:53.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: I put my headphones
into the digital recorder

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:56.180 align:middle line:90%
and I press play.

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:57.460 align:middle line:90%
And I hear my voice.

00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:59.050 align:middle line:10%
I hear the raindrops.

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:02.200 align:middle line:10%
And then, I'm flooded
with goosebumps.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.400 align:middle line:10%
I stop.

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.280 align:middle line:10%
I rewind.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:09.010 align:middle line:84%
The second number 46 on
the counter, a male voice

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:11.290 align:middle line:90%
says, goodnight, Sandra.

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:12.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.220 align:middle line:10%
>>CHAMPLAIN: In a
computer garbley sound--

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:17.369 align:middle line:10%
there's two whispers
that are women's voices.

00:20:17.369 --> 00:20:18.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Clearly, though.

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:20.034 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Yeah,
that say, goodnight,

00:20:20.034 --> 00:20:22.925 align:middle line:84%
goodnight-- and then
another garbled man's voice

00:20:22.925 --> 00:20:25.230 align:middle line:90%
says, goodnight.

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:30.150 align:middle line:10%
And it was that moment that not
only thrilled me, but scared

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:30.990 align:middle line:10%
that heck out of me.

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:31.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Freaking out.

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:33.644 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Because
are they always with me?

00:20:33.644 --> 00:20:35.800 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, I'm playing
in a world that I

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.100 align:middle line:90%
didn't think I should be.

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:38.960 align:middle line:10%
And when I brought it
to class the next day,

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:43.050 align:middle line:10%
Tom and Lisa said, that's a
class A. That is a class A EVP.

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:44.536 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's exciting.

00:20:44.536 --> 00:20:45.310 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Yeha.

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:46.710 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:49.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me about the
communication mechanism.

00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:51.040 align:middle line:90%
What are they trying to do?

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:53.130 align:middle line:84%
Are they using
EVPs to talk to us?

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:54.542 align:middle line:90%
Is that what they want?

00:20:54.542 --> 00:20:55.750 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: I think they do.

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:59.170 align:middle line:84%
I think there's different
ways EVP is being used.

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:02.654 align:middle line:84%
I know from Tom
and Lisa's research

00:21:02.654 --> 00:21:05.070 align:middle line:84%
that there's a whole team of
people on the other side that

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:07.710 align:middle line:84%
are trying to work with
scientists to get through

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:10.180 align:middle line:90%
and to bridge the world.

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:13.130 align:middle line:84%
For me, myself, and
I, it dawned on me

00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:16.980 align:middle line:84%
that I now have the
credibility to share my journey

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:19.040 align:middle line:84%
into learning mediumship
and the other things,

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.570 align:middle line:84%
because now, I can
do these recordings.

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And I have worked
with-- privately,

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:30.250 align:middle line:84%
not charging a penny--
probably almost 200 people

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:34.770 align:middle line:84%
to do these recordings,
because here's a for instance.

00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:36.450 align:middle line:10%
There was a woman
that her mother

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:39.410 align:middle line:10%
had died in Hurricane Katrina.

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:40.860 align:middle line:10%
She never got to say goodbye.

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:41.110 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Gosh.

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:42.040 align:middle line:10%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Her mother
was one of the seniors.

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:42.960 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Frustrating.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:46.180 align:middle line:10%
>>CHAMPLAIN: I had met this
woman on an airport shuttle

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:49.220 align:middle line:10%
from San Francisco
airport to the airport.

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:51.430 align:middle line:10%
We both have close
connection times.

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:54.730 align:middle line:10%
And she had just shared with
me about her mother's death.

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And I tell you what--
my conscience kicked in

00:21:57.270 --> 00:22:00.410 align:middle line:84%
that I have to tell her about
what I've learned so far.

00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:02.190 align:middle line:90%
This was long before the book.

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:05.830 align:middle line:10%
And so I said, I've done
these things called EVPs.

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:09.740 align:middle line:10%
And with big eyes, she says,
can you try it with me?

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:11.110 align:middle line:90%
Can we get through to my mom?

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And truthfully, I had no
idea if it would work or not.

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:17.600 align:middle line:10%
So we were sitting right
outside her departure gate

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:21.662 align:middle line:10%
at San Francisco airport--
tons of background noise.

00:22:21.662 --> 00:22:22.620 align:middle line:10%
You know, all the time.

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:23.674 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:22:23.674 --> 00:22:25.340 align:middle line:10%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Please
report to your gate,

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:27.790 align:middle line:10%
and boarding now, zone one.

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:30.670 align:middle line:10%
And so I thought, this
is not going to work.

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:32.710 align:middle line:10%
Well, we said the
prayer, held hands.

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:34.870 align:middle line:84%
This is me with a
total stranger--

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:36.750 align:middle line:90%
press the record button.

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:41.880 align:middle line:10%
And I'm so negative inside
my mind, always the skeptic.

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:44.990 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, this poor woman's
never going to hear anything.

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:47.150 align:middle line:10%
But when we played
it back-- now,

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:49.093 align:middle line:10%
the woman introduced
herself as Dee.

00:22:49.093 --> 00:22:51.200 align:middle line:90%
That was her name.

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.770 align:middle line:84%
And you could hear all
the background noise

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:56.380 align:middle line:84%
of the announcements
in the airport.

00:22:56.380 --> 00:23:00.340 align:middle line:10%
But it was as if someone was
right next to that microphone

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:04.390 align:middle line:10%
and said, I love you, Elizabeth.

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:07.196 align:middle line:90%
So I heard it right away.

00:23:07.196 --> 00:23:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And because I've listened
to so many of them,

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:12.800 align:middle line:84%
my ears pick up what a lot of
times people haven't listened

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:13.370 align:middle line:90%
don't.

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And so I said to her, I
said, well, I hear something,

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:18.240 align:middle line:90%
but it doesn't make sense, Dee.

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:21.470 align:middle line:10%
All I hear is, I
love you, Elizabeth.

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:24.610 align:middle line:84%
She says, that's my real
name and only my mother

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:26.260 align:middle line:90%
called me that.

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment, that
lady's life was changed.

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:33.840 align:middle line:84%
She knew mom was still around
and totally changed her view

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:37.454 align:middle line:84%
on her life, of grief,
of life after death.

00:23:37.454 --> 00:23:38.495 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is amazing.

00:23:38.495 --> 00:23:38.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Amazing.

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And I have lots
of those stories.

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:46.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When a spirit
reincarnates, is it gone

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:50.380 align:middle line:84%
or can you still communicate
with it on the other side?

00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:54.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: I seem to think
that we can still communicate.

00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:57.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's almost like
they split or something.

00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:57.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Yeah.

00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:03.000 align:middle line:84%
It's really hard to grasp
how this is possible.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.110 align:middle line:90%
So I'm not sure that I can.

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:08.210 align:middle line:84%
I have a friend in
Australia named Duncan.

00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And he's been told by mediums
that his wife had reincarnated.

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:15.675 align:middle line:84%
And so I told about
this EVP phenomenon.

00:24:15.675 --> 00:24:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And he says, can
we try to do it?

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:18.670 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:20.140 align:middle line:90%
So I live in Massachusetts.

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:22.840 align:middle line:90%
He's in Sydney, Australia.

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.900 align:middle line:84%
He says a prayer to his
wife, if you could just

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:27.210 align:middle line:84%
bop over to
Massachusetts and speak

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:30.390 align:middle line:84%
into Sandra's recorder, that
would make a difference.

00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:32.375 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm willing
to try anything.

00:24:32.375 --> 00:24:35.450 align:middle line:84%
It takes only about a minute
to record one of these, George.

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:36.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's all?

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:39.397 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Yeah, but it takes
maybe an hour to go through it

00:24:39.397 --> 00:24:40.855 align:middle line:84%
and really listen
for the whispers.

00:24:40.855 --> 00:24:41.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:43.668 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: So I didn't
have Duncan right next to me

00:24:43.668 --> 00:24:46.590 align:middle line:90%
to say this is right or not.

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:48.220 align:middle line:84%
When I played it
back for myself,

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:50.320 align:middle line:90%
I heard an "I love you, Duncan."

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:52.860 align:middle line:84%
99.9% of the time
when somebody's

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:55.155 align:middle line:84%
looking for a loved one, an
"I love you" comes through.

00:24:55.155 --> 00:24:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's important for
people to share that.

00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:57.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure is.

00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: But then
there was a "she's

00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:00.250 align:middle line:90%
a better housekeeper than me."

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:01.480 align:middle line:90%
That came through.

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:05.360 align:middle line:84%
There was-- it sounded like
a woman singing in French.

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:08.644 align:middle line:84%
And then the weirdest thing
I hear is Pepe Le Pew.

00:25:08.644 --> 00:25:10.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, I remember the skunk
cartoon Pepe Le Pew.

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:12.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I remember him.

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:14.920 align:middle line:10%
>>CHAMPLAIN: So I call Duncan
back after about an hour,

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:17.160 align:middle line:10%
and I said, well,
I got some stuff.

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.690 align:middle line:90%
So I heard the "I love you."

00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And I said I hear, "she's
a better housekeeper."

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.390 align:middle line:84%
He's like, that's
my current wife,

00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:24.980 align:middle line:84%
and truthfully, she is
a better housekeeper

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:26.840 align:middle line:90%
than my deceased wife.

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:29.070 align:middle line:10%
And I said, I get somebody
singing in French.

00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:31.440 align:middle line:84%
He says, Sandra, my
mom, who's deceased,

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:34.410 align:middle line:84%
used to always sing
me French lullabies.

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:36.810 align:middle line:84%
And now, Duncan's a very
professional artist,

00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:39.600 align:middle line:84%
and I was afraid to say this,
but I said, I keep hearing

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:43.080 align:middle line:84%
over and over, sounds
like Pepe Le Pew.

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:44.220 align:middle line:90%
And he just laughed.

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:46.140 align:middle line:84%
He says, that's what I
calked my grandfather.

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:46.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:48.120 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: I know.

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:51.881 align:middle line:84%
So how her soul did
that, I don't know.

00:25:51.881 --> 00:25:54.380 align:middle line:84%
That's why I just don't think
there's any such thing as time

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:56.160 align:middle line:84%
or space except for
maybe here on Earth.

00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:00.701 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think dying is
like being in the dream state?

00:26:00.701 --> 00:26:01.700 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Yes and no.

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:06.130 align:middle line:84%
I think dreams can
be very, very real.

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And what we're experiencing
right now is very, very real.

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:12.730 align:middle line:84%
From those I've interviewed,
dying is so much more real.

00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:14.230 align:middle line:90%
Everything is more clear.

00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:16.800 align:middle line:84%
Everything is a more
sense of knowing.

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Now than before?

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:19.600 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: What do you mean?

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:20.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In terms of knowing.

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.591 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Oh,
knowing-- when we're dead,

00:26:22.591 --> 00:26:24.050 align:middle line:84%
when we're in
heaven, everything's

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:26.460 align:middle line:84%
so much more clear and
so much more vivid.

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:28.950 align:middle line:84%
So it makes our
life here on Earth

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:31.051 align:middle line:90%
seem like it was just the dream.

00:26:31.051 --> 00:26:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And there's a great
little nursery rhyme--

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:33.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it might be.

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:36.190 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Row, row, row your
boat gently down the stream.

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:39.950 align:middle line:84%
Merrily, merrily, merrily,
life is but a dream.

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:43.040 align:middle line:90%
And really, what if?

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.041 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who would know?

00:26:44.041 --> 00:26:45.706 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Well,
we'll know some time.

00:26:45.706 --> 00:26:48.052 align:middle line:84%
And who knows if we'll be
able to communicate it back.

00:26:48.052 --> 00:26:50.010 align:middle line:84%
But it makes life worth
living to explore this.

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:51.051 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What drives you?

00:26:51.051 --> 00:26:53.200 align:middle line:90%
Where's that passion, Sandra?

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:59.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: My passion right
now is I love to investigate.

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:03.670 align:middle line:84%
You love hearing the news
stories and meeting new guests.

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:06.330 align:middle line:84%
Since I've had my book-- it's
been about two years now--

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:08.560 align:middle line:90%
I've done a lot of the talking.

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And not that my own
story's not great,

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:13.510 align:middle line:84%
but there's a Sandra
that just loves

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:16.760 align:middle line:84%
to research and learn and
meet people and hear stories.

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:21.180 align:middle line:84%
And so right now, I've
got my own podcast

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:22.110 align:middle line:90%
called We Don't Die.

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:22.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, cool.

00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:23.720 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: And I interview
either people that have had

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:24.840 align:middle line:90%
in near death experience or--

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:26.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
people listen to it?

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:27.746 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: You
can go to iTunes.

00:27:27.746 --> 00:27:28.970 align:middle line:90%
We Don't Die-- type that in.

00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:31.640 align:middle line:84%
Or you can go to
wedontdieradio.com.

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:32.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:34.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: And that's easy for
anyone who doesn't know iTunes

00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:35.050 align:middle line:90%
to just go and--

00:27:35.050 --> 00:27:36.758 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just like
the title of the book.

00:27:36.758 --> 00:27:38.720 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Yeah,
wedontdieradio.com-- and see

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.120 align:middle line:90%
the guests and press play.

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:41.580 align:middle line:90%
But I've interviewed mediums.

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:44.500 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed people that
have had near death experiences

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:46.660 align:middle line:84%
and people that were
with a loved one

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:48.045 align:middle line:90%
just moments before they died.

00:27:48.045 --> 00:27:49.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Many of the
mediums are pretty

00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:50.540 align:middle line:90%
fascinating, aren't they?

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:51.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Real fascinating.

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And I only want to
know two questions.

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:55.540 align:middle line:84%
Why do you believe
in life after death?

00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And how do you live your life
knowing that we don't die?

00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:01.450 align:middle line:90%
Pretty powerful conversations.

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:03.870 align:middle line:84%
Every single one gives
people goosebumps.

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:07.120 align:middle line:84%
I've got now people addicted
to listening to the shows,

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.490 align:middle line:90%
like when's the next one coming?

00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:10.679 align:middle line:84%
So maybe I'll be the
next Coast to Coast.

00:28:10.679 --> 00:28:11.220 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:15.070 align:middle line:84%
But I'm passionate about hearing
stories and then connecting

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:18.130 align:middle line:84%
them with people
that want to know,

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:22.010 align:middle line:84%
because even though I believe
in life after death and even

00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:26.470 align:middle line:84%
though I've had my
life experiences,

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:28.690 align:middle line:84%
there's something that
feels so good and reassuring

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:30.920 align:middle line:84%
to learn more, to
meet more people,

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:32.650 align:middle line:84%
and then just to
be able to share.

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And I've gotten
emails from readers

00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:38.640 align:middle line:84%
around the world-- how much
hope and faith they now have

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:39.770 align:middle line:90%
and comfort.

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:42.130 align:middle line:84%
And I spoke at an
event in Scottsdale.

00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:43.480 align:middle line:90%
And god bless this woman.

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:45.650 align:middle line:90%
She was too afraid to fly.

00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:47.399 align:middle line:84%
She says, I drove 21
hours to meet you.

00:28:47.399 --> 00:28:48.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To come see you.

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.080 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: To tell
you the difference

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:51.370 align:middle line:90%
that this has made in my life.

00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:52.700 align:middle line:90%
And I love that.

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:54.600 align:middle line:90%
And I love people.

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Any time we can grow
and learn and somebody

00:28:57.410 --> 00:28:59.900 align:middle line:84%
can have a better life,
that's what I'm about.

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:03.200 align:middle line:84%
So if my stories and
my expeditions help,

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.960 align:middle line:90%
that gives me great passion.

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:09.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you 100% sure
that the other side exists?

00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:10.649 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: 100%.

00:29:10.649 --> 00:29:11.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No doubts?

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAMPLAIN: No doubt,
not for me, none.

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:14.827 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a change for you.

00:29:14.827 --> 00:29:16.160 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: What did it change?

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:17.493 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was huge, wasn't it?

00:29:17.493 --> 00:29:18.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Oh, yeah.

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:21.340 align:middle line:90%
And now, here's a problem.

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:23.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
part of our humanity.

00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:26.020 align:middle line:90%
We all have the inner skeptic.

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:30.580 align:middle line:84%
We all have the little
voice inside of our heads.

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:33.650 align:middle line:84%
There's a part of being human
that we can't get rid of.

00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And whether you call it the
skeptical nature-- in the book,

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:41.820 align:middle line:84%
I call it the voice,
because even though I've

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:47.160 align:middle line:84%
shared my story through
my radio show or people

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:49.840 align:middle line:84%
reading the book or now there's
a documentary about me--

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:52.670 align:middle line:84%
changing thousands
of lives, right?

00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:56.216 align:middle line:84%
I wake up this morning, knowing
I'm coming on "Beyond Belief."

00:29:56.216 --> 00:29:57.840 align:middle line:84%
And now, I knew a
couple of months ago.

00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And I swore I was going
to eat healthy, exercise,

00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:02.040 align:middle line:90%
lose a few pounds.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:04.120 align:middle line:84%
The first thought in
my mind this morning

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:07.860 align:middle line:84%
was I can't possibly
appear on TV like this.

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:09.600 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's going to
take me seriously.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:10.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm too big.

00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:16.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know I'm not alone
in that weight issue.

00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:19.970 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is that
this voice in our heads

00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:22.010 align:middle line:90%
is not who we really are.

00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:23.820 align:middle line:90%
We are so much more powerful.

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:27.065 align:middle line:90%


00:30:27.065 --> 00:30:29.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what your
thoughts are about yourself,

00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:32.240 align:middle line:84%
but I can assume that sometimes
it might be easy for people

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.530 align:middle line:84%
to hit the snooze button and
say some negative things.

00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:37.470 align:middle line:84%
But if we interview the people
in our life and we ask them,

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:40.530 align:middle line:84%
what do you think of me,
and the most powerful words

00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:42.530 align:middle line:90%
will come out of their mouths.

00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:45.330 align:middle line:84%
But left to our own devices,
this voice inside of our head

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:47.930 align:middle line:84%
wants to remind us
that-- no, too fat, ugly,

00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:51.120 align:middle line:84%
single at the age of 48,
whatever that is, not enough.

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:53.220 align:middle line:90%
But it's not reality.

00:30:53.220 --> 00:31:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And so through everything that
I'm up to, it is just a 100%

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:07.400 align:middle line:84%
solid, sure, no doubt about
it that heaven is real,

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:10.650 align:middle line:84%
that the little voice inside of
our head, can't get rid of it.

00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:13.600 align:middle line:84%
We just have to embrace it
and know that it's there.

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:17.490 align:middle line:84%
But that's the link that's
having us think that we're just

00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:19.490 align:middle line:84%
human beings, that there's
not a bigger picture.

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:22.304 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm in no to
get to the other side.

00:31:22.304 --> 00:31:23.220 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Nor am I.

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:27.297 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But when the time
comes, I'll be ready for it.

00:31:27.297 --> 00:31:27.880 align:middle line:90%
How about you?

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:27.986 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: Yeah.

00:31:27.986 --> 00:31:28.630 align:middle line:90%
I'll be ready.

00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:31.540 align:middle line:90%
Well, I say I'll be ready.

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:33.680 align:middle line:90%
I still have fear in my life.

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:35.400 align:middle line:90%
I wish I could say I didn't.

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:38.430 align:middle line:84%
I still have communications
I haven't had with people

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:42.030 align:middle line:84%
that I might be a
little hesitant.

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:45.150 align:middle line:10%
There are times that, like
right now, if I were to die,

00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:47.764 align:middle line:10%
I'd have some regrets--
things I hadn't gone for,

00:31:47.764 --> 00:31:48.680 align:middle line:10%
things I haven't done.

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:50.555 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Things you
haven't accomplished yet.

00:31:50.555 --> 00:31:52.660 align:middle line:10%
>>CHAMPLAIN: So the
more I share my story,

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:56.400 align:middle line:10%
the more I talk to people, the
more courage I have in my life,

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:57.630 align:middle line:10%
the more results I have.

00:31:57.630 --> 00:32:00.210 align:middle line:10%
So I want a little bit
more time on this lifetime

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:01.520 align:middle line:10%
to do more things--

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:02.449 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Super.

00:32:02.449 --> 00:32:03.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CHAMPLAIN: --and do all that.

00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:05.060 align:middle line:84%
