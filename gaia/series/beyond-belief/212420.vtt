00:00:18.022 --> 00:00:19.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to Beyond Belief.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.180 align:middle line:10%
Matthew LaCroix is back with us,
writer, researcher, and author

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.660 align:middle line:10%
who specializes in ancient
history, especially

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.340 align:middle line:10%
ancient civilizations.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And he is here to tell us
some exciting new discoveries.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.680 align:middle line:90%
What do you got for us Matt?

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MATTHEW LACROIX: Hey, George.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.702 align:middle line:84%
It's great to be
back talking to you.

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:38.740 align:middle line:10%
We have something big today,
something that I think

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.240 align:middle line:10%
is going to change
our understanding

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.560 align:middle line:10%
of ancient history, the
origins of who we are,

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.710 align:middle line:10%
and even the divinity
of prereligion itself.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:46.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fire away.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.310 align:middle line:90%
I can't wait.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.210 align:middle line:10%
>>LACROIX: Well,
earlier in this year,

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.790 align:middle line:10%
I was doing ancient
connection research trying

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.850 align:middle line:10%
to link South America
through Peru and Bolivia

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.340 align:middle line:10%
with the Mediterranean
civilizations,

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.930 align:middle line:10%
like Baalbek, Lebanon and
pre-Greek civilizations.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And I came across a series
of discoveries that were just

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.840 align:middle line:84%
being excavated in an area of
Eastern Turkey called Lake Van.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.853 align:middle line:84%
Some of these were
so new, George,

00:01:09.853 --> 00:01:11.770 align:middle line:84%
that some of the underwater
megaliths and some

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.080 align:middle line:84%
of the other discoveries
inland just around the lake

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.480 align:middle line:90%
were as new as 2017.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.890 align:middle line:90%
So this is cutting-edge stuff.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:18.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My gosh.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:19.780 align:middle line:90%
How did you find this?

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well, I was trying
to trace the ancient origins

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.470 align:middle line:84%
of the Sumerian connections with
the biblical version of Noah,

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.770 align:middle line:84%
these descendants from
an ancient Sumerian line

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.050 align:middle line:84%
that disappeared from
history through a series

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.880 align:middle line:90%
of catastrophes that occurred.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And while tracing
that, I found evidence

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.280 align:middle line:84%
of this incredible
megalithic style of building

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.190 align:middle line:84%
that was emerging from some of
these sites around Lake Van.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And in those sites were
ancient king's lists, George,

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.270 align:middle line:90%
written in cuneiform.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.680 align:middle line:84%
In those king's
lists, it discusses

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.310 align:middle line:84%
how it was ruled by a king
named King Hayk, who was

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.650 align:middle line:90%
a direct descendant of Japheth.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.150 align:middle line:84%
Doing a little
search of Japheth,

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.570 align:middle line:84%
you find it literally is a
descendant of the Noah figure.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:03.410 align:middle line:90%
When--

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The flood Noah figure?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Exactly, but not
from the Christian text.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.910 align:middle line:84%
From the angle that I look at,
from ancient civilizations,

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.010 align:middle line:84%
you find out that the
Noah figure was actually

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.800 align:middle line:84%
based on an ancient
Sumerian king

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.190 align:middle line:84%
and actually, George, the
very last Sumerian king

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.970 align:middle line:84%
before that entire region
was destroyed by a deluge.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
more about Shuruppak

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.270 align:middle line:90%
and how important is that.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: So Shuruppak
is this incredible place

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.290 align:middle line:90%
that's located in Iraq.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And the reason it's
so important is

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.330 align:middle line:84%
that when we look at
this enormous amount

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.580 align:middle line:84%
of different tablets,
cuneiform tablets we have

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.930 align:middle line:84%
from that region, especially
from the Royal Ashurbanipal

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.380 align:middle line:84%
Library that was found by
Austen Henry Layard in 1849,

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.973 align:middle line:84%
they found over 30,000
cuneiform tablets.

00:02:47.973 --> 00:02:48.890 align:middle line:90%
And in those stories--

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 30,000?

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: 30,000.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And it contains stories
that seem to be from a time

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.920 align:middle line:84%
so far, so long ago that
it was considered nothing

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.840 align:middle line:90%
more than a myth and a legend.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.790 align:middle line:84%
But in those stories,
George, there

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.310 align:middle line:84%
were five original
cities that were created.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And the last of those
cities was called Shuruppak.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And it was ruled lastly
by the Sumerian king,

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.820 align:middle line:84%
the last Sumerian
king, who became

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.260 align:middle line:90%
the figure known as Noah.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.750 align:middle line:84%
But the story we know
of in the Christian text

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.300 align:middle line:84%
was very different coming
out of the cuneiform

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.732 align:middle line:90%
tablets that discussed him.

00:03:21.732 --> 00:03:23.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where do you
think the flood occurred?

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: When we look
back into these layers that

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.030 align:middle line:90%
we're finding--

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.960 align:middle line:84%
and so if anybody wants to know
what the name of that city was,

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.750 align:middle line:84%
it was called Fara
today, F-A-R-A.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.660 align:middle line:84%
But what they did is
they went back in 1931.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.210 align:middle line:84%
They found the
remnants of Shuruppak.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And what they found,
though, it was

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.110 align:middle line:84%
separated by three distinct
layers of civilizations

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.430 align:middle line:90%
that had existed there.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And they found evidence
of 17 feet, George,

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.930 align:middle line:84%
17 feet that they called an
inundation layer, a flood

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.020 align:middle line:90%
layer.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.860 align:middle line:84%
But what's so
amazing about that,

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.800 align:middle line:84%
though, was that
the most advanced

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.620 align:middle line:84%
of those civilizations,
the three,

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.780 align:middle line:84%
by far the most advanced
and sophisticated

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.350 align:middle line:84%
was on the lowermost level
below the flood layer.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And the most primitive
was on the top,

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.000 align:middle line:84%
completely backwards
that history tells us.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there any
evidence for the Ark?

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.725 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: That was
one of these things

00:04:15.725 --> 00:04:18.120 align:middle line:84%
that I was trying to understand
because in the tablets,

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.370 align:middle line:84%
such as the Atra-Hasis
or Epic of Gilgamesh,

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.950 align:middle line:84%
you find out that there was
a catastrophe that was either

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.860 align:middle line:84%
allowed or even created by
these ancient and Anunna

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.000 align:middle line:90%
gods of Sumer.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.130 align:middle line:90%
They wanted to wipe out mankind.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.285 align:middle line:90%
And the story goes--

00:04:30.285 --> 00:04:31.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As the Bible says.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.452 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Right, and this
ancient Sumerian king,

00:04:33.452 --> 00:04:37.410 align:middle line:84%
the last king, known as
Utnapishtim or Ziusudra

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.550 align:middle line:90%
was his original Sumerian name.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.970 align:middle line:84%
He was a direct
descendant of Enki,

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.910 align:middle line:84%
one of these ancient
royal Anunna gods.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The late Zecharia
Sitchin's work right there.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.535 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Yeah,
and it discussed

00:04:48.535 --> 00:04:51.060 align:middle line:84%
how he was warned that there
was a coming catastrophe.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.150 align:middle line:84%
And that if he didn't
preserve the seed of mankind,

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.070 align:middle line:84%
is what they call it, through
the bloodlines of his sons,

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.620 align:middle line:84%
his wife, and to
survive basically,

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.890 align:middle line:84%
that mankind might never be
here today, to this point.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think this
flood of Noah actually was?

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well, as I've
gone through and looked

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.100 align:middle line:84%
over evidence to understand
this discovery, which we haven't

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.370 align:middle line:84%
even really talked
fully about yet,

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.570 align:middle line:84%
was that I found evidence of
not one flood but two floods.

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:17.860 align:middle line:90%
So we talked so much--

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In what time period?

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: So we talked so much
about the Younger Dryas time

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.890 align:middle line:84%
period, which is around
12,000 years ago.

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.570 align:middle line:84%
This time period
when we had an Ice

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.210 align:middle line:84%
Age on Earth and
during the interval,

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.640 align:middle line:84%
the interglacial period
when the ice was melting

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.890 align:middle line:84%
and then we got into the
Holocene that we're in now,

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.170 align:middle line:84%
we had catastrophes
around the Earth

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.320 align:middle line:84%
to the level that actually
looks like it wiped out

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.360 align:middle line:90%
a lot of these civilizations.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.870 align:middle line:84%
But what we're finding is that
the actual flood and deluge

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.830 align:middle line:84%
that buried Shuruppak and
was the actual flood of Noah

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.850 align:middle line:84%
was not the Younger Dryas but
another entire flood before it.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And what we're
looking at, George,

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.530 align:middle line:84%
is something more than
20,000 years ago, I believe.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who told
Noah to build the Ark?

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.560 align:middle line:90%
God?

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: He was told to build
the Ark through his patron

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:03.340 align:middle line:90%
god, Enki.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, Enki was one of two primary
gods in the ancient Sumerian

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.200 align:middle line:90%
lineage.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wasn't he an Anunnaki?

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: He's one of these
Anunna, Anunnaki figures.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And his brother
Enlil and him, Enki,

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.550 align:middle line:84%
duly ruled over the entire
region of ancient Sumer.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And they were patron gods
of that civilization.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And Enlil was the one that
came and brought the council

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.140 align:middle line:84%
together, the Council of
12, to allow a catastrophe

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.750 align:middle line:84%
to occur to essentially
wipe out humanity.

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And he secretly warned through
a reedbed to not directly tell

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.090 align:middle line:84%
him, almost like through a
dream-like reedbed state that

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.810 align:middle line:84%
had to build this type of
massive, massive cedar craft,

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.475 align:middle line:84%
which he told him he had to
use bitumen to seal it off

00:06:46.475 --> 00:06:47.275 align:middle line:90%
completely--

00:06:47.275 --> 00:06:47.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: --because the
catastrophe was literally

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:50.290 align:middle line:90%
going to wipe out the world.

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:51.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So it could float.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Right.

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:56.388 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
weigh reality from myth?

00:06:56.388 --> 00:06:58.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well, that
was one of the things

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.880 align:middle line:84%
that I had difficulties
with because I'm not

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.740 align:middle line:90%
a strong Christian by any means.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm more of just a spiritual
guy that just studies evidence.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.980 align:middle line:84%
But I couldn't ignore
the idea that there

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.050 align:middle line:84%
was ancient Hebrew and
Christian connections

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:12.670 align:middle line:90%
to the bloodlines of Noah.

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.660 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't ignore that idea.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And so when I was
in here looking,

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:19.450 align:middle line:84%
at these sites around
Lake Van and seeing

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:23.530 align:middle line:84%
the incredible sophistication,
polygonal and 90-degree angle

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.700 align:middle line:84%
that seems to have
spread around the world,

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.360 align:middle line:84%
I found that there seemed
to be an origin point,

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.870 align:middle line:84%
an origin point back to
the ancient Sumerian kings,

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:35.290 align:middle line:84%
the last Sumerian
king known as Noah.

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:37.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So I never knew
Noah was a Sumerian king.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:38.795 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: That's
the part that I

00:07:38.795 --> 00:07:40.948 align:middle line:84%
think would change our
understanding of history

00:07:40.948 --> 00:07:43.240 align:middle line:84%
is that it's not only that
he was just a Sumerian king,

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.370 align:middle line:84%
but he was the very
last Sumerian king

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:47.080 align:middle line:84%
before the ancient
world was destroyed,

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:51.370 align:middle line:84%
meaning that he had the
seed, this royal seed,

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:54.470 align:middle line:84%
of basically this bloodline
genetic seed of mankind.

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:55.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:58.420 align:middle line:90%
1931, Shuruppak was discovered.

00:07:58.420 --> 00:07:59.920 align:middle line:90%
How was it found?

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: So they go into
this area called Fara today.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And they had theories
that that was

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.540 align:middle line:84%
the location where Shuruppak
was, but they didn't know.

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.090 align:middle line:84%
So they bring in this
huge team in 1931.

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And they actually had a
sandstorm so significant

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:15.755 align:middle line:84%
that it buried the entire
camp for three days.

00:08:15.755 --> 00:08:17.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a
lot of sand, Matthew.

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:19.755 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: And they almost
had to cancel the whole thing.

00:08:19.755 --> 00:08:22.240 align:middle line:84%
So as they bury, they dig
themselves out of the sand,

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:22.480 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.120 align:middle line:84%
After three days, they ended
up getting some nice weather

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.020 align:middle line:90%
after that.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And they started
digging down, George.

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And they called the
three different distinct

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:34.120 align:middle line:84%
civilizations Stratum I,
Stratum II, and Stratum III.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.440 align:middle line:84%
The first two civilizations
were quite primitive,

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.500 align:middle line:84%
and they were located within
the first 15 feet of soil.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.539 align:middle line:84%
But then as I said, they
got down to 17 feet,

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:45.500 align:middle line:84%
and they hit that flood layer
that went 20 feet down, George.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.270 align:middle line:84%
When they actually
found the bottom

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:50.930 align:middle line:84%
where ancient Shuruppak was
with all the advanced pottery

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:56.055 align:middle line:84%
and cuneiform tablets and all
these things, it was 35 feet.

00:08:56.055 --> 00:08:56.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:58.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: That's about
as tall as the ceiling

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.330 align:middle line:90%
we're in right now.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.930 align:middle line:84%
35 feet down they found the
ancient city of Shuruppak

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:05.937 align:middle line:84%
with 17 feet of mud from
a flood sitting on top.

00:09:05.937 --> 00:09:07.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Totally
buried and submerged.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Totally buried,
lost to the ancient history

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:09.470 align:middle line:90%
from the world.

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got
some incredible photos.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:15.920 align:middle line:84%
I want you to explain what they
are from the Shuruppak area.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.160 align:middle line:90%
What are we looking at here?

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: So these are actual
photos from the site, George.

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:21.380 align:middle line:10%
What you're looking
at the top is

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:24.050 align:middle line:10%
when they first discovered what
they believed was Shuruppak.

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:25.520 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And that's
the excavation?

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: That's
the excavation,

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:28.520 align:middle line:84%
but they had only gone
down a couple of feet.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And they were finding
more primitive type

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:33.770 align:middle line:84%
of tools and evidence
of the sophistication

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:34.820 align:middle line:90%
of a civilization.

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:36.260 align:middle line:84%
But that's important
to understand

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.900 align:middle line:84%
because our model
of history tells us

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:42.690 align:middle line:84%
that it's a linear progression
of civilization over time.

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:44.570 align:middle line:84%
So if the most
primitive is at the top

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:47.790 align:middle line:84%
and the most advanced is at the
bottom, something's wrong here.

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:49.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are those people
down there at the bottom?

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:49.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: They are.

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:51.313 align:middle line:84%
And what's amazing
about that picture,

00:09:51.313 --> 00:09:54.230 align:middle line:84%
again, that's an actual
picture from 1931

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.120 align:middle line:90%
of the excavations of Shuruppak.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, where those
people are, George,

00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:59.990 align:middle line:84%
at the very bottom of
that lower picture,

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:03.800 align:middle line:84%
that's the very, very top of
where the flood layer started.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.340 align:middle line:84%
They had to go down 17
more feet to get down

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.830 align:middle line:84%
to where they found the evidence
of the original Sumerian

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:11.710 align:middle line:90%
civilization.

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:12.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unbelievable.

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:14.982 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Showing that
the whole thing was true.

00:10:14.982 --> 00:10:16.048 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't just a myth.

00:10:16.048 --> 00:10:18.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does that tell
you about the Bible, Matt?

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:20.673 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: It tells me that
when we look at information,

00:10:20.673 --> 00:10:23.830 align:middle line:84%
regardless of where it is, we
shouldn't put all of our eggs

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:25.420 align:middle line:90%
in one basket no matter what.

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:27.610 align:middle line:84%
We should take bits and
pieces when they make sense

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:28.960 align:middle line:90%
from a lot of areas.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.940 align:middle line:84%
Because in the end,
it looks like there

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:33.580 align:middle line:84%
are aspects of truth woven
into a lot of different things

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:34.660 align:middle line:90%
throughout history.

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:38.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They say the Ark
came to rest at Mount Ararat.

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:40.040 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
happened to it?

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:40.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: That was
one of the things that

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:41.680 align:middle line:90%
got me so interested.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:42.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it still
may be up there.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well, that was
one of the things that got me

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:46.990 align:middle line:84%
so interested because we had
been stuck there for a long

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:49.180 align:middle line:84%
time because the
cuneiform tablets,

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:53.740 align:middle line:84%
specifically the Atra-Hasis, an
ancient Sumerian and Babylonian

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:55.420 align:middle line:90%
set of tablets--

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:58.600 align:middle line:84%
the tablets fracture off when
they land on Mount Ararat.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:03.750 align:middle line:84%
Enlil descends down furious that
mankind has survived the flood.

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And he basically talks directly
to the Noah figure asking him

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.130 align:middle line:90%
how he survived.

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And then Enki descends down
and tells him he warned him

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.190 align:middle line:84%
and that he's to preserve
the seed of mankind.

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:16.590 align:middle line:84%
And, George, the
tablets end there.

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:18.540 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
happened since then,

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:21.630 align:middle line:84%
until these discoveries
around Lake Van

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:23.760 align:middle line:84%
have changed our
complete understanding

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.860 align:middle line:84%
of this connection
between the biblical Noah

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.860 align:middle line:84%
and the ancient, ancient golden
age megalithic civilizations

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:29.885 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:11:29.885 --> 00:11:32.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what happens
to Noah after the flood?

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:34.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well, Noah
is given immortality.

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And supposedly,
he's the last human

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:40.410 align:middle line:84%
to ever be given
immortality ever again.

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And what's fascinating is
that the story of Gilgamesh,

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:47.850 align:middle line:84%
Gilgamesh actually goes to
seek out the flood hero, Noah,

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:51.360 align:middle line:84%
to find out how he found
the secrets of immortality.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who told him?

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.290 align:middle line:90%
Who told him?

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:54.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: He ends up-- and
that's a whole other story.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.360 align:middle line:84%
But he ends up finding out
that no mortal can ever

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.870 align:middle line:84%
seek immortality ever again
despite how hard he tries.

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:04.300 align:middle line:84%
He goes back empty handed
realizing he can never

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:05.140 align:middle line:90%
obtain immortality.

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:06.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was it god given?

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.613 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Well, he's a demigod.

00:12:07.613 --> 00:12:10.930 align:middle line:84%
So he's still mixed half
with these Anunna gods.

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:13.422 align:middle line:84%
That's why he lives hundreds
of years, and he's a giant.

00:12:13.422 --> 00:12:15.130 align:middle line:84%
So he's shown--
remember, you've probably

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:17.920 align:middle line:84%
seen depictions of Gilgamesh
with a full-grown lion

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.470 align:middle line:84%
that looks like a house
cat with a mane, right?

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:21.640 align:middle line:90%
Because they're demigods.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.160 align:middle line:84%
But demigods are
still half mortal.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
the fallen ones?

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.392 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: I think
they're directly related

00:12:27.392 --> 00:12:29.050 align:middle line:84%
to that aspect in
that story of how

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:31.433 align:middle line:84%
we have these divine
connections to something higher.

00:12:31.433 --> 00:12:32.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Nephilim.

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:35.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Which is why Enlil
in the story of Atra-Hasis

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:38.140 align:middle line:84%
decided to destroy
mankind because he

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:41.830 align:middle line:84%
believed that they were
abominations of the gods, us.

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:44.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the
significance of Lake Van?

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Lake Van is one of
these incredibly high-elevation

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:49.840 align:middle line:84%
lakes that is very,
very deep and ancient.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And we find direct correlations
with something like Lake

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.550 align:middle line:90%
Titicaca down in South America.

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:57.935 align:middle line:84%
Lake Van is over 1,500
feet deep, George.

00:12:57.935 --> 00:12:58.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:01.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: And it's surrounded
by ancient volcanoes.

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:03.700 align:middle line:84%
So there's an ancient
land where there seemed

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.140 align:middle line:90%
to be something lowered there.

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.270 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, for
those wondering,

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:10.390 align:middle line:84%
Lake Van is 55 miles
from Mount Ararat.

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:14.110 align:middle line:84%
So the story links up just
like the biblical connections

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:17.860 align:middle line:84%
of something happening, someone
landing, and the brothers

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:20.650 align:middle line:84%
basically going to
this region of Lake Van

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:24.280 align:middle line:84%
and creating a completely
new iteration and epic

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.977 align:middle line:84%
of our civilization that
has never existed before.

00:13:26.977 --> 00:13:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And I don't believe
it's ever existed since.

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:31.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you see natural
discoveries like this,

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:34.540 align:middle line:84%
like Lake Van,
Mount Ararat, that

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.510 align:middle line:84%
echo what was in the Bible,
what does that tell you

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:38.440 align:middle line:90%
about the Bible?

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.648 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: It tells me that
we should still take bits

00:13:40.648 --> 00:13:42.845 align:middle line:90%
and pieces of it for truth but--

00:13:42.845 --> 00:13:43.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why not all of it?

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:46.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well,
because a lot of aspects

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:50.390 align:middle line:84%
of stories that are-- the
more old the story is,

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:52.510 align:middle line:84%
the more potential it
has to be tampered.

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:54.250 align:middle line:84%
So we have to be very
careful to go back

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:56.770 align:middle line:84%
to the original sources of
stories if we can find them.

00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:57.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:00.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: And that's why for
my opinion, as a researcher who

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:03.220 align:middle line:84%
studied this, and for
anything that's out

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.890 align:middle line:84%
there that exists for
something to learn about

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:09.370 align:middle line:84%
is that we should never
put all of our emphasis

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:11.080 align:middle line:84%
on learning about
something in one place.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.970 align:middle line:84%
We should be open
minded to taking things

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:15.190 align:middle line:84%
from a lot of variety
of different areas

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:17.860 align:middle line:84%
but be very objective
and not just take

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:19.877 align:middle line:90%
anything for face value.

00:14:19.877 --> 00:14:21.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When we
started this program,

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:24.600 align:middle line:84%
we talked about a
major discovery.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And you've hinted to us
that it has to do with Noah.

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Right.

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:31.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's the bottom line?

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:35.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: So the bottom line
is what my evidence, I believe,

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:38.560 align:middle line:84%
has shown is that the
descendants of Noah

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:43.420 align:middle line:84%
created a previously unknown
civilization around Lake

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:46.090 align:middle line:84%
Van that may be the
origins of religion,

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:48.130 align:middle line:84%
the origins of
megalithic building,

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:50.950 align:middle line:84%
and the origins of all of
these incredible civilizations

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:54.160 align:middle line:84%
around the world that were
such a mystery for so long

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.770 align:middle line:84%
before on what that
origin point was.

00:14:56.770 --> 00:14:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And, George, I
wanted to give them

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:02.590 align:middle line:84%
the name that I felt best
respected their ancient history

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:03.460 align:middle line:90%
and their beliefs.

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And so they didn't call
themselves anything.

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:08.300 align:middle line:84%
They left no writings
calling themselves anything.

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:11.020 align:middle line:84%
So I'm calling it the
lost Ararat civilization

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:12.340 align:middle line:90%
of Lake Van.

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How does this tie
into Sumeria, the Anunnaki,

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:21.000 align:middle line:90%
and extraterrestrials?

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: So what looks
like happened here is that

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.080 align:middle line:84%
the original Sumerian
civilization with these five

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.090 align:middle line:84%
prediluvian,
antediluvian cities,

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:31.640 align:middle line:84%
that Noah was the last
king of the last--

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.860 align:middle line:84%
of that city Shuruppak
that we mentioned.

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:36.650 align:middle line:84%
When they landed on
this Mount Ararat area

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:38.360 align:middle line:84%
after the disasters,
there seemed

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:42.440 align:middle line:84%
to be an agreement made going
forward where, remember,

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.120 align:middle line:84%
instead of mankind
being destroyed

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:48.080 align:middle line:84%
and the seed of mankind being
lost, because Noah and his sons

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.600 align:middle line:84%
had survived and they had
preserved the seed of mankind--

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:55.520 align:middle line:84%
and it also mentions because
they were still showing respect

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:56.580 align:middle line:90%
to their patron gods.

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:57.830 align:middle line:90%
It mentions that, by the way--

00:15:57.830 --> 00:15:58.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Big time.

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:02.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: --that they were
given a complete another chance

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:04.700 align:middle line:90%
and another entire iteration.

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:06.890 align:middle line:84%
And golden age was
lowered into humanity

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:10.370 align:middle line:84%
to do something, George,
that's never existed before.

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Imagine a path
humanity could take

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:15.570 align:middle line:84%
that's not materialistic
or based on technology

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:18.030 align:middle line:84%
but based on harnessing
the power of the universe--

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:19.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a first.

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:21.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: --through stars,
law of correspondence, energy,

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:24.660 align:middle line:84%
vibration, telekinesis,
levitation.

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:27.900 align:middle line:84%
These civilizations
mastered all of reality.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:29.370 align:middle line:90%
And they seemed to--

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:32.490 align:middle line:84%
they left behind clues,
clues so that how

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:34.920 align:middle line:84%
we can follow behind
and learn what

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:37.140 align:middle line:84%
they knew that we've
forgotten long ago.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us
about these symbols

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:40.125 align:middle line:90%
and artifacts found out there.

00:16:40.125 --> 00:16:42.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: One of the
most fascinating things

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.850 align:middle line:84%
that honestly blew my
mind besides the fact

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:47.850 align:middle line:84%
that we find the origins of
polygonal megalithic building

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:49.590 align:middle line:84%
and the 90-degree
angles, like we

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:52.710 align:middle line:84%
see in the Osirion
throughout ancient Egypt,

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:57.480 align:middle line:84%
we found these symbols, George,
symbols that fundamentally

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.720 align:middle line:84%
change our entire
understanding of prereligion

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:04.060 align:middle line:84%
and the origins of what
I call ascension temples.

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:07.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a term that's
obviously been used before.

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:10.079 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's something that
maybe needs to be used again

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:12.180 align:middle line:84%
because the purpose
of this temple

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:14.220 align:middle line:90%
seems to be for human ascension.

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:16.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're talking about
the cradle of civilization.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:19.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: It seems to be
something else was lowered here

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:21.180 align:middle line:84%
that's never been
lowered before,

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:23.579 align:middle line:84%
the knowledge of
divinity itself,

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:26.250 align:middle line:84%
how to achieve the
highest state we can

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:28.025 align:middle line:90%
to become gods of the universe.

00:17:28.025 --> 00:17:29.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have
another picture.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.900 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at that and
explain what we're looking at,

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.690 align:middle line:90%
Matt.

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:36.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: So this
is Ayanis itself.

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:37.170 align:middle line:90%
This is the temple.

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:38.418 align:middle line:90%
It's called Haldi Temple.

00:17:38.418 --> 00:17:39.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It looks
like a sarcophagus.

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: It's actually
a mysterious room

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.400 align:middle line:84%
because, as the
archaeologists have stated,

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.850 align:middle line:84%
there are no windows
and no doors.

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:49.950 align:middle line:84%
This seemed to be
a closed room that

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:53.790 align:middle line:84%
was only accessible by the
most high level of royalty

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:55.380 align:middle line:90%
and most high priesthood.

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:57.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, George, what
do you think might

00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:00.970 align:middle line:84%
be in the center of that
giant box there in the middle?

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:02.512 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something dramatic.

00:18:02.512 --> 00:18:04.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well, that's the
thing that we don't know.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.150 align:middle line:84%
That stone box in
the center seems

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:09.370 align:middle line:84%
to be an altar, but
something's inside

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:10.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Noah's body?

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:12.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Those wood
fragments outside that box,

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.838 align:middle line:84%
some have speculated that
it could even be part--

00:18:14.838 --> 00:18:15.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Part of the Ark.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.005 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Part of the Ark.

00:18:17.005 --> 00:18:18.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That could be.

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:19.990 align:middle line:84%
Now these various
symbols that we're

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:23.670 align:middle line:84%
looking at, birds,
animals, what are they?

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:26.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: I'm going to go ahead
and encode those all for you.

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:29.400 align:middle line:84%
I spent a significant amount
of time studying this temple.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.230 align:middle line:84%
I've been studying
this temple for months,

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:32.850 align:middle line:90%
going over every single symbol.

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to break
that down for you.

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I have a whole layout
of basically analyzing

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:39.150 align:middle line:90%
these symbols.

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think we have that
image coming up, right?

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's take a look.

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:43.505 align:middle line:10%
>>LACROIX: All right.

00:18:43.505 --> 00:18:46.080 align:middle line:10%
So, George, this helps
people encapsulate

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:48.870 align:middle line:10%
I guess the totality and
how significant I feel

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:50.370 align:middle line:10%
like these discoveries are.

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:52.860 align:middle line:10%
Now, when I found
or was-- stumbled

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:55.530 align:middle line:10%
upon this civilization,
this unknown civilization,

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:57.870 align:middle line:10%
it was because I was studying
the ancient pre-Greek

00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:58.170 align:middle line:10%
civilization.

00:18:58.170 --> 00:18:59.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
circle those pictures?

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:00.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: I did.

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:03.120 align:middle line:84%
So I put all these
names in here to try

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.310 align:middle line:84%
to help people understand
what these symbols mean.

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And that symbol-- and I want
to start on the top left--

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:09.330 align:middle line:90%
because that's a griffin.

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's important because
a griffin is a combination

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:13.620 align:middle line:90%
of the lion and the eagle.

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:16.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, the lion and the eagle are
the most important two symbols

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:19.530 align:middle line:84%
in ancient Sumer as
well as in Greece.

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:22.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, the combination of
the lion and the eagle

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:23.710 align:middle line:90%
creates a griffin.

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is that it's a
protector, George, a guardian.

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:27.550 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:28.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.782 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Now,
continue on a second,

00:19:29.782 --> 00:19:31.352 align:middle line:84%
you see the hourglass
symbol there.

00:19:31.352 --> 00:19:33.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the
significance of that, time?

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: That's for time.

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And then you see the image
of the depiction of the sun

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:40.310 align:middle line:84%
as well as what I believe
there in the center, George,

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:42.855 align:middle line:84%
is the very first depiction
of the cross on Earth.

00:19:42.855 --> 00:19:44.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it
looks like Popeye

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:45.970 align:middle line:90%
underneath the hourglass.

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:47.680 align:middle line:10%
>>LACROIX: That
symbol underneath here

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:49.400 align:middle line:10%
is called god Haldi, George.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:52.510 align:middle line:10%
And if you look at the
depictions of God Haldi,

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:55.210 align:middle line:10%
you find it's nearly
identical to Enlil.

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:57.280 align:middle line:90%
So that is Enlil from Sumer.

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
the wings he has.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, what may look
different to you

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:02.170 align:middle line:84%
is that he's wearing
a different hat

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:05.920 align:middle line:84%
than he wore in Sumer because
the hat represents mentality.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, he's
wearing a magi hat.

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:11.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what is Enlil's
relationship to Noah?

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:13.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: In this case,
he gave Noah complete--

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:15.520 align:middle line:84%
he gave Noah
immortality and allowed

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:19.520 align:middle line:84%
his sons to create an entirely
new golden age in humanity.

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's why he's shown
with the magi hat passing

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:24.280 align:middle line:90%
basically divine knowledge.

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And he's shown at the top of
the crosses protecting the path

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:28.960 align:middle line:90%
of divinity, essentially.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:31.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what's the
significance of the Sun?

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:33.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Now, the Sun
is shown in two ways.

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:35.200 align:middle line:10%
One, the Sun is
shown in this case

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.760 align:middle line:10%
because the Sun is
often associated

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.170 align:middle line:10%
with the most high god.

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:39.790 align:middle line:10%
The Sun has often
been associated

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:42.940 align:middle line:10%
with this direct lineage to
the most high god or creator

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:43.990 align:middle line:10%
of the universe.

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:45.970 align:middle line:84%
But the Sun is
also shown, George,

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:49.630 align:middle line:84%
on top of the hourglass in
the top right, which I believe

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:51.730 align:middle line:84%
indicates with the
griffin that they're

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:54.610 align:middle line:84%
trying to show that the
Anunna are the lords

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:57.890 align:middle line:84%
and guardians of time
and ascension in mankind.

00:20:57.890 --> 00:20:58.690 align:middle line:90%
That's what I've--

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:01.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So if you could give
me an overall perspective, Matt,

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:04.480 align:middle line:84%
on what this all
means, in your opinion?

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.190 align:middle line:10%
>>LACROIX: I think
what this means is

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:10.540 align:middle line:10%
that there was a time in history
when the Anunna gods came

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:13.650 align:middle line:10%
to a different agreement
because mankind survived

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:17.530 align:middle line:10%
the first catastrophe
and because Noah

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:19.450 align:middle line:10%
and his descendants
survived and they

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:22.930 align:middle line:10%
had the bloodlines,
connections to the Anunna,

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:24.850 align:middle line:10%
seems like Enlil decided
to play a completely

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:27.670 align:middle line:10%
different role in humanity
for thousands of years.

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:29.500 align:middle line:84%
Instead of being this
wicked jealous god,

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:32.080 align:middle line:84%
he played this role
of an enlightener

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.930 align:middle line:84%
until he eventually switched
in the Old Testament

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:36.520 align:middle line:90%
to a more jealous god again.

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:38.080 align:middle line:84%
But it shows that
these Anunna seem

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:43.030 align:middle line:84%
to be playing these polaristic,
dualistic type of aspects

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:46.120 align:middle line:84%
in our reality, playing the good
and the bad cop over and over

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.620 align:middle line:90%
again, depending on the zodiac.

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And this civilization, the
lost Ararat civilization,

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:54.670 align:middle line:84%
seems to be the point in
which megalithic building

00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:56.410 align:middle line:84%
styles emerged
for the first time

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:59.170 align:middle line:84%
everywhere in the world,
highly sophisticated building.

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And the stone, like basalt
and granite, as well as

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:06.700 align:middle line:84%
the lowering of ascension
teachings for how we

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:08.260 align:middle line:90%
could reach our highest state.

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:11.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
most significant aspect

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:12.910 align:middle line:90%
of these artifacts being found?

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:16.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: I think that even
if we put aside the rocks,

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:18.130 align:middle line:84%
the rocks prove
how old they are.

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:21.907 align:middle line:84%
Because again, if you build
with basalt and andesite,

00:22:21.907 --> 00:22:24.490 align:middle line:84%
some of the hardest stone in the
world, how are you going to--

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:26.073 align:middle line:84%
what kind of tools
are you going to be

00:22:26.073 --> 00:22:27.310 align:middle line:90%
able to use to mimic that?

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:29.360 align:middle line:90%
Bronze Age tools wouldn't work.

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.840 align:middle line:84%
So that proves how
old they are, George.

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.970 align:middle line:84%
But the ancient symbols
and the depictions

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:38.170 align:middle line:84%
we find, like the Kelesi
artifact, the rock relief,

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:43.090 align:middle line:84%
and like you just saw at Ayanis,
they tell us a path of humanity

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:45.070 align:middle line:84%
through our own
divinity and ascension

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:47.290 align:middle line:84%
that we've forgotten
something that's

00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:50.530 align:middle line:84%
been corrupted and
polluted over time so

00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:53.230 align:middle line:84%
that the original message
has been largely lost

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:56.380 align:middle line:84%
and how we truly are
all gods within us,

00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:58.390 align:middle line:84%
that we don't need
to follow any savior,

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:00.940 align:middle line:84%
that if we follow the teachings
that have been handed down

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:02.710 align:middle line:84%
for how to reach
our highest state,

00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:04.840 align:middle line:84%
we can truly all
become creator gods

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:06.220 align:middle line:90%
of this Earth in the universe.

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:08.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Matt, we've got a video
of a colleague of yours Paul

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:11.950 align:middle line:84%
Wallis who discusses
his interpretation

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:13.260 align:middle line:90%
of these discoveries.

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:14.060 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:17.690 align:middle line:84%
- There is so much
going on on this box.

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:20.720 align:middle line:84%
Goodness me, we could spend a
couple of hours just discussing

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:21.800 align:middle line:90%
the symbology here.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:26.720 align:middle line:84%
But I'm fascinated by the
connection between the beings

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:29.450 align:middle line:90%
above and the beings below.

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:32.420 align:middle line:10%
And that in the
middle there, you've

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:35.210 align:middle line:10%
got the triptych door,
which you're quite right,

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:37.850 align:middle line:10%
echoes in symbology
throughout the world.

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:40.700 align:middle line:10%
You can find it in
Eastern Orthodox churches

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:44.150 align:middle line:10%
when you look at the
iconostasis at the front.

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:45.950 align:middle line:10%
It's three doorways.

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:49.430 align:middle line:10%
One of which will be
used by the priests.

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:53.180 align:middle line:84%
They also seem to
represent ziggurats.

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:56.570 align:middle line:84%
This correspondence between
what's going on in the heavens

00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:59.510 align:middle line:84%
and what's going on
below is actually

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:02.210 align:middle line:84%
represented as a
horizontal movement

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:07.070 align:middle line:84%
as well because this notion
of connecting with the higher

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:10.880 align:middle line:84%
realms and with higher
information is right there

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:17.030 align:middle line:84%
in the foreground with the
offering of the pine cone,

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:20.860 align:middle line:84%
which is a representation
of the offer of that wisdom

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:23.710 align:middle line:90%
at this level, to you and me.

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:27.880 align:middle line:10%
So it's almost like a
story of our relationship

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:33.340 align:middle line:10%
with the cosmos all summarized
in the symbols on that box.

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:34.280 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:36.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Matt, how
old is that block?

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:40.895 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: That box was
actually found, George, in 1964.

00:24:40.895 --> 00:24:42.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But how old is it?

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:42.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: A long time.

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:44.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, that box is
over 20,000 years old.

00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:46.172 align:middle line:84%
But that box, I want
to just tell you

00:24:46.172 --> 00:24:47.172 align:middle line:90%
a little story about it.

00:24:47.172 --> 00:24:48.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The
carvings are amazing.

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:50.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: I consider it in
the future to be studied.

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:52.267 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the most
important artifacts

00:24:52.267 --> 00:24:54.260 align:middle line:84%
in human history
because of the teachings

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.610 align:middle line:84%
that are embedded in
that basalt, giant--

00:24:56.610 --> 00:24:58.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you sure that's
not the Ark of the Covenant?

00:24:58.340 --> 00:24:59.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well,
that thing is it

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:01.580 align:middle line:84%
looks like it was carried
just like the Ark was too.

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:01.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:03.415 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: And I have
a theory, George,

00:25:03.415 --> 00:25:05.810 align:middle line:84%
that because it contains
different iconography in it

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:08.720 align:middle line:84%
than Ayanis does, but similar,
that that maybe that was

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.850 align:middle line:84%
an ascension teaching
that was carried

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:12.770 align:middle line:84%
between different
sites around the world

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:16.850 align:middle line:84%
because it was found buried
and deliberately hidden

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:18.710 align:middle line:90%
near Kef Kalesi of the temple.

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:20.792 align:middle line:84%
And the temple is in
complete ruins, in shambles.

00:25:20.792 --> 00:25:22.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's
underwater wasn't it?

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:23.875 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: From an
ancient catastrophe.

00:25:23.875 --> 00:25:25.758 align:middle line:84%
Well, some of the ruins
are under Lake Van

00:25:25.758 --> 00:25:27.800 align:middle line:84%
showing that the water
levels were very different

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:29.300 align:middle line:90%
when that was originally built.

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:31.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think of Paul's analysis?

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:34.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Paul is I think dead
on with that, that that box

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:37.560 align:middle line:84%
relief-- which by the way
is 3 feet by 3 feet by 4.

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:40.245 align:middle line:84%
It's quite large--
that may be one

00:25:40.245 --> 00:25:42.870 align:middle line:84%
of the most important artifacts
in the future for understanding

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:46.980 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient past and what
they lowered down long ago.

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:51.900 align:middle line:84%
But that relief found in
1964 sat in the Museum of Van

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:54.750 align:middle line:84%
outside in the
garden for 30 years.

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:57.000 align:middle line:84%
That shows their interest
and importance in it.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.530 align:middle line:90%
And nobody had ever heard of it.

00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:00.850 align:middle line:84%
And I stumbled upon it
during these discoveries.

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:03.622 align:middle line:84%
And it's sitting in a museum
right now in Ankara, Turkey,

00:26:03.622 --> 00:26:05.580 align:middle line:84%
and very few people have
ever even heard of it.

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:06.538 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why you, Matt?

00:26:06.538 --> 00:26:08.370 align:middle line:90%
Why were you able to find this?

00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:10.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: I think it might
be my obsession with studying

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.900 align:middle line:84%
the ancient Sumerian
and connections

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:14.730 align:middle line:84%
with the Noah
figure in Shuruppak.

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:16.877 align:middle line:90%
And it really is an obsession.

00:26:16.877 --> 00:26:18.585 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
keeps me up at night.

00:26:18.585 --> 00:26:21.120 align:middle line:84%
I'll wake up at 4:00 in the
morning trying to figure out

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.620 align:middle line:90%
the different Stratum layers.

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:24.795 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It hits you, right?

00:26:24.795 --> 00:26:25.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: It's my mission.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.400 align:middle line:84%
It's what I'm
supposed to be doing.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.780 align:middle line:90%
And so I love it.

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:31.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me more about
this underwater temple.

00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:33.933 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: So this is one of the
things that got my attention.

00:26:33.933 --> 00:26:36.900 align:middle line:84%
So in 2017, they discovered
the most significant

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:40.620 align:middle line:84%
underwater megalithic ruins
in the world under Lake Van

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:44.010 align:middle line:84%
because you can't see
megalithic blocks anywhere else.

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:45.630 align:middle line:90%
Usually, it's a ruined state.

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:48.210 align:middle line:84%
Or in some cases, like
off of Alexandria, Egypt,

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:50.700 align:middle line:84%
it's part of a totally different
time period of history.

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:54.400 align:middle line:84%
But these megalithic blocks
that are under Lake Van, what's

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.860 align:middle line:84%
so significant about
them is that when

00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:58.900 align:middle line:84%
they had climatologists
and other experts

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:02.530 align:middle line:84%
comment after the
discovery was made in 2017,

00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:05.050 align:middle line:84%
they admitted that
it didn't make sense

00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:09.160 align:middle line:84%
because they were underwater,
over 100 feet underwater.

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:13.120 align:middle line:84%
When was that lake the lowest
that it's been in order

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.800 align:middle line:90%
to have those ruins exposed?

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:17.260 align:middle line:84%
They had to admit it was
before the last Ice Age,

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:19.580 align:middle line:90%
15,000 years ago.

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:21.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Flood of Noah.

00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:22.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: There you go.

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:25.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think created the flood?

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:26.140 align:middle line:90%
Was it a melting?

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:27.410 align:middle line:90%
Was it an asteroid that hit?

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:28.210 align:middle line:90%
What--

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:29.835 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: When I've
studied and looked

00:27:29.835 --> 00:27:32.620 align:middle line:84%
at these disasters and
these catastrophes on Earth,

00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:34.510 align:middle line:90%
they seem to have correlations.

00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:37.690 align:middle line:84%
The correlations seem
to come with what

00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:40.630 align:middle line:84%
looks like a massive pole
shift or a disruption

00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:42.820 align:middle line:84%
in the magnetic sphere
of the Earth leading

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:45.940 align:middle line:84%
to these enormous
tsunamis being created

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:48.610 align:middle line:84%
and volcanoes going off
around the world as well

00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:52.430 align:middle line:84%
as very significant climatic
disruptions as well.

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:54.610 align:middle line:90%
Now, what's causing that?

00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:57.670 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a combination
of astronomical impacts

00:27:57.670 --> 00:28:02.350 align:middle line:84%
but potentially the biggest
influencer here is the Sun.

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:05.710 align:middle line:84%
Robert Schoch just released
an amazing analysis article

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:07.870 align:middle line:84%
where he was
studying Giza and saw

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:10.105 align:middle line:84%
evidence of what looks
extensive lightning strikes.

00:28:10.105 --> 00:28:11.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, you're right.

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:14.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: You see that
all over the sites of Giza.

00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:17.200 align:middle line:84%
The only reason you would get
these massive electromagnetic

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:20.470 align:middle line:84%
storms would be from a
coronal mass ejection

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:23.330 align:middle line:84%
from the sun, which would
basically bombard the Earth

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:24.455 align:middle line:90%
with these solar particles.

00:28:24.455 --> 00:28:25.913 align:middle line:84%
And it would disrupt
the magnetic--

00:28:25.913 --> 00:28:27.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was devastating.

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:28.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Right, and
I think that that's

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:30.950 align:middle line:84%
why the ancients, like the
rongorongo texts from Easter

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:33.470 align:middle line:84%
Island, have these
bizarre figurines.

00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:37.530 align:middle line:84%
I think they're talking about
plasma discharges in the sky.

00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, of
these discoveries,

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:42.650 align:middle line:84%
was it all over the planet
or just to this region?

00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:45.723 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: It seems like there
were certainly people living

00:28:45.723 --> 00:28:46.890 align:middle line:90%
in other parts of the world.

00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And we have stories all
around the world woven down

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:53.120 align:middle line:84%
through ancestral
connections of Indigenous

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.740 align:middle line:90%
groups of a great flood.

00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:57.530 align:middle line:84%
It's in North America through
the Indigenous people.

00:28:57.530 --> 00:28:59.480 align:middle line:90%
It's in South America.

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:00.680 align:middle line:90%
It's all throughout Asia.

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:04.190 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly, they
just had those discoveries

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:05.870 align:middle line:84%
of those footprints
at the White Sands,

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:09.470 align:middle line:84%
New Mexico that using a
lot of really neat analysis

00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:13.850 align:middle line:84%
are proving that people were
in the United States 25,000

00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:16.475 align:middle line:84%
years ago, which also
gives evidence that they

00:29:16.475 --> 00:29:17.600 align:middle line:90%
would know about the flood.

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:18.683 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In North America?

00:29:18.683 --> 00:29:20.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Right, exactly.

00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:22.190 align:middle line:84%
So everything just keeps
getting older, George.

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:24.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is Lake Van
so important here, Matt?

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:27.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well, Lake Van
seems to be a place where

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:30.950 align:middle line:84%
divine knowledge was handed
down that I think led

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:34.030 align:middle line:84%
to this golden age around the
world that was then destroyed

00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:35.780 align:middle line:84%
from the catastrophes
of the Younger Dryas

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:39.920 align:middle line:84%
11,600 years ago, which is the
date that we get from Plato,

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:43.310 align:middle line:84%
and Diodorus, and the temple
priests of Sais for Atlantis

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:44.520 align:middle line:90%
being destroyed.

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:46.760 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I'm
trying to get to,

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.590 align:middle line:84%
George, is I believe
the civilizations

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:51.620 align:middle line:84%
at Lake Van even led to
the creation of something

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:53.060 align:middle line:90%
like Atlantis.

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:56.488 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did it come up with
the creation though of God?

00:29:56.488 --> 00:29:58.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well, it's
related to that story

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:03.230 align:middle line:84%
because there seems to be a plan
that was lowered here long ago,

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:08.010 align:middle line:84%
a plan for us, a plan for what
we will eventually become.

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:10.520 align:middle line:84%
And so, George, as
we're talking about this

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:12.290 align:middle line:84%
and discovering these
huge discoveries

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:16.190 align:middle line:84%
on the ancient aspect
of who we used to be

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:17.900 align:middle line:84%
and the knowledge
that was handed down,

00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:19.790 align:middle line:84%
it looks like we're
getting closer and closer

00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:20.990 align:middle line:90%
to that point.

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:24.410 align:middle line:84%
This bubbling cauldron of
truth is starting to open up.

00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's not going to
be held back any longer.

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:30.488 align:middle line:84%
These discoveries at Lake Van,
it's part of a major project

00:30:30.488 --> 00:30:32.030 align:middle line:84%
that I'll be heading
up in the future

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:33.920 align:middle line:84%
with some big,
big names, George.

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:35.690 align:middle line:84%
So there's already
people around the world

00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:40.430 align:middle line:84%
that are coming together to go
to Lake Van and change history.

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:42.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How could the
age of these civilizations

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:45.160 align:middle line:84%
change our perspective
of history?

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: The
beauty of these sites

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:50.050 align:middle line:84%
is that they built with
andesite and basalt.

00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And what's so
important about that

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:55.300 align:middle line:84%
is that we know that that proves
that they didn't fit into any

00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:58.240 align:middle line:84%
of the modern understanding
of where the Urartu

00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.230 align:middle line:90%
civilization is.

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:01.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Urartu
civilization is the one

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:04.822 align:middle line:84%
that the archaeologists in
there think built these sites.

00:31:04.822 --> 00:31:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And I want to make
that very clear.

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:07.405 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: "Think" in quotes.

00:31:07.405 --> 00:31:09.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: They think because
of mainstream doctrines.

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:12.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, for those who want
to know where the Urartu

00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:14.950 align:middle line:84%
civilization came in or Urartu,
depending on how you want

00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:17.410 align:middle line:84%
to pronounce it, they
came in somewhere around

00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:20.650 align:middle line:90%
3,500 years ago, OK?

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:21.745 align:middle line:90%
But that means that--

00:31:21.745 --> 00:31:22.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not too long back.

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:24.328 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: But that
means that they

00:31:24.328 --> 00:31:27.880 align:middle line:84%
came more than 10,000 years
later than these civilizations

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:28.840 align:middle line:90%
at Lake Van.

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:31.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are
we so off on time?

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:33.038 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well, it's
this doctrine, George.

00:31:33.038 --> 00:31:34.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are we afraid of?

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:36.163 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: It's a
doctrine of history that's

00:31:36.163 --> 00:31:38.120 align:middle line:90%
been protected for a long time.

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:42.560 align:middle line:84%
And when you have huge momentous
things that change in history

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:44.780 align:middle line:84%
where some idea
has to change, it

00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:47.250 align:middle line:84%
has enormous opposition
to finally happen.

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:50.750 align:middle line:84%
But I do think that there's
also some more nefarious aspects

00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:51.710 align:middle line:90%
of this as well.

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:53.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And what would that be?

00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:54.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well,
think this has been

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:55.550 align:middle line:90%
hidden for quite a long time.

00:31:55.550 --> 00:31:56.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: By?

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:58.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: By those
who maybe don't

00:31:58.010 --> 00:32:00.830 align:middle line:84%
want the truth of how
old we are, how far back

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:03.200 align:middle line:84%
the true nature of
our divinity goes,

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.420 align:middle line:90%
for who we truly used to be.

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:07.400 align:middle line:84%
If we realize the
potential and the gifts

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.380 align:middle line:84%
that we used to
have within us, we'd

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:11.847 align:middle line:84%
then be able to unlock
them in the future.

00:32:11.847 --> 00:32:13.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe they
don't want us to realize

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.480 align:middle line:90%
the Bible is a real story.

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:17.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: And they
don't want us to realize

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:19.600 align:middle line:90%
the truth of who we really are.

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.050 align:middle line:84%
I think if people
realize that we're not

00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:25.000 align:middle line:84%
just this primitive animal
that lives on the planet

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.840 align:middle line:84%
but we are a divine being of
the universe that is incredibly

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:30.060 align:middle line:84%
powerful but has the
dormant gifts within us,

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:32.460 align:middle line:84%
if we have the proof
of all these teachings

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:35.730 align:middle line:84%
through the symbols laid down
like a breadcrumb trail for us

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:38.580 align:middle line:84%
to follow, then what will
that mean for our future going

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:39.600 align:middle line:90%
forward?

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:41.647 align:middle line:90%
Who will we decide to become?

00:32:41.647 --> 00:32:42.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, the stonework that
we've been looking at

00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:47.160 align:middle line:84%
tells you what about the
advancement of that society

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.480 align:middle line:90%
during that time period?

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:51.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: George,
some of those symbols

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:52.860 align:middle line:84%
that were carved
in that andesite,

00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:55.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know how
that's possible with hand,

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.330 align:middle line:90%
even with hand work even today.

00:32:57.330 --> 00:32:58.790 align:middle line:90%
Was that done with lasers?

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:01.040 align:middle line:84%
Was that done with something
that we don't understand?

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:03.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Doesn't
look like a chisel.

00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:05.447 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Imagine
stone so hard that you

00:33:05.447 --> 00:33:07.530 align:middle line:84%
would have to have something
like a diamond tipped

00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:08.910 align:middle line:90%
drill to even manipulate

00:33:08.910 --> 00:33:09.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right and chop it.

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:11.227 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Right, but
then how would you

00:33:11.227 --> 00:33:13.310 align:middle line:84%
create symbols of that
kind of perfection.

00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:16.280 align:middle line:84%
Like that giant box we saw
that Paul was talking about,

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:18.310 align:middle line:90%
that's a basalt box.

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:20.150 align:middle line:84%
How did they get
all that perfection?

00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:22.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm not sure if
they could do it today.

00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:23.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: That's
what I'm saying

00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:24.640 align:middle line:84%
is that's something's
going on here,

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:28.180 align:middle line:84%
George, where we keep thinking
that our past is so primitive,

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:30.040 align:middle line:84%
maybe we need to think
about it in reverse.

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:31.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
you say, Matt,

00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:33.130 align:middle line:84%
of everything we've
talked about right

00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:39.730 align:middle line:84%
now is the most compelling
block of evidence to tell you

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:43.810 align:middle line:84%
that Noah existed,
the flood existed,

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:46.600 align:middle line:90%
and the Bible is the real deal.

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:50.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: What I find when I
look at these incredible ruins

00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:55.010 align:middle line:84%
of these civilizations
is that the level

00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:58.700 align:middle line:84%
of sophistication in them
should not be there, George.

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:01.510 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't make sense
in the way that--

00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're talking about
hundreds of thousands of years

00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:04.430 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:06.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Something was
lowered here in a way

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:09.679 align:middle line:84%
where megalithic building
style of creating

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:12.889 align:middle line:84%
these gigantic stone
blocks that seem to

00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:15.770 align:middle line:84%
almost been heated and put
into place, like we see

00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:18.199 align:middle line:90%
in Saqsaywaman down in Peru.

00:34:18.199 --> 00:34:21.380 align:middle line:84%
We have no idea how they built
some of these structures today.

00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:23.570 align:middle line:84%
But what's so important
about Lake Van is

00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:27.050 align:middle line:84%
it seems to be this ascension
teaching school for teaching

00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:30.980 align:middle line:84%
them how to not only build these
incredible energetic structures

00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:33.110 align:middle line:84%
around the world that I
think is far more than just

00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:36.380 align:middle line:84%
the physical aspect of
what they are, but also

00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:39.560 align:middle line:84%
how about lowering the knowledge
of how we could reach gods

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:44.270 align:middle line:84%
and then perhaps carrying that
giant artifact around the world

00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:46.159 align:middle line:84%
to teach civilizations
as they go,

00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:49.010 align:middle line:84%
which is exactly what we're
told that the ancient sages

00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:50.150 align:middle line:90%
around the world did.

00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:52.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
these discoveries do

00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:53.617 align:middle line:90%
to modern religion?

00:34:53.617 --> 00:34:54.659 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: What they do--

00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:56.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it
enhance it or not?

00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:59.133 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well, I think that's
what's so beautiful about this

00:34:59.133 --> 00:35:02.220 align:middle line:84%
is that we can combine
this body of knowledge

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:05.470 align:middle line:84%
that we have with alternative
theorists, like researchers.

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:06.720 align:middle line:90%
I don't like that term at all.

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:09.690 align:middle line:84%
But those like me and others,
like Graham Hancock and Randall

00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:12.360 align:middle line:84%
Carlson, they want to change
the narrative of history

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.350 align:middle line:90%
and how sophisticated we are.

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:16.740 align:middle line:84%
I think it secures
that understanding more

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:22.080 align:middle line:84%
of a scientific timeline
aspect, but also the divinity

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:25.860 align:middle line:84%
of these symbols in their
pure form connecting already

00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:28.200 align:middle line:84%
to the biblical connections
that they've already

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:29.700 align:middle line:90%
described, right?

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:33.450 align:middle line:84%
But then having the king's
list in cuneiform stone

00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:37.110 align:middle line:84%
that says right in
it, I am King Hayk

00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:39.120 align:middle line:84%
that built these
incredible structures.

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:40.980 align:middle line:90%
I am a descendant of Japheth.

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:44.370 align:middle line:84%
Having that in these
stones and in these sites

00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:47.490 align:middle line:84%
and then mimicking the lists
we get from the ancient Hebrew

00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:49.170 align:middle line:84%
and Christian lists
from the Bible

00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:52.380 align:middle line:84%
shows us that we're actually all
talking about the same thing.

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:55.290 align:middle line:84%
But the time and the age
is much more ancient.

00:35:55.290 --> 00:35:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And we have to open our
minds up to the fact

00:35:57.810 --> 00:36:00.580 align:middle line:84%
that really it's not about
competing with these ideas

00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:01.380 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:03.860 align:middle line:84%
If anything, the
Ararat civilization

00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:06.860 align:middle line:84%
and these sites at Lake Von
bring the world together.

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:10.563 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You think it enhances
the planet as a whole?

00:36:10.563 --> 00:36:12.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: I think it
will allow us to finally

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.120 align:middle line:84%
stop arguing over
what the cross means

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:17.780 align:middle line:84%
because these
artifacts show us not

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:20.280 align:middle line:84%
only the symbol of the cross
but the associated symbols that

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:22.597 align:middle line:84%
relate to it to tell
us what they mean

00:36:22.597 --> 00:36:24.930 align:middle line:84%
and to show us that it meant
something different than it

00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:25.515 align:middle line:90%
does now.

00:36:25.515 --> 00:36:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't about--
and this is something

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:29.970 align:middle line:84%
that Paul Wallis and I
spent a whole weekend hiking

00:36:29.970 --> 00:36:33.270 align:middle line:84%
and talking about recently
was that the cross became

00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:35.250 align:middle line:90%
a symbol of sacrifice later.

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:39.090 align:middle line:84%
But it originally was a
symbol of balance and harmony

00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:42.460 align:middle line:84%
and reaching this balanced
state of the three sides of us,

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:43.260 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:46.170 align:middle line:84%
In the Bible, it's the Father,
the Son, the Holy Ghost.

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:48.880 align:middle line:84%
But in other aspects
of spirituality,

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:50.940 align:middle line:84%
it's the mind, the
body, and the spirit.

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:53.730 align:middle line:84%
So there's these three,
this obsession over three

00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:58.440 align:middle line:84%
that they basically handed
down to show that, look,

00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:02.010 align:middle line:84%
if you follow these teachings,
you can become gods just

00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:03.180 align:middle line:90%
like us.

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:05.695 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where do you take
these discoveries next?

00:37:05.695 --> 00:37:07.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: These
discoveries are turned

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:10.005 align:middle line:90%
into part of my life's work.

00:37:10.005 --> 00:37:12.252 align:middle line:84%
The new book I
have, after the one

00:37:12.252 --> 00:37:13.710 align:middle line:84%
with Billy Carson
that's releasing,

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:15.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm calling The Missing
Link of History.

00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be uncovering
the secrets of this lost

00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:22.320 align:middle line:84%
civilization as well as a major
project that is taking off

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:25.000 align:middle line:84%
to go to these sites, to
make something amazing that

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.250 align:middle line:90%
hopefully will change history.

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:27.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are these
sites protected?

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:29.423 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Two of
these sites, George,

00:37:29.423 --> 00:37:31.080 align:middle line:90%
out of four around Lake Van--

00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:33.150 align:middle line:84%
remember echoing
what could be some

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:36.990 align:middle line:84%
of the most ancient important
ruins of our entire history--

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:40.710 align:middle line:84%
two of four are left completely
out in the middle of the open

00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:42.733 align:middle line:84%
with no fences,
no infrastructure.

00:37:42.733 --> 00:37:43.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's crazy.

00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:45.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: No
excavations at all.

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're
thousands of years old.

00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:48.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Some of the
oldest sites on Earth.

00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:49.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're relics.

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:50.977 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Right,
and it shows you

00:37:50.977 --> 00:37:53.562 align:middle line:84%
that some of these secrets,
George, don't want to be known.

00:37:53.562 --> 00:37:55.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They make you want
to get down on your knees

00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:56.850 align:middle line:90%
and pray, don't they?

00:37:56.850 --> 00:37:58.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: I'll probably
do that when I get there.

00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:00.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you get emotional?

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:01.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: It's very
powerful because you

00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:04.402 align:middle line:84%
realize you're part of something
so much bigger than you ever

00:38:04.402 --> 00:38:05.710 align:middle line:90%
realized.

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:07.110 align:middle line:90%
It's like the great secret.

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:08.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
people find you, Matt?

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:12.000 align:middle line:10%
>>LACROIX: I hope people check
out my revised website that

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.770 align:middle line:10%
has a lot of this

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:16.740 align:middle line:10%

>>LACROIX: What's next for me
is to truly uncover and unwrap

00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:25.590 align:middle line:10%
the secrets of this
lost civilization

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:28.650 align:middle line:10%
and its connections all around
the world to the very heart

00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:31.163 align:middle line:10%
and origins of prereligion
and spirituality itself.

pleasure, George.

00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:35.277 align:middle line:90%
It was great talking to you.

00:38:35.277 --> 00:38:36.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What an
amazing discovery.

00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:40.020 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I've always believed the
biblical version of Noah's Ark.

00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:43.050 align:middle line:10%
But hearing Matt LaCroix
talk more about it

00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:44.880 align:middle line:10%
makes it even more believable.

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:46.830 align:middle line:84%
