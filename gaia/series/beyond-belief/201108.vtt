00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:27.000 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: We've all
been fascinated by stories

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.840 align:middle line:10%
of extraterrestrial contact.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.810 align:middle line:10%
And today on "Beyond
Belief," we've

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.790 align:middle line:10%
got the privilege to speak to
someone who is an experiencer,

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.100 align:middle line:10%
Kate Thorvaldsen is
from Norway and has

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.380 align:middle line:10%
several close
encounters and even

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.840 align:middle line:10%
some major encounters with ETs.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.240 align:middle line:84%
She's an author,
artist, radio host.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.850 align:middle line:90%
Kat, welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:48.300 align:middle line:90%
>>KATE THORVALDSEN: Thank you.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.382 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad to be here.

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:51.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When did this
all happen to you?

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.612 align:middle line:90%
When did this all start?

00:00:52.612 --> 00:00:55.070 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Well, it started
when I was three years old.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Two years old?

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.920 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Three years old.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:58.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Three years old?

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.660 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah, it
started really early.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did that happen?

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.470 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Well, this
was actually very close

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.550 align:middle line:90%
up to Christmas time.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And my mother, she
has been putting me

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.450 align:middle line:90%
to bed for the night.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.150 align:middle line:10%
And I remember I wasn't tired.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.580 align:middle line:10%
And I remember I was standing
in the crib looking out

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.830 align:middle line:10%
the big windows that
we had in the bedroom

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.410 align:middle line:10%
and suddenly this creature was
coming out from the left wall.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.440 align:middle line:84%
It is a tiny little
creature with a big head,

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.430 align:middle line:90%
big black eyes.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.020 align:middle line:90%
And he did not walk.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.888 align:middle line:90%
It was like it was floating.

00:01:29.888 --> 00:01:31.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Floating right to you?

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.530 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.667 align:middle line:84%
And then he was standing
up in front of the crib.

00:01:33.667 --> 00:01:35.250 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, I
was three years old.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.570 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know what this was.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.880 align:middle line:84%
So I was like blah,
blah, blah, blah.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:38.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did it scare you?

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.470 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: No.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.340 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't afraid.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.190 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to
talk to this thing.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.170 align:middle line:10%
And I understand very
quickly that he didn't speak.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.127 align:middle line:10%
We communicate between
our heads instead.

00:01:49.127 --> 00:01:50.460 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Was he bigger than you?

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.060 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: A little bit.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.990 align:middle line:90%
Not much.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.115 align:middle line:90%
I was standing in the crib.

00:01:53.115 --> 00:01:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, he was a little
bit, like, this taller than me.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A 3-year-old is
about that tall anyway, right?

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.870 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yep.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, did you tell
your mother at three years old?

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Well, I
didn't tell her then.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.080 align:middle line:84%
I think I was just
talking about Santa Claus.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.695 align:middle line:90%
And of course, it was--

00:02:11.695 --> 00:02:13.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's who
you thought it was?

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.610 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Well,
the thing is that when

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.620 align:middle line:84%
he was standing there
and we was communicating

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.078 align:middle line:84%
for a little while
and he was there

00:02:18.078 --> 00:02:21.450 align:middle line:84%
to see if I was OK, that was the
feeling that he was giving me.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And then he was just leaving
the same way he came.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.250 align:middle line:84%
And then in the next
moment, I see this creature

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.712 align:middle line:84%
with one more inside a
craft outside the windows.

00:02:29.712 --> 00:02:31.170 align:middle line:84%
We were living on
the second floor.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.680 align:middle line:90%
So this is not a car.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.360 align:middle line:90%
And then he just took off.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And then in my little
head, I was thinking, wow,

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.340 align:middle line:90%
Santa Claus was here.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.053 align:middle line:84%
So of course, I was
telling my mother

00:02:40.053 --> 00:02:41.220 align:middle line:90%
that Santa Claus was coming.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you were
kind of like happy

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:43.710 align:middle line:90%
to see this little thing?

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.120 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah, I was.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.280 align:middle line:84%
And the funny thing is
that one week later,

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.232 align:middle line:84%
when it was Christmas
Eve, my mother,

00:02:49.232 --> 00:02:51.690 align:middle line:84%
she was putting me on her arm,
taking me to the living room

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.420 align:middle line:84%
because I was going
to meet Santa.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And when I came into
the living room,

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.700 align:middle line:84%
there was this guy with
the red suit, plastic face,

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.100 align:middle line:90%
and a false beard.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.950 align:middle line:90%
And I was terrified.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:04.750 align:middle line:90%
I was screaming.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And I was so angry, too, because
that was not my Santa Claus.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your Santa
Claus you saw before.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:10.550 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, then,
I told my mother

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.760 align:middle line:84%
more how my Santa
Claus looked liked.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And she said, hmm,
OK, I don't think

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.710 align:middle line:84%
we will talk about that
any more right now.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.978 align:middle line:84%
And later, when I was
older, I found out why.

00:03:23.978 --> 00:03:25.520 align:middle line:84%
Because my mother,
she has seen them,

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.530 align:middle line:84%
my grandfather has
seen them, and lot--

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.048 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: In the family.

00:03:29.048 --> 00:03:29.970 align:middle line:90%
It runs in the family.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:30.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's interesting.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.420 align:middle line:84%
They've been
following your family.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.740 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:33.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Since the beginning.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.607 align:middle line:84%
And are they still following
you and the family?

00:03:35.607 --> 00:03:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you kind of
describe what they look like?

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.060 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Well, the
first one I met there,

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.355 align:middle line:84%
there wasn't that big, I
think around 1 meter, 20-ish.

00:03:44.355 --> 00:03:47.170 align:middle line:90%


00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.560 align:middle line:84%
Didn't look like they
had any kind of clothing.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.955 align:middle line:84%
They were this grayish, white
grayish, like a texture.

00:03:54.955 --> 00:03:56.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Big heads.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.500 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Big heads,
yeah, and the big black eyes.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Typical little alien.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.292 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN:
Typical little aliens.

00:04:02.292 --> 00:04:04.560 align:middle line:84%
And for me, many people
are talking about,

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.630 align:middle line:84%
perhaps they can be robots
or things like that.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.940 align:middle line:84%
I didn't ever get
that feeling, no.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They move like
something biological?

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.400 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they
communicate with you?

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.480 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah,
telepathically.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You could
understand them--

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.769 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah.

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:19.519 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At three?

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:20.352 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah.

00:04:20.352 --> 00:04:22.813 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And what did they want?

00:04:22.813 --> 00:04:24.980 align:middle line:10%
>>THORVALDSEN: He was just
there to see if I was OK.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.148 align:middle line:90%
It was actually quite nice.

00:04:26.148 --> 00:04:27.440 align:middle line:90%
I guess that's why I liked him.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.030 align:middle line:90%
I didn't feel afraid.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think about
the contact experience, Kat?

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.660 align:middle line:90%
What do you think it is?

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.472 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: For me, I think
that they are following you.

00:04:38.472 --> 00:04:40.430 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are
thinking that they are just

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.540 align:middle line:90%
following bowlines.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:42.660 align:middle line:90%
For me, I don't think so.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.510 align:middle line:84%
I think that if you
are seeing things

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.050 align:middle line:84%
in a bigger perspective,
like past lives and so on,

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.930 align:middle line:84%
that you're not just
only been human,

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.630 align:middle line:84%
you have been one
of them also before.

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And when people talk about just
the Pleiades or the Arcturus

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.520 align:middle line:84%
or that's the only place they're
coming from, that's wrong.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.450 align:middle line:84%
Because there are
over, I think it's

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.840 align:middle line:84%
around three billions
or trillions galaxy just

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.910 align:middle line:90%
in our universe alone.

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, we are
coming from everywhere.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
been hurt by them?

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.910 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: No.

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:13.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Never.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:14.366 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: No.

00:05:14.366 --> 00:05:15.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you're
comfortable with them.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.020 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: I'm comfortable.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they at a point now
in their visitations with you

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.230 align:middle line:84%
because you've been
contacted how many times now?

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.050 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Close encounters,
physically, close encounters

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.750 align:middle line:84%
has been three times
that I know of.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Including when
you were three years old?

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.030 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah.

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:33.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Have they taken you?

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.180 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Well,
the second time

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.117 align:middle line:84%
they took me up there,
yeah, on the craft.

00:05:37.117 --> 00:05:38.450 align:middle line:90%
Then, I was around 10 years old.

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:40.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have they taken
you to their planet?

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.670 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: No.

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:41.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They haven't done that?

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.510 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: No.

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They just fly you
around and bring you back.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:44.150 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.942 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Must have been
one heck of a ride.

00:05:45.942 --> 00:05:48.665 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: [LAUGHS] Yeah,
I wish I could remember it.

00:05:48.665 --> 00:05:50.660 align:middle line:90%
It would be a nice view.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Clifford Stone,
Sergeant Clifford Stone

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.040 align:middle line:90%
is a whistle-blower.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.120 align:middle line:84%
He was on the Gaia's
Program "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.027 align:middle line:84%
And he talked about one of
many of his close encounters.

00:06:02.027 --> 00:06:03.860 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.360 align:middle line:10%
we're with Sergeant
Clifford Stone who

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.830 align:middle line:10%
has amazing personal experiences
with extraterrestrials

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.420 align:middle line:10%
in the military.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.530 align:middle line:10%
Sergeant Stone,
welcome to the show.

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:13.920 align:middle line:10%
>>CLIFFORD STONE: Thank you.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:14.870 align:middle line:10%
I'm glad to be here.

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.520 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Sarge, many
people out there

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.030 align:middle line:10%
are claiming ETs are amongst us.

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:19.940 align:middle line:10%
Are they?

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.398 align:middle line:10%
>>STONE: I actually
know that to be

00:06:21.398 --> 00:06:23.855 align:middle line:10%
true through
personal experiences.

00:06:23.855 --> 00:06:26.700 align:middle line:10%
Korona, I remember his
name because he's going

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.730 align:middle line:10%
to be with me throughout life.

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.218 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes he
creates problems for me.

00:06:31.218 --> 00:06:33.260 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Well, what's your
involvement with that?

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.552 align:middle line:10%
>>STONE: He's learning from me.

00:06:34.552 --> 00:06:37.820 align:middle line:10%
And there's thousands
of people out there

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.000 align:middle line:10%
that have a
companion, I'll put it

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.160 align:middle line:10%
that way, that's going to
follow them throughout life.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.735 align:middle line:10%
And once again,
they're among us.

00:06:48.735 --> 00:06:53.220 align:middle line:10%
He's not going to go into
a social event with me.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.880 align:middle line:10%
I know of at least two other
people who have seen him.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.030 align:middle line:10%
In one instance, it saved
that individual's life.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.610 align:middle line:10%
But they're not--
that's not the purpose.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.940 align:middle line:10%
They're learning from
your experiences.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.810 align:middle line:10%
I can go ahead, look at
this document page by page,

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:15.720 align:middle line:10%
and even if I'm not reading
it, he can actually pick up

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.740 align:middle line:10%
on everything that's there.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.190 align:middle line:10%
And he'll fully remember.

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:23.190 align:middle line:10%
And at the same time,
everything I see,

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:25.890 align:middle line:10%
like when I'm going through
my documents, they see.

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:28.860 align:middle line:10%
One instance was
that I had contact

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:33.960 align:middle line:10%
with some people who, they
look very much like you and me,

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.880 align:middle line:10%
very normal.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:37.680 align:middle line:10%
We talked.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.000 align:middle line:10%
And they would
talk about things.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.667 align:middle line:10%
And I was wondering,
gee, where did they

00:07:40.667 --> 00:07:44.550 align:middle line:10%
get all their knowledge about
certain things about space,

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:48.900 align:middle line:10%
about our solar system, the
manipulation of space time?

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:53.032 align:middle line:10%
And they finally told me that
we're not from your planet.

00:07:53.032 --> 00:07:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kate, what
do you think of that?

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.380 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of his story?

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:59.870 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah, I
think that's quite true.

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:01.940 align:middle line:84%
But I must say, I'm glad
that my alien didn't

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.148 align:middle line:90%
look as grumpy as this one.

00:08:03.148 --> 00:08:04.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was going
to ask you about that,

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.340 align:middle line:84%
because this one had a long
nose and everything else.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:10.135 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah, mine
was more the small cheek.

00:08:10.135 --> 00:08:11.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bigger eyes.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:12.490 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah.

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:15.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And do they have slits?

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.930 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Tiny, tiny.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:17.980 align:middle line:90%
But they never used them.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you hear
stories of abductions

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:25.570 align:middle line:84%
from other people, regardless
of what has happened to you,

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:26.380 align:middle line:90%
what do you think?

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:29.460 align:middle line:90%
Do you think, well, or what?

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:32.100 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: For me, I think
it's natural to be skeptic.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:35.090 align:middle line:84%
I have been skeptic myself,
too, to my own close encounters.

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:35.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.140 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: All the things
I have been experiencing

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.700 align:middle line:84%
through my whole life, I have
been twisting and turning them

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.789 align:middle line:84%
up and down till I can't
even twist them anymore.

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And I can't deny
what happened to me.

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:50.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: From three years old,
when was your next experience?

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.940 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: The next
time, I was 10 years old.

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:54.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So seven years went by.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.332 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah.

00:08:55.332 --> 00:08:56.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And then after that?

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.550 align:middle line:84%
Because you said you've
had three major ones.

00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:58.670 align:middle line:90%
How old were you?

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:00.740 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah, I
was almost 30 years old.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do you think
there was such a gap?

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:04.600 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: I don't know.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.600 align:middle line:90%
I absolutely don't know.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.652 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was it the same
individual who came to see you?

00:09:08.652 --> 00:09:10.610 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Well,
there were the small ones,

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:12.590 align:middle line:84%
but there were
also the tall ones.

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:13.550 align:middle line:90%
So they were coming in.

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But were
they the ones that

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:16.467 align:middle line:90%
visited you when you were 3?

00:09:16.467 --> 00:09:17.300 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah.

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:18.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same people, basically.

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:19.280 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah,
there were both of them.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't want
to call them people.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.460 align:middle line:84%
But what do we call
them, entities?

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:25.183 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN:
Entities perhaps, yeah.

00:09:25.183 --> 00:09:26.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what do
they want with you?

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:28.095 align:middle line:90%
What do they tell you?

00:09:28.095 --> 00:09:29.970 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Well,
they don't tell me much.

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:33.336 align:middle line:84%
I think that they have been
more preparing me or some way.

00:09:33.336 --> 00:09:35.057 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To what?

00:09:35.057 --> 00:09:36.640 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Well,
I think that that

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:41.160 align:middle line:84%
comes through the cosmology,
astrophysics, stuff like that.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you say
your family was also

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:43.840 align:middle line:90%
involved in this.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And it goes all the way
back to your grandmother?

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:48.470 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah.

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:51.483 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
they want with your family?

00:09:51.483 --> 00:09:52.650 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: I don't know.

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:53.450 align:middle line:90%
I haven't asked.

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:55.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Surely not
every family in Norway

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:56.670 align:middle line:90%
is being abducted, right?

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:57.750 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: No,
I don't think so.

00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:58.583 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or visited.

00:09:58.583 --> 00:09:59.980 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: No.

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:00.780 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:02.490 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the
problem for me.

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And I also have a lot of
people that are reacting to it,

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:09.000 align:middle line:90%
because I don't have questions.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When did your
mother and father tell you,

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.357 align:middle line:84%
this has been
happening to us, too?

00:10:13.357 --> 00:10:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Well, my father
has never experienced it.

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:16.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He has not.

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:17.050 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: No.

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:20.190 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's why my
mother wanted to keep it quiet.

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:21.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: When did she tell you?

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:25.187 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Well, I
was around in my 20s.

00:10:25.187 --> 00:10:26.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She admitted it to you.

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:26.850 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah.

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:27.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did it shock you?

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:28.770 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: No.

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:29.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It did not.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:29.535 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: No.

00:10:29.535 --> 00:10:31.782 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how did she
describe her experience?

00:10:31.782 --> 00:10:33.240 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN:
Well, her experience

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.130 align:middle line:84%
is that the thing
that she remembered

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:37.860 align:middle line:84%
is that she was seeing three of
them was coming close to her.

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And then she was just
reaching out her hand

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.030 align:middle line:90%
and said, come no further.

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's the whole
thing that she remember.

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:47.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With where they
live, is it kind of rural?

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:50.070 align:middle line:84%
Are they the only ones
that live out that way?

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:55.010 align:middle line:84%
Or have other people witnessed
seeing these craft come in?

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:57.630 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: No, they were
living in a normal city.

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And my-- as I said, my
grandfather and my aunties had

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:01.770 align:middle line:90%
also seen--

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:04.390 align:middle line:84%
they have more or
less seen crafts,

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:05.473 align:middle line:90%
like cigar kind of crafts.

00:11:05.473 --> 00:11:06.273 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:11:06.273 --> 00:11:08.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, but would
the city see it,

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.303 align:middle line:90%
the population of everybody?

00:11:09.303 --> 00:11:10.470 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: I don't know.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:11.620 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:13.240 align:middle line:90%
They never told me.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:16.723 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can they make them
visible only to certain people?

00:11:16.723 --> 00:11:17.890 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: I don't know.

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:19.265 align:middle line:84%
I guess that you--
perhaps if you

00:11:19.265 --> 00:11:20.860 align:middle line:84%
are on the different
frequency or so

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:22.480 align:middle line:84%
that you will see
things differently

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.130 align:middle line:90%
than the rest of the people.

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:27.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, were your
parents ever taken somewhere?

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:27.940 align:middle line:90%
Your mother.

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:30.107 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: My mother,
perhaps, I don't know.

00:11:30.107 --> 00:11:31.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is your
mother still with us?

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:32.500 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yes.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:33.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does she
still talk about this?

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:34.540 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Absolutely.

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:35.530 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:36.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She likes it?

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.175 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah, she do.

00:11:38.175 --> 00:11:39.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And she
understands what

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:40.770 align:middle line:90%
has happened to you as well.

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:42.170 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah.

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:44.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when
you tell other people

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.840 align:middle line:90%
this, what do they think?

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:47.873 align:middle line:90%
What do they say?

00:11:47.873 --> 00:11:49.540 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Well,
I don't say so much

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:51.190 align:middle line:90%
about this story in Norway.

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And if I do, I do it
in certain groups,

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.810 align:middle line:84%
because if you do
this in Norway,

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:58.160 align:middle line:84%
they will think that
you are a nut case.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:58.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:11:58.960 --> 00:11:59.210 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah.

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:00.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They think
you need some help?

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:01.263 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah.

00:12:01.263 --> 00:12:02.963 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] You
absolutely, you don't

00:12:02.963 --> 00:12:04.630 align:middle line:84%
go to your doctor or
anyone else and say

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:06.640 align:middle line:84%
that I have seen
things like this,

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.710 align:middle line:84%
or you have implants,
or whatsoever.

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:11.980 align:middle line:84%
You will-- no, they will call
the people in white frocks.

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are your
friends knowledgeable

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:16.150 align:middle line:90%
about this situation?

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:17.470 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah, they are.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:20.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they ridicule
you, or do they accept this?

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:22.362 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: They accept it.

00:12:22.362 --> 00:12:24.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has any of this
happened to them, too?

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:24.920 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: No.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:25.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just you.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:26.630 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah.

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:28.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:31.750 align:middle line:84%
Have you yet decided,
and been convinced,

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:34.185 align:middle line:90%
why is this happening to you?

00:12:34.185 --> 00:12:35.060 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Well--

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:37.223 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they
ever tell you why you?

00:12:37.223 --> 00:12:39.140 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: No, they
haven't never told me,

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.290 align:middle line:90%
so I just have to guess.

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think that I have
to take a look at it

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:46.708 align:middle line:84%
in a long lifespan, and
also, as I mentioned before,

00:12:46.708 --> 00:12:49.250 align:middle line:84%
with the past lives and so on
that they're also following you

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:52.590 align:middle line:84%
as a consciousness because you
have been one of them before.

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:54.353 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where are
they coming from?

00:12:54.353 --> 00:12:55.520 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: I don't know.

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:58.580 align:middle line:84%
I have never asked, because
for me, it's not important,

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:01.130 align:middle line:84%
because I think that we
are coming from everywhere.

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:03.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know, all these
questions I've asked you,

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:06.580 align:middle line:84%
Kate, why don't you ask
them these questions?

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:07.990 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: That's the thing.

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:13.550 align:middle line:84%
I think that we are jumping
a little bit in the subject.

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:17.840 align:middle line:84%
This was in early
'95 or something,

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.730 align:middle line:84%
when I was starting
with my downloads.

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:22.440 align:middle line:90%
This just suddenly happened.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And can you imagine
when you are grown up,

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.810 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly you
are going to get

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:28.850 align:middle line:84%
the answer of every
question that you

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:31.470 align:middle line:90%
have had in your entire life?

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:33.130 align:middle line:90%
That will be a lot of questions.

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:34.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Many questions.

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:36.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But great to
have those answers.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.690 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah, but
for me, it was like--

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:41.060 align:middle line:84%
it's like when you are
looking at the end of a film,

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:42.410 align:middle line:90%
that you are seeing the text.

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:44.900 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing
pictures, films, images

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.897 align:middle line:90%
that is just going like this.

00:13:46.897 --> 00:13:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the
rest of the people

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.330 align:middle line:84%
and see other things
at the same time.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:54.110 align:middle line:84%
I was walking around like
this in three months.

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:56.685 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like that I was
trying to see it or understand

00:13:56.685 --> 00:13:57.560 align:middle line:90%
that was coming down.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.240 align:middle line:90%
You just knew.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is that
when all this was over,

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:05.690 align:middle line:84%
it was like you knew it all,
but it wasn't important anymore.

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And it felt like you
were like in ground zero.

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:11.635 align:middle line:84%
So after that, it
feels like I don't

00:14:11.635 --> 00:14:12.760 align:middle line:90%
have any questions anymore.

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:15.400 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What would you say has
been the most compelling thing

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:20.080 align:middle line:10%
they've told you about either
yourself, or this planet,

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:22.210 align:middle line:10%
or the future for all of us?

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:23.560 align:middle line:10%
Have they gone into any of that?

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.490 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: No.

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:26.290 align:middle line:90%
They haven't.

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:29.257 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
their reason is for coming here?

00:14:29.257 --> 00:14:30.840 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Well,
I think that they

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.925 align:middle line:90%
are interested in our planets.

00:14:32.925 --> 00:14:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think that they
have always been there,

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.440 align:middle line:90%
coming and going.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And as a human species, we
have also been here before.

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:44.740 align:middle line:84%
So I guess that they are just
following the different layers

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:45.910 align:middle line:90%
of humanities.

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:49.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: May they
have created us?

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:51.020 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: In
a certain point,

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:54.422 align:middle line:84%
I think they have been
helping us a little bit, yes.

00:14:54.422 --> 00:14:56.380 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Kind of like
Zecharia Sitchin's theory

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:59.440 align:middle line:10%
of the Annunaki that
came and seeded us

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:03.020 align:middle line:10%
from whatever species was
on this planet at the time.

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:04.630 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Mm,
I think that they

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:06.213 align:middle line:84%
have been doing
something with our DNA

00:15:06.213 --> 00:15:08.160 align:middle line:90%
to upgrade us a little bit.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Close
encounters-- what would you

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:12.203 align:middle line:90%
say is a major close encounter?

00:15:12.203 --> 00:15:14.620 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Well, I had a
serious one when I was almost

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:15.640 align:middle line:90%
30 years old that--

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:16.807 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell us about that.

00:15:16.807 --> 00:15:19.382 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN:
--changed my life a lot.

00:15:19.382 --> 00:15:21.340 align:middle line:84%
I was supposed to be in
a cabin for two months,

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:23.080 align:middle line:90%
writing on my book.

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:26.200 align:middle line:84%
And this was a
nice, quiet place.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:29.525 align:middle line:10%
It was 20 kilometers
to the next people.

00:15:29.525 --> 00:15:31.150 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, I was really
alone out there.

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:33.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's like 15
miles or something, right?

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:34.050 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah.

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:34.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, OK.

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:35.560 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: And I had no car.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.690 align:middle line:84%
So I could not escape, or
I could not do anything.

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:40.015 align:middle line:84%
I had to call the people
that was owning the cabin

00:15:40.015 --> 00:15:41.140 align:middle line:90%
if I want to get back home.

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:42.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Come and get you, yeah.

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:42.910 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah.

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:45.293 align:middle line:84%
So I was staying
there for one week.

00:15:45.293 --> 00:15:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And then I was waking
up in the morning.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And my first thought was that,
am I getting sick or something?

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:53.560 align:middle line:84%
Because my nose was sore,
and my eyes were sore.

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And when I was looking
at myself in the mirror,

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:59.440 align:middle line:84%
I had like this gray-greenish
dried liquid from my eyes

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.910 align:middle line:90%
and from my nose.

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:02.740 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that I
was most looking at,

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:04.840 align:middle line:90%
it was this mark on my face.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.520 align:middle line:90%
It was not the pillow mark.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:09.250 align:middle line:84%
It was like after some
kind of metal thing

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:10.970 align:middle line:90%
that was grip on my face.

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:14.730 align:middle line:84%
So you could see the
clear mark on my face.

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And so, yeah, I was
wondering what was going on.

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:20.090 align:middle line:84%
But when you're
living in a cabin,

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:22.370 align:middle line:84%
you're living there alone,
you have to do the fire.

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:23.640 align:middle line:84%
You have to make the
food, and you had

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:24.848 align:middle line:90%
to do all the kind of things.

00:16:24.848 --> 00:16:26.880 align:middle line:90%
So it blows away a little bit.

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:29.630 align:middle line:84%
But when the evening
was coming, it was--

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:32.300 align:middle line:84%
I was like a restless
animal in a cage.

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:36.140 align:middle line:84%
I knew something had happened,
but I couldn't remember what.

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And I was terrified
to go to sleep.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.070 align:middle line:84%
So I was reading the
same magazine, I think,

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:42.320 align:middle line:90%
about 20 times that night.

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And the next day, I
was able to connect

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:46.340 align:middle line:90%
with the owners of the cabin.

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:49.330 align:middle line:90%
So they was coming to get me.

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And when they came, and
they brought me back

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:55.350 align:middle line:84%
to the society, where there
was electrical power, then

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:56.850 align:middle line:84%
I can really see
the big difference.

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:57.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Back to the world.

00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:59.660 align:middle line:10%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah,
because in the cabin,

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:01.367 align:middle line:10%
there was no electricity there.

00:17:01.367 --> 00:17:02.950 align:middle line:84%
So, of course, what
is the first thing

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:05.380 align:middle line:84%
we are doing when we are
coming back to the society?

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:07.400 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we have
to charge our phones.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:08.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.660 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: So I was putting
my charger into the wall,

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:14.170 align:middle line:84%
and it was screaming like
a microphone is screaming.

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:15.049 align:middle line:90%
It was bad.

00:17:15.049 --> 00:17:15.849 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:17:15.849 --> 00:17:17.319 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: And you
can hear the light bulbs.

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:18.319 align:middle line:90%
You can hear everything.

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:19.750 align:middle line:90%
And then people were talking.

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:21.670 align:middle line:90%
It was bad.

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:25.900 align:middle line:84%
So my hearing abilities,
they were enormous.

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:28.850 align:middle line:84%
So I was going with this super
hearing for at least two,

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:29.650 align:middle line:90%
three months.

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:31.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did it drive you crazy?

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:32.067 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Almost.

00:17:32.067 --> 00:17:34.433 align:middle line:84%
I was putting cotton balls
in my ears every time

00:17:34.433 --> 00:17:36.100 align:middle line:84%
I had to go out or
interact with people.

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:37.555 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You could hear
voices from everywhere

00:17:37.555 --> 00:17:38.560 align:middle line:90%
and things like that?

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:40.950 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: No, it was
just when people were talking.

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And you could hear
the electricity.

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:43.852 align:middle line:84%
Even if they were
hidden in the wall,

00:17:43.852 --> 00:17:46.210 align:middle line:90%
you can even hear that going on.

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:47.110 align:middle line:90%
It was too bad.

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And my boyfriend, he actually,
he had bought me a perfume.

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:54.430 align:middle line:84%
Normally, I was taking the
perfume on to please him.

00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And this time, I was putting
it on, and I was just--

00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:00.230 align:middle line:84%
had to wash it off again
because it was just too much.

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:03.540 align:middle line:84%
So suddenly I was getting
my sense of smell back.

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:06.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let me
ask you this, Kate.

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:09.140 align:middle line:84%
This experience that
you had in this cabin,

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:11.330 align:middle line:84%
was it by the same
type of beings

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:12.890 align:middle line:84%
that had been
visiting you since you

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:15.410 align:middle line:90%
were 3 or a different group?

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:17.660 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Well, since
I didn't know what happened

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:18.980 align:middle line:90%
to me, then we--

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:20.450 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE] Norway.

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:23.510 align:middle line:84%
We went to Oslo, and we find
a very good hypnotist person

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:24.440 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And we were doing
this regression.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And then we found out that when
I was staying in the cabin,

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:31.610 align:middle line:84%
I was lying in my
bed for the night.

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly,
this gray kind of tall

00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:35.660 align:middle line:90%
was coming into the room.

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And normally, when you're
seeing the images of them,

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:40.940 align:middle line:84%
you are seeing them lined
up with the old black lines.

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:43.220 align:middle line:84%
But if you were
taking that image

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:45.070 align:middle line:84%
and making it over
to a negative,

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:47.570 align:middle line:84%
so all the black
lines was-- it was

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:49.640 align:middle line:90%
like it was shining instead.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.660 align:middle line:84%
It was a bright
light in the room.

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And then I was following this
creature into the living room.

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And then I was there
with three others.

00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:59.183 align:middle line:90%
They were the small ones.

00:18:59.183 --> 00:19:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And they were the ones that were
standing around me, and putting

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:02.720 align:middle line:90%
the helmet on me.

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And it almost looked like a bad
horror movies from the '70s.

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:10.098 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you said
earlier that it scared you.

00:19:10.098 --> 00:19:11.140 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Well, it--

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, this would
be one of the first times

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:16.240 align:middle line:90%
these entities have scared you.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.590 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Well,
it did not scare me.

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:20.680 align:middle line:84%
The thing that scared
me, it was because I

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.300 align:middle line:90%
didn't know what happened.

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:23.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened to you?

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:24.790 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: The thing
was that they were putting

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:26.110 align:middle line:90%
this kind of helmet on my head.

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:27.467 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For?

00:19:27.467 --> 00:19:29.050 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Well,
I think that they

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:31.340 align:middle line:90%
were heightening my senses.

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:33.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that where
that big thing came, that--

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:35.440 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah, they
had this, like this arms--

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:35.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --put that mark on you?

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:38.130 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: --around
here, with like these forks

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:40.480 align:middle line:84%
that is going around that
is going up in my nose.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.773 align:middle line:84%
And I hate people
touching my nose.

00:19:42.773 --> 00:19:44.440 align:middle line:84%
And there was also
these kind of needles

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:46.320 align:middle line:90%
that was going into my ears.

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And for that-- for
a split second,

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:50.600 align:middle line:84%
I remember what happened to
me when I was 10 years old.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.130 align:middle line:84%
So I asked them, please don't
let me remember anything more.

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:56.160 align:middle line:84%
So from that moment on,
everything was gray.

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They listened to you.

00:19:57.410 --> 00:19:58.243 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah.

00:19:58.243 --> 00:20:01.150 align:middle line:84%
So from-- so this hypnotist
guy, he was trying to work on me

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:04.570 align:middle line:84%
for two hours to see if he could
break through the gray area,

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:05.373 align:middle line:90%
and he couldn't.

00:20:05.373 --> 00:20:07.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A little hypnotherapy
did not work for you.

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:08.530 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: No.

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:10.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I interviewed author
Ron Felber some time ago

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:13.920 align:middle line:84%
on "Beyond Belief"
about an abduction story

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.900 align:middle line:84%
that occurred in
the Mojave desert.

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:18.967 align:middle line:10%
And let's take a look
at this encounter.

00:20:18.967 --> 00:20:20.550 align:middle line:10%
>> So they're
experimenting with them.

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:24.060 align:middle line:10%
Did they ever physically
take them somewhere?

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:29.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, these experiments
went on for hours.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.390 align:middle line:10%
And as I--

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:31.190 align:middle line:10%
>> Emotional.

00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:31.760 align:middle line:10%
Emotional experiments--

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:32.430 align:middle line:10%
>> Emotional.

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:33.210 align:middle line:10%
>> --I would call them.

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:35.340 align:middle line:10%
>> And as I mentioned, they
thought they were going to have

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:36.380 align:middle line:10%
a heart attack.

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:40.740 align:middle line:10%
And so when they would
get so worked up,

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:44.197 align:middle line:10%
praying and literally
pinching one another--

00:20:44.197 --> 00:20:46.530 align:middle line:10%
and this is the kind of detail
that makes it so credible

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:47.330 align:middle line:10%
to me--

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:48.430 align:middle line:10%
pinching one another.

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:49.920 align:middle line:10%
What do you see?

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:50.760 align:middle line:10%
What do you see?

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:52.440 align:middle line:10%
Describe this to me.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:55.140 align:middle line:10%
I mean, this is exactly
what people would do.

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:58.920 align:middle line:10%
And so when they felt they were
on the verge of either going

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:04.080 align:middle line:10%
mad or dying physically,
a mist would come in.

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:07.350 align:middle line:10%
And it would calm them,
like a anesthesia or a--

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:08.460 align:middle line:10%
>> Like a spray, huh?

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:11.400 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, like a mist would
just cloud into the camper.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.020 align:middle line:10%
And it would calm them.

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:15.420 align:middle line:10%
And it was almost like
scientists keeping,

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:19.860 align:middle line:10%
I don't know, animals
alive for experimentation.

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:21.720 align:middle line:10%
We don't want them
to die because we

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.350 align:middle line:10%
need to do more experiments.

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:24.150 align:middle line:10%
>> Wow.

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:26.940 align:middle line:10%
>> And so they were kept
purposefully from having heart

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:28.070 align:middle line:10%
attacks or from going--

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:29.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Keeping them calm.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:32.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Exactly, which I found,
like, quite incredible.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:33.540 align:middle line:10%
But they do wind up--

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:34.440 align:middle line:10%
>> What a story.

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.210 align:middle line:10%
>> But they do wind
up on the craft.

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:41.320 align:middle line:10%
They wake up with no memory
of being on the craft.

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.110 align:middle line:10%
And it was recovered
retrogressively.

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:45.540 align:middle line:10%
>> Do they know if it
took them anywhere,

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:48.775 align:middle line:10%
or if they just were
carried along the craft?

00:21:48.775 --> 00:21:50.950 align:middle line:10%
>> I tell you, it's
another interesting aspect

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:52.240 align:middle line:10%
to the story.

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:56.447 align:middle line:10%
I mentioned this sort of
triangular mining searcher

00:21:56.447 --> 00:21:57.780 align:middle line:10%
they called it, that the craft--

00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:00.150 align:middle line:10%
>> Now, that was separate
from the bigger craft, right?

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:00.950 align:middle line:10%
>> Correct.

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:02.716 align:middle line:10%
But it came out of the
bigger craft, yeah.

00:22:02.716 --> 00:22:03.516 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:22:03.516 --> 00:22:06.390 align:middle line:10%
>> And they felt the
ground, like, rumbling.

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:09.030 align:middle line:10%
They felt the ground
vibrating beneath them.

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:12.720 align:middle line:10%
And they felt the camper
ultimately being lifted up.

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:15.100 align:middle line:10%
The entire-- like the
ground didn't change.

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:15.900 align:middle line:10%
The horizon--

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:17.060 align:middle line:10%
>> Sucked it right in.

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:18.940 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, everything, the
horizon, everything.

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:19.740 align:middle line:10%
>> That happens.

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:21.540 align:middle line:10%
>> They felt a very cool--

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:23.220 align:middle line:10%
everything got cold.

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:25.770 align:middle line:10%
And the rest is blank
to them and, again,

00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:28.590 align:middle line:10%
was recovered through
retrogressive hypnosis

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:33.480 align:middle line:10%
by Dr. William Anixter in
Asheville, North Carolina.

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think of that, Kate?

00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:36.870 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah, I
think that's very similar,

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:38.070 align:middle line:84%
that you're coming
to a second point.

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And then you don't
remember anything more.

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:40.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's gone.

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.622 align:middle line:90%
It's like they block it out.

00:22:41.622 --> 00:22:43.830 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah, but
for me, I was asking for it.

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:45.622 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They have that
ability to do that.

00:22:45.622 --> 00:22:46.620 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah.

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:49.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was watching a
segment about "Men in Black,"

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:52.950 align:middle line:84%
and that they had
been talking about how

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:57.090 align:middle line:84%
the ETs had a device that
could make you forget.

00:22:57.090 --> 00:22:59.100 align:middle line:90%
They'd hold it up to your head.

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:00.593 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they did that to you, too.

00:23:00.593 --> 00:23:01.760 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: I don't know.

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.300 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember that
I was seeing any.

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:04.100 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:06.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have devices
implanted in your body?

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:08.550 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah, the
thing is that for many years,

00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:10.920 align:middle line:84%
I was joking about
perhaps I have implants.

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:11.970 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps I don't.

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:13.860 align:middle line:90%
I heard a lot about implants.

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And then a friend of
mine, he was telling me

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:18.880 align:middle line:84%
that he was working
on cases like this.

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:23.213 align:middle line:84%
And he tells me, why don't you
buy one of those DnM magnets

00:23:23.213 --> 00:23:24.630 align:middle line:84%
and try it on your
neck, because I

00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:27.150 align:middle line:84%
had this tiny little
triangle-shaped thing

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:28.490 align:middle line:90%
that I could feel on my neck.

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:30.032 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You could
feel a bump there.

00:23:30.032 --> 00:23:32.280 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah, and,
of course, walking around,

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:34.620 align:middle line:84%
joking about it, and
then buying them,

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:38.810 align:middle line:84%
and then they are actually
sticking is a big wow.

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:40.825 align:middle line:90%
And I had a friend coming over.

00:23:40.825 --> 00:23:43.200 align:middle line:10%
And he said, since your nose
has been closed more or less

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.660 align:middle line:10%
since you were 10 years old, why
don't you try it on your nose,

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:46.460 align:middle line:10%
too?

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:49.140 align:middle line:10%
So I did, and they were
sticking there, too.

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:51.540 align:middle line:10%
So he says, OK, this could
be a little bit of fun.

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:54.060 align:middle line:84%
So the thing is
that when you're--

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:56.610 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to make my
body temperature as neutral

00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:58.870 align:middle line:90%
as possible, clean as possible.

00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And then we had a little
research party all over,

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:05.790 align:middle line:84%
almost, with the tiny
magnets to see if they stick.

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And we found out
that now we have

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:10.980 align:middle line:84%
up to a little bit
under 30 implants.

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:12.765 align:middle line:90%
And they are symmetrical placed.

00:24:12.765 --> 00:24:16.440 align:middle line:84%
Up here, both sides
here, both here, here,

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:18.970 align:middle line:84%
and five in the front,
all the way down my spine,

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:22.410 align:middle line:84%
and lower back, and
also now down here.

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:25.262 align:middle line:84%
And I also brought some
of the magnets with me.

00:24:25.262 --> 00:24:26.970 align:middle line:84%
Of course, now I have
a lot of makeup on.

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:30.310 align:middle line:84%
So it will be interesting
to see if they stick.

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:31.930 align:middle line:90%
Quite strong.

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:35.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many, would you
say, total you have, Kate?

00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:39.840 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: As I know of,
it's around 28, 30-something.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:43.277 align:middle line:84%
So as you can see,
they will not fall off.

00:24:43.277 --> 00:24:45.235 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, we'll take
a shot of that later.

00:24:45.235 --> 00:24:47.360 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: See, if I
take it on the other side,

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:49.120 align:middle line:90%
this will not fall off either.

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:51.457 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's magnetized to
some device inside of you.

00:24:51.457 --> 00:24:52.290 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah.

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:52.590 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:55.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they tracking
devices that they put in you?

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:56.735 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: I don't think so.

00:24:56.735 --> 00:24:58.860 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are asking
me if they are tracking.

00:24:58.860 --> 00:24:59.660 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps they are.

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:02.280 align:middle line:84%
But I think that if there
are tracking devices,

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.890 align:middle line:84%
I think there will be more
than enough with just one.

00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:06.390 align:middle line:84%
There was a friend
of mine that said

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:08.460 align:middle line:84%
that the way they
are placed, it's

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:10.825 align:middle line:84%
like you are like a walking,
talking radio antenna.

00:25:10.825 --> 00:25:11.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:13.290 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: And when it comes
to all the implants things,

00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:15.990 align:middle line:84%
and to the download
things that I am doing,

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:18.330 align:middle line:84%
I think that can
be a possibility.

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:19.860 align:middle line:90%
That's why they are there.

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:23.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Elon Musk is
working on having chips

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:27.180 align:middle line:84%
implanted in people's
heads, in their brains.

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:30.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how far off
this kind of technology is.

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:35.930 align:middle line:84%
But let's assume the ETs
have developed it eons ago,

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:37.490 align:middle line:84%
and they've been
doing that to people

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:39.560 align:middle line:84%
now, where they're
putting in chips

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:43.010 align:middle line:84%
in your head and little
devices and things like that.

00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:44.270 align:middle line:90%
Do they manipulate you?

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:45.380 align:middle line:90%
Do they control you?

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Do you sometimes get these
thoughts that aren't yours?

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:49.490 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: No.

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:51.865 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they're being--
you're being told something?

00:25:51.865 --> 00:25:55.090 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: No,
I don't think so.

00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:57.370 align:middle line:10%
For me, the only-- when
I have contact with them,

00:25:57.370 --> 00:25:59.800 align:middle line:10%
or they are trying
to connect with me,

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:01.560 align:middle line:10%
it's more like a
telepathic message.

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And they are normally
coming through quite clear.

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:08.228 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you remember
anything about them?

00:26:08.228 --> 00:26:10.520 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Well, I-- not
that I have been out there

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:13.220 align:middle line:84%
or anything like that,
just that there are--

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:17.030 align:middle line:84%
just from those times when we
had the close interactions.

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:18.958 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why don't
you get them removed?

00:26:18.958 --> 00:26:20.250 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: I don't want to.

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:20.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why not?

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:21.530 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: I
think-- no, I think

00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:23.420 align:middle line:84%
that since they are
symmetrical placed,

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:25.220 align:middle line:84%
I think that they are
there for a reason.

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:26.678 align:middle line:84%
I also think that
they are actually

00:26:26.678 --> 00:26:28.760 align:middle line:84%
helping me with the
things that I am doing.

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:31.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've got 29
devices in your body,

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:32.730 align:middle line:90%
and you don't want them removed?

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:33.530 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: No.

00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And I also-- the thing is
that I also have three of them

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:39.780 align:middle line:84%
like a pyramid shaped,
right on my heart.

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:40.580 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:43.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, how do you
know they're helping you?

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:45.480 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: For me,
it's just a feeling.

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I
have, in my family,

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:51.100 align:middle line:84%
we are also having a
serious high blood pressure.

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:53.938 align:middle line:84%
Mine, at times, can
be up to 180 over 110.

00:26:53.938 --> 00:26:54.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Take medication.

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: No, I don't
want to take medication.

00:26:57.410 --> 00:26:59.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't like drugs
in my system at all.

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:02.418 align:middle line:84%
My body tells me that they
don't like the medication.

00:27:02.418 --> 00:27:04.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These devices
are controlling your blood

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:05.720 align:middle line:90%
pressure?

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:06.990 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: I think that
they are keeping more--

00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:09.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they bringing
it down to a normal level?

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:10.538 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN:
Well, not all, but I

00:27:10.538 --> 00:27:12.892 align:middle line:84%
think that they are
keeping me here.

00:27:12.892 --> 00:27:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm doing
everything right

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:16.330 align:middle line:84%
with my diet and
everything, then I'm

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:18.645 align:middle line:90%
actually able to lower it.

00:27:18.645 --> 00:27:20.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Over what
period of time

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:23.003 align:middle line:84%
do you think these 29 devices
were implanted in you?

00:27:23.003 --> 00:27:24.170 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: I don't know.

00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:26.530 align:middle line:84%
They can have been putting in
there since I was 10 years old.

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:27.330 align:middle line:90%
Or if they--

00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:28.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or 3.

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:29.420 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Possibly.

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:30.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe.

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.930 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: But
since I remember--

00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:34.790 align:middle line:84%
since I feel that I
remember everything

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:37.330 align:middle line:84%
that happened when
I was 3 years old,

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:39.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm not including that time.

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:42.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you had these
devices scanned and X-rayed?

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:44.120 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah,
we took X-rays.

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:44.920 align:middle line:90%
We did.

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And that was actually a little
bit funny because, of course,

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:49.560 align:middle line:84%
you can't go to your
local doctor and say,

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:51.920 align:middle line:84%
hey, I think that I have
implants in my body.

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.390 align:middle line:90%
Can you take X-rays of them?

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:55.130 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they will,
again, call the man

00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:56.960 align:middle line:90%
in white, not the man in black--

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:57.215 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, take you away.

00:27:57.215 --> 00:27:57.920 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: --but
the man in white.

00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:59.330 align:middle line:90%
Take her away, yeah.

00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:01.820 align:middle line:84%
So they also [INAUDIBLE]
from Norway, they

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:06.590 align:middle line:84%
had this chiropractor that
had his own X-ray machine.

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:09.350 align:middle line:84%
So they were actually sneaking
me in from the back door.

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:11.450 align:middle line:84%
They did not even put
my name in the schedule.

00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:13.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wow,
that's interesting.

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:17.300 align:middle line:84%
Sean Stone has had a program on
Gaia for some time now called

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:18.560 align:middle line:90%
"Buzzsaw."

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And he had an interview with
a channeler named Kaia Ra.

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And she talks a little
bit about downloads.

00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:28.140 align:middle line:90%
Let's see this.

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:32.052 align:middle line:10%
>> So the Sophia Dragon Tribe,
I met them at-- while I was

00:28:32.052 --> 00:28:33.510 align:middle line:10%
living on the side
of Mount Shasta,

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:37.990 align:middle line:10%
I was taken into the light
in a very unexpected moment.

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:41.725 align:middle line:10%
In that moment, all of reality,
physical reality, was gone.

00:28:41.725 --> 00:28:43.660 align:middle line:10%
And I was just sitting
there with my laptop.

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:47.170 align:middle line:10%
And out of the
source light, a voice

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:49.870 align:middle line:10%
came and called herself Sophia.

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:52.720 align:middle line:10%
And I was just in
shock, and I thought,

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.230 align:middle line:10%
the Greek goddess of Wisdom?

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:56.020 align:middle line:10%
But I didn't see a form.

00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:58.150 align:middle line:10%
And she said, no, I
am the Divine Mother

00:28:58.150 --> 00:29:00.490 align:middle line:10%
Kratrix of All Life.

00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:05.370 align:middle line:10%
And so we had this very poignant
conversation about sovereignty

00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:07.960 align:middle line:10%
and humanity's
divinity, and that she

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:11.110 align:middle line:10%
had a high council of
ascended master beings

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:14.320 align:middle line:10%
that were exceptional teachers
on the sovereign divinity

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:17.110 align:middle line:10%
of humanity, and how to
activate the reconciliation

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:19.810 align:middle line:10%
and remembrance of
that sovereign divinity

00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:22.490 align:middle line:10%
within humanity's
collective consciousness.

00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:25.420 align:middle line:10%
So I had been working with the
ascended masters and angels

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:28.070 align:middle line:10%
individually for my whole life.

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:30.460 align:middle line:10%
But when I met
this high council,

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:32.350 align:middle line:10%
there were so many faces.

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:34.420 align:middle line:10%
And they were so advanced.

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:39.970 align:middle line:10%
And they came from, really,
the highest spaces and places

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:43.000 align:middle line:10%
in the multiverse form.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.670 align:middle line:10%
And I realized that I had
come home to the council

00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:49.540 align:middle line:10%
that I was meant to work
with for the rest of my life.

00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:51.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So that was
her download, Kate.

00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:53.070 align:middle line:90%
How about yours?

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:53.970 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:57.450 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Well, after those
three months with the downloads

00:29:57.450 --> 00:30:00.570 align:middle line:84%
with my own questions,
as I said, I was--

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:03.503 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I was
at ground zero.

00:30:03.503 --> 00:30:04.920 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think
much more about it.

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:10.050 align:middle line:84%
I was just continued busy
during my day, or my schedules.

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And I remember it so well
when this happened, because I

00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:14.220 align:middle line:90%
was standing in my basement.

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:17.100 align:middle line:84%
I was working on a wedding
dress for a friend of mine.

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:17.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not yours.

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:18.740 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Not mine, no.

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:19.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:21.595 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: And trust
me, I had a deadline, too.

00:30:21.595 --> 00:30:25.740 align:middle line:84%
So what thing-- the things
that was going to happen,

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:28.290 align:middle line:84%
it was absolutely
not on my mind, no.

00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:29.460 align:middle line:90%
I was down there working.

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly, I'm
hearing these numbers--

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:35.180 align:middle line:90%
1, 3, 7, 12.

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:36.623 align:middle line:90%
OK, didn't tell me much.

00:30:36.623 --> 00:30:37.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In your head?

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:38.373 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah.

00:30:38.373 --> 00:30:41.140 align:middle line:84%
And then it repeated
itself several times.

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:43.900 align:middle line:90%
OK, still didn't tell me much.

00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly
I was seeing this,

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:50.620 align:middle line:84%
like a, you know, the
pearls, a string of pearls.

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And then I see another
one, but then it's

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:55.990 align:middle line:84%
more like it's shaped like a
DNA but without the bindings.

00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And then it starts to grow and
grow and grow and become more

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.870 align:middle line:90%
like a 12-string DNA.

00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:04.277 align:middle line:84%
And even then, it starts
to grow and grow and grow.

00:31:04.277 --> 00:31:05.860 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly,
it was like someone

00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:08.110 align:middle line:84%
was taking my consciousness
and just drag it

00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:10.020 align:middle line:84%
out the backside of
my head and just--

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:12.160 align:middle line:90%
shwew-- out.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And I was not outside
our house, or I was even

00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:19.460 align:middle line:84%
outside our universe and
even outside of everything.

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:23.110 align:middle line:84%
So I was like I was hanging out
there, outside of the total.

00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:25.065 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking
back at the total.

00:31:25.065 --> 00:31:29.840 align:middle line:84%
So I can see like the doughnut
shape kind of very complex DNA

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:30.928 align:middle line:90%
string with pearls.

00:31:30.928 --> 00:31:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And I can also see the big light
that was surrounding it all,

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:35.600 align:middle line:90%
like where the consciousness.

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:38.363 align:middle line:90%
And I understood what it was.

00:31:38.363 --> 00:31:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And I felt so humble
when I was hanging there.

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:44.123 align:middle line:84%
And just, wow, it
was just stunning.

00:31:44.123 --> 00:31:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And then in the next
moment, I was just,

00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:49.150 align:middle line:84%
like my consciousness
was just dragged back in,

00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:51.930 align:middle line:90%
into one of the spheres.

00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And I saw something that looked
like a atom and electrons,

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:56.850 align:middle line:90%
but it wasn't.

00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:58.850 align:middle line:84%
Actually the atom
and the electrons

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:02.040 align:middle line:84%
is actually the copies
of the bigger picture.

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:04.590 align:middle line:84%
So then I was
following one of those.

00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:07.920 align:middle line:84%
They were actually multiverses
and the multiverse core

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:09.930 align:middle line:84%
that was inside one
of those spheres.

00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:10.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:12.413 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: And
then I was starting

00:32:12.413 --> 00:32:15.150 align:middle line:84%
to follow one of
the multi-universes.

00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:16.290 align:middle line:90%
And that one explode.

00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:18.182 align:middle line:90%
That was our big bang.

00:32:18.182 --> 00:32:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And then I was following
the whole cycle,

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:23.460 align:middle line:84%
what happened from there
on, until I was coming back

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:28.020 align:middle line:84%
to a system, planetary system
that I can actually recognize.

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And then, whoops, I was
back in my basement.

00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:32.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your book is
called "A Hybrid's Story."

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:33.483 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah.

00:32:33.483 --> 00:32:35.530 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's a fascinating
book about your life,

00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:38.340 align:middle line:10%
many of the things we've
talked about tonight.

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:41.348 align:middle line:10%
When you wrote it, did
they give you any help?

00:32:41.348 --> 00:32:42.640 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: No, they didn't.

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:43.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This was all you.

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:44.980 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Because
this one is my bio.

00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:47.730 align:middle line:84%
This is about my
close encounters,

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:50.930 align:middle line:84%
but it's also a lot of
my paranormal events

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:54.840 align:middle line:84%
or experiences,
too, and past lives.

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:57.930 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Of everything that's
happened to you in your life,

00:32:57.930 --> 00:33:02.672 align:middle line:10%
what would you say has
been the strangest?

00:33:02.672 --> 00:33:03.630 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Oh, ooh.

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:04.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For you.

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:06.240 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: It
is difficult to say

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:08.010 align:middle line:90%
because there has been so many.

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:09.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
I am not looking

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:10.473 align:middle line:90%
at them as strange for me.

00:33:10.473 --> 00:33:14.538 align:middle line:90%
They are more like teaching.

00:33:14.538 --> 00:33:16.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
normal for you now?

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:17.070 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah.

00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:19.290 align:middle line:10%
They are teaching
me in so many ways,

00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:24.000 align:middle line:10%
learning me to open my eyes to
see things in a bigger view.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.430 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you a short
one, if you have time.

00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:28.055 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, please.

00:33:28.055 --> 00:33:29.430 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN:
Many years back, I

00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:33.090 align:middle line:84%
had four horses, also
a quarter from here.

00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And one of my other
horses, she had kicked her.

00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:37.430 align:middle line:90%
So she had broken her--

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:38.610 align:middle line:90%
the back bone here.

00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:39.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ouch, yeah.

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:41.290 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: And we
had to call the vet.

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And we also know that we
want to have to put her down.

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:48.786 align:middle line:84%
And we also had to call the
butcher, so he was on his way.

00:33:48.786 --> 00:33:50.510 align:middle line:90%
And I was sitting in my office.

00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking,
it was overwhelming

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:55.762 align:middle line:90%
feeling that this was so wrong.

00:33:55.762 --> 00:33:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And then in the
next moment, then I

00:33:57.220 --> 00:34:01.260 align:middle line:84%
am seeing myself in the vision
in front of me as an Indian.

00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:04.770 align:middle line:84%
I saw myself from the back, with
black hair, long white feather,

00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:08.670 align:middle line:84%
bare body, holding my arms
around the neck of the horse.

00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:10.320 align:middle line:90%
And I saw some other Indians.

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:14.820 align:middle line:84%
But then in the next moment,
I having this older man

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:16.968 align:middle line:90%
this close to my face.

00:34:16.968 --> 00:34:18.510 align:middle line:84%
And he looks me
straight in the eyes.

00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:22.199 align:middle line:84%
And he says to me, never
leave your beloved ones

00:34:22.199 --> 00:34:25.190 align:middle line:90%
in death to strangers.

00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:26.375 align:middle line:90%
And then he disappeared.

00:34:26.375 --> 00:34:27.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:29.468 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: So then I
knew that this job was mine,

00:34:29.468 --> 00:34:31.199 align:middle line:90%
not the butcher's.

00:34:31.199 --> 00:34:35.110 align:middle line:84%
So I had to tell my boyfriend at
the time that this job is mine

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:36.750 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:38.120 align:middle line:90%
And he said, no.

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:42.108 align:middle line:84%
Yes, the only way this
going to happen, my way.

00:34:42.108 --> 00:34:43.400 align:middle line:90%
And he also called the butcher.

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:44.828 align:middle line:84%
And the butcher
said, he has been

00:34:44.828 --> 00:34:46.370 align:middle line:84%
working with this
for 30 years, never

00:34:46.370 --> 00:34:47.900 align:middle line:90%
experienced anything like it.

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:49.880 align:middle line:84%
But, of course, if
no one would know,

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:53.480 align:middle line:84%
then it was OK, because, of
course, it's not illegal.

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:56.690 align:middle line:84%
So when he came, he was
giving me the nail gun.

00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:58.130 align:middle line:90%
And he showed me what to do.

00:34:58.130 --> 00:34:59.810 align:middle line:90%
And then they all left.

00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:01.040 align:middle line:90%
So I got my horse out.

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.290 align:middle line:84%
He was just walking on three
legs, not a pretty sight.

00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:05.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It must've
been horrible for you.

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:07.820 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah, but my
own feelings was not important.

00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:10.310 align:middle line:84%
So I had put myself
and my feelings

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:12.800 align:middle line:84%
away, because the horse
would have been reading me

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.270 align:middle line:90%
as an open book.

00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:17.180 align:middle line:84%
So I put my hands over
her eyes, after I give her

00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:19.130 align:middle line:84%
a little food, asked
her to forgive me,

00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:20.360 align:middle line:90%
and put the trigger off.

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:22.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, horrible
thought, horrible.

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:24.500 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: But after
that, I could scream.

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:26.910 align:middle line:90%
But I had never, ever regret it.

00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And I also see now
that in our society,

00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:31.310 align:middle line:84%
that is exactly
what we are doing.

00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:34.800 align:middle line:84%
We are leaving our beloved
ones to a stranger in death.

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:35.940 align:middle line:90%
So for me, I--

00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:38.090 align:middle line:84%
when I bought my
next house, I bought

00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:40.190 align:middle line:84%
it big enough so I can
have my mother downstairs.

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:42.580 align:middle line:90%
I want to take care of her.

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:44.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me about
astrophysics and consciousness.

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:46.960 align:middle line:84%
How does that
relate to the things

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:48.230 align:middle line:90%
that have happened to you?

00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:49.030 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Wow.

00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:50.560 align:middle line:84%
How many programs
do you want to make?

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:51.043 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:35:51.043 --> 00:35:51.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:54.430 align:middle line:90%


00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:57.040 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Well,
after this download, when

00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:00.110 align:middle line:84%
it comes to the physics
stuff, of course,

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:03.152 align:middle line:84%
I became a little bit more
interested into the topic.

00:36:03.152 --> 00:36:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And the good thing is
with this that when

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:06.670 align:middle line:84%
you are getting these
kind of downloads,

00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:09.590 align:middle line:84%
they are become
like a part of you.

00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:11.590 align:middle line:84%
So I guess that if the
school system was working

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:13.007 align:middle line:84%
in the same way,
I guess you would

00:36:13.007 --> 00:36:16.030 align:middle line:84%
be doing-- finishing your
school in one week or one year.

00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:18.850 align:middle line:84%
So they are sticking
with you forever.

00:36:18.850 --> 00:36:23.080 align:middle line:84%
But I also learned that for me
to move forward, since I am,

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:25.690 align:middle line:84%
like I am on the stage
that I don't have

00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:28.900 align:middle line:84%
any questions anymore, I need
to interact with people that

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:34.780 align:middle line:84%
are working in physics or
science that can have questions

00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:36.715 align:middle line:90%
that can trigger my mind.

00:36:36.715 --> 00:36:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And when they do
trigger my mind,

00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:41.600 align:middle line:84%
then I will start seeing
the film, and things occur.

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:44.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Another one of our
Gaia shows, "Mystery Teachings,"

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:46.760 align:middle line:84%
is with Dr. Theresa
Bullard, where

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:50.240 align:middle line:84%
she talks about the
origins of the universe.

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>> We are all familiar with
the dramatic words of Genesis

00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:56.660 align:middle line:84%
describing the creation
of Heaven and Earth.

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:59.180 align:middle line:10%
But long before the
Bible was ever written,

00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:00.650 align:middle line:10%
creation stories
have been a part

00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:04.880 align:middle line:10%
of every spiritual and shamanic
tradition throughout the world.

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:10.160 align:middle line:10%
We yearn to understand this vast
universe and our place in it.

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:14.060 align:middle line:10%
Most creation stories fall
under one of two types.

00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:17.930 align:middle line:10%
Either the universe was
created from nothing,

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:22.940 align:middle line:10%
or it is eternal, with
no beginning or end.

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:26.540 align:middle line:10%
But as we'll see through the
union of modern astrophysics

00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:29.540 align:middle line:10%
and ancient mystery school
teachings of cosmology,

00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:32.720 align:middle line:10%
we can reconcile these
two contrasting views

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:35.490 align:middle line:10%
and gain new insights into
the nature of the multiverse.

00:37:35.490 --> 00:37:37.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what do you
think of the multiverse?

00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:39.610 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
of the universe?

00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:41.860 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Well, when
it comes to the multiverses,

00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:44.270 align:middle line:84%
I think that there are
many, many multiverses

00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:45.470 align:middle line:90%
around the multiverse core.

00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:47.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you taught
that, told that by the ETs?

00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:50.330 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: No, that was the
vision that I had when I had

00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:51.300 align:middle line:90%
this first--

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:52.362 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:37:52.362 --> 00:37:55.040 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: --downloading
when it comes to this topics.

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:59.000 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, I can see how
they are interacting,

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.690 align:middle line:84%
not so much interacting
with each other.

00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:03.530 align:middle line:84%
But I can see how the
system works, how they are,

00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:05.630 align:middle line:84%
like, they are
producing universes,

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:08.120 align:middle line:84%
and how the universe
is expanding inside

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:11.030 align:middle line:84%
of every one of the spheres,
and how all of it grows.

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:13.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many downloads
have you had, Kate?

00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:15.210 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: I
don't know, many.

00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:16.010 align:middle line:90%
That--

00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they do it on their
own, or do you ask for it?

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:19.300 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: No.

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:21.780 align:middle line:10%
Normally, I need something
to trigger my mind.

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:23.390 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times,
when I'm working

00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:25.940 align:middle line:84%
on my book, when it comes
to the physics part,

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:27.680 align:middle line:90%
then I'm trying to categorize.

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, then that
also can trigger my mind.

00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:32.130 align:middle line:84%
And then I have to
do that bit instead.

00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:34.750 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a wonder why
my book takes so long.

00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:35.550 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:37.805 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But can you
summon them for help?

00:38:37.805 --> 00:38:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: No, I don't.

00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:39.560 align:middle line:90%
I don't need to.

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:40.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't do that.

00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:40.670 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: No.

00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:43.160 align:middle line:84%
The thing is that I'm working
very much in the same way

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:45.080 align:middle line:90%
as Tesla is doing.

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:46.710 align:middle line:84%
When he was working
on his engines,

00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:49.380 align:middle line:84%
he was seeing his engine like
a 3D film in front of him.

00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:50.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:52.515 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: So he can
take one part, put it

00:38:52.515 --> 00:38:54.140 align:middle line:84%
into the engine, and
he can very easily

00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:56.350 align:middle line:90%
see if that one fits or not.

00:38:56.350 --> 00:39:00.500 align:middle line:84%
So when I-- when-- the thing
that I saw to begin with,

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:04.910 align:middle line:84%
it was like you are showing the
bigger picture, the big engine.

00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And later on, all of this
stuff that I am getting now

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:10.220 align:middle line:84%
is the smaller and
smaller, smaller part

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:12.080 align:middle line:90%
that fits in to this machine.

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:16.520 align:middle line:84%
So when I hear some
other scientists trying

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:20.810 align:middle line:84%
to tell me about them,
how their theory works,

00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:22.850 align:middle line:90%
I don't hear his theory.

00:39:22.850 --> 00:39:24.620 align:middle line:90%
I see his theory.

00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And I can put this
theory into the stuff

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:28.910 align:middle line:84%
that I am having, so I
can actually see what part

00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:31.460 align:middle line:84%
that works and
what doesn't work.

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:35.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you visualized
how the universe was formed?

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:38.035 align:middle line:84%
And we're taking God out of
the equation for a moment.

00:39:38.035 --> 00:39:40.160 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Well, I
didn't need to visualize it.

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:44.210 align:middle line:84%
I never do, because I'm
just getting the downloads.

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:49.223 align:middle line:84%
For me, it's very important for
me to not put myself into it,

00:39:49.223 --> 00:39:51.140 align:middle line:84%
because if I'm trying
to put my stuff into it,

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:53.510 align:middle line:84%
then I'm messing up with the
downloads that I'm getting.

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:57.060 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What do you want people
to learn from your experience?

00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:59.390 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Well, when
it comes to my physics

00:39:59.390 --> 00:40:01.140 align:middle line:84%
part or the cosmology
part, it's more like

00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:03.600 align:middle line:84%
that I'm trying to
fill in the gaps,

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:08.430 align:middle line:84%
so they can see how everything
works in the bigger pictures.

00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:11.680 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to the
science, most of the science,

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:14.460 align:middle line:84%
they are not putting their
consciousness part together

00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:15.570 align:middle line:90%
with the science.

00:40:15.570 --> 00:40:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And if they don't, they will
never, ever get to the result.

00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:23.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Since this has happened
to you, since you were 3

00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:27.210 align:middle line:84%
and at this point
now, where would you

00:40:27.210 --> 00:40:31.200 align:middle line:84%
like this to take
you personally?

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:32.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've made
this progression

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:34.290 align:middle line:90%
over all these years.

00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:36.875 align:middle line:90%
What's next for you?

00:40:36.875 --> 00:40:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Well, I think
that that must be to be done

00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:43.310 align:middle line:84%
with my cosmology, this book
that is called "The Creation--

00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:46.180 align:middle line:84%
Where Physics and
Consciousness Meet."

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:49.730 align:middle line:10%
And with this book,
I will try to, yeah,

00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:54.420 align:middle line:10%
learn the everyday people
without science background.

00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:55.810 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: When will it be done?

00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:58.250 align:middle line:10%
>>THORVALDSEN:
Hopefully, this fall.

00:40:58.250 --> 00:41:01.010 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, and there will be
no formulas in this book,

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:02.810 align:middle line:90%
because I don't do formulas.

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:04.252 align:middle line:90%
I don't understand formulas.

00:41:04.252 --> 00:41:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And I also think that you don't
need formulas to understand

00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:08.558 align:middle line:90%
how everything works.

00:41:08.558 --> 00:41:10.850 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Is there anything
there that a scientist would

00:41:10.850 --> 00:41:13.160 align:middle line:10%
read and go, that's not real?

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:15.410 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Well, I have
been very lucky, actually,

00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:20.800 align:middle line:84%
because I was in Bulgaria,
for example, two years back.

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:25.410 align:middle line:84%
The person that was having this
conference, he was a professor,

00:41:25.410 --> 00:41:26.900 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE].

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:29.150 align:middle line:10%
And he is a professor
in astrophysics

00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:31.940 align:middle line:10%
and also been to space
programs, et cetera.

00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:35.570 align:middle line:84%
And he really embraced the
thing that I was doing.

00:41:35.570 --> 00:41:36.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He understood it.

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:37.513 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah.

00:41:37.513 --> 00:41:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And he was also
asking me questions.

00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:42.560 align:middle line:84%
And he was actually also getting
the answers straight back.

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:45.860 align:middle line:84%
So I guess I was blowing
his mind a little bit.

00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:47.780 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is that
they are actually--

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:50.165 align:middle line:90%
they want to work with me.

00:41:50.165 --> 00:41:52.040 align:middle line:84%
When I was starting with
this, I was actually

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:54.110 align:middle line:84%
thinking that, OK,
I make my stuff.

00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And I will run after
the science people

00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:59.240 align:middle line:84%
and show them, or
try to show them,

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:00.920 align:middle line:84%
will you please
take a look at this?

00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:04.400 align:middle line:84%
But surprisingly to me, it
actually has been the opposite.

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:07.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you had
never had these contacts

00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:10.430 align:middle line:84%
from these entities,
where would you

00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:16.627 align:middle line:84%
be today in terms of your
own personal advancement?

00:42:16.627 --> 00:42:18.210 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: I
don't know, actually.

00:42:18.210 --> 00:42:20.280 align:middle line:84%
I think that I will
hopefully always

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:24.910 align:middle line:84%
been spiritual, always trying
to be seeking, to begin answer.

00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:26.837 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But do you
think they've helped you?

00:42:26.837 --> 00:42:27.920 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: I think so.

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:28.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: These experiences?

00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:30.543 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah, I
think so, absolutely.

00:42:30.543 --> 00:42:32.670 align:middle line:84%
You are getting a
view perspective.

00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:35.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you expect
more in the future?

00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:36.243 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah, I do.

00:42:36.243 --> 00:42:37.910 align:middle line:84%
I think that we are
never stop learning.

00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:39.180 align:middle line:90%
We will always learn.

00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:42.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If there was something
catastrophic about to happen,

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:45.297 align:middle line:90%
would they tell you?

00:42:45.297 --> 00:42:46.630 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: I don't think so.

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:47.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They won't warn you?

00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: No,
I don't think so.

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:50.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why not?

00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:52.620 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: They have
never done that before.

00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:54.330 align:middle line:90%
But if they--

00:42:54.330 --> 00:42:55.130 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:42:55.130 --> 00:42:57.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, did
they warn you about 9/11,

00:42:57.290 --> 00:42:58.430 align:middle line:90%
the tragedy there?

00:42:58.430 --> 00:42:59.500 align:middle line:90%
Nothing like that.

00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:01.400 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: No.

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:03.440 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to the
earthquakes, I am not--

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:05.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that they
are actually warning me.

00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:07.310 align:middle line:10%
I just think that that
is one of the things

00:43:07.310 --> 00:43:09.500 align:middle line:10%
that I can sense
because of all of this,

00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:11.600 align:middle line:10%
because I've become
that sensitive,

00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:15.200 align:middle line:10%
because I could actually feel
the earthquake in Norway when--

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:18.080 align:middle line:10%
in back in 2004, when
we had the big tsunamis

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:21.440 align:middle line:10%
and all of that in the east.

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:22.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they know?

00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:24.430 align:middle line:90%
Do they know the future?

00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:26.180 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: I don't
think that they are

00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:28.040 align:middle line:90%
that interested in the future.

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:30.150 align:middle line:84%
I think that they are
also the same as us.

00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:30.950 align:middle line:90%
They are learning.

00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:34.420 align:middle line:84%
They are expanding, very
much the same thing.

00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:36.970 align:middle line:84%
I think that a lot of people
are thinking at the east--

00:43:36.970 --> 00:43:39.730 align:middle line:84%
at the ETs as gods, that
they know everything,

00:43:39.730 --> 00:43:42.937 align:middle line:84%
they can do everything, and they
can help us with everything.

00:43:42.937 --> 00:43:44.770 align:middle line:84%
I just think that they
are just the same way

00:43:44.770 --> 00:43:47.860 align:middle line:84%
as we are, of course
more advanced than us.

00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:49.850 align:middle line:90%
But they are still goods--

00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:51.580 align:middle line:84%
they are goods,
and they are bad.

00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:53.380 align:middle line:90%
And they are still learning.

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:56.450 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Same group that has
visited you since you were 3?

00:43:56.450 --> 00:43:57.328 align:middle line:90%
Or has that changed?

00:43:57.328 --> 00:43:58.870 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: No,
they are the same.

00:43:58.870 --> 00:44:01.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And have they
specifically told you

00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:04.570 align:middle line:84%
where they are out
there in the universe?

00:44:04.570 --> 00:44:05.920 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: No, they haven't.

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:06.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you haven't asked?

00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:07.360 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: No.

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:08.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why not?

00:44:08.410 --> 00:44:09.430 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Because
I've never been interested,

00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:09.700 align:middle line:90%
because--

00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:10.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'd be curious.

00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:12.010 align:middle line:90%
I'd say, where are you from?

00:44:12.010 --> 00:44:13.420 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah,
I've never been.

00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:14.795 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
the star system.

00:44:14.795 --> 00:44:16.210 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN:
[CHUCKLES] I think

00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:17.650 align:middle line:84%
that the reason why they
don't tell you the star

00:44:17.650 --> 00:44:19.420 align:middle line:90%
system because it's that huge.

00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:21.337 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would they
tell you if you asked?

00:44:21.337 --> 00:44:22.420 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: I think so.

00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:24.880 align:middle line:84%
But still, I think
that it's so huge.

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:26.740 align:middle line:84%
And since-- I think
that they also

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:29.600 align:middle line:84%
think that since I have all the
knowledge that I already have,

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:32.870 align:middle line:84%
and the way that I see
how the system works, then

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:35.440 align:middle line:84%
they will also know that
it's not a necessarity for me

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:38.050 align:middle line:84%
to know exactly where I
came from, because that's

00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:40.780 align:middle line:84%
a human typical thing,
that we need to point out,

00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:42.100 align:middle line:90%
oh, I come from that star.

00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:44.350 align:middle line:84%
It's not important to say
that you come from that star

00:44:44.350 --> 00:44:45.767 align:middle line:84%
if you can say
that you are coming

00:44:45.767 --> 00:44:47.440 align:middle line:90%
from trillions of places.

00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:49.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you an ET?

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:51.320 align:middle line:10%
>>THORVALDSEN: No,
I don't think so.

00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:53.780 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps they did something with
my mother's DNA or something.

00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:54.592 align:middle line:10%
I don't know.

00:44:54.592 --> 00:44:56.300 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Do you believe
in reincarnation?

00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:57.230 align:middle line:10%
>>THORVALDSEN: Absolutely, yeah.

00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:59.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Might you have
been one in a past life?

00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:01.900 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Absolutely.

00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:03.100 align:middle line:90%
I remember several lives.

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:05.058 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe that's
why there's a connection.

00:45:05.058 --> 00:45:05.893 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah.

00:45:05.893 --> 00:45:07.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know, there's
got to be a reason.

00:45:07.810 --> 00:45:10.070 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: I think so.

00:45:10.070 --> 00:45:13.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your
book, "The Hybrid,"

00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:19.640 align:middle line:84%
that connotates a creation
of an entity between human

00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:21.990 align:middle line:90%
and whatever they are.

00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:23.427 align:middle line:90%
Could that be you?

00:45:23.427 --> 00:45:24.510 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: Absolutely.

00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:25.620 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you
don't rule that out?

00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:28.380 align:middle line:90%
>>THORVALDSEN: No, I don't.

00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:31.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How can people get more
information about what you do?

00:45:31.650 --> 00:45:33.442 align:middle line:10%
>>THORVALDSEN: Well,
they can go on my home

00:45:33.442 --> 00:45:36.030 align:middle line:10%
page, www.katethorvaldsen.com.

00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:38.595 align:middle line:10%
And they can also find the
information on my books there.

00:45:38.595 --> 00:45:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And they can also
find more information

00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:44.665 align:middle line:84%
on all my close encounters,
and also about past lives.

00:45:44.665 --> 00:45:46.790 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Kate, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:48.570 align:middle line:84%
>>THORVALDSEN: Yeah,
thank you for being here.

00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:50.028 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: From
childhood encounters,

00:45:50.028 --> 00:45:52.920 align:middle line:84%
to major encounters, this
life-changing experience

00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:56.710 align:middle line:84%
of downloads, Kate has
really seen it all.

00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:58.710 align:middle line:10%
And if you want to know
more about Kate's story,

00:45:58.710 --> 00:46:01.320 align:middle line:10%
check out her book,
"A Hybrid's Story."

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:03.310 align:middle line:10%
And watch out for her next one.

00:46:03.310 --> 00:46:05.130 align:middle line:10%
It'll come out soon.

00:46:05.130 --> 00:46:08.870 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:14.000 align:middle line:90%
