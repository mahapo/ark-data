00:00:05.114 --> 00:00:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC]
And I think many people

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:08.840 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know what
to believe anymore.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.464 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.464 --> 00:00:13.220 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.466 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:17.090 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.255 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:26.722 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.722 --> 00:00:28.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.520 align:middle line:10%
You know, there are
some people that

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.860 align:middle line:10%
have an innate ability to heal.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.930 align:middle line:10%
And they use various
techniques to do that.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, you may think, well
of course, doctors do this.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.040 align:middle line:84%
But we're talking
about energy healing.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And my guest on "Beyond
Belief" is Tom Benedict,

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.850 align:middle line:90%
who is truly an energy healer.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.340 align:middle line:90%
Tom, welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.950 align:middle line:90%
>>TOM BENEDICT: Many blessings.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.033 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, George.

00:00:51.033 --> 00:00:53.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
an energy healer?

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.890 align:middle line:10%
>>BENEDICT: Well,
the energy around us

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.440 align:middle line:10%
is how that we can
help ourselves to heal.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.540 align:middle line:10%
The energy deals
with meridian lines

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.880 align:middle line:10%
of the body, energy sources,
or the chakras of the body.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.480 align:middle line:10%
Any time that we have a
challenge with a certain area,

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.620 align:middle line:10%
let's say our throat
area, then a lot

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.690 align:middle line:10%
of times, the color blue's
associative area with that.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And so bringing a blue
stone or something

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.510 align:middle line:84%
with that vibration
of blue into our space

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.390 align:middle line:90%
helps that area to heal.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.399 align:middle line:84%
And so that's kind
of my specialty,

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:25.690 align:middle line:90%
is the working with the stones.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I assume you were
born with this ability.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:28.940 align:middle line:90%
>>BENEDICT: I was.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And like many of us, we run
away, run away, run away.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And through some, we're going
to say physical challenges, that

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.120 align:middle line:84%
put me bed bound
for three years,

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.790 align:middle line:84%
it helped me to understand
during those three years,

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.230 align:middle line:84%
the only time I'd get out of bed
was to go to one healing class.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And I learned so many modalities
at that class of healing.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.247 align:middle line:84%
And I found today,
15 years later,

00:01:52.247 --> 00:01:54.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm still teaching much
of that information.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were confined
to a bed for three years?

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: I was in bed
three years with severe pain.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How old were you?

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: This
was just in '99,

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.470 align:middle line:90%
so it's not been that long.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And I was on all
kinds of medicines.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.770 align:middle line:84%
14 doctors, they all said
the same thing-- count

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.430 align:middle line:84%
on being this the
rest of your life,

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.950 align:middle line:84%
and count on taking all this
morphine, and oxycodone,

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.400 align:middle line:90%
and all these other stuff.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, I don't think so.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.865 align:middle line:84%
And so I ended up
getting off of the meds.

00:02:20.865 --> 00:02:21.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On your own?

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:22.720 align:middle line:90%
>>BENEDICT: On my own.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.150 align:middle line:84%
I got a flu so bad that
I couldn't put anything

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.400 align:middle line:90%
in my mouth.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.400 align:middle line:84%
And then for the next
month, I blamed the flu

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.580 align:middle line:84%
on the coming down
off of the meds.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.121 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
think you were going

00:02:34.121 --> 00:02:35.944 align:middle line:90%
to die, just in bed like that?

00:02:35.944 --> 00:02:36.748 align:middle line:90%
>>BENEDICT: No.

00:02:36.748 --> 00:02:39.210 align:middle line:84%
I knew that there was
something else happening.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.930 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know why.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.440 align:middle line:84%
I did find out that
being flat on your back

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.440 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most predominant
ways of influencing your chakra

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.940 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But not
for three years.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.619 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: But not
for three years.

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:52.310 align:middle line:90%
That's the challenge part.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.510 align:middle line:84%
It helped me to
walk into my gifts,

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.020 align:middle line:84%
and helped me-- because of some
financial boon from that-- it

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.670 align:middle line:84%
helped me to invest in my
business that's Tom Stones.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get into
the healing stones arena then?

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: I began even
before I even knew it.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.430 align:middle line:84%
At a toddler, my dad
said, son, can you

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.890 align:middle line:84%
leave a few of those
stones in our driveway?

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.550 align:middle line:84%
And then I had a
great experience

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.060 align:middle line:84%
at five years old
with a turquoise

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.950 align:middle line:84%
that several hours
just disappeared.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.400 align:middle line:84%
As a five-year-old,
I put it in my hand.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.270 align:middle line:84%
And several hours
just were gone.

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.130 align:middle line:84%
The next thing I knew,
it was dark outside.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.586 align:middle line:84%
It scared me so bad, George,
I opened up that toy box,

00:03:32.586 --> 00:03:34.835 align:middle line:84%
chucked that turquoise in
there, and didn't say a word

00:03:34.835 --> 00:03:36.340 align:middle line:90%
to anybody.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.490 align:middle line:84%
And that was my first experience
with energies of stones.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So Tom, you're holding
this turquoise in your hand.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.800 align:middle line:90%
And what?

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.750 align:middle line:84%
The whole environment
changes on you?

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: You
know, all I know is

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.070 align:middle line:84%
it created a meditative
state that I lived in

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.960 align:middle line:90%
and I was in for several hours.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And I remember it was
daylight when I began

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.010 align:middle line:90%
and dark when I ended.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And several hours
were totally gone.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.819 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where did they go?

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: To this
day I don't know.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, did
you black out or what?

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.683 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: It was
a meditative state.

00:04:10.683 --> 00:04:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And so I believe
that period of time,

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.709 align:middle line:84%
the stones were re-harmonizing
with the capabilities

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.550 align:middle line:90%
of me and this lifetime.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:21.390 align:middle line:84%
Many lifetimes I've
used stones, so I

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.930 align:middle line:84%
came in with the innate ability
of working with the stones

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.130 align:middle line:84%
and understanding
their energies.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.330 align:middle line:84%
And was doing that even before
I knew why, like that day.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it the
stone, or is it

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.040 align:middle line:84%
you that creates
that energy force?

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.490 align:middle line:90%
>>BENEDICT: Fabulous question.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.980 align:middle line:84%
Really, it is our
allowing of the vibrations

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.880 align:middle line:84%
of the stones, the
molecular vibrations,

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.260 align:middle line:84%
to affect our personal
healing, our personal body.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And so it really is the
allowing, is the big picture.

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.090 align:middle line:84%
When we allow things to
happen with us, they do.

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And especially with
the stones, you know?

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.400 align:middle line:84%
If somebody was to allow
the vibration of sound

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.620 align:middle line:90%
to be their healing.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.220 align:middle line:84%
Well then, that was what
harmonizes with them.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.920 align:middle line:84%
Many people work
with the stones.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.050 align:middle line:84%
And since they have a
molecular vibration with them,

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.010 align:middle line:84%
they're like a solid
form of frequency tools

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.802 align:middle line:90%
to aid our healing.

00:05:13.802 --> 00:05:15.843 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many different
stones are out there,

00:05:15.843 --> 00:05:17.700 align:middle line:84%
Tom, that you use
for healing purposes?

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BENEDICT: That I use?

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.280 align:middle line:84%
At shows, I have about
eight boxes like this,

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.350 align:middle line:90%
and have 105 at the moment.

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.360 align:middle line:84%
And also in many
different shapes,

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.290 align:middle line:84%
many different
sizes of minerals.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they all
do something different?

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:31.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: They all do a
little something different.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:32.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.840 align:middle line:84%
We've got some pictures
I wanted to go through.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.000 align:middle line:90%
Our first picture.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.980 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain what
are these stones

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.730 align:middle line:84%
and what are the
purpose of those stones?

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: This
stone's Amazonite.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.160 align:middle line:84%
Amazonite assists our
healing of the lungs.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.090 align:middle line:84%
Many times the color is
a direct organization

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:50.760 align:middle line:90%
of the area of the chakra.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.592 align:middle line:84%
And so the blue stones, if
you hold these Amazonite right

00:05:53.592 --> 00:05:55.050 align:middle line:84%
under the collarbone
here, George--

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just hold
them up right here.

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.353 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: Hold them right
here under the collar.

00:05:58.353 --> 00:06:00.320 align:middle line:84%
Then it works with
the upper lung area,

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.830 align:middle line:84%
and it aids and sends perfect,
beautiful blue healing

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:04.940 align:middle line:90%
energy to those lungs.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Probably
great for smokers.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.200 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: Fabulous
for smokers.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.574 align:middle line:84%
And then what you
want to do also

00:06:09.574 --> 00:06:12.680 align:middle line:84%
is move this out about
an inch and a half

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.500 align:middle line:84%
and hold it there
for several minutes.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.770 align:middle line:84%
That way, it works on
the lower lung area.

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.810 align:middle line:84%
If you do that exercise
three, four, five times a day,

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.250 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be breathing
better in no time at all.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:24.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:24.950 align:middle line:90%
Truly is.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:25.450 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:26.120 align:middle line:90%
Next picture.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.090 align:middle line:90%
Let's switch to that.

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:29.400 align:middle line:90%
What are theses stones called?

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.690 align:middle line:90%
>>BENEDICT: Bloodstone.

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And bloodstone really
helps any challenge

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.990 align:middle line:84%
that we have with our
overall blood system.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:39.020 align:middle line:84%
It could be anemia, high blood
pressure, low blood pressure,

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:44.440 align:middle line:84%
diabetes, any of those things
that affect our blood system.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And the bloodstone
itself has a vibration

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:50.739 align:middle line:84%
to it, a healing
vibration, that complements

00:06:50.739 --> 00:06:52.280 align:middle line:84%
the energies that
we're working with.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And so if we had
all the vibrations

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:56.510 align:middle line:84%
that we needed in
our blood system,

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:58.680 align:middle line:84%
we would have no
challenge at all.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do these bloodstones
change color after awhile?

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.100 align:middle line:90%
Or do they stay the same?

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: Sometimes
they can shift in colors.

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And the ones that are red, a
little bit more red in them,

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.120 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that I
suggest for anemia people

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.440 align:middle line:84%
because when we walk in and out
of anemia, it's lack of iron.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, the red in this stone
is the energy of iron.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.635 align:middle line:84%
So replacing that into our
space boosts the energy of iron

00:07:20.635 --> 00:07:22.380 align:middle line:90%
that we work with.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it drawing
something from the atmosphere,

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.330 align:middle line:90%
from the ether?

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.580 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:32.460 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: It's our allowing
the energy of the stones

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.270 align:middle line:90%
to work.

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And by doing that, we allow them
or amplify their connections

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:38.980 align:middle line:90%
with the universe, we'll say.

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.460 align:middle line:84%
God, and other people
like to use the word.

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:44.190 align:middle line:84%
It's the universe's
vibrations that

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:46.170 align:middle line:84%
actually focus
into to the stone.

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:51.479 align:middle line:84%
And these stones can become
a little slower in their work

00:07:51.479 --> 00:07:53.270 align:middle line:84%
if you've been using
them for a good while.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:54.370 align:middle line:84%
So putting them out
in the sunlight's

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:54.990 align:middle line:90%
a good way to turn them.

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.031 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well now, that's
an interesting thought.

00:07:57.031 --> 00:08:00.670 align:middle line:84%
Are they like batteries
where the more you use them,

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:02.977 align:middle line:90%
the more drained they become?

00:08:02.977 --> 00:08:03.810 align:middle line:90%
>>BENEDICT: Perfect.

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:06.890 align:middle line:84%
That's a perfect
analogy, George.

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:08.290 align:middle line:90%
Like with the bloodstone.

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:10.070 align:middle line:84%
In general, the blood
challenges that we

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:12.410 align:middle line:90%
have we didn't walk into a day.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And many times, the bloodstone
takes a lot more than a day

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.300 align:middle line:90%
to do that direct effect.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:18.689 align:middle line:84%
It may take three
to four months.

00:08:18.689 --> 00:08:21.230 align:middle line:84%
The first half of that, people
might not notice a difference.

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:25.340 align:middle line:84%
The last half of that they
will-- and or they should,

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:26.460 align:middle line:90%
if we're allowing.

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:29.370 align:middle line:84%
These stones become
a little less charged

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:31.210 align:middle line:84%
every day that we
work with them.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And adding a citrine stone
to that is a battery.

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:37.710 align:middle line:84%
The citrine itself
is a battery for us.

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:38.830 align:middle line:90%
It brings our energies up.

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:41.380 align:middle line:84%
Or it also can be the
battery for the stones.

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:44.810 align:middle line:84%
So if you carried a bloodstone
and a citrine together,

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:45.700 align:middle line:90%
they're always happy.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.025 align:middle line:90%
They're always vibrating.

00:08:47.025 --> 00:08:47.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:49.240 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at our next picture.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.380 align:middle line:90%
What are these stones?

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, they look a little like
bloodstones too, don't they?

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.880 align:middle line:10%
>>BENEDICT: These are A
shiny, metallic chrome color,

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.815 align:middle line:10%
almost like a black chrome.

00:08:58.815 --> 00:09:04.030 align:middle line:84%
The hematite is exceptional
for anybody that's an empath.

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And as an empath, the
oversimplified way

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:09.360 align:middle line:84%
of saying it is we have
this neon sign on our head.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And it keeps saying
over and over,

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.810 align:middle line:84%
everybody gets to see
it, send me your crapola.

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:15.690 align:middle line:90%
I'll help you to heal.

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's why many
people that are empaths

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:21.040 align:middle line:84%
are overwhelmed about being
in public, because they're

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.310 align:middle line:84%
receiving all of these
energies from everybody--

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:26.330 align:middle line:84%
their feelings, their
aches and pains.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:27.820 align:middle line:90%
And it becomes draining to them.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you come home with
other people's aches and pains.

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:35.650 align:middle line:84%
With the hematite, if you
visualize a shield around you

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:39.760 align:middle line:84%
that looks just like the
shiny hematite, for 24 hours

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.670 align:middle line:84%
you become in a
bubble that you get

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:44.780 align:middle line:84%
to choose if you want
to let people in.

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:48.495 align:middle line:84%
So for those empaths that had
this neon sign ringing out,

00:09:48.495 --> 00:09:50.110 align:middle line:84%
it gives them choice
whether or not

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:51.570 align:middle line:84%
they want to
connect with people.

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:54.370 align:middle line:84%
For 24 hours, it lets
them be in their space

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:57.899 align:middle line:84%
so that they can reach
out to people and connect.

00:09:57.899 --> 00:09:59.690 align:middle line:84%
Like the elderly lady
in the grocery store.

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:00.856 align:middle line:90%
Oh, she's such a sweetheart.

00:10:00.856 --> 00:10:03.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're allowing
your energies to be used.

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And yet with this
shield on, it still

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:08.360 align:middle line:84%
allows all those things for
our highest good to enter, too.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's a win-win across
the board for any empath,

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:11.642 align:middle line:90%
for a 24-hour shield.

00:10:11.642 --> 00:10:14.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A couple of years ago,
you were on a panel with me

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.780 align:middle line:90%
in Columbus, Ohio.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed that
during the entire event,

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.940 align:middle line:90%
you were holding some stones.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.865 align:middle line:90%
What were you doing?

00:10:22.865 --> 00:10:24.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: I was staying
perfectly grounded.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And believe it or
not, that stone

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:28.790 align:middle line:84%
that I was talking to
you about or that I carry

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:30.100 align:middle line:90%
is still in my pocket.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And this stone is
black tourmaline.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.370 align:middle line:84%
Black tourmaline is
a great grounder.

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:39.390 align:middle line:84%
For us to stay
grounded and focused,

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:41.650 align:middle line:90%
and articulate very well.

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:48.090 align:middle line:84%
It really helps to be that extra
real grounded and real focused.

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:50.420 align:middle line:84%
So it really helps
that focus time.

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who polishes
these stones?

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:53.896 align:middle line:90%
Are they that way naturally?

00:10:53.896 --> 00:10:55.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: Very
rarely would you

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:57.960 align:middle line:90%
find a natural polished stone.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.057 align:middle line:84%
Most people that
tumble the stones,

00:11:00.057 --> 00:11:01.140 align:middle line:90%
they use the old tumblers.

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:05.247 align:middle line:84%
Remember as a youngster, we
always had those rock tumblers?

00:11:05.247 --> 00:11:06.330 align:middle line:90%
Makes all kinds of racket.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.600 align:middle line:84%
End up in the garage,
making this racket

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.800 align:middle line:84%
with the stones and
the grit with them.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, people do
this in huge bins

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.104 align:middle line:90%
to create the polished stone.

00:11:16.104 --> 00:11:18.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take a look
at our next picture, Tom.

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:20.650 align:middle line:90%
And tell us what that is.

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:22.810 align:middle line:90%
>>BENEDICT: Rose quartz.

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:25.750 align:middle line:84%
George, the reason why
we're here, in my opinion,

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:29.920 align:middle line:84%
is to understand the energy
of love that's around us.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.690 align:middle line:84%
And rose quartz just
boosts that energy of love

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:33.860 align:middle line:90%
that we deal with.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.840 align:middle line:84%
When we live in
unconditional love

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:40.210 align:middle line:84%
and radiate
unconditional love, then

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:42.680 align:middle line:84%
the way some people would
say, heaven is here.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:46.530 align:middle line:84%
And this stone, rose quartz,
is a spectacular stone

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:48.800 align:middle line:84%
for not just understanding
the love that we

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.422 align:middle line:84%
can have for ourselves, but
extending that from our aura

00:11:52.422 --> 00:11:56.140 align:middle line:84%
so that other people also
recognize that and participate

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:56.705 align:middle line:90%
with it.

00:11:56.705 --> 00:11:57.413 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:11:57.413 --> 00:12:00.590 align:middle line:84%
Next one is kind of
a fascinating one.

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:03.411 align:middle line:84%
That kind of looks like it was
from the movie, the Superman

00:12:03.411 --> 00:12:03.910 align:middle line:90%
movie.

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:04.750 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember?

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:05.800 align:middle line:90%
>>BENEDICT: I do remember that.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When Superman
put these-- what are they?

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.340 align:middle line:90%
Crystals or what?

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:11.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: It is
selenite, natural selenite.

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:13.526 align:middle line:84%
And the selenite
gathers the white light,

00:12:13.526 --> 00:12:14.860 align:middle line:90%
the light that we live in.

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:17.620 align:middle line:84%
I call it a soup of
energies that we live in.

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:21.265 align:middle line:84%
It gathers that white
light into a focus point

00:12:21.265 --> 00:12:25.832 align:middle line:84%
that we can use for ourselves
or to focus into others.

00:12:25.832 --> 00:12:27.540 align:middle line:84%
When we're working
with that white light,

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:31.440 align:middle line:84%
it is all the colors of
the chakras in combination.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:35.870 align:middle line:84%
So it can help every bit
of the chakras to activate

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:37.560 align:middle line:84%
and bring in
beautiful white light.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.670 align:middle line:84%
Call it the universe's light,
call it God's light, whatever.

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:41.752 align:middle line:90%
It's just a word.

00:12:41.752 --> 00:12:43.710 align:middle line:84%
But it is the pure white
light that we live in.

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:45.459 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We'll go
through a few more, Tom.

00:12:45.459 --> 00:12:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And then I want to ask you
some specific questions

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:49.600 align:middle line:90%
about the stones.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at
our next picture here.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.050 align:middle line:84%
Now those are pretty
darn interesting.

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:56.150 align:middle line:90%
>>BENEDICT: Red jasper.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:59.810 align:middle line:10%
Red jasper, like the black
tourmaline, is a grounder.

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And to stay grounded, we get
to stay focused much better.

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:05.080 align:middle line:84%
Now the difference is
this black tourmaline

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:07.320 align:middle line:84%
is a smack me in
the face, ground me.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.670 align:middle line:90%
It's a real masculine stone.

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:11.945 align:middle line:84%
And the way that I see it,
the better grounded we are,

00:13:11.945 --> 00:13:15.070 align:middle line:84%
the easier it is to play
on our spiritual self.

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:19.650 align:middle line:84%
The red jasper is a very
beautiful, soft, mellow

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:20.500 align:middle line:90%
grounder.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.960 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the
ladies-- It really is

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:25.130 align:middle line:84%
spectacular with a
lot of the ladies.

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And one of the great
advantages of being grounded

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:30.750 align:middle line:84%
is we can multitask
so much better.

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:34.159 align:middle line:84%
And many times when these
stones call to people at shows,

00:13:34.159 --> 00:13:35.700 align:middle line:84%
I know that they're
having challenges

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.120 align:middle line:84%
with their
multitasking abilities.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they make
rings and jewelry out

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:39.490 align:middle line:90%
of stores like that?

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:40.323 align:middle line:90%
>>BENEDICT: They do.

00:13:40.323 --> 00:13:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter what
form that we bring them

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:45.820 align:middle line:84%
into our space as
long as we bring

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:48.050 align:middle line:84%
the energy, the
vibrations into our space

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:49.800 align:middle line:90%
and allow them to work.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you came
here from Columbus, Ohio.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.740 align:middle line:84%
We're here in the
Denver-Boulder area.

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:57.214 align:middle line:84%
Did you get through
TSA with that stone

00:13:57.214 --> 00:13:58.380 align:middle line:90%
that you had in your pocket?

00:13:58.380 --> 00:13:59.574 align:middle line:90%
>>BENEDICT: I did.

00:13:59.574 --> 00:14:01.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they know
there's something there?

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:05.291 align:middle line:90%


00:14:05.291 --> 00:14:07.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: These, they
let me go right through.

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:09.415 align:middle line:84%
I put them in the bin, they
ran them right through.

00:14:09.415 --> 00:14:10.680 align:middle line:90%
Not a problem.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:13.277 align:middle line:84%
I had bought spheres,
quartz spheres this big.

00:14:13.277 --> 00:14:14.360 align:middle line:10%
A series of eight of them.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:14.943 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Huge.

00:14:14.943 --> 00:14:16.450 align:middle line:10%
>>BENEDICT: Huge.

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:18.487 align:middle line:10%
And they were on
carry-on luggage.

00:14:18.487 --> 00:14:20.320 align:middle line:84%
That was not the most
brilliant thing to do.

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because they don't
know what they are, right?

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:22.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BENEDICT: Right.

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:23.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is that?

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.534 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: They went in there
through the x-ray machine.

00:14:25.534 --> 00:14:28.657 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing I knew, I had
to take them out and show them

00:14:28.657 --> 00:14:30.240 align:middle line:84%
what they were and
that kind of thing.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.990 align:middle line:84%
And they approved them and let
me go onto the plane with them.

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:35.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I traveled
with those again,

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.910 align:middle line:84%
this time, instead
of doing it the way

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:40.445 align:middle line:84%
I did-- I still put
them in the carry-on--

00:14:40.445 --> 00:14:43.470 align:middle line:84%
but I sent massive,
beautiful white light

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:45.430 align:middle line:90%
energy into the stones.

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:47.050 align:middle line:84%
I didn't get asked
a thing about them.

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:47.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing.

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:49.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: Not one
thing that second time.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:49.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They went
right through.

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:51.280 align:middle line:84%
And let's look at our
last picture here.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:51.989 align:middle line:90%
What are those?

00:14:51.989 --> 00:14:53.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BENEDICT: Apophyllites.

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And this is also
the apophyllites.

00:14:55.500 --> 00:15:00.640 align:middle line:84%
The apophyllites radiate pure,
pure, pure white light energy.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.430 align:middle line:84%
It's a little different
than selenite.

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:06.210 align:middle line:90%
It has a great vibration to it.

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:10.260 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't take any focus
to allow that energy

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.280 align:middle line:90%
to come out of the tip of it.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.180 align:middle line:90%
It helps us with gridding.

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:18.150 align:middle line:84%
To grid would mean to
place them around four

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:20.360 align:middle line:84%
corners of your
household, either inside

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.820 align:middle line:84%
or outside the house,
it doesn't matter.

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And to visualize a beam
of light out of each one,

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:28.400 align:middle line:84%
just like a telephone
pole of pure white light.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And then we kind
of surround ourself

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:32.090 align:middle line:90%
like using a cellophane wrap.

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:34.560 align:middle line:84%
You could think about it
as white cellophane wrap.

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.500 align:middle line:84%
You just visualize
it all the way

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.580 align:middle line:90%
around a floor and a ceiling.

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tom, are these stones
four and a half billion years

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:43.300 align:middle line:90%
old?

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:46.092 align:middle line:90%
>>BENEDICT: Some are hugely old.

00:15:46.092 --> 00:15:47.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because
I assume they were

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:49.140 align:middle line:90%
made when the planet was made.

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:50.050 align:middle line:90%
>>BENEDICT: Many are.

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:52.900 align:middle line:84%
And many are through
processes since then,

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:56.090 align:middle line:84%
the combination of certain
minerals in certain locations,

00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:59.220 align:middle line:84%
where the heat and there's
temperature and the pressure.

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:01.610 align:middle line:84%
And they create those
particular items.

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:03.730 align:middle line:84%
I did run across a
stone called shungite

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:05.240 align:middle line:90%
that's three billion years old.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:09.680 align:middle line:84%
When it was created, the
planet had a little bit

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:12.240 align:middle line:84%
of green on it, like a
little algae-type stuff,

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.250 align:middle line:90%
and that's it.

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:14.960 align:middle line:90%
Nothing else on the planet.

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:18.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are they all so
different in terms of look?

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:21.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: Each molecule,
each combination of molecules,

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:23.590 align:middle line:90%
creates that different stone.

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And it takes those
certain molecules

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:28.620 align:middle line:84%
being in the right location,
with the right heat,

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:31.170 align:middle line:84%
the right pressure,
to be created

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:35.800 align:middle line:84%
and to form the overall
vibration of the stone.

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:40.130 align:middle line:84%
So each of those molecules
add to the vibration frequency

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:40.980 align:middle line:90%
of that stone.

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:42.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are the stones alive?

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:45.740 align:middle line:84%
Sounds like a weird
question, but you know what?

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:47.570 align:middle line:84%
I've heard stories
of people that

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:52.550 align:middle line:84%
have seen rocks in the
desert that you can't move.

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:54.270 align:middle line:90%
And they take a picture of it.

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe like two weeks
later, you see rock imprints

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.090 align:middle line:90%
and the thing moved 20 feet.

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:04.457 align:middle line:84%
How in the heck
does that happen?

00:17:04.457 --> 00:17:06.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: Science
has no idea about that.

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:09.130 align:middle line:84%
I believe that it
wanted to move.

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:11.910 align:middle line:84%
And for those of us
have direct hearing,

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:13.730 align:middle line:84%
clairaudient
abilities, we actually

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:15.800 align:middle line:90%
can hear the stones talk to us.

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And when somebody stands up
in front of me at a show,

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:21.530 align:middle line:84%
I know without fail I hear a
certain stone calling to them.

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And many times, I'll
point it out to them

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:25.329 align:middle line:90%
and/or gift it to them.

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:26.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Stones talk?

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:28.099 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: I can
hear the stones talk.

00:17:28.099 --> 00:17:31.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They say things
like don't throw me.

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:33.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: I had one
that used to cuss me out.

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:34.780 align:middle line:90%
It was the funniest thing.

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:37.110 align:middle line:84%
But at that moment,
I was not living

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:39.450 align:middle line:90%
my truth, my spiritual self.

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:42.150 align:middle line:84%
And that stone did not
appreciate that at all.

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And it used to cuss
me out for that.

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:47.345 align:middle line:84%
That's unusual for
a stone to do that.

00:17:47.345 --> 00:17:49.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They could be real
in a different kind of a way.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:50.160 align:middle line:90%
>>BENEDICT: Yes.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.576 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not as
organic as we are,

00:17:51.576 --> 00:17:55.190 align:middle line:84%
but there could be
something there.

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:56.615 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT:
Vibrational molecules.

00:17:56.615 --> 00:17:57.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're
going to come back

00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:00.530 align:middle line:84%
in just a moment on "Beyond
Belief," where we will then

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:03.300 align:middle line:84%
come back with a
demonstration for you.

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:04.721 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to miss it.

00:18:04.721 --> 00:18:11.250 align:middle line:90%


00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:12.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, welcome back
to "Beyond Belief."

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:15.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm with Tom Benedict,
the energy healer.

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:17.600 align:middle line:90%
And we have Andy with us.

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:22.430 align:middle line:84%
Andy is going to go through a
stone healing session with Tom.

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, Andy sports a
little more creative mustache

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:26.990 align:middle line:90%
than I do.

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:27.766 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDY: Thank you.

00:18:27.766 --> 00:18:29.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A little
handlebar there, huh?

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:29.810 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDY: Yes sir.

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:30.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good to see you.

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:31.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad you're with us.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.200 align:middle line:90%
You're a pilot by trade.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:32.580 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDY: Yes, sir.

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:33.465 align:middle line:90%
Nice to be here.

00:18:33.465 --> 00:18:33.620 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:36.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I bet you have seen
all kinds of things in the air.

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:37.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDY: I've seen a
few things out there

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:42.380 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't know what they
were, but just a few lights.

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:44.397 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not a UFO that
flies along next to you?

00:18:44.397 --> 00:18:46.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: I haven't seen any
cigar-shaped things or anything

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:47.760 align:middle line:90%
next to me for awhile, no.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:48.343 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good.

00:18:48.343 --> 00:18:49.940 align:middle line:84%
So Tom, what do we
do here with Andy?

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:53.505 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: Well,
Andy, with your name--

00:18:53.505 --> 00:18:55.336 align:middle line:84%
and usually just
with the first name,

00:18:55.336 --> 00:18:57.710 align:middle line:84%
I know which stones are calling
to you at the moment that

00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:00.380 align:middle line:84%
could help you in your
personal healing at the moment.

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the first
stones is blue lace agate.

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:04.650 align:middle line:90%
And the blue lace agate--

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:06.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'll hold these up for
you while you talk about it.

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:06.990 align:middle line:90%
>>BENEDICT: Thank you very much.

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:09.100 align:middle line:84%
The blue lace agate
is a great stone

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.370 align:middle line:84%
to help us to stay
calmed and relaxed.

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And obviously as a pilot, that
would be a great thing to,

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:18.450 align:middle line:84%
no matter what's
going on, to stay

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:19.920 align:middle line:90%
in that focus and that balance.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.040 align:middle line:84%
Does that make
some sense to you?

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:27.800 align:middle line:84%
Then another stone we've got
for you is the blue kyanite.

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And blue kyanite, this
is a polished version.

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:31.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting stone here.

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:32.585 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: And
the blue kyanite,

00:19:32.585 --> 00:19:34.650 align:middle line:84%
what it does for us
is it, once again,

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:36.380 align:middle line:84%
helps us to stay
focused and balanced

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:40.940 align:middle line:84%
by aligning the
entire chakra system.

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:43.460 align:middle line:84%
And obviously,
your job is really

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:47.190 align:middle line:84%
I want to stay in tune
with everything going on.

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
this kyanite does.

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:51.580 align:middle line:84%
No matter what's going on
with each of our chakras,

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:54.270 align:middle line:84%
it could be you're really
excited about something,

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:57.010 align:middle line:84%
it still helps that area to
stay calmed, and balanced,

00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:58.247 align:middle line:90%
and relaxed.

00:19:58.247 --> 00:20:00.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, will you be
picking different stones

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:01.250 align:middle line:90%
for different people?

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:03.590 align:middle line:84%
If you have 10 people
here, would you probably

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:05.147 align:middle line:90%
be picking 10 different stones?

00:20:05.147 --> 00:20:06.480 align:middle line:90%
>>BENEDICT: I would be picking--

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:09.521 align:middle line:84%
There may be a few that
would be similar because

00:20:09.521 --> 00:20:12.020 align:middle line:84%
of environmental situation that
they might be at the moment,

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.500 align:middle line:84%
or they might be drawn
to the moon energies

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.190 align:middle line:90%
and have that effect to them.

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:18.170 align:middle line:84%
But many times,
they're different.

00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And I do these stone readings
for people at shows for free

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:25.682 align:middle line:84%
and over the phone for
a very minimal price.

00:20:25.682 --> 00:20:27.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What else
do we have here?

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:29.306 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: Then the next
stone is royal chalcedony.

00:20:29.306 --> 00:20:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And this stone
you're going to love.

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:35.340 align:middle line:84%
You have a great
fascination with past lives.

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:36.762 align:middle line:90%
You love information.

00:20:36.762 --> 00:20:37.595 align:middle line:90%
Give me information.

00:20:37.595 --> 00:20:39.450 align:middle line:90%
You live for information.

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDY: That's true.

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: And so
the royal chalcedony

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:48.790 align:middle line:84%
can help you to access 117
of your personal past lives.

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:50.100 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot of information.

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:51.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, how does
that happen, though?

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:53.251 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: Well,
the way that you'll

00:20:53.251 --> 00:20:55.370 align:middle line:84%
utilize this stone is
you'll put it in your hand

00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:58.160 align:middle line:84%
either before dream
time or meditation.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And dream time's your
power time, isn't it?

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:03.480 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDY: I'm not sure.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:06.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: Or do
you do meditation?

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:07.539 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDY: I don't meditate.

00:21:07.539 --> 00:21:08.955 align:middle line:84%
My wife would like
me to meditate.

00:21:08.955 --> 00:21:11.371 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Especially when he's
flying, he doesn't meditate.

00:21:11.371 --> 00:21:12.690 align:middle line:90%
>>BENEDICT: Exactly.

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And so with this stone,
put it in your hand

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:16.690 align:middle line:84%
before you get ready
to go to sleep.

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And just ask it to show you
things, like in this case,

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:21.440 align:middle line:84%
please show me
things that I would

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:25.070 align:middle line:90%
like to know from 17 lives ago.

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:27.350 align:middle line:84%
And so if you do that
three or four straight days

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:29.500 align:middle line:84%
and skip a day or
two-- by the way,

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:33.124 align:middle line:84%
17 lives ago is a lesson that
you learned that parallels

00:21:33.124 --> 00:21:34.790 align:middle line:84%
something that you're
going through now.

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:36.440 align:middle line:90%
That's why I picked that.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.468 align:middle line:90%
And you want to do that.

00:21:37.468 --> 00:21:39.301 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why you
skip a couple of days

00:21:39.301 --> 00:21:41.467 align:middle line:84%
is you is you let the
conscious and the subconscious

00:21:41.467 --> 00:21:43.340 align:middle line:84%
do the oh, that was
the lesson then.

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:46.300 align:middle line:90%
How can it apply this time?

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And so it will help you
to access 117 lives.

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:53.240 align:middle line:84%
If you journal, consider
buying a journal

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.870 align:middle line:84%
with a little bit
more than 100 pages.

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:56.904 align:middle line:84%
And you can skip around
anywhere you want to.

00:21:56.904 --> 00:21:58.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what do
you think of this, Andy?

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:03.080 align:middle line:84%
Because when I first heard
about stones with you, Tom,

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:06.240 align:middle line:84%
a couple years ago
that event, I went,

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.950 align:middle line:90%
come on, stones and healing?

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:11.160 align:middle line:90%
What are you taking in here?

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.690 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDY: Well, I'm not sure.

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:14.650 align:middle line:90%
The 117 kind of struck me.

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:15.320 align:middle line:90%
That's--

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:16.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a lot of lives.

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDY: --hundreds and
hundreds of years, yeah.

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:21.437 align:middle line:84%
But he wants me
to go just to 17,

00:22:21.437 --> 00:22:23.020 align:middle line:84%
so I'll just have
to see what happens.

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:24.025 align:middle line:90%
And I'll give it a try.

00:22:24.025 --> 00:22:25.733 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So if he's
a pilot in this life,

00:22:25.733 --> 00:22:27.900 align:middle line:84%
what do you think he
was in past lives?

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:30.279 align:middle line:90%


00:22:30.279 --> 00:22:32.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: This is not
very exciting, my friend.

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:32.550 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDY: That's OK.

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:34.758 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: But one of the
lives that just jumped out

00:22:34.758 --> 00:22:36.950 align:middle line:84%
at me as you asked,
George, was a gardener.

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:39.860 align:middle line:90%
You loved growing things.

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:40.690 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDY: Yeah.

00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:42.820 align:middle line:84%
my nails are dirty
right now from being

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:45.290 align:middle line:84%
in the yard for
the last two weeks.

00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:47.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: And so that's
just a great explanation.

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:50.790 align:middle line:84%
Many times from other lives,
we bring that information

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:52.170 align:middle line:90%
to this lifetime.

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:55.250 align:middle line:84%
And in your case, you
love to see things grow.

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And that fascination with you
has come from one, two three--

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:01.615 align:middle line:90%
about eight lives ago.

00:23:01.615 --> 00:23:04.570 align:middle line:84%
You really-- You
had a garden that

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:07.499 align:middle line:84%
lifetime that people
just drooled over.

00:23:07.499 --> 00:23:08.540 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDY: That's hilarious.

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:11.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tom, where would
something like being a pilot

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:13.770 align:middle line:90%
come in from past lives?

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:16.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: It may be
etherical traveling.

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:21.440 align:middle line:84%
You may have been--
let me see, hear it.

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:24.530 align:middle line:84%
22 lives ago, you
were spectacular

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:26.830 align:middle line:90%
with etherical traveling.

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:29.160 align:middle line:84%
You would travel
anywhere you wanted to.

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:34.030 align:middle line:84%
You could visit any place,
any time, and anybody.

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And that may have been
one of the things that

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:40.600 align:middle line:84%
drew you this lifetime
to wanting to fly again.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:42.430 align:middle line:84%
You chose the
physical way this time

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:45.470 align:middle line:84%
instead of the spiritual
way or the etherical way.

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:47.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: 22 lives
ago, let's assume

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:49.560 align:middle line:90%
he lived 80 years of life.

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:52.520 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
500 AD, right?

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>>BENEDICT: Yes.

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And now we also have to
consider that many lives did not

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:58.735 align:middle line:84%
last the length of life
that we're doing now.

00:23:58.735 --> 00:23:59.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:23:59.360 --> 00:23:59.510 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:00.551 align:middle line:90%
Especially in those days.

00:24:00.551 --> 00:24:01.843 align:middle line:90%
>>BENEDICT: And averaging-- 45.

00:24:01.843 --> 00:24:02.842 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe 40, yeah.

00:24:02.842 --> 00:24:05.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: Yeah, would probably
be a little bit more accurate.

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:06.622 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Any more stones?

00:24:06.622 --> 00:24:07.330 align:middle line:90%
>>BENEDICT: Sure.

00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:08.460 align:middle line:90%
The next one is sodalite.

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:10.780 align:middle line:90%
You are a huge man of wisdom.

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:11.840 align:middle line:90%
You love wisdom.

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:14.855 align:middle line:84%
Information is-- I don't
know about information,

00:24:14.855 --> 00:24:16.780 align:middle line:84%
but if I can put it
into practical use

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:18.750 align:middle line:84%
in my life, that's
the game plan.

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:20.640 align:middle line:84%
That's why the
sodalite calls to you,

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.000 align:middle line:90%
because it's a stone of wisdom.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.359 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense to you?

00:24:23.359 --> 00:24:24.150 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDY: I think so.

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:24.899 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sodalite.

00:24:24.899 --> 00:24:26.290 align:middle line:90%
>>BENEDICT: Sodalite.

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:30.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And again, you
pick up different stones

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:31.550 align:middle line:90%
for different people.

00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:32.500 align:middle line:90%
>>BENEDICT: Exactly.

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:33.826 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:24:33.826 --> 00:24:35.204 align:middle line:90%
The next stone is bloodstone.

00:24:35.204 --> 00:24:36.370 align:middle line:90%
And that's the one that we--

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's the
one we talked about.

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:39.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: The one
we've talked about.

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:41.340 align:middle line:84%
This one has a little
bit more red in it.

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:42.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And gray.

00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:43.980 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:45.080 align:middle line:90%
Has it been used before?

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:46.940 align:middle line:90%
>>BENEDICT: No, I promise.

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:48.450 align:middle line:90%
Well, it might have been.

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:51.140 align:middle line:84%
But for the purposes
that we're using it, no.

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:52.090 align:middle line:90%
Do you have anemia?

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:54.240 align:middle line:84%
Do you step in and out
of anemia sometimes?

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:55.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDY: I don't know.

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:56.605 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: Not
that you know of?

00:24:56.605 --> 00:24:58.760 align:middle line:84%
Does your energy kind of
really low on occasions?

00:24:58.760 --> 00:24:59.634 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDY: Occasionally.

00:24:59.634 --> 00:25:03.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: And may last
for three weeks at a time?

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:04.389 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDY: I haven't really--

00:25:04.389 --> 00:25:05.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: Put two
and two together?

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:06.471 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDY: Yeah.

00:25:06.471 --> 00:25:08.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: The bloodstone,
I believe, on occasion, you

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:10.347 align:middle line:90%
walk in and out of anemia.

00:25:10.347 --> 00:25:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I picked
a stone for you that

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:14.600 align:middle line:84%
has a little bit more
red in there, that iron,

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.145 align:middle line:84%
so that you'll have
less likelihood.

00:25:16.145 --> 00:25:19.330 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any challenges
with your blood system?

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:21.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDY: The doctors told
me that my red blood

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:22.995 align:middle line:90%
cells are really large.

00:25:22.995 --> 00:25:24.370 align:middle line:84%
And I have a lot
of iron, though.

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:25.203 align:middle line:90%
That's what he said.

00:25:25.203 --> 00:25:26.215 align:middle line:90%
>>BENEDICT: OK.

00:25:26.215 --> 00:25:29.140 align:middle line:84%
That might be balancing
the energy of the iron.

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:31.141 align:middle line:84%
That would mean that's
why that bloodstone calls

00:25:31.141 --> 00:25:33.056 align:middle line:84%
to you, because you
already are aware that you

00:25:33.056 --> 00:25:34.540 align:middle line:84%
have a situation
with your blood.

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:36.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what will the
stone do, though, for him.

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:38.042 align:middle line:90%
Does it help heal him?

00:25:38.042 --> 00:25:39.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BENEDICT: Yes, it can help.

00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:42.587 align:middle line:84%
And in your case-- two,
three-- about three months

00:25:42.587 --> 00:25:43.420 align:middle line:90%
is what I'm hearing.

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:44.878 align:middle line:84%
Just carry it a
solid three months.

00:25:44.878 --> 00:25:48.177 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If it's too much
iron, could be hemochromatosis.

00:25:48.177 --> 00:25:49.010 align:middle line:90%
>>BENEDICT: Exactly.

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:50.176 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a possibility.

00:25:50.176 --> 00:25:51.610 align:middle line:90%
I have a friend who has that.

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And he has to get a little
pint of blood taken out

00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:57.640 align:middle line:90%
of him every once in awhile.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.265 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: Just to
keep things stable.

00:25:59.265 --> 00:26:00.924 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:26:00.924 --> 00:26:02.340 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: Over
the three months,

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:05.120 align:middle line:84%
it should stabilize
your blood system.

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.450 align:middle line:90%
And I'd love feedback from you.

00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:08.570 align:middle line:84%
Just send me an
email or something

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:10.300 align:middle line:84%
and tell me how
that worked for you.

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:10.610 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDY: I'll do that.

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:11.400 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: The
first half of that,

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.980 align:middle line:84%
you may not notice
much of a shift.

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:17.500 align:middle line:84%
But after that, your challenge
should start disappearing.

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.515 align:middle line:84%
The last stone, my
friend, is apophyllite.

00:26:19.515 --> 00:26:21.050 align:middle line:90%
It's pure, pure white light.

00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:23.091 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is one of
my favorites, by the way.

00:26:23.091 --> 00:26:25.100 align:middle line:90%
We talked about this one before.

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: And any
time that we carry

00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:30.360 align:middle line:84%
apophyllites, you could consider
that you're living and carrying

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.940 align:middle line:84%
the energy of sacred
space with you.

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:34.420 align:middle line:84%
It will help you
to stay energized.

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:38.640 align:middle line:84%
It will help you to stay in
that white light of everything

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.340 align:middle line:90%
is good.

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And does that make kind of
some sense with you, too?

00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:43.816 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDY: It makes some sense.

00:26:43.816 --> 00:26:45.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I appreciate that.

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:47.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does he carry
all those all the time?

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:49.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: Now that's
a great question.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:52.030 align:middle line:84%
George, I would carry
all of the stones

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:55.710 align:middle line:84%
except for the royal
chalcedony right here.

00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And that one would
be one that you

00:26:57.150 --> 00:26:59.210 align:middle line:84%
would like to work
with in dream time.

00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:02.300 align:middle line:84%
So that's not a necessity
to carry all the other times

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:03.050 align:middle line:90%
during the day.

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:04.180 align:middle line:84%
Just when you're
getting ready to work.

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:05.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you can put
them all in your pocket.

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:06.216 align:middle line:90%
>>BENEDICT: Yep.

00:27:06.216 --> 00:27:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And with that, Andy, I'm going
to give you a little felt bag.

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:08.880 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDY: Thank you very much.

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:11.338 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: That way you'll be
able to carry them with you.

00:27:11.338 --> 00:27:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And they're my gift to you
just for participating today.

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:14.147 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDY: All right.

00:27:14.147 --> 00:27:14.560 align:middle line:90%
Appreciate it, Tom.

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:15.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: Thank
you very much, Andy.

00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:16.903 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So that's how it works.

00:27:16.903 --> 00:27:18.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BENEDICT: That's how it works.

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:21.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I still think you
have a lot to do with it,

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:22.634 align:middle line:90%
the interpreter--

00:27:22.634 --> 00:27:23.300 align:middle line:90%
>>BENEDICT: Yes.

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:24.475 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --of what it is.

00:27:24.475 --> 00:27:25.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: And
that's the reason

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:29.510 align:middle line:84%
why I stay so busy at
shows, is giving people

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:33.182 align:middle line:84%
the interpretation of why these
particular stones call to them.

00:27:33.182 --> 00:27:34.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDY: What did you
think of this, Andy?

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:36.640 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDY: I thought it
was very interesting.

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:39.660 align:middle line:84%
And he came up on the
idea for the blood thing,

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:42.990 align:middle line:84%
and that was right on the-- it
hit the nail on the head there.

00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:45.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, if you
were out with your pals,

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:48.220 align:middle line:84%
and you were telling them
that you were wearing

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:52.275 align:middle line:84%
healing stones, what do
you think they'd say?

00:27:52.275 --> 00:27:53.150 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDY: I'm not sure.

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:54.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would they
say we're nuts?

00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:55.870 align:middle line:90%
What do they say, Tom?

00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:58.630 align:middle line:84%
People who aren't into
this or understand it.

00:27:58.630 --> 00:27:59.580 align:middle line:90%
What do they say?

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT:
Sometimes, even people

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:05.300 align:middle line:84%
consider it to be
not of the light.

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:06.910 align:middle line:10%
And it's all up to us.

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:09.900 align:middle line:10%
And I won't go up to any
average Joe on the street

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:11.870 align:middle line:10%
and say, oh, I've got
this stone for you

00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:14.400 align:middle line:10%
right here because it
might freak them out.

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:18.260 align:middle line:10%
And so we have to realize who
we can speak to this about

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:20.300 align:middle line:10%
and who we don't need to.

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:21.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
have any stones that

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.790 align:middle line:90%
help you predict the future?

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:27.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: If I do, I think I'd
be a little bit richer than I

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:29.610 align:middle line:84%
am at the moment, other
than the spiritual richness

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:32.720 align:middle line:84%
that I'm seeing
from the business.

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:33.800 align:middle line:90%
I don't.

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:37.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you had one
stone to wear all the time,

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:38.860 align:middle line:90%
which one would it be?

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:41.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BENEDICT: The same as you
love so much, apophyllites.

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:44.060 align:middle line:84%
When we live in
that white light,

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:46.195 align:middle line:90%
then all things are possible.

00:28:46.195 --> 00:28:47.501 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, it sure is.

00:28:47.501 --> 00:28:48.750 align:middle line:90%
And that's what one of these--

00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:49.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BENEDICT: Exactly.

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:50.469 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --happen to be.

00:28:50.469 --> 00:28:52.650 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not sure I will
wear this every day.

00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:54.540 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of big.

00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:55.040 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:57.280 align:middle line:90%
>>BENEDICT: It's small.

00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:00.010 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You know, with healing
stones and the possibility

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:02.550 align:middle line:10%
of taking care of
yourself, making

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:04.890 align:middle line:10%
your life a little
better, making your life

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:07.540 align:middle line:10%
a little healthier, who knows?

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:10.230 align:middle line:10%
Maybe with people
like Tom Benedict,

00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:13.030 align:middle line:10%
you can create an
environment for yourself

00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:15.120 align:middle line:10%
where you can change your life.

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:15.934 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating, Tom.

00:29:15.934 --> 00:29:16.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BENEDICT: Thank you.

00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:18.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And Andy, thank you
for being on "Beyond Belief."

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:19.502 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDY: Thanks for having me.

00:29:19.502 --> 00:29:21.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we'll see
you on our next edition

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:23.480 align:middle line:90%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:39.400 align:middle line:90%
