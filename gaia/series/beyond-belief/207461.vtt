>>HARRIS: It's a

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:15.522 align:middle line:90%
Nice to be here.

00:01:15.522 --> 00:01:17.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
get started in this?

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: With Allen Hynek.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:19.090 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh!

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.428 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: --yeah, I
mean, the astronomer.

00:01:21.428 --> 00:01:23.230 align:middle line:10%
When you're working
with a scientist,

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.080 align:middle line:10%
you know that this is serious.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.090 align:middle line:10%
And I saw the movie "Close
Encounters," ironically.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.890 align:middle line:90%
I was teaching--

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Based on his book?

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.230 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.390 align:middle line:10%
And all of his classifications--

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.310 align:middle line:10%
because he's the one
that did Close Encounters

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.310 align:middle line:10%
of the First Kind, which is
sightings, Second Kind, which

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.090 align:middle line:10%
is physical traces, and
Third Kind, which is contact.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And in that film, Jacques
Vallée was portrayed by--

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:48.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Lacombe.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: --Francois Truffaut,
Truffaut, the director.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.920 align:middle line:84%
His name was Lacombe
in the film, yes.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And I saw that last scene,
and I started to cry.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, whoa, I don't
know anything about this.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.730 align:middle line:84%
So I ended up in
Evanston, Illinois,

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.260 align:middle line:84%
at CUFOS, Center
for UFO Studies.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.060 align:middle line:90%
I walk in.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.110 align:middle line:90%
There's Hynek.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.479 align:middle line:90%
And I said, is this real?

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.358 align:middle line:84%
Because in 1979, it wasn't
something we talked about--

00:02:14.358 --> 00:02:15.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, that's true.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.270 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: --as freely as today.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:17.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: We can
talk about it today.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's
picking up steam now.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:19.350 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.540 align:middle line:84%
So he said, you want to work
with me, you speak Italian.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And so-- because I did all
of his Italian translations

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.030 align:middle line:90%
of all the sightings in Europe.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.160 align:middle line:84%
I worked with him until he
died of a brain tumor in 1986.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, that was sad.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.210 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he came along
in a very slow fashion.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.140 align:middle line:84%
When he was heading up Project
Blue Book, he was a skeptic.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.182 align:middle line:84%
But something changed
him, didn't it?

00:02:43.182 --> 00:02:44.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, it did.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.320 align:middle line:84%
I think the Air Force's
program on Project Blue Book

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.230 align:middle line:84%
weren't going to be excited
if he was a believer.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.840 align:middle line:84%
So they picked the
right man, an academic,

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.610 align:middle line:90%
a man that's a scientist.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And I remember-- now,
Jacques told me this,

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.000 align:middle line:84%
because since I've met Jacques,
he said, you know, Paola,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.990 align:middle line:84%
the thing that made Allen Hynek
change his mind is the Lonnie

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.412 align:middle line:90%
Zamora case in Socorro because--

00:03:06.412 --> 00:03:07.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The police
officer, right?

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: The police--
the state trooper.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.027 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Because
what Hynek was looking

00:03:12.027 --> 00:03:14.620 align:middle line:84%
for was the case that he
could go to the government

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.257 align:middle line:90%
with and say, this is real.

00:03:16.257 --> 00:03:17.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And that was the case--

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.550 align:middle line:84%
if I recollect, Zamora
was in his cruiser,

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.250 align:middle line:84%
coming up along the
side of the highway,

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.730 align:middle line:84%
and saw what he thought was a
white car almost flipped over.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:29.650 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't quite sure.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.420 align:middle line:90%
He thought it was an accident.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And then, as he gets closer,
he realizes, this isn't a car.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.270 align:middle line:84%
And then he sees a couple
occupants scurrying around,

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:41.770 align:middle line:90%
and then it took off.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.360 align:middle line:90%
They got in and took off.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.077 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's amazing.

00:03:45.077 --> 00:03:48.730 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And he's credible
because of who he was.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.280 align:middle line:84%
And for us, it's in
our book "Trinity,"

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.220 align:middle line:84%
which we're going to talk about
Jacques Vallée in my book.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.790 align:middle line:84%
We talk about that case
because the craft is not

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:58.870 align:middle line:90%
a flying saucer.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.200 align:middle line:90%
It's egg shaped.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.850 align:middle line:84%
See, I thought, when I
first heard about this case,

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.560 align:middle line:84%
that it was a lunar module
moon landing test because it

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.990 align:middle line:90%
kind of looked like that.

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.570 align:middle line:84%
It had that kind of
tripod look to it.

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.089 align:middle line:84%
I thought maybe that was
it, that that's what he saw.

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:16.899 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't.

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:18.357 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: No, he
saw little people.

00:04:18.357 --> 00:04:19.209 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.740 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And it
gets complicated.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And when people
see little people,

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.900 align:middle line:84%
they're seeing something
that even today nobody

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.847 align:middle line:84%
wants to talk about, and
that's who's inside the craft.

00:04:28.847 --> 00:04:30.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us
about Jacques Vallée.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.360 align:middle line:90%
How did you meet him?

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.890 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, I started
working on the San Antonio

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:34.690 align:middle line:90%
case--

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.520 align:middle line:90%
1945 crash.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And actually, you had Reme Baca
and Jose Padilla on your show,

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.020 align:middle line:84%
on your radio show years ago
because I brought them there--

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.680 align:middle line:84%
two little boys who
see a crash in 1945.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And they were alive,
and I know where

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.380 align:middle line:84%
it crashed because I've been
to that location so often now.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.713 align:middle line:84%
So I was working on it, and
nobody paid attention to it,

00:04:55.713 --> 00:04:56.513 align:middle line:90%
George.

00:04:56.513 --> 00:04:57.620 align:middle line:90%
They just didn't pay--

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was a great story.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.892 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: It was a great story.

00:04:59.892 --> 00:05:02.230 align:middle line:84%
And then Jacques
started working on it

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.140 align:middle line:84%
four years ago because he
was in Datil, New Mexico,

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.910 align:middle line:90%
collecting metal samples.

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.800 align:middle line:84%
So he wrote me a
letter, and he said,

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.160 align:middle line:84%
I hear the case that you're
working on has metal.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.970 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yeah.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.762 align:middle line:84%
The nine-year-old went
in and pulled it off

00:05:14.762 --> 00:05:16.330 align:middle line:90%
the wall of the UFO.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, would you be
willing to tell me about it,

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.030 align:middle line:84%
and could we go there
together, and could you

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.170 align:middle line:90%
let me meet the people?

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.380 align:middle line:84%
And four years we
worked on it together.

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So it's a
total of nine years.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.020 align:middle line:84%
And Jacques said, this is
the most incredible story

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.800 align:middle line:84%
because it's got the location,
it's got the witnesses,

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.340 align:middle line:84%
it's got the metal, and it's
one month after the atomic bomb.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.640 align:middle line:90%
So he said it's historical.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bingo.

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:43.240 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's it.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.350 align:middle line:84%
Regina Meredith, on the
Gaia show "Open Minds,"

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:51.580 align:middle line:84%
talked to you and Jacques Vallée
about J Allen Hynek and what

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.840 align:middle line:84%
got him started in
the UFO research.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.240 align:middle line:90%
Let's look.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.900 align:middle line:84%
>>JACQUES VALLEE: Some of
my education was in France.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.780 align:middle line:84%
I was recruited by
Paris Observatory

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.900 align:middle line:84%
in the first team
that did satellite

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.400 align:middle line:90%
tracking in French science.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:15.180 align:middle line:84%
I quickly realized that UFOs
were an unsolved problem--

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.200 align:middle line:84%
actually, unsolved and
unresearched because everybody

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:24.330 align:middle line:84%
was afraid of rocking the
boat about the theories that

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:25.530 align:middle line:90%
existed.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:31.650 align:middle line:84%
And I became aware of the work
that had been done in the US.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:36.870 align:middle line:84%
Of course, American science is
a model for European science

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.010 align:middle line:90%
in many ways.

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:44.580 align:middle line:84%
And I was recruited to work
at the University of Texas,

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.160 align:middle line:90%
where I had access to records.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.240 align:middle line:84%
I had access to a computer
in a much more open way

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:56.040 align:middle line:84%
than I did in France to study
UFOs alongside the astronomical

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.360 align:middle line:90%
work I was doing.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And then, through
that work, I met

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:05.160 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Hynek and moved to
Northwestern University

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:10.470 align:middle line:84%
in Chicago and worked actually
with him pretty much day

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:12.343 align:middle line:90%
to day for about five years.

00:07:12.343 --> 00:07:14.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
And this was while he

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:18.960 align:middle line:84%
was doing his research for the
US military and intelligence

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:19.830 align:middle line:90%
agencies, right?

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:23.880 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: Well, he was
the scientific consultant

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:28.050 align:middle line:84%
to Project Blue Book, which
was the Air Force project

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:33.720 align:middle line:84%
to study reports from the
public, mostly from the public

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:38.010 align:middle line:84%
but also from the
armed forces, and try

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:43.510 align:middle line:84%
to see if there was a scientific
value to those observations.

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:44.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yes.

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.770 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: And I was
bringing the databases

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:49.530 align:middle line:84%
from the European
side that I had

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:55.080 align:middle line:84%
been studying for many years
and starting to apply computer

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.830 align:middle line:90%
science research to this.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He and J Allen
Hynek-- incredible guys.

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:01.860 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:02.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aren't they?

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:02.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:03.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And great researchers.

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:04.932 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And they
were good friends,

00:08:04.932 --> 00:08:07.650 align:middle line:84%
and their families
were good friends.

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:09.690 align:middle line:90%
And it was history.

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:12.290 align:middle line:84%
It was UFO history that
was happening back then.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:13.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was.

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:17.550 align:middle line:84%
Could you imagine if we had
Hynek here today with Jacques

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:19.400 align:middle line:90%
and you as a researcher?

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.150 align:middle line:84%
I think you're one of
the best researchers

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:21.810 align:middle line:90%
out there today, Paola.

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:22.350 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Thank you.

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:23.150 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:25.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, we would get
some answers that we still

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:26.640 align:middle line:90%
haven't gotten yet.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.002 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Well, my job--

00:08:28.002 --> 00:08:29.460 align:middle line:84%
George, I want to
make this clear--

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:30.870 align:middle line:90%
is just to do the field work.

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:34.260 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to do, you know--

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:35.820 align:middle line:84%
I think, in this
country, there's

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.950 align:middle line:84%
a lot of entertainment
around UFOs.

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And so when I tell you that
I did nine years of going out

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.260 align:middle line:90%
in the field, I mean--

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.740 align:middle line:84%
where the location is, there
were snakes all the time

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:47.640 align:middle line:90%
when I was out there.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:48.682 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You hate snakes.

00:08:48.682 --> 00:08:49.740 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I hate snakes.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.120 align:middle line:90%
That's the only things I hate.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:52.920 align:middle line:90%
There were snakes.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:53.795 align:middle line:90%
There were scorpions.

00:08:53.795 --> 00:08:54.930 align:middle line:90%
It was darn hot.

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:59.040 align:middle line:84%
It was-- they kept changing
the location because they

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.420 align:middle line:90%
knew I was going down there.

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.370 align:middle line:84%
At a certain point, there were
even poisonous plants planted.

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:04.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh jeez.

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:06.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I didn't know
this, but the person

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:08.070 align:middle line:84%
I was working with
pulled them out,

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:11.320 align:middle line:84%
and he had a reaction
where he couldn't breathe.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.870 align:middle line:84%
And then I was
wondering, why did

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:16.140 align:middle line:84%
they plant these plants
just in the location where

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:17.400 align:middle line:90%
the UFO crashed?

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.830 align:middle line:84%
And they-- because they're
watching me the whole time,

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:22.830 align:middle line:84%
knowing I'm coming back,
knowing I'm bringing people.

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:25.950 align:middle line:84%
I brought Jaime Maussán
there, who did a story.

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:29.500 align:middle line:84%
He did the story for Gaia,
actually, on this case.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:33.010 align:middle line:90%
The 1945 case is powerful.

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:37.243 align:middle line:84%
I think it's got a lot that
will also help the Roswell case.

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:38.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us a
little bit about what

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:40.750 align:middle line:90%
happened in San Antonio.

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:44.790 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, in 1945, one
month after the atomic bomb,

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:47.910 align:middle line:84%
two little boys are
checking the fences.

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:49.860 align:middle line:84%
But these aren't
regular little boys.

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:54.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Jose Padilla is
driving a truck at that age.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.320 align:middle line:90%
Reme Baca's with him.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.820 align:middle line:90%
He's seven years old.

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:00.720 align:middle line:84%
These are doing the work of men
because they lived on a ranch.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.540 align:middle line:84%
And it was like a thunderstorm
just like Roswell.

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:06.450 align:middle line:84%
And this thing comes
in, this avocado shape.

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:08.420 align:middle line:84%
Again, remember, like
the Lonnie Zamora.

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:09.545 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting shape.

00:10:09.545 --> 00:10:11.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah,
the circular shape

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:14.100 align:middle line:84%
takes out a piece
of a radio tower

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:17.070 align:middle line:84%
and lands with
all its integrity.

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:18.990 align:middle line:84%
It does not crack
up or anything.

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:21.300 align:middle line:90%
It does have a panel missing.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.960 align:middle line:84%
So that when the boys who were
curious and saw the whole thing

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.380 align:middle line:84%
walked down about
500 feet from it,

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:31.890 align:middle line:84%
they take binoculars and can
see three creatures sliding

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:33.010 align:middle line:90%
back and forth.

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:34.947 align:middle line:84%
That's the part that's
difficult because--

00:10:34.947 --> 00:10:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can't
make this stuff up.

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:36.870 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No.

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:38.078 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know what it was.

00:10:38.078 --> 00:10:39.990 align:middle line:90%
There was no Kenneth Arnold.

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:42.180 align:middle line:84%
There was no word
"flying saucer."

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:43.890 align:middle line:90%
There was no TV.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:45.750 align:middle line:84%
They thought it
was a plane crash,

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:49.440 align:middle line:84%
and they were going to help
the people that were in there.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's what happened
with Jose Padilla.

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:54.900 align:middle line:90%
He heard them screaming.

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.000 align:middle line:84%
He said it sounded
like a baby crying,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.830 align:middle line:84%
and he wanted to run
in and help them.

00:10:58.830 --> 00:10:59.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's dramatic.

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:02.640 align:middle line:84%
We've got Jacques Vallée
again on "Open Minds"

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.340 align:middle line:84%
talking about government's
disclosure of some of these

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:06.450 align:middle line:90%
discoveries.

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:08.960 align:middle line:90%
Here's what he had to say.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.730 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: All the
attention, everything

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:14.390 align:middle line:84%
you see on TV and so on, is
what is the government going

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:15.390 align:middle line:90%
to reveal to us?

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:16.190 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Right.

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:20.330 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: Now my
approach isn't that.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.077 align:middle line:84%
I think-- I don't
think you should wait

00:11:22.077 --> 00:11:22.910 align:middle line:90%
for the government--

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:23.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: No, I agree.

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:25.040 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: --to tell
you what's going on.

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:25.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Hallelujah.

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.875 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: I mean, your
neighbors have seen UFOs.

00:11:27.875 --> 00:11:29.790 align:middle line:90%
In this case--

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:32.120 align:middle line:84%
I have a colleague
who says, well,

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.330 align:middle line:84%
you had some clearances
along the way when you worked

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:38.070 align:middle line:90%
on space projects and so on.

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:40.190 align:middle line:84%
But you'll never
have the clearances

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:45.245 align:middle line:84%
it takes to know what's really
going on in a case like this

00:11:45.245 --> 00:11:47.240 align:middle line:90%
in the Manhattan Project.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And my response is, I
don't need the clearances.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.640 align:middle line:90%
I have the witnesses.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.740 align:middle line:84%
These two little
kids were there.

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:56.480 align:middle line:90%
The government wasn't there.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:00.110 align:middle line:84%
These two little kids
were there on the spot

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:01.790 align:middle line:90%
when the thing crashed.

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:03.050 align:middle line:90%
It actually didn't crash.

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:04.580 align:middle line:90%
It crash landed.

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.650 align:middle line:90%
It was under power.

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:08.630 align:middle line:90%
It didn't break apart.

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And the entire
thing was recovered.

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:12.830 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:16.520 align:middle line:84%
So Lamar and Paola
had been researching

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.050 align:middle line:90%
this for four or five years--

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:19.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Oh, well, you're
in your 12th year or something

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:19.700 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: --four or
five years before.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.080 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah, yeah.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.360 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: Now I came in
because I had been looking

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.320 align:middle line:90%
at other cases in New Mexico.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:26.120 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Socorro and--

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:32.420 align:middle line:84%
>>VALLEE: A friend of mine
knew one of the witnesses, who

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:36.860 align:middle line:84%
by then was in his
late 70s and 80s,

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:39.390 align:middle line:84%
and wanted to
introduce me to him.

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And then I discovered that
Paola had already done research

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:45.080 align:middle line:90%
with that witness.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:49.430 align:middle line:84%
So we combined the information
we had, and then we

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:52.370 align:middle line:84%
went back to the site,
and that was the story.

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:54.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why hasn't
there been much coverage

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:58.880 align:middle line:84%
other than the things you've
brought to my show about this?

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.410 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: They don't care.

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:03.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm convinced
some people don't even

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.260 align:middle line:84%
believe in UFOs who
are talking about UFOs.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Very little field
research is done,

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.330 align:middle line:90%
maybe because it costs money.

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:14.600 align:middle line:84%
But there's very
little research done.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.888 align:middle line:84%
When I was in Italy, I
learned about this case.

00:13:16.888 --> 00:13:18.680 align:middle line:84%
I was living in Italy,
and my first thought

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:20.660 align:middle line:84%
was, why aren't my
colleagues jumping on this?

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:22.490 align:middle line:84%
Because the witnesses
are still alive.

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:22.885 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:13:22.885 --> 00:13:23.280 align:middle line:90%
It's perfect.

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.530 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: They're still alive!

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:27.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what are you
going to wait 60 years?

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And we lost half
of the witnesses.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.520 align:middle line:84%
But I can't
understand it, George,

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:35.000 align:middle line:84%
because the only kind
of research I like doing

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.375 align:middle line:90%
is field research.

00:13:36.375 --> 00:13:37.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love that.

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:38.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I love that
because I'm there.

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:39.650 align:middle line:90%
I talk to the people.

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:40.940 align:middle line:90%
They can show me.

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:42.530 align:middle line:90%
I don't do things on the phone.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:43.610 align:middle line:90%
I don't pick up--

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:48.200 align:middle line:84%
I don't listen to whistleblowers
from the CIA giving me

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.250 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:52.040 align:middle line:90%
I have to go to the place.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.243 align:middle line:90%
I have to live what they lived.

00:13:54.243 --> 00:13:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And then I have to
figure out if they're

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:58.700 align:middle line:84%
telling the truth, which
is the hardest part.

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:00.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's true.

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.750 align:middle line:84%
Do you ever hook them up
to a lie detector test?

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:05.197 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I don't need to
anymore after 40 years.

00:14:05.197 --> 00:14:07.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're the lie
detector test, aren't you?

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.240 align:middle line:84%
For instance, if they're
going to ask me for $250,000

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.880 align:middle line:84%
or they're going to say
something, I'm going to--

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.560 align:middle line:90%
my red flag goes up.

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:18.470 align:middle line:84%
If they say, the
world needs to know

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:23.390 align:middle line:84%
that there was a statement made
after the atomic bomb blasted,

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:26.450 align:middle line:84%
then I know that their agenda
is a little bit different.

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:28.460 align:middle line:90%
And that's Jose Padilla.

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:30.530 align:middle line:90%
He said, I don't want any money.

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:31.970 align:middle line:90%
He said, this happened.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:33.500 align:middle line:90%
You got to know this happened.

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.190 align:middle line:90%
I was nine years old.

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:36.210 align:middle line:90%
This is the truth.

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:38.300 align:middle line:84%
He said, my family
doesn't even believe me.

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:41.300 align:middle line:84%
He said, but I've had
to live with this,

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:44.480 align:middle line:84%
he said, because
we lived through--

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.270 align:middle line:84%
and Jacques talks about
this on that show--

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:49.160 align:middle line:90%
we had to live through the bomb.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.810 align:middle line:90%
It was not a test.

00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:53.900 align:middle line:84%
That bomb that
was exploded there

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:57.288 align:middle line:84%
was as powerful as
the one in Nagasaki.

00:14:57.288 --> 00:14:58.580 align:middle line:90%
And they never told the people.

00:14:58.580 --> 00:14:59.538 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And Hiroshima.

00:14:59.538 --> 00:15:02.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And there was
70,000 people living there.

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And the rain, the plutonium
or whatever the rain was--

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're all exposed.

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:08.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: 150 miles out.

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:09.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:10.297 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Nobody knew.

00:15:10.297 --> 00:15:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happened
to the oval-shaped craft?

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:17.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, it took them
about seven to eight days

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.550 align:middle line:84%
to recover that, and
they had to make a road.

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:22.640 align:middle line:84%
The road that's down there
now is made by the army.

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:23.900 align:middle line:90%
They had to cut--

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:25.385 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
laugh about this.

00:15:25.385 --> 00:15:28.010 align:middle line:84%
They had to cut the gate because
they couldn't take the weather

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:29.030 align:middle line:90%
balloon through it.

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And Jose and his father had
collected weather balloons

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:33.933 align:middle line:84%
for the army, so
they knew it wasn't--

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:34.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So they knew.

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:37.490 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: --they didn't
have to cut a gate.

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And so the boys
watched for seven days

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:44.720 align:middle line:84%
as they loaded it
on a lowboy and had

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.740 align:middle line:84%
to take kind of an A-frame to
go sideways over the overpass.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:52.100 align:middle line:84%
There's an underpass
near where it

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.380 align:middle line:84%
is that that thing
had to go through,

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:56.240 align:middle line:90%
so it had to be sideways.

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And I talked to
Reme Baca, and he

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:02.960 align:middle line:84%
said, because he worked for
the governor of Washington

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:07.340 align:middle line:84%
State, Dixy Lee, who was
involved with the Atomic Energy

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:10.940 align:middle line:84%
Commission, to thank her for
helping her get elected--

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.370 align:middle line:90%
the Hispanic community.

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:15.360 align:middle line:90%
She showed him the case.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.620 align:middle line:84%
The case is in the Atomic
Energy Commission files.

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:20.572 align:middle line:84%
It is not in the
Air Force files.

00:16:20.572 --> 00:16:22.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were there
any samples that they

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.530 align:middle line:84%
picked up, some kind
of metal or something?

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:27.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, what
happened was Jacques

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:30.170 align:middle line:84%
and I were working on
this for four years,

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:33.770 align:middle line:84%
and then all at once Jose
says, well-- he says,

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:36.800 align:middle line:84%
my niece was living
with my father,

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.810 align:middle line:90%
and you better talk to her.

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't know, when I went
to LA to talk to his niece,

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:44.660 align:middle line:84%
that his niece was
seven years old

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:47.400 align:middle line:84%
and had seen the foil,
the long pieces of foil--

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:48.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my--

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.705 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: --that you
scrunch up and then go back.

00:16:50.705 --> 00:16:52.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Unfolds back--
just like Roswell.

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:54.020 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Exactly.

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:56.030 align:middle line:90%
And so he didn't know that.

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:57.200 align:middle line:90%
But she told us that.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.750 align:middle line:84%
She said, we didn't have
Slinkies in those days,

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:03.369 align:middle line:84%
so Grandpa would give us
these long pieces of foil,

00:17:03.369 --> 00:17:05.119 align:middle line:84%
and we'd scrunch them,
and they'd go back.

00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And then-- this is
the funniest part--

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:11.329 align:middle line:84%
when that craft did
hit the radio tower,

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:15.809 align:middle line:84%
it spewed out about 10 pounds of
angel hair that the two boys--

00:17:15.809 --> 00:17:16.609 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Collected?

00:17:16.609 --> 00:17:19.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: --collected
because they lit up.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.510 align:middle line:84%
So guess what they
did with them.

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:22.369 align:middle line:84%
They trimmed the
Christmas trees.

00:17:22.369 --> 00:17:23.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where is it now?

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:26.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, this
is 76 years ago.

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:28.920 align:middle line:84%
So the house that
they were living in--

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:31.400 align:middle line:84%
and I went to the
location-- burned down.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And because this stuff
was so beautiful--

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:37.790 align:middle line:84%
and they had 10 pounds of it
that lit up in pink and purple

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:38.690 align:middle line:90%
and so forth--

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:40.230 align:middle line:84%
could have been
fiber optics or--

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:40.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It could have been.

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:41.360 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: --like that.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:41.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Could have been.

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:43.733 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: They gave it
to all the neighbors.

00:17:43.733 --> 00:17:46.190 align:middle line:84%
So I said to Jose,
look, you're going

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:47.900 align:middle line:84%
to need to talk to
all your neighbors

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.660 align:middle line:84%
to see if they have any
Christmas decorations left.

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:52.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They might
in boxes from all--

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:53.060 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes!

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:53.765 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You know?

00:17:53.765 --> 00:17:54.565 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:17:54.565 --> 00:17:56.660 align:middle line:84%
Because they gave it
to all the neighbors,

00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:58.560 align:middle line:84%
because the neighbors
saw it on the windows.

00:17:58.560 --> 00:17:58.850 align:middle line:90%
They put it on the windows.

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:00.267 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What a
discovery, Paola--

00:18:00.267 --> 00:18:01.970 align:middle line:90%
if they're still there.

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:03.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Oh, that would
be amazing, wouldn't it?

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:04.825 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh my god,
get great material.

00:18:04.825 --> 00:18:06.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Because that's
the original material.

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking
of-- you could start

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:11.747 align:middle line:84%
a movie with these kids just
decorating the Christmas trees

00:18:11.747 --> 00:18:13.580 align:middle line:84%
and then flash back to
they're picking it up

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:16.890 align:middle line:84%
and all the mesquite
and all the bushes,

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:18.140 align:middle line:90%
because they picked it up.

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:19.550 align:middle line:90%
And it was so pretty.

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:21.630 align:middle line:90%
It lit up by itself.

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:25.913 align:middle line:84%
And they picked it up and
put it in a big canvas bag.

00:18:25.913 --> 00:18:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, now,
Roswell happened two years

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:29.700 align:middle line:90%
after this event, right?

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:30.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yet Roswell
has the notoriety.

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:35.320 align:middle line:90%
San Antonio doesn't.

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:37.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I hope it
doesn't get notoriety.

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:39.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to
see T-shirts or I

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.503 align:middle line:84%
don't need to see cups
with San Antonio on them.

00:18:41.503 --> 00:18:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And I hope-- I
don't mean to say--

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:44.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or festivals
or anything like that.

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:46.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: --or festivals
or people selling

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:47.690 align:middle line:90%
lemonade and all their wares.

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:51.740 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately-- I have
a European mentality--

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:54.060 align:middle line:84%
this belongs in
university and in science.

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:54.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:56.090 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It does not
belong in the circus.

00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:57.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I agree.

00:18:57.050 --> 00:19:00.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And the problem
with the UFO material,

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:03.560 align:middle line:84%
the way it's presented, is
if you're at the Marriott

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:06.980 align:middle line:84%
and you've got a conference
and somebody walks

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:11.610 align:middle line:84%
by who's a scientist and he
sees a rubber alien out--

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:13.200 align:middle line:90%
he's not going to come in.

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.780 align:middle line:90%
And so what I did--

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:18.230 align:middle line:84%
yeah-- was have the Laughlin
conference in Laughlin, Nevada,

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:19.932 align:middle line:84%
once a year where
it's geared towards--

00:19:19.932 --> 00:19:21.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've gone to
some of your conferences.

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:22.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, yeah, you--

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:23.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're well
put together, by the way.

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:24.290 align:middle line:90%
You do a good job.

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:26.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And there's no
little gray aliens out there.

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:29.300 align:middle line:84%
What there is the
pictures of the Hubble,

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:34.280 align:middle line:84%
and the red carpet's all the
Hubble telescope and photos

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.740 align:middle line:90%
of the galaxies and so forth.

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:39.680 align:middle line:84%
I think Jacques and I have
one thing in common, George--

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.365 align:middle line:90%
we want science to get involved.

00:19:41.365 --> 00:19:42.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's
so important.

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:44.010 align:middle line:90%
And that's your background.

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:46.610 align:middle line:84%
Your background is an
investigative reporter.

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:48.530 align:middle line:90%
You want real science.

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think you'll
get that eventually.

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:52.400 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I'm hoping
that it doesn't

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.670 align:middle line:84%
have a stigma because we need
more scientists like Jacques

00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:59.090 align:middle line:84%
and Hynek, and they're
afraid that they're

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:02.480 align:middle line:84%
going to be stigmatized
with the UFO question.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:06.770 align:middle line:84%
But today in 2021,
my kids are going,

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:09.410 align:middle line:84%
Mom, it's OK because it's
in "The New York Times."

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:11.442 align:middle line:90%
Ad I'm going, OK.

00:20:11.442 --> 00:20:12.650 align:middle line:90%
It's in "The New York Times."

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:14.120 align:middle line:90%
I've been working for 40 years.

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.110 align:middle line:90%
You never believed it.

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:17.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: But now that it's
in "The New York Times."

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:18.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Now you believe it.

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:20.180 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about the
researchers that

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:22.700 align:middle line:84%
are up and coming,
because we've lost

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:27.680 align:middle line:84%
so many great ones-- the Hyneks,
Stanton Friedman, people who

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:30.200 align:middle line:84%
are just good
dedicated ufologists

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.240 align:middle line:90%
who investigated these things.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.820 align:middle line:84%
Eventually people are going to
get older and older and older

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:35.930 align:middle line:90%
and die off.

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:38.075 align:middle line:90%
Are we replacing them?

00:20:38.075 --> 00:20:40.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: God, George, that's a
good question you're asking me.

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:44.730 align:middle line:10%
You and I, we're on the same
wavelength with that thought.

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:48.630 align:middle line:84%
It's so sad because I know
that I'm going to retire soon.

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:52.110 align:middle line:84%
All my archive is going
to Rice University--

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:54.660 align:middle line:84%
all Jacques' and all
Whitley Strieber's.

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:57.990 align:middle line:84%
So we won't lose
the research we did.

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:00.840 align:middle line:84%
It's going to Rice at the
Department of Religious Studies

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:02.040 align:middle line:90%
with Jeff Kripal.

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.180 align:middle line:84%
I had to do something
with all of it.

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.120 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know.

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:08.550 align:middle line:84%
It's like, if I see
any young people--

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:11.460 align:middle line:84%
in Laughlin, we give an
award to a young researcher.

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:13.560 align:middle line:90%
I go looking for them.

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:16.140 align:middle line:84%
But it can't be a
young researcher who

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:18.180 align:middle line:90%
wants to be famous or anything.

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:21.062 align:middle line:84%
It has to be somebody
who when they were little

00:21:21.062 --> 00:21:22.020 align:middle line:90%
were passionate about--

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:23.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just dedicated to it.

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:24.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Dedicated to it, yeah.

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.025 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we got
another clip for you to see--

00:21:27.025 --> 00:21:31.680 align:middle line:84%
Robert Salas, who has talked
about UFOs by nuke sites--

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.170 align:middle line:84%
again, on Regina Meredith's
"Open Mind" show.

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:36.570 align:middle line:84%
She has collected
some great interviews.

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:37.805 align:middle line:90%
Here's another one.

00:21:37.805 --> 00:21:39.930 align:middle line:10%
>>ROBERT SALAS: I get a
call from my topside guard,

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:42.540 align:middle line:10%
and he's saying, well,
sir, we've been--

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:45.360 align:middle line:10%
the guards and I have been
out looking at the stars,

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:49.380 align:middle line:10%
and we've been seeing some
strange flying objects up here

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:55.450 align:middle line:10%
going at high speeds, stopping
on a dime, reversing course,

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:58.727 align:middle line:10%
making 90-degree turns,
not making any sounds--

00:21:58.727 --> 00:22:00.060 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: At very high speeds?

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:04.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SALAS: --very high
speeds, very strange.

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And they're not any kind of
aircraft that we know of.

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And I even said,
you mean like UFOs?

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:16.660 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, sir,
we can't explain them.

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:19.020 align:middle line:90%
And I just wanted to report it.

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:21.167 align:middle line:84%
I said, OK, thank
you for your report.

00:22:21.167 --> 00:22:22.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Now, where were you?

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:23.850 align:middle line:90%
You say he was topside.

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:25.620 align:middle line:84%
So that indicates
you were not topside.

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:26.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SALAS: No, I'm sorry.

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:31.410 align:middle line:84%
I was 60 feet underground in a
hardened, concrete, and steel

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:32.230 align:middle line:90%
capsule.

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:34.977 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: So this is
extremely secure, I take it.

00:22:34.977 --> 00:22:36.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SALAS: Extremely secure.

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:37.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Well, I mean,
with that many missiles,

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:38.860 align:middle line:90%
it should be extremely secure.

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:39.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SALAS: Yeah.

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:42.900 align:middle line:84%
Supposedly, we were able to
withstand a nuclear blast

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:43.800 align:middle line:90%
overhead.

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:44.600 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: OK.

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:48.108 align:middle line:84%
>>SALAS: So this was a very
secure facility, obviously.

00:22:48.108 --> 00:22:50.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: And is this where
the controls for the silo

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.110 align:middle line:84%
are located,
underneath the ground?

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:53.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SALAS: The controls
for all the missiles

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:56.050 align:middle line:90%
were all located underground.

00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:58.545 align:middle line:84%
They had no controls
topside or ground level.

00:22:58.545 --> 00:23:00.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Just setting
the stage for what's

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:01.220 align:middle line:90%
going to happen.

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:02.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SALAS: Right, right.

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:08.130 align:middle line:84%
So-- and this is an important
point because first thing

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:09.550 align:middle line:84%
people are going
to want to think

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:12.210 align:middle line:84%
is this was some kind of a
hoax, that it was perpetrated

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:14.280 align:middle line:90%
by those guys upstairs.

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:15.930 align:middle line:90%
It was not.

00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:18.540 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, this phone call--
this first phone call,

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:22.560 align:middle line:84%
I basically hung up on him,
thanked him, and thought,

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.150 align:middle line:90%
you know, it's a little strange.

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:25.920 align:middle line:90%
This guy's a professional.

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:30.960 align:middle line:84%
I knew the guard, and he
was always very straight

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:34.120 align:middle line:84%
and did not joke around,
things like that.

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:38.610 align:middle line:84%
So are these guys trying to
kid me or what, you know?

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:43.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, went back to my book, and
then five minutes or so later,

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:45.960 align:middle line:90%
I get another call.

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:48.660 align:middle line:84%
This time, the same guard
is screaming into the phone.

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:51.420 align:middle line:90%
And he's obviously frightened.

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:54.790 align:middle line:90%
He's yelling into the phone.

00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:56.310 align:middle line:90%
He's not speaking his words.

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:57.540 align:middle line:90%
He's yelling them.

00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And he says, we've got
all the guards out here.

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:04.800 align:middle line:84%
They've all got
their weapons drawn.

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking out
the front window,

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:09.580 align:middle line:84%
and I see this
glowing, red object.

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:18.270 align:middle line:84%
It's an elongated oval shape,
pulsating red-orange light,

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:19.230 align:middle line:90%
sitting--

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:21.630 align:middle line:84%
or hovering just
above the front gate--

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:24.690 align:middle line:90%
no noise, absolutely silent.

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:26.963 align:middle line:90%
And they're scared to death.

00:24:26.963 --> 00:24:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does your lie
detector say about that?

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:30.060 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:31.890 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I know him very well.

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:35.010 align:middle line:84%
His testimony at the
citizen hearing--

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:35.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Years ago.

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:40.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: --years ago shook all
those congressmen and senators

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:42.130 align:middle line:90%
that were there.

00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:46.110 align:middle line:84%
This goes with the idea
that-- and I always tease--

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:49.900 align:middle line:84%
that UFOs or whatever that
is is not on vacation.

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:50.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:56.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: They're seen
over particular places that

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:59.710 align:middle line:90%
could be detrimental to us.

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:01.510 align:middle line:90%
And I want to say two things.

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:05.830 align:middle line:84%
Number one, Robert told me later
that when he was down there--

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:07.800 align:middle line:84%
I said, did you get
any impressions?

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:10.170 align:middle line:84%
Robert told me later
that in his mind came,

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:11.830 align:middle line:90%
we could shut you down.

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:12.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like that?

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Like that,
we can shut you down.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.950 align:middle line:84%
They were pointed-- because
it was the Cold War,

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:21.510 align:middle line:84%
and they were pointed at
the Soviet Union and Europe.

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And the Soviet Union evidently
had an incident where

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:28.060 align:middle line:90%
the code started on their own.

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:30.870 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't take
a rocket scientist

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:34.335 align:middle line:90%
to see that 1945 was a message.

00:25:34.335 --> 00:25:36.960 align:middle line:84%
I don't think those things were
just flying around because they

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.600 align:middle line:90%
wanted to see New Mexico.

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They picked up an
atomic explosion on this

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:43.280 align:middle line:90%
planet--

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.950 align:middle line:90%
two of them in 1945--

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:48.260 align:middle line:90%
Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:51.890 align:middle line:84%
And they realized these
people are in the game now.

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:53.267 align:middle line:90%
We have to go there.

00:25:53.267 --> 00:25:54.350 align:middle line:90%
And that's how it started.

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:57.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: These people
are affecting our level

00:25:57.350 --> 00:26:03.200 align:middle line:84%
of dimension, because when
you blast a nuclear bomb--

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:06.480 align:middle line:84%
and the A-bomb was nothing
like-- the H-bomb was worse.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You could be
tearing something in space.

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:09.320 align:middle line:90%
Who knows.

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Exactly.

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And you're coming into
our territory now.

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:15.680 align:middle line:84%
If they were a threat, they
would have done it that--

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:16.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I thought so.

00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:17.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: If they
were a threat--

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:18.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A long time ago.

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:20.058 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: --they would
have done it then.

00:26:20.058 --> 00:26:22.025 align:middle line:84%
They would have said,
these species are crazy.

00:26:22.025 --> 00:26:22.490 align:middle line:90%
They are--

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:23.448 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wipe them out.

00:26:23.448 --> 00:26:24.800 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Wipe them out.

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.530 align:middle line:84%
Let's just start over
again with this planet.

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:33.320 align:middle line:84%
This idea that UFOs are a
threat has an agenda behind it.

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:36.000 align:middle line:90%
And UFOS could have--

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.250 align:middle line:90%
well, they didn't do anything.

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:40.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they scared
those poor military guys.

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:41.510 align:middle line:90%
They scared them.

00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:43.640 align:middle line:84%
But did they-- they
shut the missiles down,

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:46.550 align:middle line:84%
and you could bring
them back up in a week.

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:49.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If we had
a voice analyzer who

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:52.670 align:middle line:84%
deals with truth
watching Robert Salas,

00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:55.490 align:middle line:84%
I guarantee you,
Paola, he would say,

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:57.230 align:middle line:90%
that man's telling the truth.

00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:58.490 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Of course.

00:26:58.490 --> 00:26:59.910 align:middle line:90%
Well, they were scared.

00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:04.670 align:middle line:84%
He's-- I mean, he's not going
to go and risk his career

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:06.230 align:middle line:90%
as a military man.

00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:08.570 align:middle line:84%
And Steven Greer's
Disclosure Project

00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:10.940 align:middle line:84%
shows that all those
guys risked their career.

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:13.370 align:middle line:84%
But they thought it was
time to tell the truth.

00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:14.330 align:middle line:90%
And it is time.

00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:15.930 align:middle line:90%
Let's get over it.

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:17.190 align:middle line:90%
It is time to tell the truth.

00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:17.990 align:middle line:90%
Let's get over it.

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:20.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a
message for humanity?

00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:23.180 align:middle line:84%
Based on everything
you have investigated,

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:24.860 align:middle line:90%
what do you think is happening?

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:26.060 align:middle line:90%
They're visiting us?

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:27.800 align:middle line:90%
They're coming here?

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.980 align:middle line:84%
They have been since the
beginning of mankind?

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:32.160 align:middle line:90%
What's going on, Paola?

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I'm not that wise,
but I did talk to Edgar Mitchell

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:35.817 align:middle line:90%
once.

00:27:35.817 --> 00:27:36.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I miss him.

00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:37.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I miss him too.

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:39.395 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Apollo 14 astronaut.

00:27:39.395 --> 00:27:40.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Astronaut-- yeah.

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:40.460 align:middle line:90%
He said--

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:40.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Walked on the moon.

00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:42.253 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: You know
what he said to me?

00:27:42.253 --> 00:27:44.870 align:middle line:84%
I said, do you think people
are ready for disclosure?

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:45.800 align:middle line:90%
He said, no.

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:46.700 align:middle line:90%
I said, why?

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:49.140 align:middle line:84%
He said, they can't get
along with each other.

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:52.070 align:middle line:84%
How are they going to get along
with extraterrestrial races

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:54.200 align:middle line:84%
that look completely
different from them?

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:57.220 align:middle line:84%
How are they going to get along
with all these different types

00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:58.020 align:middle line:90%
of races?

00:27:58.020 --> 00:27:59.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, you know that
Clifford Stone

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:03.290 align:middle line:84%
said there was 57
different species he

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:05.670 align:middle line:84%
was dealing with that
he had seen in a manual.

00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:06.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:09.590 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I mean, we
have exo-racism as it is.

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:11.390 align:middle line:90%
The reptilians are bad.

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:12.860 align:middle line:90%
There's abductions.

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:13.800 align:middle line:90%
The Nordics are good.

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:14.600 align:middle line:90%
They're angels.

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:15.470 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:17.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Greys
do their thing.

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:20.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I mean,
it's ridiculous

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:23.840 align:middle line:84%
how we have already made
a decision about something

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.640 align:middle line:84%
we don't really know
that much about.

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And so when Mitchell
told me, I felt sad

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:31.342 align:middle line:84%
because I think you
and I want to know--

00:28:31.342 --> 00:28:32.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We want the answers.

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:34.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: We want the
answers before we go--

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:34.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We want the answers.

00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:35.992 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: --to the other place.

00:28:35.992 --> 00:28:38.270 align:middle line:90%
It's like, we want the answers.

00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:41.390 align:middle line:84%
But even the ETs I don't
think want to give us

00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:42.650 align:middle line:90%
the answers right now.

00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And Jacques said
something very beautiful

00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:46.100 align:middle line:90%
that I want to share with you.

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:49.100 align:middle line:84%
He said, look-- he
said, this phenomena

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:54.530 align:middle line:84%
is a teaching mechanism to show
us who we are as a species.

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:58.100 align:middle line:84%
He said, every now and
then, we look up and wonder.

00:28:58.100 --> 00:28:59.660 align:middle line:90%
We see a UFO.

00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And he says, we-- because
he did when he was young.

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And he says, we have
to open our minds

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:08.000 align:middle line:84%
and we have to think
outside the box.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And I love that,
because in the end,

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:14.510 align:middle line:84%
there isn't a whole bunch
you can do with a sighting.

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:15.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:19.100 align:middle line:84%
When you saw the movie "Close
Encounters of the Third Kind,"

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:22.880 align:middle line:84%
Hynek walked in with his
pipe and you saw Lacombe.

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.187 align:middle line:90%
Had you known Jacques Vallée--

00:29:24.187 --> 00:29:25.520 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No, no, I didn't know.

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:25.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --prior to that?

00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:26.390 align:middle line:90%
You didn't?

00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:26.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No.

00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:28.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you didn't put
the two and two together--

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:28.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No, no.

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --that he
was that person?

00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:33.357 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you went and
saw the movie today--

00:29:33.357 --> 00:29:35.690 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: No, I put two and
two that he was that person,

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:36.538 align:middle line:90%
but he was--

00:29:36.538 --> 00:29:38.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you didn't
know him that well.

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:39.788 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I didn't
know him at all.

00:29:39.788 --> 00:29:41.178 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I just
worked with Hynek,

00:29:41.178 --> 00:29:42.470 align:middle line:90%
and I asked Jacques about that.

00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And he had already
moved to Silicon Valley

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:48.440 align:middle line:84%
and worked in Silicon Valley
and was in California.

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:51.530 align:middle line:84%
Destiny, which has
guided my career,

00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:54.990 align:middle line:84%
has placed all these incidents
and all these people,

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:58.610 align:middle line:84%
whether it be Edgar Mitch
or Colonel Corso in my life

00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:00.530 align:middle line:90%
just to do a job.

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:02.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've been
blessed in all that.

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:03.860 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I do the job.

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:05.660 align:middle line:90%
I do what I'm supposed to do.

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:06.620 align:middle line:90%
I archive it.

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:08.570 align:middle line:90%
It's going to Rice University.

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:10.850 align:middle line:84%
And George, that's
really all there is.

00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:12.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The
government has released

00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:16.490 align:middle line:84%
a report that was mandated
in the COVID-19 bill

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:22.520 align:middle line:84%
legislation which basically
said nothing other than we don't

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:24.080 align:middle line:90%
really know what these are.

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:26.000 align:middle line:90%
We can't say they're ours.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.410 align:middle line:90%
We don't think they are.

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:30.050 align:middle line:84%
We can't say they're
Russian or Chinese.

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:32.570 align:middle line:84%
We can't say they're
extraterrestrial.

00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:38.960 align:middle line:84%
All we can say is they're UAPs,
unidentified aerial phenomena.

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.730 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what they are.

00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:44.300 align:middle line:84%
Will we ever get real
disclosure, Paola?

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:46.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I think
you can answer that.

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:47.697 align:middle line:90%
For what reason?

00:30:47.697 --> 00:30:50.030 align:middle line:84%
Because they decided they're
going to tell us the truth?

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:53.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the vested interest
in the back engineering

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:57.800 align:middle line:84%
and the advanced technologies
is really the secret.

00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:00.440 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that until
I met Colonel Corso.

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:04.430 align:middle line:84%
So if you see even
Steven Greer's movie

00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:07.118 align:middle line:84%
"The Cosmic Hoax," you realize
we've back engineered stuff.

00:31:07.118 --> 00:31:09.410 align:middle line:84%
So we don't know if it's our
stuff or their stuff we're

00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:10.700 align:middle line:90%
looking at anymore.

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:13.130 align:middle line:90%
It's so confusing.

00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:17.930 align:middle line:84%
My test is, if it
has an agenda--

00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:21.170 align:middle line:84%
and the agenda, if you look
at Harry Reid, Marco Rubio,

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:23.270 align:middle line:84%
and all those guys,
is to go to Congress

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:27.200 align:middle line:84%
to say it's a threat so we get
more money to do something.

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:34.370 align:middle line:84%
If that's the agenda, then
we're not looking at honesty.

00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:36.542 align:middle line:90%
And that's not where I'm going.

00:31:36.542 --> 00:31:38.000 align:middle line:84%
Like Jacques said,
that's not where

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm going for the information.

00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:40.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to the witnesses.

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:42.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to the countries.

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:45.500 align:middle line:84%
I've been working extensively
in Latin America right now.

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:47.220 align:middle line:90%
I've been to Colombia.

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:48.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good sightings there?

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:50.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Oh, not
only sightings.

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:52.760 align:middle line:84%
There's people coming
off spacecraft there.

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:53.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god.

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:55.077 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: We have
witnesses-- five

00:31:55.077 --> 00:31:59.750 align:middle line:84%
and six-- journalists in the
Chilca Desert, Sixto Paz.

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:01.100 align:middle line:90%
Journalists are there.

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:04.562 align:middle line:84%
The thing lands,
and you'd say, well,

00:32:04.562 --> 00:32:06.770 align:middle line:84%
why does it happen there
that it doesn't happen here?

00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:10.228 align:middle line:84%
Because here, if something
lands and somebody comes out,

00:32:10.228 --> 00:32:12.020 align:middle line:84%
just like "The Day the
Earth Stood Still--"

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:12.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We shoot at it.

00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: --we shoot them.

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:13.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:14.647 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're right.

00:32:14.647 --> 00:32:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: There's all these
people, and they're so nice,

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:18.540 align:middle line:90%
and they're out in the desert.

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And the thing's going to land
because it's basically safer.

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:26.150 align:middle line:84%
So for me, I'm not
looking at the government.

00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:30.410 align:middle line:84%
I'd rather go to Colombia,
Argentina, Chile--

00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:32.600 align:middle line:84%
I've been to the
Atacama Desert twice.

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:36.650 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to go there
so that I'm there

00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:39.110 align:middle line:84%
looking at the people
that are not lying,

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:41.780 align:middle line:84%
that don't want to be on TV,
that don't ask for money,

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:44.390 align:middle line:90%
and ask them, what did you see?

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:46.050 align:middle line:90%
What were they like?

00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:47.780 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
the message is?

00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And all I can share
with you right now

00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:52.685 align:middle line:84%
is that in Latin America
the message is we're

00:32:52.685 --> 00:32:56.805 align:middle line:84%
an ecological last
days disaster.

00:32:56.805 --> 00:32:57.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:02.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, all of this lately has
been from that 2004 incident

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:07.400 align:middle line:84%
off the "USS Nimitz," where our
Navy fighter pilots witnessed

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:12.290 align:middle line:84%
what they have called the Tic
Tac UAPs, whatever they may be.

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:14.030 align:middle line:90%
Let's look.

00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:19.040 align:middle line:84%
>> On December 16th, 2017, two
videos emerged on the internet

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:21.950 align:middle line:84%
that showed Navy pilots
encountering mysterious

00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:25.160 align:middle line:84%
spherical objects that move
through the air in ways that

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:26.670 align:middle line:90%
mystified experts.

00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:28.970 align:middle line:84%
>> My gosh, there's a
whole fleet of them.

00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:30.107 align:middle line:90%
Look on the SA.

00:33:30.107 --> 00:33:31.190 align:middle line:90%
They're all going against.

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:33.812 align:middle line:84%
The wind's 120
miles to the west.

00:33:33.812 --> 00:33:36.160 align:middle line:90%
>> What the hell is that?

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:39.260 align:middle line:90%
Have you got a moving target?

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:42.710 align:middle line:84%
>> A third video,
released in March 2018,

00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:45.170 align:middle line:90%
depicted a similar encounter.

00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:47.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Look at that thing.

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:49.160 align:middle line:90%
It's rotating.

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:53.810 align:middle line:10%
>> These three videos are
referred to as Flir 1, Gimbal,

00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:55.850 align:middle line:10%
and GoFast.

00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:56.910 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh my gosh, dude.

00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:57.710 align:middle line:10%
>> Wow.

00:33:57.710 --> 00:33:58.880 align:middle line:10%
What is that, man?

00:33:58.880 --> 00:33:59.750 align:middle line:90%
Look at it fly.

00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:04.170 align:middle line:90%


00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:08.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Years earlier, the videos
captured by a US Navy F/A-18

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:13.280 align:middle line:84%
Super Hornet documents an
incident that occurred in 2004

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:16.070 align:middle line:84%
known as the
"Nimitz" encounters,

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:19.130 align:middle line:84%
so named for the fighter
pilots of "USS Nimitz"

00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:22.190 align:middle line:84%
carrier strike group, who
spotted the mysterious flying

00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:23.600 align:middle line:90%
bodies.

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.159 align:middle line:90%
>> 2.5 dB.

00:34:25.159 --> 00:34:28.159 align:middle line:84%
>> The pilots reported
as strange-shaped object

00:34:28.159 --> 00:34:33.139 align:middle line:84%
resembling the popular Tic Tac
breath mint about 100 miles off

00:34:33.139 --> 00:34:35.570 align:middle line:90%
the coast of San Diego.

00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:38.659 align:middle line:10%
What makes these particular
videos so significant

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:41.840 align:middle line:10%
is the fact that
in September 2019

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:44.239 align:middle line:10%
the official spokesperson
for the Deputy

00:34:44.239 --> 00:34:47.210 align:middle line:10%
Chief of Naval Operations
for Information Warfare

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:49.010 align:middle line:10%
confirmed publicly--

00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:51.620 align:middle line:10%
>> The Navy designates the
objects contained in these

00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:55.730 align:middle line:10%
videos as unidentified
aerial phenomena.

00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:59.000 align:middle line:84%
>> While that statement alone
is of historical significance,

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.230 align:middle line:84%
what the videos themselves
suggest is remarkable.

00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:06.500 align:middle line:84%
Ongoing incursions of
unidentified aerial phenomena,

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:11.390 align:middle line:84%
or UAPs, are being captured
on video by the US Navy

00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:13.640 align:middle line:84%
that maneuver in ways
that are impossible

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:18.520 align:middle line:84%
for any current acknowledged
aviation technology.

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:19.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dramatic.

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:19.930 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: It is.

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:20.730 align:middle line:90%
It's dramatic.

00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:21.840 align:middle line:90%
But can I add something?

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:25.950 align:middle line:84%
When I was living in
Italy, I got similar photos

00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:31.260 align:middle line:84%
from a pilot who was my friend
who was a pilot for Alitalia.

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And he had gone
across the Atlantic,

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:35.530 align:middle line:84%
and he actually
photographed those things.

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:38.580 align:middle line:84%
So pilots have
seen these things.

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:41.430 align:middle line:84%
And I love this video because
the guys look like they're

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:42.400 align:middle line:90%
having a great time.

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:42.700 align:middle line:90%
It's like--

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:44.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, they were-- they
loved chasing these things.

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:45.480 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: He's chasing them.

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:46.350 align:middle line:90%
They're cat and mouse.

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:47.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's like a video game.

00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:48.805 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It's
like a video game.

00:35:48.805 --> 00:35:50.670 align:middle line:84%
If they would leave
it at that and not

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:52.410 align:middle line:90%
make it a national threat--

00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:53.520 align:middle line:90%
that's cat and mouse.

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:56.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that isn't like those
things were after anybody.

00:35:56.610 --> 00:35:59.040 align:middle line:84%
It's like saying,
hey, we're here.

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:01.510 align:middle line:84%
Malmstrom is like,
hey, we're here.

00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:02.390 align:middle line:90%
We can shut you down.

00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:03.190 align:middle line:90%
It's been going--

00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:04.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We want
you to know that--

00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:04.860 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: We're just watching.

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:06.527 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --you know,
that kind of thing.

00:36:06.527 --> 00:36:08.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: We're watching--
don't go overboard.

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:09.780 align:middle line:90%
We're here.

00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:13.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, anybody that uses logic
knows if-- hey, we're here--

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.690 align:middle line:84%
you consider that a
threat that you're

00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:18.540 align:middle line:84%
going to make space-based
weapons to go after them

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:20.040 align:middle line:90%
and have a space war.

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:22.920 align:middle line:84%
I remember Colonel Corso
telling me-- he said, Paola--

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:25.150 align:middle line:84%
he said, we knew
they were there.

00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:27.630 align:middle line:84%
He says, but the
technology is so great

00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:32.400 align:middle line:84%
that if we ever shot at them it
would be like shooting cannons

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.330 align:middle line:90%
in the old days.

00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:34.413 align:middle line:90%
And this is Colonel Corso.

00:36:34.413 --> 00:36:35.257 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:36:35.257 --> 00:36:36.090 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, so--

00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:38.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me about "Trinity"
that you wrote with Jacques

00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:39.380 align:middle line:90%
Vallée.

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:42.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, we decided
to call it "Trinity"

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:44.640 align:middle line:84%
because Jacques did
extensive research

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:49.320 align:middle line:84%
on what really happened
at the end of World War II

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:53.580 align:middle line:90%
to get Japan to surrender.

00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:55.230 align:middle line:90%
He read so many books that--

00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:58.830 align:middle line:84%
I read the books he was
reading on the history.

00:36:58.830 --> 00:37:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And the Manhattan Project
was very important.

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:05.820 align:middle line:84%
Every time I-- the
crash happened 13 miles

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:10.170 align:middle line:84%
from even that banner that
Oppenheimer put down there.

00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:14.550 align:middle line:84%
Oppenheimer had quite a
career afterwards, almost

00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:18.033 align:middle line:84%
regretting his role in
opening up the nuclear--

00:37:18.033 --> 00:37:19.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was the
father of the atomic bomb.

00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:20.750 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I know.

00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:24.060 align:middle line:90%
And so was Fermi, our Italian--

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:25.530 align:middle line:90%
our Nobel Prize--

00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:27.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It did
stop World War II.

00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:30.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, if
you read our book,

00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:36.570 align:middle line:84%
it's very interesting that the
emperor was going to surrender

00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:37.630 align:middle line:90%
before that and that--

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:38.547 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe, maybe.

00:37:38.547 --> 00:37:39.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes, yes.

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And that brings almost
Jacques very emotional

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:45.090 align:middle line:84%
because he read the
Japanese version

00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:48.600 align:middle line:90%
and they couldn't go on anyway.

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:52.830 align:middle line:84%
But the Nagasaki and
Hiroshima was a statement.

00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:53.790 align:middle line:90%
It was a statement.

00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:57.870 align:middle line:84%
It was like, we can annihilate
you with this new weapon.

00:37:57.870 --> 00:38:00.060 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is
then other countries

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:03.263 align:middle line:84%
get that weapon, George,
and you're playing chess.

00:38:03.263 --> 00:38:04.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And look
what's happened.

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:05.670 align:middle line:90%
Look where we are today.

00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:06.240 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: --today.

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:07.115 align:middle line:90%
You're playing chess.

00:38:07.115 --> 00:38:09.900 align:middle line:84%
So the only way you
can win this game

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:12.180 align:middle line:90%
is to keep it a check mate.

00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:13.427 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, exactly.

00:38:13.427 --> 00:38:15.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: You don't think
that whoever's out there

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:17.370 align:middle line:90%
is watching this?

00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:19.140 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
wonder if they're

00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:22.560 align:middle line:84%
going to destroy themselves
ecologically first,

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:25.680 align:middle line:84%
then maybe somebody--
an accident.

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:27.180 align:middle line:90%
We're going to have an accident.

00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:28.050 align:middle line:90%
We had Chernobyl.

00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:29.400 align:middle line:90%
We had Fukushima.

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:34.440 align:middle line:84%
UFOs were seen around those
two areas when we had that.

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:39.360 align:middle line:84%
And that was serious, I mean,
especially Chernobyl and all

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:41.850 align:middle line:90%
the food supply and everything.

00:38:41.850 --> 00:38:46.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't think people are looking
at the behavior of the humans.

00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:49.080 align:middle line:84%
They're looking too
much at the behavior

00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:50.400 align:middle line:90%
of whoever is visiting.

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have
a name for that.

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:56.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why aren't they landing
so it's so obvious for us?

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:58.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: You saw "The Day
the Earth Stood Still."

00:38:58.440 --> 00:38:59.415 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We did.

00:38:59.415 --> 00:38:59.670 align:middle line:90%
And look what we did.

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:00.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: We shot them.

00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:01.337 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We shot them.

00:39:01.337 --> 00:39:03.090 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And then
I remember reading

00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:06.180 align:middle line:84%
"Childhood's"-- the book, and
it's, the overlords came over

00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:08.230 align:middle line:84%
and took all the
kids off the planet.

00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:13.320 align:middle line:84%
It would be really interpreted
as an alien invasion.

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:16.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will we ever get these
answers, Paola, the answers

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:18.422 align:middle line:84%
to the questions you've been
looking for all your career?

00:39:18.422 --> 00:39:20.380 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And you've been
looking for them too.

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:21.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I've been
looking for them too.

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:22.125 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, I know.

00:39:22.125 --> 00:39:22.590 align:middle line:90%
We've been both--

00:39:22.590 --> 00:39:24.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thank god I've
got researchers like you

00:39:24.590 --> 00:39:25.980 align:middle line:90%
to do the yeoman's work.

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And you go out there in the
field and things like that.

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:31.315 align:middle line:84%
I'm the facilitator, but
you're the real investigator.

00:39:31.315 --> 00:39:32.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: But I think
you want to know.

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:35.278 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Absolutely,
since I was a kid.

00:39:35.278 --> 00:39:37.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Since you were
a kid-- and Jacques, who

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:41.040 align:middle line:84%
saw at 15 years old a UFO
that changed his life and went

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:44.520 align:middle line:84%
into this area hoping
science will follow him.

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:45.690 align:middle line:90%
Do I think we'll know?

00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:46.650 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:47.970 align:middle line:90%
I don't think we'll ever know.

00:39:47.970 --> 00:39:52.140 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't matter because
this is about personal.

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:55.020 align:middle line:84%
When I was in Argentina,
I saw UFOs over my head

00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:56.760 align:middle line:90%
in broad daylight--

00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:57.810 align:middle line:90%
broad daylight.

00:39:57.810 --> 00:39:58.590 align:middle line:90%
They were there because it was--

00:39:58.590 --> 00:40:00.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Buzzing
all over the place?

00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:02.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I saw two
around noontime,

00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:05.460 align:middle line:84%
and then I saw one at 3
o'clock in the afternoon.

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:09.150 align:middle line:84%
But there's no airport,
and there's no airplanes.

00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And it was a clear
sky during the day,

00:40:11.610 --> 00:40:13.620 align:middle line:90%
and the people were meditating.

00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:15.690 align:middle line:84%
Where I was, the
people were meditating.

00:40:15.690 --> 00:40:16.950 align:middle line:90%
It's almost like--

00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:22.340 align:middle line:84%
I want to say that if
you want to have answers

00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:25.910 align:middle line:84%
you have to go internally
in a place like where

00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:31.820 align:middle line:84%
I was in Uritorco, which is
near Cordoba, and just ask.

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:33.680 align:middle line:84%
You can't be in the
middle of New York City.

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:37.190 align:middle line:84%
You can't be in the
middle of huge confusion.

00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:40.400 align:middle line:84%
I think that whatever is out
there, whatever consciousness

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:46.280 align:middle line:84%
is out there, will respond to
you if you are very sincere.

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:47.922 align:middle line:84%
And that's the only
way, George, you're

00:40:47.922 --> 00:40:49.880 align:middle line:84%
going to get your answer,
because I don't think

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:51.710 align:middle line:84%
it's going to come
out of the government,

00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:53.430 align:middle line:90%
because I don't think they know.

00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:56.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're dealing with
the Navy who's in charge of--

00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:58.610 align:middle line:84%
what about the Air
Force and the Army?

00:40:58.610 --> 00:41:01.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's so
compartmentalized

00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:03.750 align:middle line:90%
that we can't find out that way.

00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:08.330 align:middle line:84%
I think the only way we can
find out is on a personal level.

00:41:08.330 --> 00:41:11.320 align:middle line:84%
But that's not what I'm here
to do because I know it's real.

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:13.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You said something at
the beginning of the program,

00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:15.855 align:middle line:84%
that you're
contemplating retirement.

00:41:15.855 --> 00:41:16.655 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:41:16.655 --> 00:41:18.007 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Don't.

00:41:18.007 --> 00:41:20.090 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: The kind of
retirement I'm contemplating

00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:25.002 align:middle line:84%
is I don't feel like
playing around anymore.

00:41:25.002 --> 00:41:25.960 align:middle line:90%
It's not entertainment.

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:27.002 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But we need you.

00:41:27.002 --> 00:41:29.960 align:middle line:90%
This field needs you.

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:31.490 align:middle line:90%
There aren't enough of you.

00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:34.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I'd rather go to a
university and teach a class.

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:35.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On what?

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:37.700 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: On what I learned.

00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:39.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You think
they'll really let you?

00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:42.625 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to the university
and get a class on UFOs

00:41:42.625 --> 00:41:43.580 align:middle line:90%
by Paola Harris?

00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:45.660 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: We can't call it UFOs.

00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:46.460 align:middle line:90%
It's like the--

00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:47.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: UAPs.

00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:50.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: We could
call it philosophy,

00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:55.880 align:middle line:84%
or we could call it social
sciences or whatever interact--

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:57.800 align:middle line:90%
we could call it contact or--

00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:01.460 align:middle line:84%
because Carl Sagan
was a famous skeptic.

00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:04.097 align:middle line:84%
Before he died, do you remember
he did the movie "Contact?"

00:42:04.097 --> 00:42:05.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, and the book.

00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:06.110 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:10.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: He didn't say what he
said, but he said what he said.

00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:11.480 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:13.820 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: If you're
intelligent, you

00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:18.500 align:middle line:10%
get that Jodie Foster
did missing time.

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:21.080 align:middle line:10%
She did meet up
with consciousness

00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:22.380 align:middle line:10%
that looked like her father.

00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:25.970 align:middle line:10%
But the words that came out
of that father was we've

00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:30.320 align:middle line:10%
been here for thousands of
years watching your species.

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.903 align:middle line:84%
That was Carl Sagan,
who was a skeptic.

00:42:32.903 --> 00:42:34.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we're looking
for the same things

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:36.530 align:middle line:90%
you're looking for.

00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:37.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Exactly.

00:42:37.330 --> 00:42:39.497 align:middle line:84%

being on "Beyond Belief."

>>NOORY: One day,
we'll get the answers.

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:46.610 align:middle line:10%
UFOs, UAPs, call them
whatever you want,

00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:50.330 align:middle line:10%
they're coming from somewhere,
and we will find out.
