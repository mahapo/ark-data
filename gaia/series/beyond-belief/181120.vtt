00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:24.279 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:26.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.250 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, physicist and
licensed professional engineer.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.750 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Tom Valone with us.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.360 align:middle line:10%
He has a PhD in
general engineering

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.480 align:middle line:10%
and a masters in physics,
president and founder

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.000 align:middle line:10%
of the Integrity
Research Institute,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.030 align:middle line:10%
and author of several books,
including "Zero Point Energy."

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.740 align:middle line:90%
Tom, welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:44.160 align:middle line:90%
>>TOM VALONE: Thank you.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.410 align:middle line:90%
Glad to be here.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's new with you?

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.621 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: Oh my goodness.

00:00:46.621 --> 00:00:49.050 align:middle line:10%
The biggest thing I
feel is the discovery

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.650 align:middle line:10%
of the new development
on climate change, which

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:59.700 align:middle line:10%
was predicted over 10 years
ago by Dr. Jim Hansen, MIT

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.740 align:middle line:10%
climatologist, probably
the world's most famous

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.580 align:middle line:10%
climatologist.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.825 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is he controversial?

00:01:04.825 --> 00:01:05.700 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: Absolutely.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.040 align:middle line:10%
The Bush administration
tried to censor him.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.230 align:middle line:10%
And he was persecuted
during the years

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.160 align:middle line:10%
that that administration
had the White House.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.280 align:middle line:84%
No words like that in
any government report.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tom, when we talk
about climate change, what

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.460 align:middle line:90%
are we talking about?

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.970 align:middle line:84%
>>VALONE: Well, the first graph
is basically a slide showing

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.300 align:middle line:84%
his 400,000-year
history of the Earth.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And what he did beyond what
Noah did is not only showing

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.890 align:middle line:84%
the carbon dioxide
change over those years--

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.590 align:middle line:84%
you can see several ice
ages as a result of this--

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.160 align:middle line:84%
but he also superimposed the
temperature and sea level

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.076 align:middle line:84%
graphs with the maximum
and minimum matched up.

00:01:44.076 --> 00:01:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, you
see they track each other.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, we'll get
into all this in just a second.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.680 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little
bit more about you.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.960 align:middle line:84%
How'd you get involved
in studying all this?

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.700 align:middle line:84%
>>VALONE: Well, years
ago, I was involved

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.830 align:middle line:90%
in pursuing free energy.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.680 align:middle line:84%
And in 1980, I basically
went to Germany

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.650 align:middle line:84%
for a conference on
gravity field energy.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.110 align:middle line:84%
And from then on, I
was actually involved

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.220 align:middle line:84%
in the polar generator, thinking
that was a free energy device.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.889 align:middle line:84%
I convinced my professor at
the University of Buffalo

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:13.620 align:middle line:84%
to let me do it as a
master's project in physics.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.960 align:middle line:90%
And then I became a celebrity.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.670 align:middle line:84%
Every year I was
going to conferences

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.760 align:middle line:84%
and talking about free energy
and was even a consultant

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.240 align:middle line:84%
for the "Free Energy,
Race to Zero Point" video.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when you
talk about free energy,

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.700 align:middle line:84%
now to me that means we're
not getting electrical bills

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.320 align:middle line:90%
from our electric company.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.340 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you mean?

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.310 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: Of course.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.850 align:middle line:84%
It's a one-time investment
in some type of device.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's some
of the information

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.510 align:middle line:84%
we'll be sharing today that
actually involves a device that

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.410 align:middle line:84%
then produces energy,
electrical energy,

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.994 align:middle line:90%
for as long as the device works.

00:02:47.994 --> 00:02:49.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
not going to want

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.480 align:middle line:90%
us to have that, Tom, are they?

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.520 align:middle line:90%
It's free.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.430 align:middle line:84%
>>VALONE: Well, I think
it's our manifest destiny,

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.590 align:middle line:84%
as they called it years
ago when we were trying

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.580 align:middle line:90%
to get to the West coast.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.310 align:middle line:90%
Hey, we used to have free water.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.500 align:middle line:90%
We used to have free air.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.300 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They found a
way to make money on it.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.640 align:middle line:84%
>>VALONE: That's
right, that's right.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And here we go again.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.210 align:middle line:90%
Climate change is controversial.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.310 align:middle line:84%
People on different
ends of the spectrum

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.400 align:middle line:84%
have their own specific
views on whether it's

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.330 align:middle line:84%
man-made or natural, maybe
a combination of both.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.850 align:middle line:90%
But why is it so controversial?

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.990 align:middle line:84%
>>VALONE: Well, the controversy
is basically the same paradigm

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.240 align:middle line:84%
shift that Thomas
Kuhn talked about

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.590 align:middle line:84%
in the scientific revolutions
book, "Structure of Scientific

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.420 align:middle line:90%
Revolutions."

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.380 align:middle line:84%
You see it repeated
over and over again.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.200 align:middle line:84%
Anything analogous,
it tends to be denied.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.700 align:middle line:90%
That's the human reaction.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:42.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.000 align:middle line:84%
>>VALONE: And Kuhn mapped
that down to the point

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.540 align:middle line:84%
where unless a
theory is developed

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.019 align:middle line:84%
that's very convincing, people
are still going to dismiss it.

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now before we get into
the graphics from Jim Hansen,

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.420 align:middle line:90%
tell us about him.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.420 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: Oh, of course.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.590 align:middle line:84%
Jim Hansen is a soft-spoken,
wonderful genius

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.690 align:middle line:84%
who's co-authored
amazing journal

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.220 align:middle line:90%
articles on climate change.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.610 align:middle line:84%
But he hasn't reached the
audience that's most important.

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.140 align:middle line:90%
And that is the public.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why not?

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>>VALONE: Well, scientists
are accused of this everywhere

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.640 align:middle line:84%
in the world, including,
as people might remember,

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.000 align:middle line:84%
in Greece where scientists
were put in jail,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.630 align:middle line:84%
geologists specifically, for
publishing their articles

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.090 align:middle line:84%
on the coming earthquake
that they had predicted

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.060 align:middle line:84%
and didn't do enough advertising
to convince the public

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.230 align:middle line:90%
to go seek shelter.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:29.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they
blamed them for it.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:30.163 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: Of course.

00:04:30.163 --> 00:04:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And they put them
in jail in Greece.

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sheesh,
are you kidding me?

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.329 align:middle line:84%
>>VALONE: I said, hey,
that's what it should be,

00:04:35.329 --> 00:04:37.840 align:middle line:84%
because scientists should
be their own spokesperson

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:45.180 align:middle line:84%
and announcers for the type
of important information

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.100 align:middle line:90%
that they're presenting.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Whose fault
was that, then?

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.870 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it was the
fault of the scientists

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.610 align:middle line:90%
and the climatologists.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.680 align:middle line:84%
It could have been
the media in Greece

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.764 align:middle line:90%
that didn't pick up on it.

00:04:56.764 --> 00:04:58.263 align:middle line:84%
>>VALONE: Thank you
for saying that,

00:04:58.263 --> 00:04:59.470 align:middle line:90%
because it wasn't my words.

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:00.270 align:middle line:90%
It was yours.

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And hey, the media obviously
is being blamed left and right

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.580 align:middle line:90%
for lots of different reasons.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.030 align:middle line:84%
But in general, we
need more science

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.190 align:middle line:90%
to be translated by the media.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dr. Jim Hansen
out at Columbia University

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.380 align:middle line:90%
created what he has.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.214 align:middle line:90%
It's called the climate graph.

00:05:17.214 --> 00:05:18.630 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at some
of these graphs

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.910 align:middle line:84%
and you explain to
us, if you would, Tom,

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.150 align:middle line:90%
what we're looking at here.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.290 align:middle line:90%
So what is this?

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:24.831 align:middle line:84%
>>VALONE: Well, this
is the first one

00:05:24.831 --> 00:05:28.480 align:middle line:84%
that he published in an
obscure journal called "MIT's

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.140 align:middle line:90%
Technology Review," 2006.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And when I study this graph,
400,000 years of ice age up

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.290 align:middle line:84%
and down temperature, CO2,
and sea level superimposed

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.020 align:middle line:84%
so you can see they
actually overlap, to me this

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.840 align:middle line:84%
is astonishing, because
no one, I think,

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.440 align:middle line:84%
even scientists, have a
formula or an understanding

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.830 align:middle line:84%
of why the three of
them are correlated.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.680 align:middle line:84%
They're diverse parts of
the biosphere, of Gaia.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.610 align:middle line:10%
And what's astonishing, as Al
Gore does in the "Inconvenient

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.250 align:middle line:10%
Truth" movie, all of a sudden
you see at the very end,

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.130 align:middle line:10%
at this time in
2006, it went way up

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.700 align:middle line:10%
to 377 parts per million.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.220 align:middle line:10%
Well, the maximum that you see
across the half million years

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.180 align:middle line:10%
is only 290 parts per million.

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.490 align:middle line:84%
It's varied between 200
and 300 parts per million

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:19.900 align:middle line:90%
for a half million years.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, humans or somebody is
pushing that CO2 up to now 408.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:25.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or somebody.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:26.425 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: Yeah, or somebody.

00:06:26.425 --> 00:06:26.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or someone.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.210 align:middle line:10%
>>VALONE: So as you go
to the second graph--

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:28.900 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Let's lay it out.

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.670 align:middle line:10%
Let's go to the second
one and see what we have.

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:32.294 align:middle line:10%
>>VALONE: What I did
is I annotated it,

00:06:32.294 --> 00:06:35.560 align:middle line:10%
because there was a table
next to that graph that

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.450 align:middle line:10%
at least showed the numbers.

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:39.096 align:middle line:90%
And I chided Jim.

00:06:39.096 --> 00:06:40.220 align:middle line:90%
I talked to him about this.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.070 align:middle line:84%
I said, this is
exactly what people

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.770 align:middle line:84%
need to understand the
graph that you published,

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:47.270 align:middle line:84%
because at the bottom
here is my key.

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.600 align:middle line:84%
10 parts per million equal
a half degree C equal

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.847 align:middle line:90%
10 meters of sea level rise.

00:06:51.847 --> 00:06:53.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's forget about
the sea level rise,

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.590 align:middle line:84%
because it takes a millennium
or more for that to happen.

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:57.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's very slow.

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:58.640 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: Very slow.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.300 align:middle line:84%
So the one I'm concentrating
on is the temperature.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.190 align:middle line:10%
And the temperature you see--

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.550 align:middle line:10%
you can even say 20 parts per
million equal one degree--

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:09.330 align:middle line:10%


00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.680 align:middle line:10%
it's calibrated so you
can actually predict,

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.700 align:middle line:10%
as I did 10 years ago, what
the future temperature change

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.650 align:middle line:10%
should be within the century.

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And as you can see, I'm
annotating five degrees

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:25.220 align:middle line:84%
C at that time just due to
the approximately 400 parts

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.020 align:middle line:90%
per million--

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that high?

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:28.520 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: Five degrees C?

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:28.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:29.380 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: Absolutely.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:33.350 align:middle line:84%
>>VALONE: Nat Geo has a video
saying one or two degrees

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:34.150 align:middle line:90%
is tolerable.

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.100 align:middle line:84%
But as you get to
three, four, and five,

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.070 align:middle line:84%
we get desertification
of the Midwest.

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:42.430 align:middle line:84%
We get a huge storm
changes, migration.

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you talk about
the migrant problem,

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:45.430 align:middle line:90%
it goes on and on.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.700 align:middle line:84%
Nat Geo says five degrees is
the absolute worst condition.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look
at our next graph.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.620 align:middle line:10%
>>VALONE: So as you
kind of look at the 2100

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:57.220 align:middle line:10%
deadline for this change of
temperature, all of a sudden

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:59.770 align:middle line:10%
now 10 years later, we
see the best climatologist

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:02.110 align:middle line:10%
in the world,
Stanford University,

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:06.580 align:middle line:10%
Carnegie Institute agreeing
with five degrees C by 2100.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, and
then our last one here.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.560 align:middle line:84%
>>VALONE: And so what I also
was wondering, what happens

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.960 align:middle line:90%
past 2100, because guess what?

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:18.691 align:middle line:10%
We're pushing the CO2
level up to 500, 600, 700.

00:08:18.691 --> 00:08:20.190 align:middle line:10%
On the right side
of this graph, you

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:24.760 align:middle line:10%
see all the climate models
predicting 600 to 800 parts

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.320 align:middle line:10%
per million of just CO2.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.430 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That is high.

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:27.920 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: Thank you.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:28.542 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is high.

00:08:28.542 --> 00:08:29.366 align:middle line:84%
>>VALONE: That's
nice of you to admit.

00:08:29.366 --> 00:08:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How it got
there we can debate.

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:31.730 align:middle line:90%
But that is high.

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:34.690 align:middle line:84%
>>VALONE: Guess what the
studies show in classrooms

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:37.720 align:middle line:84%
when you reach 1,000
parts per million of CO2?

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.711 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What might it
have been like, Tom,

00:08:40.711 --> 00:08:41.980 align:middle line:90%
60 million years ago--

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:42.280 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: 50.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:42.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --with the dinosaurs?

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:44.141 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: 50 million years ago.

00:08:44.141 --> 00:08:47.280 align:middle line:84%
It turns out the Eocene Epoch
was 800 parts per million

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.080 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right,
what caused that?

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:50.200 align:middle line:90%
We didn't have man.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.430 align:middle line:90%
We didn't have machines.

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:52.572 align:middle line:90%
We didn't have industry.

00:08:52.572 --> 00:08:53.530 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: That's right.

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:55.720 align:middle line:84%
There was something
happening to the climate that

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.790 align:middle line:90%
caused it to go way up in 800.

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:00.400 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm interested
in is the temperature

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.152 align:middle line:84%
was also 15 degrees C
higher than the present.

00:09:04.152 --> 00:09:05.110 align:middle line:90%
We're not talking five.

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:05.980 align:middle line:90%
We're talking 15.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:06.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:07.785 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: Absolutely.

00:09:07.785 --> 00:09:08.936 align:middle line:90%
If we reach 800 by 2100--

00:09:08.936 --> 00:09:10.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think is happening now?

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.038 align:middle line:84%
>>VALONE: --we're
going to be a hothouse.

00:09:12.038 --> 00:09:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And guess what the
Eocene Epoch had?

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:16.480 align:middle line:90%
Alligators in the Arctic.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you saying
that this is an earth cycle?

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:19.660 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: No.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:23.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying this is artificially
avoiding the next ice age that

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.000 align:middle line:90%
should be happening right now.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.920 align:middle line:84%
As you can see from
the first graph,

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.400 align:middle line:84%
the temperature is going
down, down, down and starting

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.570 align:middle line:90%
to go up a little bit.

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:34.360 align:middle line:84%
But the important thing is
we were actually at the point

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.450 align:middle line:84%
where it should have been
starting to decrease.

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And instead we've heated
up the atmosphere so

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:43.300 align:middle line:84%
tremendously with CO2
obviously, heat-trapping gas,

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.920 align:middle line:84%
that we're avoiding the ice
age, which is good news.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.080 align:middle line:90%
But we're over-driving it.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:50.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you recommend
we get that temperature

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:51.710 align:middle line:90%
level down?

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:56.950 align:middle line:84%
>>VALONE: We have to invent and
rediscover CO2 sequestration.

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:58.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is that?

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>>VALONE: There is a number of
technologies that our institute

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:04.310 align:middle line:84%
actually advocates every month
in our Future Energy eNews,

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:08.110 align:middle line:84%
which is free at our website,
Integrity-Research.org.

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And you can basically see that
universities and scientists

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:18.310 align:middle line:84%
have already not only come up
with iron seeding of the oceans

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:21.990 align:middle line:84%
to get plankton to absorb
millions of tons of CO2,

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:27.080 align:middle line:84%
but there's also special types
of concrete that absorb CO2.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:31.920 align:middle line:84%
There's types of technologies
that actually bury it

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.310 align:middle line:84%
in rock so that it's
actually reformed

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:38.010 align:middle line:90%
into a concrete-type substance.

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:41.580 align:middle line:84%
There's buildings, building
materials that absorb CO2.

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:45.510 align:middle line:84%
So we need all of that
into the billion ton range.

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And even director and
CEO of Virgin Galactic

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:54.840 align:middle line:84%
was interested in offering
$10 million prize.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's not enough to
accomplish a billion ton--

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:58.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:59.250 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: --of sequestration.

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:00.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a start.

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:01.980 align:middle line:90%
But it's not a lot.

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:05.820 align:middle line:84%
What got you interested in
the possibility that humans

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:07.410 align:middle line:90%
are contributing to this?

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:11.920 align:middle line:84%
What did you see personally,
Tom, to make you feel that way?

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:15.030 align:middle line:84%
>>VALONE: Well,
actually the pollution

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:19.230 align:middle line:84%
that fossil fuels cause
I felt was serious enough

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:21.590 align:middle line:90%
to be concerned about.

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:23.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm sensitive to air pollution.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:25.930 align:middle line:90%
Indoor air pollution bothers me.

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:28.650 align:middle line:84%
I used colloidal
silver nose sprays.

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:32.195 align:middle line:84%
I use ozone generators
to sanitize the air.

00:11:32.195 --> 00:11:34.320 align:middle line:84%
Indoor air can be worse
than outdoor air sometimes.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.090 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:38.010 align:middle line:84%
>>VALONE: But I also
was aware of the fact

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:40.980 align:middle line:84%
that if you study
Carl Jung psychology,

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:45.720 align:middle line:84%
that the archetype of fossil
fuels is macabre and morbid.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.870 align:middle line:84%
You're dealing with
a dead symbol that

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:50.700 align:middle line:90%
should remain in the ground.

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And instead we're
digging it up as if we're

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:57.090 align:middle line:84%
some type of Halloween
type of figure

00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:02.070 align:middle line:84%
and trying to revivify it
to make it more energetic.

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:09.030 align:middle line:84%
This is a whole misuse of
nature's and Gaia's resources.

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:11.310 align:middle line:84%
Instead, the free
energy movement,

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:15.150 align:middle line:84%
which is now
bearing fruit, shows

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:17.790 align:middle line:84%
that there's energy available
from the quantum vacuum--

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:20.940 align:middle line:84%
clean, pure, light
type of energy

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:24.510 align:middle line:84%
that is totally different
in symbolic form

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.724 align:middle line:84%
than the dead, morbid type
of energy we're using now.

00:12:26.724 --> 00:12:28.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
there's no question

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:30.600 align:middle line:84%
that we should be using
different kinds of fuels

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:31.440 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.205 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: Do we even need fuel?

00:12:33.205 --> 00:12:34.080 align:middle line:90%
This is the question.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And this has been our problem
from the past 100 years,

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:40.740 align:middle line:84%
thinking that fuel
was our only resource.

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:44.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, Nikola Tesla lectured
us very seriously about it.

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:47.790 align:middle line:84%
If we continue to use
fuel as a resource,

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:50.280 align:middle line:84%
the coming generations
will actually suffer.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Stanford University's
Doctor Mark Jacobson

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.560 align:middle line:84%
talks about 139
countries that he

00:12:55.560 --> 00:13:00.520 align:middle line:84%
says by 2050 could be
using renewable systems.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:02.778 align:middle line:10%
>>MARK JACOBSON:
We think that it's

00:13:02.778 --> 00:13:05.760 align:middle line:10%
possible to address all of
global carbon and air pollution

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.160 align:middle line:10%
problems simultaneously
by transitioning

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.570 align:middle line:10%
every single country and
state to 100% clean, renewable

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:15.240 align:middle line:10%
energy, particularly wind,
water, and solar power.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:19.260 align:middle line:10%
We calculate 22 million new jobs
worldwide by such a transition.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.740 align:middle line:10%
Onshore and offshore wind;
solar photovoltaics on rooftops

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:25.130 align:middle line:10%
and in power plants;
utility scale solar;

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:27.270 align:middle line:10%
photovoltaics;
also utility scale

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:31.230 align:middle line:10%
concentrated solar power
and then geothermal power;

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:34.470 align:middle line:10%
existing, not new
hydroelectric power;

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:36.780 align:middle line:10%
and tiny amounts of
tidal wave power.

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:38.820 align:middle line:10%
We find for each
country of the world

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:42.270 align:middle line:10%
that we tested that
it's possible to power

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:45.120 align:middle line:10%
each country entirely by
wind, water, and solar.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.610 align:middle line:10%
Electricity is much more
efficient than burning things.

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:50.190 align:middle line:84%
For example, take
a gasoline car.

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:54.300 align:middle line:84%
Gasoline car, only 17% to 20%
of the energy in the gasoline

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:55.250 align:middle line:90%
goes to move the car.

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:56.430 align:middle line:90%
And the rest is waste heat.

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:59.100 align:middle line:10%
If you have an electric
car, of the electricity that

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:02.215 align:middle line:10%
goes into the car in starting
batteries, 80% to 86%

00:14:02.215 --> 00:14:03.090 align:middle line:10%
goes to move the car.

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:09.480 align:middle line:10%
So we reduce significantly
over 60%, 70% the energy

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.140 align:middle line:10%
need in transportation.

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:12.570 align:middle line:10%
When you average
over all sectors,

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:15.750 align:middle line:10%
there is about a 32%
reduction in energy demand

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:17.070 align:middle line:10%
due to this efficiency.

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:19.700 align:middle line:10%
And then we can squeeze
out another about 7%

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.090 align:middle line:10%
in use energy efficiency
improvements beyond that.

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:26.320 align:middle line:84%
So we get about 39% reduction of
power demand over all sectors.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.320 align:middle line:10%
So the problem with wind
and solar, for example,

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.611 align:middle line:10%
is the wind doesn't always
blow, the sun doesn't shine.

00:14:30.611 --> 00:14:33.270 align:middle line:10%
So the concern has been that
the grid will be unstable.

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:35.490 align:middle line:10%
You'll have high cost
to keep it stable

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:38.390 align:middle line:10%
if we go to large-scale
wind, water, and solar power.

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:40.185 align:middle line:10%
But it turns out
this is not the case.

00:14:40.185 --> 00:14:41.310 align:middle line:10%
It's actually the opposite.

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:43.920 align:middle line:10%
>>AMORY LOVINS: In
2014, more than a fourth

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.320 align:middle line:10%
of Germany's
electricity consumption

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:51.690 align:middle line:10%
was renewable and about half in
four other European countries

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:54.840 align:middle line:10%
with modest or no hydropower.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.560 align:middle line:10%
None of them added bulk storage.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:59.680 align:middle line:10%
All of them sustained high
reliability for Denmark

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.490 align:middle line:10%
and Germany, about 10 times
better than America's.

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:04.680 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBSON: The actual
demand is variable itself.

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.290 align:middle line:10%
So baseload power doesn't
really mean anything,

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:10.620 align:middle line:10%
because you always, even
today and historically, you've

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:13.330 align:middle line:10%
always needed some kind of
peaking to fill in the gap.

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:15.930 align:middle line:84%
So like nuclear power,
which provides baseload,

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:18.834 align:middle line:84%
does not help you actually
match power demand.

00:15:18.834 --> 00:15:20.250 align:middle line:84%
Coal, which is
primarily baseload,

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:22.410 align:middle line:84%
does not help you
meet the peaks.

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:26.220 align:middle line:10%
It just gives you some flat,
underlying amount of energy.

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:29.850 align:middle line:10%
But we found that by
electrifying all sectors--

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:33.190 align:middle line:10%
so that's transportation,
heating and cooling industry

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:35.230 align:middle line:10%
in addition to electricity--

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:37.320 align:middle line:10%
it actually makes it easier
to match power demand

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.930 align:middle line:10%
at a cost of about 10
and a half to 10.6 cents

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:42.450 align:middle line:10%
per kilowatt hour, which
is similar to the energy

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:44.180 align:middle line:10%
cost of a fossil fuel system.

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:44.980 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:46.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So it can be done.

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:46.670 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: Absolutely.

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:47.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It can be done.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.340 align:middle line:90%
Well, why aren't we doing it?

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:51.900 align:middle line:84%
>>VALONE: Well,
Mark Jacobson has

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:53.760 align:middle line:84%
received a lot of
criticism, saying

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.410 align:middle line:90%
that it would be too expensive.

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:58.710 align:middle line:84%
Various countries he's named
are actually resistant.

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:01.360 align:middle line:84%
Poland, for example,
is loving the fact

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.780 align:middle line:84%
they can get cheap
coal in their homes.

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:05.800 align:middle line:84%
And the pollution,
they don't care about.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.700 align:middle line:84%
So it's changing
mindset to even be

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:11.672 align:middle line:84%
concerned about air pollution
and, of course, climate change.

00:16:11.672 --> 00:16:14.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't think I'd like
a coal furnace in my house.

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>>VALONE: No, but
the Polish people--

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:15.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Would you?

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:16.759 align:middle line:84%
>>VALONE: --seem
to be used to it.

00:16:16.759 --> 00:16:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And there's many
other countries that

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.870 align:middle line:90%
burn very dirty types of fuel.

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And of course, even
a solar converter,

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:27.040 align:middle line:84%
like in India and Africa, is
a wonderful new innovation

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:27.840 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:32.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you started
thinking about free energy, how

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:32.840 align:middle line:90%
old were you?

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.940 align:middle line:90%
When did that start?

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:36.844 align:middle line:90%
Were you a kid?

00:16:36.844 --> 00:16:37.760 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: Pretty much.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:42.200 align:middle line:84%
I was actually in college
at the time, a grad student

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:47.180 align:middle line:84%
and in my 20s, looking for a
master's project that I felt,

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:49.790 align:middle line:84%
I want to do something that
I would be interested in

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:52.470 align:middle line:84%
rather than wait for the
professor to tell me.

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:55.820 align:middle line:84%
In one case, I was
offered a PhD thesis

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:58.580 align:middle line:84%
on the distribution
of utility generators

00:16:58.580 --> 00:16:59.910 align:middle line:90%
throughout the country.

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:00.710 align:middle line:90%
Whoop-de-doos.

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:04.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to be able to talk
about my PhD thesis after that.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:07.940 align:middle line:10%
So that's why I investigated
"Sunburst, Return

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:09.714 align:middle line:10%
of the Ancients"
by Norman Paulsen.

00:17:09.714 --> 00:17:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And I went out to
their community.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:14.599 align:middle line:84%
You saw this, quote unquote,
"free energy generator,"

00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:16.910 align:middle line:84%
Bruce DePalma's device,
and thought, hey,

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:19.430 align:middle line:84%
I may be able to test this
for a master's project.

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:20.990 align:middle line:84%
And luckily I
convinced my professor

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:22.740 align:middle line:84%
to let me do that for
a master in physics.

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:24.281 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
your thoughts, Tom,

00:17:24.281 --> 00:17:26.839 align:middle line:84%
that every household would
have some kind of free energy

00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:28.216 align:middle line:90%
device attached to it?

00:17:28.216 --> 00:17:29.090 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: Absolutely.

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:30.506 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not hooked
into the grid?

00:17:30.506 --> 00:17:31.910 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: Absolutely.

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:35.660 align:middle line:84%
Having stand-alone power is the
only answer to climate change.

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And really this is the kind of
self-sustaining type of future

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:46.070 align:middle line:84%
that human race needs for all
the dangerous storms we've

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:47.560 align:middle line:90%
been receiving.

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:51.590 align:middle line:84%
Just a few years ago, we
had 200 tornadoes in one day

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:53.330 align:middle line:90%
throughout the Midwest.

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:55.640 align:middle line:84%
Popular Science this month
actually shows the map

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.230 align:middle line:90%
of all those 200 tornadoes.

00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:58.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Power lines down.

00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:59.270 align:middle line:90%
It was a mess.

00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.990 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: You name it.

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.740 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:02.531 align:middle line:84%
And of course hurricanes
are getting worse.

00:18:02.531 --> 00:18:04.419 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we don't need that.

00:18:04.419 --> 00:18:05.960 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to
be experiencing it

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.520 align:middle line:90%
all throughout the century.

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:11.520 align:middle line:84%
Even each generation will
see worsening conditions.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.670 align:middle line:84%
So the first step
is Mark Jacobson

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:17.780 align:middle line:84%
says to go ahead with
the clean energy first.

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:21.210 align:middle line:84%
Renewable energy has to be a
mandate for all the countries,

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:23.180 align:middle line:84%
including unfortunately
the carbon

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:28.310 align:middle line:84%
tax that was just voted
out of being instituted

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:30.860 align:middle line:90%
in a Western state recently.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.810 align:middle line:84%
Eventually we'll
have to face facts

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:36.950 align:middle line:84%
and say, yes, it's about time
we stopped emitting carbon.

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:38.780 align:middle line:90%
Carbon dioxide is a pollutant.

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't ever
know, I don't think,

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:middle line:84%
that the Earth was that
temperature sensitive to CO2

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.200 align:middle line:90%
levels.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.783 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You and I
differ a little bit

00:18:46.783 --> 00:18:47.970 align:middle line:90%
on how we got to this point.

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:48.770 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: Yes.

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:50.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But we agree
on certain things.

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:53.557 align:middle line:84%
For example, I don't think we
should be polluting the planet.

00:18:53.557 --> 00:18:54.390 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: Thank you.

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:56.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we're
doing that in a big way.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm a believer in the
abiotic oil theory.

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:02.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't think our oil is from
plants and dead dinosaurs.

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:06.740 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe that we
shouldn't be burning it

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:09.350 align:middle line:84%
and to get into a
different source.

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:12.290 align:middle line:84%
So though we may disagree on
certain aspects of climate

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:15.110 align:middle line:84%
change, we do agree
on the fact that we

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:17.180 align:middle line:90%
need to do something about it.

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:18.740 align:middle line:90%
And it's there.

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.780 align:middle line:84%
What would it cost to
have a device like that

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:24.440 align:middle line:84%
attached to your house, to
have your own power system?

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.840 align:middle line:84%
>>VALONE: Well, the
cost is probably

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:32.870 align:middle line:84%
something that's still in the
gray zone of possibilities.

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:34.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Meaning it's
too high right now?

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:35.660 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: Yes, yes.

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:37.970 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I can equate
it to, for example,

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:42.860 align:middle line:84%
the backup natural gas
generators that are available.

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:46.730 align:middle line:84%
We have power outages even in
the Maryland area, Washington

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:48.830 align:middle line:90%
DC area every so often.

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And people often experience
that even with storms.

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.140 align:middle line:84%
You not only have the
damage from the hurricane,

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:57.260 align:middle line:84%
but you also lose power
for any number of weeks.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.870 align:middle line:84%
So backup generators
are a solution,

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:01.190 align:middle line:90%
running on natural gas.

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:04.040 align:middle line:84%
But you'll spend at
least $10,000 or more

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:07.220 align:middle line:84%
to get that type of
generator as a alternative.

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:09.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That cost will
come down though, won't it,

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:10.310 align:middle line:90%
dramatically?

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.940 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: Sure, and--

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:13.398 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or maybe it will be
$1,000 or something like that.

00:20:13.398 --> 00:20:15.200 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: Absolutely.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How would it work?

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:19.400 align:middle line:10%
>>VALONE: Well, what
we're now seeing finally--

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:22.250 align:middle line:10%
and I'm looking at
almost 30 years later

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:25.100 align:middle line:10%
from when I started in 1980--

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:28.220 align:middle line:10%
to actually see the
first presentation

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:32.420 align:middle line:10%
that's very solid in terms
of the evidence behind it

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:34.745 align:middle line:10%
for the Arthur Manelas device.

00:20:34.745 --> 00:20:37.360 align:middle line:84%
And that was presented
by Brian Ahern, Dr. Brian

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:40.940 align:middle line:84%
Ahern at our last conference
on future energy, the 10th one

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:43.310 align:middle line:90%
we had during the summer.

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:46.670 align:middle line:84%
FutureEnergy.org is our website
for all our consciences.

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:51.650 align:middle line:10%
And what was surprising about
that is the Manelas device

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:55.310 align:middle line:10%
works on strontium
ferrite billet,

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:58.100 align:middle line:10%
nanocrystalline
strontium ferrite billet,

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:01.000 align:middle line:10%
which has crystal sizes
less than 10 nanometers.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That small?

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:02.950 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: Yes.

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:04.877 align:middle line:84%
And what Dr. Ahern
discovered, because he

00:21:04.877 --> 00:21:06.710 align:middle line:84%
worked in the cold
fusion area that's always

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:09.680 align:middle line:84%
been a problematic area
to research-- he said,

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:12.510 align:middle line:84%
the only successful
cold fusion devices,

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:16.910 align:middle line:84%
which is called LENR,
low-energy nuclear reactions,

00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:21.440 align:middle line:84%
is the 10 nanometer or
less palladium crystals,

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:22.550 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And Arata was one
of the doctors who

00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:28.580 align:middle line:84%
were successful in getting
excess heat generation.

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:31.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Manelas device
produces excess electricity

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:34.422 align:middle line:90%
even after 25 miles of running--

00:21:34.422 --> 00:21:35.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a good thing.

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:35.990 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: --several weeks.

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.790 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:39.740 align:middle line:84%
The voltage goes up on
the billet in the battery,

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:43.010 align:middle line:84%
because the billet is inside
the battery, and it gets cooler.

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:44.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dr. Mark
Jacobson thinks

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:47.056 align:middle line:84%
that we should be
doing all electricity.

00:21:47.056 --> 00:21:47.930 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: Absolutely.

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:49.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it doable?

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:49.820 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: Yes.

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:53.750 align:middle line:84%
From what his research proves
and what other climatologists

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:56.420 align:middle line:84%
and renewable
energy experts say,

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:59.640 align:middle line:84%
we can be running on 100%
free renewable energy

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:00.440 align:middle line:90%
if we choose to.

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of course, the
genius about free energy

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:03.560 align:middle line:90%
was Nikola Tesla.

century, Nikola Tesla,

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:11.340 align:middle line:10%
the great inventor who

>> Electric power is
ever present in unlimited

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.710 align:middle line:84%
It can drive the
world's machinery

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:24.900 align:middle line:84%
without the need of coal,
oil, gas, or any other fuel.

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:28.590 align:middle line:84%
This new power for the driving
of the world's machinery

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:30.630 align:middle line:84%
will be derived from
the energy which

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:35.190 align:middle line:84%
operates the universe,
the cosmic energy.

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:37.220 align:middle line:10%
>> With over 200
patents to his name,

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:40.730 align:middle line:10%
Tesla was well on his way to
transmitting electric power

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:44.930 align:middle line:10%
without wires when he ran
into trouble with JP Morgan

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:48.290 align:middle line:10%
and the financial
interest of 1901.

00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:50.540 align:middle line:84%
His ambitious
Wardenclyffe project

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:53.480 align:middle line:84%
to magnify and transmit
power to ships at sea

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:56.770 align:middle line:84%
and eventually to provide free
electricity for the whole world

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:59.505 align:middle line:84%
was scuttled by Morgan,
leaving Tesla penniless

00:22:59.505 --> 00:23:01.280 align:middle line:90%
and disillusioned.

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.530 align:middle line:84%
The wealthy
industrialists of the time

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:07.040 align:middle line:84%
knew that their vast plans
to wire the world with copper

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.350 align:middle line:84%
from the mines they
owned would be upset

00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:11.135 align:middle line:84%
if they could no longer
control the supply

00:23:11.135 --> 00:23:13.610 align:middle line:90%
and means of delivery.

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:16.310 align:middle line:84%
Tesla's beliefs about
developing technology

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:18.560 align:middle line:84%
in harmony with
nature conflicted

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:21.260 align:middle line:84%
with the prevailing American
attitude at the time

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:27.380 align:middle line:84%
that mankind was put on Earth
to subdue and dominate nature.

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:30.260 align:middle line:84%
Little by little, Tesla
was denounced as a crackpot

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:33.350 align:middle line:84%
and deleted from the
historical record.

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:35.240 align:middle line:84%
At the time of
his death in 1943,

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:37.790 align:middle line:84%
Tesla's truckloads
of scientific papers

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:41.120 align:middle line:84%
were seized by US
government agencies.

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:44.390 align:middle line:84%
Who knows what ideas and
remarkable devices our world

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:48.530 align:middle line:84%
could have inherited if only
his genius was recognized?

two books came out.

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:18.680 align:middle line:84%
I edited "Harnessing
the Wheelwork of Nature"

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:21.380 align:middle line:84%

>>VALONE: Absolutely.

00:24:26.305 --> 00:24:29.000 align:middle line:84%
Even Westinghouse
let him tear up

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.180 align:middle line:84%
the contract which could have
made him a multimillionaire

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:34.880 align:middle line:84%
and never replaced
it with anything

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:39.189 align:middle line:84%
to at least substantiate his
genius and his worthiness.

00:24:39.189 --> 00:24:40.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they
couldn't figure out,

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:42.271 align:middle line:84%
how were they going
to make money off

00:24:42.271 --> 00:24:45.680 align:middle line:84%
of this, because the direction
they wanted to go into

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.865 align:middle line:84%
was charging everybody
like they do today.

00:24:47.865 --> 00:24:48.740 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: Absolutely.

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:51.440 align:middle line:84%
We're suffering under that
paradigm that they invented,

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:54.020 align:middle line:84%
the JP Morgan umbilical
cord, I call it.

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:56.070 align:middle line:84%

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:03.870 align:middle line:84%

00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:08.360 align:middle line:84%
including Dr. Jim Corum's
latest one on the Zenneck wave.

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.850 align:middle line:84%
And this is surprising,
because Corum's discovery

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:14.330 align:middle line:84%
is that not only is there an
atmospheric earth atmosphere

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:18.620 align:middle line:84%
cavity that resonates throughout
the earth to transmit power

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:21.290 align:middle line:84%
if you use a Wardenclyffe
Tower-type antenna,

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:24.320 align:middle line:84%
but also the earth
itself becomes

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:28.100 align:middle line:84%
a medium for transmitting

>>VALONE: Oh my goodness.

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:36.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out, I
was at the patent office.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.780 align:middle line:84%
I was employee as
a patent examiner.

00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And I essentially was
invited by a friend of mine

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:45.410 align:middle line:84%
at the State Department, US
State Department open forum.

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And it was great, because I
actually titled it, Conference

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:52.430 align:middle line:84%
on Free Energy and thought,
oh, this is a great chance

00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:53.690 align:middle line:90%
to finally bring it out.

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:56.750 align:middle line:84%
It's been a decade,
actually two decades

00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:58.670 align:middle line:90%
since I pursued free energy.

00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:00.230 align:middle line:90%
I thought the time was right.

00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:02.052 align:middle line:90%
Turns out I was totally wrong.

00:26:02.052 --> 00:26:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you were
right about the timing.

00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:05.468 align:middle line:84%

were wrong, right?

00:26:05.468 --> 00:26:06.305 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: Exactly.

00:26:06.305 --> 00:26:06.740 align:middle line:90%
The back ledge.

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:07.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did they do?

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:08.570 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: Oh my goodness.

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:10.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, the
American Physical Society

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:14.500 align:middle line:84%
pounced on me every week
by calling it a cold fusion

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:15.300 align:middle line:90%
conference.

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:18.500 align:middle line:84%
But I only had one cold fusion
speaker out of 14 presenters

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:24.380 align:middle line:84%
on new renewable energy and
invented patented energy.

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:27.162 align:middle line:84%
So it turns out
Dr. Zimmerman, who

00:26:27.162 --> 00:26:29.120 align:middle line:84%
was the only physicist
at the State Department,

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:32.270 align:middle line:84%
became my nemesis,
along with Dr. Park,

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:34.800 align:middle line:84%
who was from the University
Maryland Public Relations

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:35.600 align:middle line:90%
department.

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:38.720 align:middle line:84%
And the two of them were just
too much for the patent office,

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:42.110 align:middle line:84%
the Department of Commerce,
and the Department of Energy.

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:44.810 align:middle line:84%
So I literally then
became a media frenzy

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:49.170 align:middle line:84%
with a Nature Magazine article,
Science Magazine article,

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:51.290 align:middle line:90%
APS News, Village Voice.

00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:55.610 align:middle line:84%
They all basically told my
story of this patent examiner

00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:58.430 align:middle line:84%
is trying to do something,
but it's totally unscientific

00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:00.530 align:middle line:90%
and, quote, "pseudoscience."

00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:02.240 align:middle line:84%
So I got fired from
the patent office.

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:03.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From that.

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:06.180 align:middle line:84%
>>VALONE: For misrepresentation
and conflict of interest.

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:08.840 align:middle line:84%
It was laughable
at the time now.

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:12.009 align:middle line:84%
But back then, it was traumatic,
because even as I approached

00:27:12.009 --> 00:27:14.300 align:middle line:84%
the Department of Commerce,
they said, oh why don't you

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:14.950 align:middle line:90%
go to commerce?

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:15.750 align:middle line:90%
You worked there.

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:18.240 align:middle line:84%
They'll give you the chance
to use the auditorium.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.100 align:middle line:90%
No, not really.

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:20.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they
set you up, Tom?

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:26.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VALONE: Well, it was
certainly a difficult situation

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:29.330 align:middle line:84%
that couldn't be resolved
with anything that I

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:32.440 align:middle line:84%
wanted to present, because
the timing was wrong.

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:33.540 align:middle line:90%
That's all I can say.

00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And so even as I changed the
name quickly to Conference

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:39.940 align:middle line:84%
on Future Energy and
pursued that from then on,

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:42.384 align:middle line:84%
I still had to go to a
hotel to have the conference

00:27:42.384 --> 00:27:44.800 align:middle line:84%
and, of course, spent six years
trying to get my job back,

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:45.430 align:middle line:90%
which I did.

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:46.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was it
frustrating for you?

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:47.410 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: Oh, absolutely.

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:48.280 align:middle line:90%
It was traumatic.

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:50.680 align:middle line:84%
But you know, it's
like Dr. Robert Becker,

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:52.960 align:middle line:84%
who was a colleague of
mine and a friend of mine.

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:55.300 align:middle line:84%
When he got fired
for similar reasons,

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:58.780 align:middle line:84%
doing electrotherapy
at a hospital,

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:02.410 align:middle line:84%
he literally then wrote the
book, "The Body Electric."

00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:05.544 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard medical doctors
say, if he hadn't got fired,

00:28:05.544 --> 00:28:07.210 align:middle line:84%
that book would never
have been written,

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:09.370 align:middle line:84%
and electrotherapy
would never be known.

00:28:09.370 --> 00:28:11.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, I pursued my
PhD when I got fired.

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And luckily I then
accomplished and finished it

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:16.520 align:middle line:90%
within the time frame.

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:18.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you were
better off eventually.

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:19.270 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: Exactly.

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:20.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who knew then, though?

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:21.150 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: I know.

00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:23.066 align:middle line:84%
My blessing in
disguise, I would say.

00:28:23.066 --> 00:28:24.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Zero-point energy.

00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:25.450 align:middle line:90%
You wrote a book on that.

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:27.670 align:middle line:84%
>>VALONE: And it was
my thesis topic, yes.

00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:30.105 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is your
definition of zero-point energy?

00:28:30.105 --> 00:28:31.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VALONE: Well,
zero-point energy

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:34.150 align:middle line:84%
is like the waves
on top of the ocean.

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And literally it's
the fluctuations

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:40.150 align:middle line:84%
that you see in the quantum
vacuum everywhere manifest,

00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:43.600 align:middle line:84%
not only in electrons
that are pushed away

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:46.000 align:middle line:84%
from the nucleus when
they're oppositely charged

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.680 align:middle line:84%
and should be
attracting each other,

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:50.290 align:middle line:84%
but the quantum vacuum
keeps them apart.

00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And you see, for example,
liquid helium never

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:58.000 align:middle line:84%
freezing even as it gets within
micro degrees of absolute zero.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.150 align:middle line:84%
Zero-point energy is
manifested in many places.

00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's an indication that
we have negative energy, see,

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:10.120 align:middle line:84%
as Paul Dirac said, that's
full of positron electron pairs

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:12.670 align:middle line:84%
just waiting to jump
out and give us energy.

00:29:12.670 --> 00:29:14.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's it
going to take, Tom,

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:16.532 align:middle line:90%
to get us in that direction?

00:29:16.532 --> 00:29:18.490 align:middle line:84%
>>VALONE: Well, it turns
out the Manelas device

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:22.420 align:middle line:84%
seems to be a very good
breakthrough start.

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And of course more
research needs to be done.

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:27.340 align:middle line:84%
Our institute is advocating
Brian Ahern's research

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:30.740 align:middle line:84%
and doing fundraising
for that purpose.

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's really going to take
some risk-taking donations

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:41.800 align:middle line:84%
to let people like Dr. Ahern
pursue a research project that

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:45.160 align:middle line:84%
at least has evidence that
it could be successful.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:47.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you get
somebody like Jeff Bezos

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:50.335 align:middle line:84%
from Amazon to back
something like this?

00:29:50.335 --> 00:29:52.130 align:middle line:90%
Would he be interested in that?

00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:52.300 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: Well--

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:54.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or would he
say, how am I going to--

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:57.730 align:middle line:84%
like JP Morgan, how am I going
to make money doing this?

00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:00.250 align:middle line:84%
>>VALONE: Well,
that's their problem.

00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:03.340 align:middle line:84%
For example, there is what's
called stealth marketing.

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard experts in
the field talk about this,

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:10.480 align:middle line:84%
that when you finally do, say,
have a device that works--

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:13.360 align:middle line:84%
and we have evidence that
there's already nanocrystalline

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:14.740 align:middle line:90%
device on the market--

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:19.180 align:middle line:84%
that basically you don't tell
people that this is over unity.

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:22.060 align:middle line:84%
I've seen a few devices
already manifest that

00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:25.030 align:middle line:84%
and successfully marketed
with no indication

00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:28.930 align:middle line:84%
that you're getting a little bit
extra than you thought you were

00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:30.280 align:middle line:90%
going to when you bought it.

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:33.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's a good
formula for marketing

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:36.130 align:middle line:84%
so that it doesn't create
the waves and the backlash.

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:39.280 align:middle line:84%
It's called raising the shadow
in Carl Jung psychology.

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:42.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
bioelectromagnetics, Tom?

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:43.900 align:middle line:84%
>>VALONE: Well,
bioelectromagnetics

00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:49.630 align:middle line:84%
is Nikola Tesla's discovery
that the body is essentially

00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:51.400 align:middle line:90%
the same as capacitors.

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:53.290 align:middle line:90%
He called them condensers.

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:56.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's a charge
storage medium.

00:30:56.260 --> 00:31:00.940 align:middle line:84%
Every cell in the
body has a membrane

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:04.600 align:middle line:84%
that's capable of storing
10 million volts per meter

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.780 align:middle line:90%
or 100,000 volts per centimeter.

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:09.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, 10 million volts
across a meter is huge.

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:11.910 align:middle line:84%
It would spark to the
ground immediately.

00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:12.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, sure.

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:15.430 align:middle line:84%
>>VALONE: But our cells know how
to insulate that and store it

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:18.640 align:middle line:84%
as a capacitor, a
charge storage medium.

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out in
biophysics, the body

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:23.680 align:middle line:90%
can only store energy two ways--

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:25.805 align:middle line:84%
chemical gradients or
electrical gradients.

00:31:25.805 --> 00:31:27.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are
companies developing

00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:29.780 align:middle line:84%
pulsed electromagnetic
field therapy.

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:30.580 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:34.180 align:middle line:10%
>> Curatron delivers pulsed
electromagnetic fields that

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:38.500 align:middle line:10%
stimulate the body to work
at its optimum capacity.

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:40.970 align:middle line:84%
The ruler effect is
eliminated, because blood

00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:44.210 align:middle line:84%
is positively charged
and can flow freely,

00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:46.760 align:middle line:84%
absorbing and delivering
more oxygen and nutrients

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:49.520 align:middle line:84%
to the cells and
removing toxins.

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:52.560 align:middle line:84%
The mitochondria operate
at an optimum level

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:54.170 align:middle line:90%
in an aerobic environment.

00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:56.900 align:middle line:84%
Enriched with oxygen, they
are capable of creating

00:31:56.900 --> 00:32:01.670 align:middle line:84%
38 ATP for each molecule
of sugar that is digested.

00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:04.790 align:middle line:84%
The blood cells fuel the
body for cell activity

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:06.620 align:middle line:90%
with optimum efficiency.

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:10.790 align:middle line:84%
Brain activity, physical
activity, healing activity all

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:14.810 align:middle line:84%
takes place at a greater
level because of PEMF.

00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:17.480 align:middle line:84%
Because it benefits the
body at a cellular level,

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:20.540 align:middle line:84%
there are many different
applications for PEMF--

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:23.030 align:middle line:84%
athletic performance
enhancement,

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:27.320 align:middle line:84%
injury healing and pain
therapy, anti-aging,

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:32.060 align:middle line:84%
increasing energy, disease
prevention and recovery.

00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:34.430 align:middle line:84%
PEMF stimulates the
natural endorphins

00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:36.800 align:middle line:84%
providing effective
pain therapy,

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:40.730 align:middle line:84%
reducing or eliminating the
need for toxic narcotics.

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:45.230 align:middle line:84%
Effective pain relief is seen
for arthritis and joint pain,

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:50.060 align:middle line:84%
fibromyalgia, back pain,
and ankylosing spondylitis.

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Because of Curatron's
powerful penetration

00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:56.450 align:middle line:84%
of up to 160,000 microtesla,
it has the ability

00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:58.580 align:middle line:84%
to penetrate deep
within the skull

00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:00.570 align:middle line:84%
and treat the brain
with energy medicine.

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:01.370 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:04.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's pretty dramatic,
Tom, if that's all true.

00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:04.910 align:middle line:90%
Is it?

00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:07.640 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: 95% of that is true.

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:10.940 align:middle line:84%
The very end of it is
actually dangerous,

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:13.490 align:middle line:84%
because when you get into
the millitesla range,

00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:15.810 align:middle line:84%
which is what the
numbers he quoted are,

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:20.300 align:middle line:84%
you're actually starting to get
to the-- and it's in my book,

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:22.010 align:middle line:90%
"Bioelectromagnetic Healing"--

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:24.670 align:middle line:84%
specifically called
electroporation.

00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:29.360 align:middle line:84%
Our PEMF devices that
our institute actually

00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:32.720 align:middle line:84%
markets on the
BioEnergyDevice.org website

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:36.840 align:middle line:84%
is essentially designed after
Dr. Glen Gordon's discovery.

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And that is that the nanosecond
rise time of the pulse in PEMF

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:44.630 align:middle line:84%
is more important than
the height of the pulse.

00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:46.600 align:middle line:84%
They're talking about
the height of the pulse.

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:50.580 align:middle line:84%
Oh, huge micro-- very
strong magnetic field.

00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:52.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, you don't need
strong magnetic fields

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.680 align:middle line:84%
to have all the benefits
he talked about.

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:58.010 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Dr. Gordon discovered
that the nanosecond rise

00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:02.720 align:middle line:84%
time stimulates what's called
HSP or heat shock protein.

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.650 align:middle line:84%
And heat shock
protein is amazing.

00:34:04.650 --> 00:34:08.270 align:middle line:84%
We've seen it, for
example, even my wife who

00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:11.394 align:middle line:84%
bumped her tibia
on a metal chair,

00:34:11.394 --> 00:34:13.560 align:middle line:84%
thinking literally it was
so painful that it's going

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:15.469 align:middle line:90%
to be black and blue, swell up.

00:34:15.469 --> 00:34:18.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, instead of ice, I
grabbed our EM pulser,

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:19.995 align:middle line:90%
about 20 minutes.

00:34:19.995 --> 00:34:20.795 align:middle line:90%
No scarring.

00:34:20.795 --> 00:34:21.110 align:middle line:90%
No--

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:21.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing.

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:22.580 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: --black and blue.

00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:23.380 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:25.790 align:middle line:84%
And this is exactly what
Dr. Gordon predicted.

00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:27.949 align:middle line:90%
We've seen our clients say so.

00:34:27.949 --> 00:34:30.560 align:middle line:84%
But to see it
personally happen where

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:34.454 align:middle line:84%
heat shock protein prevents the
inflammation, it's wonderful.

00:34:34.454 --> 00:34:35.870 align:middle line:84%
It's a great
alternative to drugs.

00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:37.911 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wouldn't want
to bombard my brain what

00:34:37.911 --> 00:34:39.237 align:middle line:90%
that thing, thought.

00:34:39.237 --> 00:34:41.570 align:middle line:84%
Is that part of the thing you
said we need to be careful

00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:42.370 align:middle line:90%
about?

00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:43.460 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: Exactly.

00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:46.580 align:middle line:84%
You're getting to the
electroshock treatment range

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:47.420 align:middle line:90%
at that point.

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:51.739 align:middle line:84%
Instead, it's very
good to consider

00:34:51.739 --> 00:34:53.480 align:middle line:90%
pulsed magnetic fields--

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:56.000 align:middle line:84%
PEMF, in other words--
for any part of the body,

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.750 align:middle line:84%
because you will get lots
of benefits, including

00:34:59.750 --> 00:35:05.540 align:middle line:84%
the anti-inflammation
and the helpful healing

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:07.420 align:middle line:90%
and restoration of tissue.

00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:09.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Remember the
"Star Trek" episodes

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:12.890 align:middle line:84%
where the doctor had this
wand which kind of like,

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:15.320 align:middle line:90%
he waved over people.

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:17.400 align:middle line:84%
Are we talking about
stuff like that?

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:18.200 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: Yes.

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:19.320 align:middle line:90%
Yes, exactly.

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:22.730 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see in
a video we supply,

00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:26.270 align:middle line:84%
speaking of your injury, Dr.
Gordon's lecture on this topic.

00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:29.740 align:middle line:84%
He describes moving
the EM pulser,

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:31.730 align:middle line:84%
or he called it
empulse at the time,

00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:34.820 align:middle line:84%
over the area to
treat a larger area.

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:36.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is it
about the human body that

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:40.560 align:middle line:84%
reacts to this kind of
electromagnetic stimulus?

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:42.860 align:middle line:84%
>>VALONE: Well, it's
literally "The Body Electric"

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:47.420 align:middle line:84%
that Dr. Becker described in
his book and I do in my book.

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:50.300 align:middle line:84%
But the exciting thing
is that, as I pointed out

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:53.510 align:middle line:84%
what Nikola Tesla
discovered, every cell loves

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:56.360 align:middle line:90%
to have high-voltage charge.

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:59.600 align:middle line:84%
And even if it isn't high
voltage, but it's electrons.

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:01.605 align:middle line:84%
See, my discovery
along with another

00:36:01.605 --> 00:36:04.580 align:middle line:84%
of Dr. Oschman's discovery
is that electrons

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:05.940 align:middle line:90%
are antioxidants.

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:09.050 align:middle line:84%
So instead of popping pills
that give you the extra electron

00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:12.050 align:middle line:84%
that quench free radicals,
because free radical damage

00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:17.720 align:middle line:84%
associated with aging is
basically unpaired molecules

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:19.400 align:middle line:90%
that are seeking electrons.

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:21.429 align:middle line:84%
And they keep stealing
it from other tissues.

00:36:21.429 --> 00:36:23.220 align:middle line:84%
You can have a chain
reaction, for example,

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:25.610 align:middle line:84%
if you take a shower
without a shower filter,

00:36:25.610 --> 00:36:29.090 align:middle line:84%
because chlorine disassociates
in warm water body temperature.

00:36:29.090 --> 00:36:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And you're rapidly
aging that way.

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:35.330 align:middle line:84%
So it's important to
consider antioxidants.

00:36:35.330 --> 00:36:40.250 align:middle line:84%
But electrons provided by PEMF
or any other electrotherapy

00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:42.740 align:middle line:84%
device gives you
electrons directly.

00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:45.721 align:middle line:84%
And you can feel pain relief,
for example, by putting--

00:36:45.721 --> 00:36:47.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Pretty
fast too, can't you?

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:47.630 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: Absolutely.

00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:49.970 align:middle line:84%
That's why we thought of
offering you and sending

00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:52.850 align:middle line:84%
you a premier junior
high-voltage device, a little

00:36:52.850 --> 00:36:55.342 align:middle line:84%
Tesla coil that you
can hold in your hand.

00:36:55.342 --> 00:36:56.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Would it work?

00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:58.160 align:middle line:84%
>>VALONE: Absolutely,
it works if you--

00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:58.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'll try it out.

00:36:58.820 --> 00:36:59.310 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: OK.

00:36:59.310 --> 00:36:59.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah--

00:36:59.490 --> 00:36:59.845 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'll try it out.

00:36:59.845 --> 00:37:00.970 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: --you'd enjoy it.

00:37:00.970 --> 00:37:02.220 align:middle line:90%
And it lights up.

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:03.440 align:middle line:90%
You can feel the sparking.

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:05.606 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly,
it transmits not only

00:37:05.606 --> 00:37:06.980 align:middle line:84%
the high voltage
so you can light

00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:09.590 align:middle line:84%
a compound fluorescent light
bulb in the other hand,

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:13.520 align:middle line:84%
but you can also feel the
penetration of electrons

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:14.900 align:middle line:90%
deep within the tissues.

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:19.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My father, God rest
his soul, back 50 years ago

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:22.985 align:middle line:84%
had a light device that he
used to rub all over his-- it

00:37:22.985 --> 00:37:25.250 align:middle line:90%
was like an infrared thing.

00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:29.360 align:middle line:84%
But he'd rub it all over his
legs and stuff like that.

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:31.140 align:middle line:84%
Maybe he was ahead
of his time, huh?

00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:31.940 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: He was.

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:36.950 align:middle line:84%
In fact, now we market that as a
ATP turbo device or a turbo LED

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:38.060 align:middle line:90%
array it's called.

00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:40.790 align:middle line:10%
And the turbo LED is
essentially called

00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:43.370 align:middle line:10%
that, because when you
get to the right frequency

00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:47.270 align:middle line:10%
of infrared, you actually
then turbo charge

00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:48.907 align:middle line:10%
the ATP of the cells.

00:37:48.907 --> 00:37:50.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's going to
come first, Tom, in terms

00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:53.150 align:middle line:90%
of mass application?

00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:59.840 align:middle line:84%
The ability for our homes to be
self-powered or these healing

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:01.100 align:middle line:90%
mechanisms?

00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:02.180 align:middle line:90%
What's going to happen?

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:04.580 align:middle line:84%
>>VALONE: Well, we feel
our institute is devoted

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:06.410 align:middle line:90%
to three-prong attack--

00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:09.040 align:middle line:84%
energy, propulsion,
bioenergetics.

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:11.660 align:middle line:84%
And if we approach all
three simultaneously,

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:14.840 align:middle line:84%
we can then maybe solve
the world's problems

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:17.480 align:middle line:84%
and ameliorate some of
the worst conditions

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:19.010 align:middle line:90%
that we see in human life.

00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:22.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What will it take for
somebody or some government

00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:26.000 align:middle line:84%
to say, we like what these
people are talking about,

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.720 align:middle line:90%
let's do it?

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:30.170 align:middle line:84%
>>VALONE: Well, obviously
in any situation

00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:33.590 align:middle line:84%
in either of the energy
propulsion or bioenergetics

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:36.500 align:middle line:90%
arena, it needs major funding.

00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And certainly there are
programs and projects

00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:44.030 align:middle line:84%
that we've engaged in
to essentially address

00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:45.240 align:middle line:90%
those issues.

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:48.020 align:middle line:84%
For example, we've funded
some propulsion projects

00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:49.820 align:middle line:90%
at our conference.

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:52.910 align:middle line:84%
We have two fellows, Mike
Gamble who retired from Boeing,

00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:55.775 align:middle line:90%
who's developing electrical--

00:38:55.775 --> 00:39:00.950 align:middle line:84%
it's a gyroscopic motion device
that's been used on the ISS.

00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And no one knew it, because
Boeing kept it proprietary.

00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:06.720 align:middle line:84%
So there's lots of
solutions out there.

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And of course, maybe the black
project people knew about it

00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:10.760 align:middle line:90%
and know about it.

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:12.624 align:middle line:84%
But it's time for the
civilian population

00:39:12.624 --> 00:39:14.040 align:middle line:84%
to start using
these technologies.

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:16.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us about
the Hutchison effect.

00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:20.060 align:middle line:84%
>>VALONE: Well, you know,
as we get to the seriousness

00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:24.560 align:middle line:84%
of the later-century conditions,
we might want to consider

00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:29.287 align:middle line:84%
the fact that humans have
more power bio-energetically--

00:39:29.287 --> 00:39:30.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Within ourselves.

00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:32.900 align:middle line:84%
>>VALONE: --within ourselves
than we ever thought possible.

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, our effort
in that regard has

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:41.030 align:middle line:84%
been to publish a book by George
Hathaway, professional engineer

00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:43.342 align:middle line:84%
from Canada, called
"Mindbending."

00:39:43.342 --> 00:39:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And the "Mindbending"
book is tremendous,

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:48.770 align:middle line:84%
because what George did as
a very physical scientist,

00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:52.490 align:middle line:84%
he investigated John
Hutchison for years, looked

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:55.480 align:middle line:84%
at his anomalous stuff that's
in this "Free Energy, Race

00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:57.980 align:middle line:84%
to Zero Point" video,
so bending of metals

00:39:57.980 --> 00:39:59.300 align:middle line:90%
and levitating objects.

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And John was
way ahead of his time.

00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:02.613 align:middle line:84%
>>VALONE: John seemed to
be way ahead of his time.

00:40:02.613 --> 00:40:04.280 align:middle line:84%
For years, people
thought, oh, it

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:06.170 align:middle line:84%
must be the Tesla
coil and Van de Graaff

00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:08.480 align:middle line:84%
combination of this
electrical circuit

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:10.160 align:middle line:90%
that nobody can figure out.

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:13.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out it only
worked when John was there.

00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:17.060 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that John
has this ability called

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:20.510 align:middle line:84%
psychokinesis, which
George delineates very

00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:23.390 align:middle line:84%
well in "Mindbending" to show
that the high voltage seems

00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:26.060 align:middle line:90%
to amplify the PK effect.

00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen this
in Puharich's work,

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:29.445 align:middle line:90%
"Beyond Telepathy."

00:40:29.445 --> 00:40:30.320 align:middle line:90%
He also witnessed it.

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:31.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is exciting.

00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:34.335 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the field you're in,
Tom, is pretty dramatic--

00:40:34.335 --> 00:40:35.460 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: Hey, Jack Houck--

00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:36.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --once
we get through it.

00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:37.790 align:middle line:90%

how to bend spoons and so forth.

00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:43.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uri Geller.

00:40:43.330 --> 00:40:43.620 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: And Uri Geller.

only the climate
problem, because we're

00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:25.039 align:middle line:84%

But I'll tell you, what
happens with Prahlad Jani.

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:52.440 align:middle line:84%
Prahlad Jani is a
yogi in India who's

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:55.920 align:middle line:84%
been studied very well by
medical doctors, isolated

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:59.670 align:middle line:84%
for a couple of weeks in
a medical hospital room

00:41:59.670 --> 00:42:01.672 align:middle line:84%
under 24-hour guards,
cameras, and everything.

>>NOORY: Oh, that's the person
who doesn't eat or drink,

00:42:04.005 --> 00:42:04.230 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:05.100 align:middle line:90%
>>VALONE: Or drink.

00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:07.230 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
about the phenomenon, which

00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:11.190 align:middle line:84%
I've experienced with Norman
Paulsen's physiology as well,

00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:15.420 align:middle line:84%
is that it ends up creating
this very strange they call it

00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:18.060 align:middle line:84%
elixir that flows down
the back of the throat.

00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:21.030 align:middle line:90%
It's a fatty liquid substance.

00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:22.890 align:middle line:90%
Who knows how it's generated?

00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:25.210 align:middle line:84%
But the human body is
capable of doing this.

00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:27.930 align:middle line:84%
Prahlad Jani in the video
actually puts his hand

00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:30.295 align:middle line:84%
in the mouth and offers
it to the reporter.

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:41.010 align:middle line:10%
Prahlad Jani has been
described as a hermit who

00:42:41.010 --> 00:42:43.050 align:middle line:10%
claims to have wandered
around India's jungles

00:42:43.050 --> 00:42:45.000 align:middle line:10%

eight and not eaten

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.120 align:middle line:10%

His claims are now
being put to the test.

00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:53.070 align:middle line:84%
A key Indian medical
institute is observing him

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:56.010 align:middle line:84%
in a private hospital in
the Western state of Gujarat

00:42:56.010 --> 00:42:58.500 align:middle line:84%
with already
astonishing results.

>> We are all watching a miracle
in the science of biology,

He has not drank a little
drop of any kind of liquid.

00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:22.860 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly,
he has not passed

00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:25.320 align:middle line:90%
a drop of urine or stool.

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:27.780 align:middle line:84%
>> The hospital has said
that initial tests have shown

00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:31.680 align:middle line:84%
the man has a brain resembling
that of a 25-year-old and that

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:35.280 align:middle line:84%
Yogic exercise has meant his
body has undergone a biological

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:36.750 align:middle line:90%
transformation.

00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:39.390 align:middle line:84%
Studying him could allow
scientists and doctors

00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:42.420 align:middle line:84%
to understand better how to
survive without food or water

I firmly believe that.

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's been, from
what I've seen in,

00:44:55.990 --> 00:45:01.140 align:middle line:84%
for example, the book by
Dr. Michael Werner called

00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:06.960 align:middle line:84%
"Life from Light" and
also the book by Ray Maor,

"A Year Without Food."

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:11.160 align:middle line:84%
Both of those books
are showing a roadmap

for people who are willing
to take that conversion.

00:45:14.912 --> 00:45:17.370 align:middle line:84%
