00:00:05.254 --> 00:00:07.420 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.295 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:09.295 --> 00:00:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.784 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.784 --> 00:00:15.450 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.480 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.255 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:26.804 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.804 --> 00:00:28.970 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE NOORY: And welcome
back to another edition

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.490 align:middle line:84%
of "Beyond Belief," where we
bring you some of the most

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.200 align:middle line:84%
incredible stories that
truly are beyond belief.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.830 align:middle line:84%
Our guest, R. Gary Patterson,
rock and roll historian,

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:39.540 align:middle line:90%
noted author.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.140 align:middle line:84%
One of his books,
"The Walrus was Paul."

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.110 align:middle line:84%
Always have been
fascinated with that work.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.651 align:middle line:84%
How did you get
involved in all this?

00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:47.910 align:middle line:90%
The musical world?

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.450 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY PATTERSON: I grew
up at the right time.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.880 align:middle line:84%
Because when I was
little, I got to listen

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.500 align:middle line:84%
to probably the golden
age Renaissance of music.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And the Beatles were
there when I was young.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.260 align:middle line:84%
I grew up, I wanted
to learn to play

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.217 align:middle line:84%
the guitar because
of the Beatles.

00:01:02.217 --> 00:01:04.800 align:middle line:84%
I can honestly say that when I
watched "The Ed Sullivan Show,"

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.700 align:middle line:90%
it changed my life.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.820 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It was electrifying.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:07.930 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: It
was electrifying.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Billy Graham stayed
home from church that night.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.330 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What year
was that, Gary?

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.130 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: 1964

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: '64.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.021 align:middle line:90%
I was 14 years old.

00:01:14.021 --> 00:01:16.020 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: Yeah, well,
I was in eighth grade.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.940 align:middle line:84%
So we're probably
close to the same age.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.670 align:middle line:90%
And I watched it that night.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.570 align:middle line:84%
And I never had anything
touch me as their music.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.850 align:middle line:84%
But it was just not me,
it was everyone else.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.790 align:middle line:90%
So I grew up with the Beatles.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:28.690 align:middle line:90%
'64.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.130 align:middle line:84%
And in '69, there
was a strange rumor

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.400 align:middle line:84%
that came out of
Detroit, Michigan.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.790 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: WKNR Radio.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:36.360 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: With Russ Gibb.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.060 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yup.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.170 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Uncle Russ.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.680 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I was in Detroit
right then, during all that.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.380 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: And when the
caller Tom called in and said,

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.710 align:middle line:84%
I want to rap with you
about McCartney being dead.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.170 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And then on the air, they spent
hours going through clues on --

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.100 align:middle line:84%
listening to certain phrases
on songs and looking at certain

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.010 align:middle line:90%
pictures on album covers.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And it created a
national emergency.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:00.732 align:middle line:90%
It was carried on--

00:02:00.732 --> 00:02:01.940 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It was a huge story

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:02.690 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Yes.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:03.470 align:middle line:90%
Roby Yonge did it.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And the manager of
the station came over,

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.680 align:middle line:84%
and he said, Roby,
you've got to stop this.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.750 align:middle line:84%
You're creating
a national panic.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.550 align:middle line:84%
And then, everyone
thought Paul was dead.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.620 align:middle line:84%
And it was either
probably the greatest hoax

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.706 align:middle line:84%
that made lots of
money for the Beatles,

00:02:19.706 --> 00:02:21.580 align:middle line:84%
because people were
buying all those albums--

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.080 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Tremendous
marketing idea.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.200 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Tremendous.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.370 align:middle line:84%
But some people believe that
Paul really did leave us.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's what made
it interesting for me.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.260 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to recount
the old clues, trying

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.055 align:middle line:84%
to create a reading environment
where the reader would

00:02:38.055 --> 00:02:39.971 align:middle line:84%
be brought into it,
and say, oh my gosh,

00:02:39.971 --> 00:02:40.970 align:middle line:90%
how fascinating this is.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.720 align:middle line:84%
I got to keep reading
to find the answer.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.990 align:middle line:90%
That is how we were.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.786 align:middle line:90%
And that's why I wrote the book.

00:02:45.786 --> 00:02:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And then I found
a few clues that

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.110 align:middle line:84%
made me think the Beatles
really planted this.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.840 align:middle line:90%
This was all not coincidence.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.000 align:middle line:84%
It was all not just some, OK,
you see this, it's a joke.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.250 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
couldn't be answered.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.996 align:middle line:84%
And I've not had
it addressed today.

00:02:59.996 --> 00:03:02.370 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Because when you
would play some of the records

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.735 align:middle line:84%
backwards, you would hear
things like, "I buried Paul,"

00:03:05.735 --> 00:03:06.655 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:03:06.655 --> 00:03:07.440 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON:
[LAUGHS] That's right.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.870 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Which normally
would not be there,

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.489 align:middle line:84%
unless they put it
there on purpose.

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:12.280 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Yeah.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.988 align:middle line:84%
Because you go into
the fascinating world

00:03:13.988 --> 00:03:15.570 align:middle line:90%
of the backward mask.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And there are backward
tracks on records.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.970 align:middle line:84%
The Beatles were the very first
to put a backward vocal track

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:21.820 align:middle line:90%
on the record.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And that was, if you listen to
"Rain," the very last verse,

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.801 align:middle line:84%
it sounds like John
Lennon is chanting.

00:03:27.801 --> 00:03:30.300 align:middle line:84%
But when you reserve it, he
just says, "When the rain comes,

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.910 align:middle line:90%
they run and hide their heads."

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And when he did the line from
"Strawberry Fields Forever,"

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.110 align:middle line:84%
but if you it to sounds very
closely to "I buried Paul."

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And on the anthology, you
hear it say more like,

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.390 align:middle line:90%
"cranberry sauce."

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.420 align:middle line:84%
And Derek Taylor said,
listen, I was there.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.530 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't say "I buried Paul."

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.340 align:middle line:90%
He said, "I'm very bored."

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.810 align:middle line:84%
So you have three
different explanations.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.144 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: But why did it get on?

00:03:57.144 --> 00:03:59.518 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: Well, you know,
that's kind of interesting.

00:03:59.518 --> 00:04:01.480 align:middle line:84%
In a fade out, why would
that sound be there?

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.600 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Yeah, in
the first place?

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.933 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: And you have
to remember that the "Magical

00:04:04.933 --> 00:04:08.700 align:middle line:84%
Mystery Tour" album, where we
would have the song "Strawberry

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.270 align:middle line:84%
Fields Forever," was all
recorded at the of "Sgt.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:12.330 align:middle line:90%
Pepper's."

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.260 align:middle line:90%
So those were leftover songs.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.980 align:middle line:84%
So whatever was cooking
in the Beatles' minds

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.670 align:middle line:84%
when "Sgt. Pepper"
came out, it continued

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.130 align:middle line:90%
on the "Magical Mystery Tour."

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.375 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: The Beatles took this
country by storm after the Ed

00:04:25.375 --> 00:04:27.000 align:middle line:90%
Sullivan performance.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.730 align:middle line:90%
The haircuts.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.180 align:middle line:84%
I remember parents panicking
because their sons wanted

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.570 align:middle line:84%
to grow their hair
like the Beatles.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And then later on,
in the later '60s

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.321 align:middle line:84%
during Vietnam, the
Beatles haircut,

00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:42.320 align:middle line:84%
that was short, considering
what happened later.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.550 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: No.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.820 align:middle line:90%
Look at it today.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:43.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.660 align:middle line:90%
Look at it today.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.130 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Why did they have
such incredible influence then.

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And to this day, the
remaining, those who are alive,

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.879 align:middle line:84%
Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr,
they still have that presence?

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:57.670 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: Well,
they wrote great songs.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.260 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Assuming
it is Paul McCartney.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.180 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: They
wrote great songs.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.310 align:middle line:90%
And the music talked to us.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And then they led a
social revolution.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And you were talking
about parents

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.945 align:middle line:84%
were afraid their sons
would have a Beatle haircut.

00:05:11.945 --> 00:05:14.140 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you, I had the
best Beatle haircut ever.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.830 align:middle line:90%
I should have brought a picture.

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.410 align:middle line:90%
It sort of left me now.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.460 align:middle line:84%
But also, high school
principals didn't

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:20.930 align:middle line:90%
like the idea of the guys--

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.180 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They didn't like it.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.888 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: They
didn't like it at all.

00:05:23.888 --> 00:05:25.250 align:middle line:90%
But that made us like it more.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.070 align:middle line:84%
Because if our parents
hated it, then we

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.520 align:middle line:90%
knew it had to be great music.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.740 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: But the
thing about the Beatles,

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:31.740 align:middle line:90%
our parents liked the music too.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.580 align:middle line:84%
I remember my mom
humming along with it.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.320 align:middle line:84%
My daughter is one of the
biggest Beatle fans ever.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.000 align:middle line:84%
So my music transcended
to her generation.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.880 align:middle line:84%
I've gone to Beatlefest in
New York, and Chicago, and LA,

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.260 align:middle line:84%
and everywhere else,
and I see these kids

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.530 align:middle line:84%
who are nine years old
with Beatles t-shirts,

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.170 align:middle line:84%
walking up to me, and knowing
all the lyrics to the songs,

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:52.560 align:middle line:90%
and having me sign books.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.080 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, you know, I
loved the Beatles until they

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.040 align:middle line:90%
went psychedelic on me.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason, I
didn't get into that.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.760 align:middle line:90%
Was that a mistake?

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.051 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: I don't think so.

00:06:03.051 --> 00:06:05.360 align:middle line:84%
I think what they
did-- all right.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.790 align:middle line:84%
Rock groups have the
absolute responsibility

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:13.060 align:middle line:84%
to transcend what they've
done, to break new ground.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.019 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And to morph.

00:06:14.019 --> 00:06:14.809 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Yeah.

00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:16.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to change
with the times.

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.499 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so many rock
groups have written songs.

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:19.915 align:middle line:84%
They've come up
with a good album,

00:06:19.915 --> 00:06:21.110 align:middle line:90%
and never went anywhere else.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.790 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: One-shot wonder.

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:22.623 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Right.

00:06:22.623 --> 00:06:23.860 align:middle line:90%
But look at the Beatles.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.770 align:middle line:84%
When the psychedelic
stage of the Beatles

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.590 align:middle line:84%
came in-- "Rain" to
me was psychedelic--

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.830 align:middle line:84%
the "Revolver" album,
which is my favorite album,

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.340 align:middle line:84%
was the very beginning
of the psychedelic thing.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.840 align:middle line:84%
If you listen to "Tomorrow
Never Knows," "Backward Track

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:36.340 align:middle line:90%
Sounds."

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:37.740 align:middle line:90%
I love that song.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.850 align:middle line:90%
And then "Sgt. Pepper" came out.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And "Sgt Pepper" was
different from any album

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.270 align:middle line:90%
the Beatles had ever recorded.

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.360 align:middle line:90%
The music was different.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.780 align:middle line:90%
Heavily influenced--

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:51.120 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Didn't it
drive Brian Wilson crazy?

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.120 align:middle line:90%
And we'll get into that.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.328 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Yeah, we will--

00:06:53.328 --> 00:06:55.900 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Because he heard
this sound, and he was Mr.

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.830 align:middle line:90%
Good Vibrations, he went crazy.

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.840 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: But you
know what the problem was?

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:05.500 align:middle line:84%
The Beatles took pet sounds
that Brian Wilson had written

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:06.310 align:middle line:90%
in '66--

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:06.815 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Which was genius.

00:07:06.815 --> 00:07:07.710 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: It was genius.

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And they said, oh my gosh,
there's no way we can top this.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.240 align:middle line:90%
There's no way.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.520 align:middle line:84%
So McCartney flew
back to London,

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.290 align:middle line:84%
and he said, maybe I'll have
a song about a band in a park.

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:19.130 align:middle line:90%
And we'll do a concept album.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.690 align:middle line:90%
So they did.

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And when Brian
Wilson heard it, it

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.760 align:middle line:84%
was so disturbing for
him, because as an artist,

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.550 align:middle line:84%
he was saying, how am
I going to top that?

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And the story goes that he
listened to "Sgt. Pepper's"

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.750 align:middle line:84%
for days on end on
headphones, and that he

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:35.565 align:middle line:84%
was getting that very close
drift into his mental issues

00:07:35.565 --> 00:07:37.190 align:middle line:84%
that plagued him for
a number of years.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:37.280 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Mm-hm.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.160 align:middle line:90%
May have pushed him.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.910 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: May have
pushed him into it.

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:43.250 align:middle line:84%
But for me, I just
like the idea that you

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:45.470 align:middle line:84%
have so many different
flavors of music.

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:47.460 align:middle line:84%
But then again,
let's take a look.

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.000 align:middle line:90%
What if that album flopped?

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.300 align:middle line:84%
The Beatles had never had an
album that didn't do well.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.144 align:middle line:90%
But this was a complete change.

00:07:54.144 --> 00:07:55.060 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It was huge.

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:56.226 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: A huge change.

00:07:56.226 --> 00:07:58.200 align:middle line:90%


00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.830 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Was that the cover
where they looked like they

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:02.350 align:middle line:90%
were in a funeral procession?

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:03.420 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: Oh,
that was "Abbey Road."

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:04.490 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That was "Abbey Road."

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:06.865 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: But if you look
at the "Sgt. Pepper" cover,

00:08:06.865 --> 00:08:08.320 align:middle line:90%
you see two sets of Beatles.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.019 align:middle line:84%
And then you see what appears
to be a freshly dug grave.

00:08:11.019 --> 00:08:13.310 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: "Sgt Pepper" cover
had all these faces on it.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:13.670 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Right.

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And they had to get permission
from all these people.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And if you look
at the cover, you

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:18.404 align:middle line:84%
have people who
had tragic lives,

00:08:18.404 --> 00:08:19.820 align:middle line:84%
you had people who
were comedians.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:21.320 align:middle line:90%
You had people who were young.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.800 align:middle line:90%
You had people who were old.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.920 align:middle line:84%
You had people who were good
as ministers and churches

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.650 align:middle line:90%
and merishas and all that.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And then you had
Aleister Crowley.

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:34.049 align:middle line:84%
And you had the yin yang of
the universe on that album.

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:35.512 align:middle line:90%
But what if it didn't sell?

00:08:35.512 --> 00:08:37.970 align:middle line:84%
What if people said, you know,
I don't want to listen "Sgt.

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:38.767 align:middle line:90%
Pepper's."

00:08:38.767 --> 00:08:40.850 align:middle line:84%
I want listen to "I Want
to Hold Your Hand," not--

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:41.450 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah. "She Loves You."

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:41.880 align:middle line:90%
That stuff.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:42.250 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Yeah.

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:43.541 align:middle line:90%
I want to listen to that stuff.

00:08:43.541 --> 00:08:44.860 align:middle line:90%
You guys, you've lost me.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:50.890 align:middle line:84%
So if it failed, what better
ploy than to put a few clues,

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:54.420 align:middle line:84%
so that if the album failed, you
could sort of leak it out that,

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.890 align:middle line:90%
Paul McCartney's dead.

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:58.015 align:middle line:90%
There's clues on the album.

00:08:58.015 --> 00:09:00.223 align:middle line:84%
So everybody would go out
and by the album, just to--

00:09:00.223 --> 00:09:01.490 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Get the album.

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:02.286 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

00:09:02.286 --> 00:09:03.410 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Oh, they did.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:04.520 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And they did.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.185 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: And not only "Sgt.
Pepper's," but all the Beatles

00:09:07.185 --> 00:09:07.790 align:middle line:90%
albums.

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:10.020 align:middle line:84%
And then clues
started coming up.

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And you had clues that came
out of areas like on "Help,"

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:16.060 align:middle line:90%
Paul doesn't have a hat.

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:16.670 align:middle line:90%
Well, see--

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:18.760 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Or no shoes
on, or something, right?

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.500 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: The problem was
that the Beatles were on tour

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:22.630 align:middle line:90%
through 1966.

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:24.404 align:middle line:90%
So it had to happen after '66.

00:09:24.404 --> 00:09:25.070 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:29.530 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: And that's why
the thing that amazed me was

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:31.530 align:middle line:84%
finding the clue on the
"Sgt. Pepper's base rim,

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:34.090 align:middle line:84%
where you take a
straight-edge mirror,

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:36.500 align:middle line:84%
and you place it in the
center of "Lonely Hearts,"

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:40.240 align:middle line:84%
and it spells out the cryptic
message, "Roman numeral I,

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.370 align:middle line:90%
O-N-E, Roman numeral IX, nine.

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:44.622 align:middle line:90%
And then it says, "He die."

00:09:44.622 --> 00:09:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And the arrow points
up to Paul McCartney

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:47.810 align:middle line:90%
perfectly in the center.

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:50.670 align:middle line:90%
And that would be 1/19, he die.

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.280 align:middle line:90%
1, 1 makes 11.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.260 align:middle line:90%
Nine is the day.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And on November 9 in at
least three Beatle sources,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.045 align:middle line:84%
they mention a car
accident Paul McCartney had

00:09:58.045 --> 00:09:59.810 align:middle line:84%
on November 9 at 5
o'clock in the morning.

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:00.910 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Great, great clues.

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:01.320 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Great clues.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.570 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And radio
stations, as you know Gary,

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:04.999 align:middle line:90%
just digested all that.

00:10:04.999 --> 00:10:05.790 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Yeah.

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:07.415 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They talked
about it forever.

00:10:07.415 --> 00:10:09.250 align:middle line:90%
They played the songs.

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:10.529 align:middle line:90%
It was a great marketing tool.

00:10:10.529 --> 00:10:11.570 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Oh, it was.

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And to be young at
that time, and sitting

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:15.900 align:middle line:84%
in a dorm room with
the "White" Album,"

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.109 align:middle line:84%
playing it backwards scared
the daylights out of you.

00:10:18.109 --> 00:10:18.858 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Exactly.

00:10:18.858 --> 00:10:21.600 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: And just the idea,
what if Paul McCartney really

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.670 align:middle line:90%
were dead?

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:24.862 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Does Paul
ever address that?

00:10:24.862 --> 00:10:26.570 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: I think
he has fun with it.

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:28.960 align:middle line:84%
I know that when he
was 50, I believe,

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.440 align:middle line:84%
he came out with the
album "Paul is Live."

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And he's crossing Abbey Road
in the same outfit he wore,

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:38.780 align:middle line:84%
and leading his big
English sheepdog.

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And the license plate
said 50 years, not 28IF.

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:44.616 align:middle line:90%
So he has fun with it.

00:10:44.616 --> 00:10:45.990 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: John
Lennon, of course,

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:48.340 align:middle line:84%
was an incredible
part of the Beatles.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:51.415 align:middle line:84%
When did things start
going south for that group?

00:10:51.415 --> 00:10:53.540 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: Well, you
know, some people blame his

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:56.080 align:middle line:90%
relationship with Yoko Ono.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:00.080 align:middle line:84%
I think that Paul and John had
a very special relationship.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.830 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They were
friends, weren't they?

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:04.413 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: They were friends,
and they wrote fabulous music

00:11:04.413 --> 00:11:08.250 align:middle line:84%
together because they
could play off each other.

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was it wasn't
fun being a Beatle after 1966.

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.690 align:middle line:84%
When the Beatles were
in the Philippines

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:17.990 align:middle line:84%
and they snubbed the
Marcos family and didn't go

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:21.620 align:middle line:84%
play, and here's Imelda
Marcos on television crying

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:24.220 align:middle line:84%
with all these little
orphans, and the Filipino army

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:25.860 align:middle line:90%
is coming after the Beatles.

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And they're running
to get on the plane.

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:30.119 align:middle line:84%
And they announced for
Brian Epstein and Mal

00:11:30.119 --> 00:11:32.410 align:middle line:84%
Evans, who were associated
management with the Beatles,

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:33.780 align:middle line:90%
to get off the plane.

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:38.140 align:middle line:84%
Male Evans turns to one
of the other managers

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:40.420 align:middle line:84%
and he says, tell
my wife I love her.

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:41.930 align:middle line:84%
Because he was convinced they
were going to murder him.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They
thought that was it.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.270 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: They were
going to shoot him.

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:44.200 align:middle line:90%
And they took their money.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.866 align:middle line:84%
And George Harrison
said, you know what?

00:11:45.866 --> 00:11:47.500 align:middle line:84%
It's not fun being
a Beatle anymore.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:48.750 align:middle line:90%
So they stopped playing live.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:52.080 align:middle line:84%
They put themselves in a
studio, and they experimented.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:55.860 align:middle line:84%
But that experiment,
going from "Sgt Pepper's,"

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:56.764 align:middle line:90%
changing everything.

00:11:56.764 --> 00:11:59.180 align:middle line:84%
People said, more and more,
what are you going to do next?

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:00.959 align:middle line:84%
And they sort of
burned themselves out.

00:12:00.959 --> 00:12:01.750 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They did.

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:04.000 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: Because they
pushed the envelope further

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.460 align:middle line:90%
than anyone else has.

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:08.132 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even today, no
one has pushed it further

00:12:08.132 --> 00:12:08.840 align:middle line:90%
than the Beatles.

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.710 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What year
did they split up?

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: Well,
actually, I guess it's pretty

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:13.820 align:middle line:90%
argumentative.

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:18.440 align:middle line:84%
But you would say 1970 would be
the year that everything ended.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:21.360 align:middle line:84%
But if you can look at
other clues, I mean,

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.100 align:middle line:84%
Ringo quit the
Beatles and came back.

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.010 align:middle line:84%
George quit the
Beatles and came back.

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:26.760 align:middle line:90%
John wanted to quit the Beatles.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.060 align:middle line:90%
Paul convinced him to stay.

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And then when Paul did
the album "McCartney,"

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.190 align:middle line:84%
he announces he
quit the Beatles.

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:35.260 align:middle line:90%
And that made John furious.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.070 align:middle line:90%
So here they were, holding on.

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
really blame Yoko Ono.

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:43.780 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think there would
have been a "White Album,"

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:46.670 align:middle line:84%
and I guarantee you there
wouldn't have been an "Abbey

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:49.210 align:middle line:84%
Road," if Yoko Ono
had not been there

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:51.150 align:middle line:90%
as a stabilizing force for John.

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And even though she came
in the studio, which

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:55.920 align:middle line:84%
violated an unwritten
agreement between the Beatles

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.017 align:middle line:90%
to bring their female wives--

00:12:58.017 --> 00:12:59.100 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And girlfriends.

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.100 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: --and
girlfriends into the studio,

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:03.010 align:middle line:84%
she still got the
work out of him.

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:06.760 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: This metamorphosis
that took them to their peak

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:10.320 align:middle line:84%
and then when it started
crumbling and falling apart,

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.490 align:middle line:84%
did they ever talk
about a reconciliation?

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:14.020 align:middle line:84%
Because it probably
would have been

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:16.590 align:middle line:84%
one of the biggest
concerts ever.

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:19.660 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: Well, if you
talk to certain people,

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:22.570 align:middle line:84%
they would say they became
friendly with each other.

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:24.650 align:middle line:84%
That when Eric Clapton
got married, and married

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:27.950 align:middle line:84%
Pattie Boyd, he had a
huge party at his house,

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:30.870 align:middle line:84%
and he reunited with the
other two members of Cream,

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:32.780 align:middle line:84%
and three of the
Beatles were there.

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:34.220 align:middle line:90%
And they played together.

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:37.100 align:middle line:84%
And of course that was
Paul, George, and Ringo.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:40.230 align:middle line:84%
John was supposed to be there,
but he didn't leave New York.

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:42.710 align:middle line:84%
So that would have
been a get together

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:45.000 align:middle line:84%
that would have been
incredible, that they were.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:51.940 align:middle line:84%
Also, that John and Paul
did a very crazy tape in LA

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:55.570 align:middle line:84%
with Stevie Winwood, Jesse
Ed Davis, and recorded it.

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:57.004 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't very good.

00:13:57.004 --> 00:13:59.170 align:middle line:84%
Matter of fact, I don't
even think Paul played bass.

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:00.820 align:middle line:90%
I think he played piano on it.

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:03.230 align:middle line:84%
But there were
attempts to record.

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And I remember someone
asked John Lennon,

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.034 align:middle line:84%
when are the Beatles
getting back together?

00:14:08.034 --> 00:14:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And John Lennon looked at
him and said, when are you

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.800 align:middle line:90%
going back to high school?

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And to him, he had
transcended it.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And he said in a number of
interviews, George, he said,

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:20.780 align:middle line:84%
he really disliked the
music that they wrote.

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:23.850 align:middle line:84%
Like "I Want to Hold Your
Hand," "She Loves You."

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:25.774 align:middle line:84%
That it was an
embarrassment to him.

00:14:25.774 --> 00:14:27.190 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But it
was a great tune.

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:28.606 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: It
was a great tune.

00:14:28.606 --> 00:14:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the thing
is, they needed each other.

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:33.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Paul had great
success as a solo artist.

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:35.280 align:middle line:90%
John had success.

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:36.770 align:middle line:84%
But if they were
together, I just

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:39.140 align:middle line:84%
imagine what the music
would have been like.

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:41.000 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Were they
jealous of each other?

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.310 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: I don't think
they were jealous of each other.

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:45.040 align:middle line:84%
I think that they had a
great respect for each other.

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:49.920 align:middle line:84%
When Paul wrote, "Hey Jude,"
there was a line about,

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.877 align:middle line:84%
"The movement you need
is on your shoulder."

00:14:51.877 --> 00:14:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I just
put that in there.

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And John said, it's the
best line of the song.

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:58.780 align:middle line:84%
So if Paul listened
that closely to a line

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:02.374 align:middle line:84%
he really didn't like, then he
had a great respect for John.

00:15:02.374 --> 00:15:04.540 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How shocked was
Paul when John got killed?

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:05.942 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Oh, devastated.

00:15:05.942 --> 00:15:07.150 align:middle line:90%
Devastated in the interviews.

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:08.381 align:middle line:90%
And so was George.

00:15:08.381 --> 00:15:10.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give you
another urban legend

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:11.088 align:middle line:90%
I haven't talked about.

00:15:11.088 --> 00:15:12.996 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember when
Live Aid was big?

00:15:12.996 --> 00:15:13.620 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:14.310 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: All right.

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And Dick Clark goes
on and said, do not

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:17.980 align:middle line:90%
miss the ending of this show.

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:19.330 align:middle line:90%
This is an important thing.

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:21.020 align:middle line:90%
This is history in the making.

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And then Paul McCartney comes
out, and he does, "Hey, Jude."

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.810 align:middle line:84%
The story was that he had
George Harrison and Ringo Starr

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:27.890 align:middle line:90%
backstage.

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:30.550 align:middle line:84%
All three of them were
going to come out and play

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:32.380 align:middle line:84%
at the end for the
first time since they

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:34.400 align:middle line:84%
did that rooftop
at "Abbey Road,"

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:38.160 align:middle line:84%
and that George was afraid
that he may be shot.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.222 align:middle line:84%
And that Ringo said, well,
my drumming's not up to par.

00:15:41.222 --> 00:15:43.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to play in
front of that large audience.

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:45.960 align:middle line:84%
So Paul angrily went
out and did it himself.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.135 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Did it by himself.

00:15:47.135 --> 00:15:48.500 align:middle line:90%
That would have been a classic.

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.515 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: It would've been
a classic ending, wouldn't it?

00:15:50.515 --> 00:15:51.139 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:15:51.139 --> 00:15:52.022 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:15:52.022 --> 00:15:53.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to get too
much into John Lennon's

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:55.520 align:middle line:90%
assassination.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:00.890 align:middle line:84%
But that was a story that
took the world by storm.

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:03.200 align:middle line:84%
I remember Howard
Cosell breaking it

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.650 align:middle line:84%
on ABC'S NFL Monday
Night Football.

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:08.170 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Right.

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:09.410 align:middle line:90%
Well, it affected me.

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:12.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was very little
when JFK was killed.

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:14.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it touched me,
but nothing touched me

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:15.860 align:middle line:90%
like the death of John Lennon.

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:17.040 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Were you in shock?

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.623 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: I was
terribly in shock.

00:16:18.623 --> 00:16:22.014 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the idea was that
he wasn't a politician.

00:16:22.014 --> 00:16:23.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he had some
political ambitions.

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure, you know,
"Give Peace a Chance."

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:29.140 align:middle line:84%
But here was a guy who had just
written an album about watching

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:32.350 align:middle line:84%
the wheels go by
with his little boy.

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:35.010 align:middle line:84%
And he wasn't the
radical John Lennon.

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:37.211 align:middle line:84%
And then, to find
out he was killed,

00:16:37.211 --> 00:16:39.210 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't listen to
Beatle music for two weeks.

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:39.835 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: By a lunatic.

00:16:39.835 --> 00:16:40.480 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: By a lunatic.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.890 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Who already had him
sign something before that,

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:43.260 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:44.051 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Yeah.

00:16:44.051 --> 00:16:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And he had him sign the
"Double Fantasy," album,

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.610 align:middle line:90%
and then shoots him.

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:50.105 align:middle line:90%
It's a terrible thing, you know?

00:16:50.105 --> 00:16:51.699 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things in conspiracy

00:16:51.699 --> 00:16:53.740 align:middle line:84%
we look with John Lennon,
because a lot of people

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:56.560 align:middle line:84%
think that Mark David
Chapman was a Manchurian

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.200 align:middle line:90%
candidate through the CIA.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And there's links that
you can put in there.

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.000 align:middle line:84%
But when Lennon came
to the United States

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.369 align:middle line:84%
in 1971, when he
got off the plane,

00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Abbie Hoffman met him,
which signaled to the Nixon

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.660 align:middle line:84%
government, here was a
guy who was a radical.

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.369 align:middle line:90%
But see, here's the thing.

00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:14.119 align:middle line:90%
Why was he so dangerous?

00:17:14.119 --> 00:17:19.589 align:middle line:84%
1972 was the very first
year that 18-year-olds

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:21.599 align:middle line:90%
could vote for president.

00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And who had a bigger
impact on teenagers

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:26.599 align:middle line:84%
than John Lennon
and the Beatles?

00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:26.819 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You got it.

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:27.318 align:middle line:90%
Well said.

00:17:27.318 --> 00:17:29.604 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: That's
why he was dangerous.

00:17:29.604 --> 00:17:32.020 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And Nixon should've
embraced him, but he didn't.

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:33.310 align:middle line:90%
His politics were way off.

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:35.269 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: He was
one of his enemies.

00:17:35.269 --> 00:17:36.060 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Politics.

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:37.204 align:middle line:90%
That's a good point.

00:17:37.204 --> 00:17:38.620 align:middle line:84%
I want to go through
some pictures

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:41.182 align:middle line:84%
and have you talk about the
group and some of the rumors

00:17:41.182 --> 00:17:42.640 align:middle line:84%
that are associated
with the group.

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:42.980 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Oh, great.

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:43.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.540 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But first
off, let's go to AC/DC.

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:47.580 align:middle line:84%
The name of the band,
they said, stands

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:50.390 align:middle line:84%
for the Antichrist
and Devil's Child.

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:52.760 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: Or-- yeah,
well, it could stand for After

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:54.370 align:middle line:90%
Christ, the Devil Comes.

00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:56.690 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Or Alternating
Currents and Direct Currents.

00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:57.481 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Yeah.

00:17:57.481 --> 00:17:58.910 align:middle line:90%
But that's what it stands for.

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:02.700 align:middle line:84%
Their sister, Malcolm
and Angus' sister,

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:05.210 align:middle line:84%
said, oh, look on this
vacuum cleaner, AC/DC.

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:06.751 align:middle line:84%
That'd be a good
name for a band.

00:18:06.751 --> 00:18:13.355 align:middle line:84%
So in the '80s, when Dan Rather
goes on "CBS News," and says,

00:18:13.355 --> 00:18:16.830 align:middle line:84%
there are satanic
messages on rock alums,

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:19.020 align:middle line:84%
and that their names--
and he listed all of that,

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:20.230 align:middle line:90%
it created hysteria.

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:21.380 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It sure did.

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:24.980 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: And I remember
a lot of ministries would have

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:27.209 align:middle line:84%
these tapes, listen, rock
and roll's for the devil,

00:18:27.209 --> 00:18:27.750 align:middle line:90%
and all that.

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And they always
claimed that AC/DC

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:34.357 align:middle line:84%
stood for After Christ, the
Devil Comes, or Antichrist,

00:18:34.357 --> 00:18:34.940 align:middle line:90%
Devil's Child.

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:35.740 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And that's a myth?

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:36.262 align:middle line:90%
Not real.

00:18:36.262 --> 00:18:37.220 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Not real.

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:38.053 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

00:18:38.053 --> 00:18:38.770 align:middle line:90%
Next one.

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:40.810 align:middle line:90%
Good old Ozzy Osbourne.

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:45.130 align:middle line:84%
That he once bit the head off
of a bat at a business meeting.

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:46.340 align:middle line:90%
Would he do that?

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:47.299 align:middle line:90%
Was he capable of that?

00:18:47.299 --> 00:18:49.131 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: Well,
actually, what Ozzy did,

00:18:49.131 --> 00:18:51.684 align:middle line:84%
he bit the head off-- I think
it was two doves at a business

00:18:51.684 --> 00:18:51.872 align:middle line:90%
meeting.

00:18:51.872 --> 00:18:52.250 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Ugh.

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:52.987 align:middle line:90%
He really did?

00:18:52.987 --> 00:18:54.070 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Yes, he did.

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:58.290 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: And the
label was just, oh my gosh,

00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:00.810 align:middle line:84%
get this mad man out of here,
so he didn't get the deal.

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:02.460 align:middle line:84%
And then, he was
performing one night,

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:04.400 align:middle line:84%
and someone threw
a bat on stage.

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:05.350 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: A dead bat?

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:07.560 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: Well, it
was actually not dead.

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.504 align:middle line:90%
But it was close to death.

00:19:09.504 --> 00:19:11.420 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So Ozzy thought
it was a rubber bat.

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:12.320 align:middle line:84%
He picks it up, puts
it in his mouth,

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:13.403 align:middle line:90%
and he bites the head off.

00:19:13.403 --> 00:19:14.257 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Aaah!

00:19:14.257 --> 00:19:16.840 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: But then he had
to take rabies shots after that.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:17.423 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Ugh.

00:19:17.423 --> 00:19:18.400 align:middle line:90%
I would guess.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.190 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: Guess that that
would not be what I would--

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:21.800 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I trust he
spit the thing out.

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.260 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: I hope he did
because that's not what I want

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:23.650 align:middle line:90%
for dinner.

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:24.230 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: No.

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:25.320 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.690 align:middle line:84%
Then there's our old buddy,
Blue Eyes, Frank Sinatra,

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:32.600 align:middle line:90%
that he had people put away.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.200 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: Well, I know he
had interesting friendships.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.640 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know of
anyone that he actually

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.530 align:middle line:90%
had taken out of the way.

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:42.360 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that'd
be a great study

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.970 align:middle line:84%
if you could do something with
Frank Sinatra and Kennedy.

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:49.670 align:middle line:84%
Because Kennedy avoided Sinatra
for his political career based

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:50.529 align:middle line:90%
on his father's--

00:19:50.529 --> 00:19:51.820 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: But they were close--

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:52.180 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: They were.

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:52.810 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: --in the beginning.

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:52.890 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: In the beginning.

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:54.930 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I remember
Frank saying,

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:58.560 align:middle line:90%
Jack's commercial high hopes.

00:19:58.560 --> 00:19:59.310 align:middle line:90%
You remember that?

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:00.280 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: I remember that.

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.738 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And then
all of a sudden,

00:20:01.738 --> 00:20:03.160 align:middle line:84%
there was a strained
relationship.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.050 align:middle line:84%
I think Frank was
very upset about it.

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:07.410 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: He was
extremely upset about it.

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:11.470 align:middle line:84%
So you know, I don't know of
anyone that Frank had killed.

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:15.330 align:middle line:84%
I know that he had certain
ties in certain organizations

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:17.730 align:middle line:84%
that people look back now,
and they say, well, maybe.

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:19.800 align:middle line:90%
But you know, we'll never know.

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:22.940 align:middle line:90%
So I would say that's a neutral.

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:24.970 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea of
anyone he did in.

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:26.580 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: The group, Kiss.

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.540 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Mm.

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:31.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, I want to congratulate
Kiss because they finally

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:34.270 align:middle line:84%
got in the Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame this year.

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And when Kiss came
out in their make up,

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:41.000 align:middle line:84%
as you can see in the
picture, what was strange

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.560 align:middle line:84%
is someone got the idea
that Kiss stood for Knights

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:48.740 align:middle line:84%
in Satan's Service, or
Kids in Satan's Service.

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:50.650 align:middle line:90%
Paul Stanley made a statement.

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:52.440 align:middle line:90%
He said, no, no, no.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:56.070 align:middle line:84%
Kiss does not stand for
Knights in Satan's Service.

00:20:56.070 --> 00:21:01.050 align:middle line:84%
It stands for Kids
in Sunday School.

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:03.410 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Led Zeppelin, folks.

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:04.910 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: Well,
of Led Zeppelin.

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:07.840 align:middle line:84%
You know how did a
group that basically

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.640 align:middle line:84%
was a group of unknowns--
Jimmy Page had-- I mean,

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:14.340 align:middle line:84%
no one in the United States
knew Jimmy Page's name

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:16.400 align:middle line:84%
unless you really followed
the session charts.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:16.720 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Nobody knew him.

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:16.890 align:middle line:90%
Nobody.

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:18.140 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Nobody knew him.

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:22.040 align:middle line:84%
But in 1968-69, when Zeppelin's
first album came out,

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:26.340 align:middle line:84%
they knocked the Beatles off
as number one on "Abbey Road."

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:27.220 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:27.910 align:middle line:90%
Unheard of.

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:29.060 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Unheard of.

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:32.520 align:middle line:84%
A group, like a
bunch of young kids.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And then the rumor spread around
that they had sold their souls

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:38.440 align:middle line:84%
to the devil, and there
was a blood contract,

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:41.700 align:middle line:84%
and that the members of Zeppelin
had signed except for one.

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And as they signed
this, even the people

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:46.590 align:middle line:84%
who worked within the
band had heard the legend,

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:47.910 align:middle line:90%
like Richard Cole.

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:49.070 align:middle line:90%
And he had heard it.

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:50.920 align:middle line:84%
But then again, it
might be a great way

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.500 align:middle line:84%
to have people come
out and see you.

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:53.840 align:middle line:90%
And they loved Robert Johnson.

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:54.340 align:middle line:90%
So, why not?

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:56.673 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Why don't people
ever say they sold their soul

00:21:56.673 --> 00:21:57.334 align:middle line:90%
to God?

00:21:57.334 --> 00:21:59.500 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: Well, I guess
that's what you normally

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.645 align:middle line:90%
expect.

00:22:00.645 --> 00:22:01.270 align:middle line:90%
I don't think--

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:02.290 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's already his.

00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:03.623 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Yeah, that's true.

00:22:03.623 --> 00:22:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think God actually--
he gives you many blessings.

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:09.400 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to get things
that you're not qualified for.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.720 align:middle line:84%
You work your way up the
ladder, don't you, George?

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.130 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's a different way.

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:12.820 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:14.420 align:middle line:90%
Elvis Presley.

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:15.532 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about him.

00:22:15.532 --> 00:22:17.990 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: Well, you know,
there's a lot of people right

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:21.880 align:middle line:84%
after his death who claimed
that he was still alive.

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
watching Bill Bixby do

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:27.710 align:middle line:84%
two specials on television,
where he was bringing

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:30.740 align:middle line:84%
in experts claiming
that Elvis was alive.

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:31.700 align:middle line:90%
They had photographs.

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:32.940 align:middle line:90%
They had evidence.

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And it created a fire
storm for a while.

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:36.470 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Was he
a devil worshiper?

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:37.580 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Oh.

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:40.040 align:middle line:84%
I think that-- let's
take a look at that.

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:43.320 align:middle line:84%
Any time you would read a book
on metaphysics-- and Elvis

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:46.030 align:middle line:84%
was interested in religion,
but he studied other religions

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:49.990 align:middle line:84%
too-- that people would
think, oh, he's off the Bible,

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:52.480 align:middle line:84%
so therefore, there's got to
be something evil about it.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.660 align:middle line:84%
But Elvis was never
a devil worshipper.

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:57.842 align:middle line:84%
He used to wear a Star of David
and a cross around his neck.

00:22:57.842 --> 00:22:59.550 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: That's kind
of religious to me.

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:00.090 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Very religious.

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And they asked him
why, and he said,

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:04.610 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to miss out
on heaven by technicality.

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:05.810 align:middle line:90%
So he wore both.

00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:07.060 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: How about Metallica?

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:07.580 align:middle line:90%
That group?

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:09.480 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: Well,
Metallica, was probably,

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:12.990 align:middle line:84%
when they came out, one of the
greatest speed metal bands.

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:15.132 align:middle line:84%
There's a number
of songs they had.

00:23:15.132 --> 00:23:16.840 align:middle line:84%
They sort of embraced
the counterculture.

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:17.380 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: "Am I Evil?"

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:19.240 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: "Am I Evil"
is one of the big ones.

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think that when they
came out, a lot of people

00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:24.660 align:middle line:84%
thought that if there was a
band that would ally themselves

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:27.710 align:middle line:84%
with Satan, it could be
Metallica because of the songs

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:29.040 align:middle line:90%
and because of the cover.

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:31.570 align:middle line:84%
But I think they had
a lot of fun with it.

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:34.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these guys
are family guys.

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:36.130 align:middle line:90%
You don't see blood sacrifices.

00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:38.480 align:middle line:84%
So I'll let Metallica
off the hook, too.

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:41.010 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Gary, music takes
an evolutionary change.

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:41.760 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Yes.

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.640 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I've listened
to music-- intentionally,

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:49.750 align:middle line:84%
I go back and listen to music
of the '40s, the '50s, the '60s.

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:54.880 align:middle line:84%
In every decade, there's a
marked difference in the music.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:58.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you were to listen to
the Fred Astaire music of then,

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:00.600 align:middle line:90%
you'd go, whoa, what is that?

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:01.660 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Yeah.

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:05.160 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How does music make
this evolutionary progression,

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:09.230 align:middle line:84%
to where it seems to
be acceptable today,

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:12.420 align:middle line:84%
and the old stuff
seems like it's passe.

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:14.440 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: I think it
has to do with change,

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:18.620 align:middle line:84%
and it has to be with a catalyst
of one musician who changes it.

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:21.740 align:middle line:84%
Whose style is so
unique and so freshing

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:23.810 align:middle line:90%
that everything is new.

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:27.085 align:middle line:84%
And then, everything that we
used to think was really hip,

00:24:27.085 --> 00:24:28.800 align:middle line:90%
we say, oh, that sounds dated.

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:29.700 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Hip.

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:30.500 align:middle line:90%
Or cool?

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:31.015 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Or cool.

00:24:31.015 --> 00:24:32.050 align:middle line:84%
Those are two
words that we know.

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:34.690 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Those are words
that we use, but they're gone.

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:35.002 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: We
use all the time.

00:24:35.002 --> 00:24:35.230 align:middle line:90%
They're hip.

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:35.800 align:middle line:90%
They're cool.

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:39.150 align:middle line:84%
But the whole thing is that,
a lot of the older stuff,

00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:40.730 align:middle line:90%
it sounds dated.

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:42.592 align:middle line:84%
When you listen to a
group like the Beatles,

00:24:42.592 --> 00:24:43.550 align:middle line:90%
they never sound dated.

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:44.564 align:middle line:90%
They still sound fresh.

00:24:44.564 --> 00:24:45.980 align:middle line:84%
So what you've got
to do is you've

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:48.400 align:middle line:84%
got to find that artist who
will come along and push

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.070 align:middle line:90%
the envelope.

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:52.070 align:middle line:84%
Who will come out with
new music, new songs,

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:57.460 align:middle line:84%
new direction, new production,
that puts everything passe.

00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:02.952 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is there anybody
today that can do that?

00:25:02.952 --> 00:25:04.160 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Great question.

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.320 align:middle line:90%
I like a lot of new bands.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:10.940 align:middle line:84%
But I've never seen anyone who
had the impact of the Beatles.

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:12.360 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, it
was a Renaissance.

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:13.690 align:middle line:90%
A Renaissance of change.

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:16.620 align:middle line:84%
Music, directions,
social comfort,

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:19.330 align:middle line:90%
social change within a society.

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And no one's ever
pushed it there.

00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:23.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have
groups that'll be

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:25.640 align:middle line:84%
great for an album
or two albums.

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.097 align:middle line:84%
I remember that when
Bon Jovi first came out,

00:25:28.097 --> 00:25:29.680 align:middle line:84%
all the girls would
say, oh, Bon Jovi,

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.110 align:middle line:90%
they're better than the Beatles.

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:32.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, they did a
number of tours,

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:34.220 align:middle line:90%
but the albums didn't stack up.

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:36.042 align:middle line:84%
You didn't have
the great albums.

00:25:36.042 --> 00:25:37.500 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You had
a few good songs.

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:38.791 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Some great songs.

00:25:38.791 --> 00:25:41.840 align:middle line:84%
But still, they didn't
continue to push album,

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.380 align:middle line:90%
after album, after album.

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:45.900 align:middle line:84%
So I haven't seen anyone
yet, but I'm waiting.

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:48.410 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Isn't it amazing that
the Rolling Stones continue

00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:49.460 align:middle line:90%
to roll on?

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:51.110 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: [LAUGHS] It is.

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And especially at $500,
$600 a ticket, I guess.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.742 align:middle line:90%
And they're playing out arenas.

00:25:55.742 --> 00:25:57.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they always thought
that Keith Richards would

00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:01.700 align:middle line:84%
be the poster child for drug
abuse, but he's still alive.

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:03.700 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: He fell out of
a tree once, didn't he?

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:03.760 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Yeah.

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:04.350 align:middle line:90%
Hit his head.

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:04.890 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And Johnny Depp
modeled his character

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:11.420 align:middle line:84%
in "Pirates of the Caribbean"
after Keith Richards.

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:14.300 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is, they're
still writing music.

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:17.400 align:middle line:84%
But then, a lot of people like
the stuff they did earlier.

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how many
years has it been?

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:22.010 align:middle line:84%
50 years that you're
playing "Satisfaction."

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:22.620 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:24.290 align:middle line:84%
But they give it
to the audience.

00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:26.040 align:middle line:84%
They're still putting
out new albums.

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And there's so much
interest in seeing them.

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:30.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, younger generations,
they stand in line

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:32.020 align:middle line:90%
to buy a ticket to the Stones.

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:34.570 align:middle line:84%
And let me tell you,
the very first concert I

00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:37.530 align:middle line:84%
ever saw my life, when
I was 13 years old,

00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:39.590 align:middle line:90%
was The Rolling Stones.

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:44.290 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I saw them play
at Busch Stadium in St.

00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:46.920 align:middle line:90%
Louis a long time ago.

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:49.310 align:middle line:90%
And the Beatles played there.

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:52.094 align:middle line:84%
I saw Sinatra play at the
Fox Theater in St. Louis.

00:26:52.094 --> 00:26:53.010 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Oh Yeah.

00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And all
of them, I think,

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:58.742 align:middle line:84%
bring some incredible
tools to people.

00:26:58.742 --> 00:27:00.450 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: That's
why they're legends.

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the new artists
want to be just like that.

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:05.710 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Why do
people like music?

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:08.750 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: I think it gets
their minds off their problems.

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:09.830 align:middle line:90%
They listen to it.

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:10.780 align:middle line:90%
They tap their foot.

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:12.460 align:middle line:90%
They sing the lyrics.

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:17.670 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, lyrics are
answers to your problem.

00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And you can do the lyric,
and you can sing that lyric,

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.180 align:middle line:84%
and say, you know, I know
exactly how that guy feels

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:24.130 align:middle line:90%
because that's going on my life.

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think we
reach out for that.

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:28.660 align:middle line:84%
That's why I guess sad
songs sell better, you know?

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:33.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think that music
gives us the transference

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:35.980 align:middle line:84%
to change our lives,
to give us hope.

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:39.480 align:middle line:84%
At least to listen with
headphones, and have the day

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:40.540 align:middle line:90%
pass faster.

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:42.780 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is there one
artist today, Gary,

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:46.630 align:middle line:84%
that will take us to the next
evolution of music that's out

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:47.130 align:middle line:90%
there?

00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:49.180 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: Oh, I hate
to anoint anybody today.

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:51.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I need to see more proof
of what's going to be there.

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:53.360 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You're not
prepared to anoint?

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: No,
I'm not prepared.

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:55.350 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You're not there yet.

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:57.220 align:middle line:84%
Miley Cyrus isn't
going to do it.

00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:57.350 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: No.

00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.990 align:middle line:90%
It's not Miley.

00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:58.840 align:middle line:90%
I'll say that.

00:27:58.840 --> 00:27:59.570 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:00.977 align:middle line:90%
Lady Gaga?

00:28:00.977 --> 00:28:02.560 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: I think
she's very good,

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:05.271 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know how hot she's
going to be in three years from

00:28:05.271 --> 00:28:05.770 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:08.010 align:middle line:90%
How her music's going to change.

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:09.404 align:middle line:84%
But that's not
putting them down.

00:28:09.404 --> 00:28:10.820 align:middle line:84%
It's saying they're
great artists,

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:13.345 align:middle line:84%
but you're talking about
changing the world.

00:28:13.345 --> 00:28:13.970 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:14.940 align:middle line:90%
And I don't see that.

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:16.779 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Chuck Berry
changed the world.

00:28:16.779 --> 00:28:17.570 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Sure.

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:19.250 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Elvis Presley
changed the world.

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:19.450 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Exactly.

00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:22.570 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: The Beatles and the
Beach Boys changed the world.

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:26.310 align:middle line:84%
My dear friend Russ Regan, who
worked with Elton John and Neil

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:28.419 align:middle line:84%
Diamond, gave the
Beach Boys their name.

00:28:28.419 --> 00:28:29.460 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Oh, really?

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:30.540 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And it's
an incredible story.

You've got to meet him one day.

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:32.500 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I need to.

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.160 align:middle line:84%
I know they call
themselves the Pendletones.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:34.940 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:36.290 align:middle line:90%
He heard that and said, nope.

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:36.820 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: No way.

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:37.986 align:middle line:90%

00:28:37.986 --> 00:28:40.320 align:middle line:90%
Gary, music has been your life.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:44.354 align:middle line:84%
But you've also been an
instrumental part of our life.

00:28:44.354 --> 00:28:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank you
for everything you do.

00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:48.780 align:middle line:84%
If people want to just track
you and see what you do,

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:49.780 align:middle line:90%
where do they go?

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:52.520 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: Well, you can
find me at rgarypatterson.com,

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:53.970 align:middle line:90%
or go to popodysseyradio.com.

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:56.214 align:middle line:90%


00:28:56.214 --> 00:28:56.880 align:middle line:90%
And you find me.

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:59.710 align:middle line:84%
Write me, and I'll
always write you back.

00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:03.210 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: He is rock and
roll's best historian.

00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:05.010 align:middle line:84%
I tap into him on
"Coast to Coast"

00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:08.690 align:middle line:84%
all the time when there's
a breaking musical story.

00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:09.880 align:middle line:90%
