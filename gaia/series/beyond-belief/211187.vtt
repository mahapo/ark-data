>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.710 align:middle line:10%
George Noory with you and we've
got a great guest for you.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.240 align:middle line:10%
Erika Gabriel is a professional
spiritual medium, a teacher.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.390 align:middle line:10%
She has more than 15 years
of experience helping others

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.210 align:middle line:10%
find purpose, direction,
and the strength

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.950 align:middle line:10%
to overcome life's challenges
by connecting to the other side.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.488 align:middle line:84%
Erika, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:39.488 --> 00:00:41.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ERIKA GABRIEL: Thank
you so much for having me.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:42.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm so happy to
be with you today.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
you become a medium?

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.890 align:middle line:10%
>>GABRIEL: Well,
I started actually

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.290 align:middle line:10%
when I was really
young, noticing

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.620 align:middle line:10%
all the kind of vibrations
that we couldn't see.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.560 align:middle line:84%
So it was almost like, if
you close your eyes right now

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.280 align:middle line:84%
and someone walked
into the room,

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.700 align:middle line:84%
you would feel them even
though you weren't seeing them.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And as a child, I kind of
felt that all the time,

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.840 align:middle line:84%
that there was so much
happening that we couldn't see.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.020 align:middle line:84%
So I moved into a new
house with my family

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.240 align:middle line:84%
when was, I think
seven or eight,

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.390 align:middle line:84%
and I started to feel the energy
and essence of a little boy

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.650 align:middle line:84%
around this new
house and was afraid,

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.080 align:middle line:84%
terrified, told my
parents, and they later

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.750 align:middle line:84%
found out that a little boy
had died on that property.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.990 align:middle line:84%
So that was kind
of my introduction

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.430 align:middle line:84%
to the spiritual world to
being a medium towards--

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.760 align:middle line:84%
to feeling other energy
and really feeling things

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.580 align:middle line:84%
that weren't there, or
weren't visible to the eye.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.361 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you see dead people?

00:01:40.361 --> 00:01:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: In general,
I feel dead people.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.280 align:middle line:84%
"Dead" I say, and I feel
and I sense people almost

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.710 align:middle line:84%
like I'm watching a
movie behind the person

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.730 align:middle line:90%
that I'm reading for.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like someone
walks into the room

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.540 align:middle line:90%
and they're sitting next to us.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.550 align:middle line:84%
It's more like I
can see a projection

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.460 align:middle line:84%
of a movie behind the
person that I'm reading for,

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.160 align:middle line:84%
and that's how I see their
loved ones in spirit.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When did you decide
to do this as a career?

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Well, feeling this
incredible energy around me

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.449 align:middle line:90%
all the time was really scary.

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:14.280 align:middle line:84%
So I knew I had to figure
out how to make it not scary

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.450 align:middle line:84%
and find out what was
actually happening.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.520 align:middle line:84%
So I was kind of on a wild
goose chase for a long time,

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.700 align:middle line:84%
deeply, deeply interested
in spirituality,

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.400 align:middle line:84%
and learning about
God and about spirit.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, when I
was kind of in my late 20s,

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.218 align:middle line:84%
I went to a medium
and she said, oh, you

00:02:34.218 --> 00:02:35.760 align:middle line:84%
know you're a medium
right and you're

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.718 align:middle line:84%
going to help thousands
and thousands of people

00:02:37.718 --> 00:02:38.790 align:middle line:90%
from all over the world?

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And I went, oh, no
but yes but thanks.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.840 align:middle line:90%
It kind of pulled it together.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.750 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:47.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bingo.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.350 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Bingo.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.520 align:middle line:84%
It was like a bow
that was tightening

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.910 align:middle line:84%
on a already existing
kind of present, right?

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.410 align:middle line:84%
It was like, it
was already there

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.270 align:middle line:84%
but she really
tightened that bow.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And then within two weeks, I
had people knocking on my door.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.015 align:middle line:84%
I lived in a bungalow off
Melrose in Los Angeles.

00:03:04.015 --> 00:03:04.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, did you?

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: I did, and people
were just like knocking.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.620 align:middle line:84%
And I was reading for
people within two weeks.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you love it.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.240 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: I love it.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.790 align:middle line:84%
I love being able to bring
other ideas to people

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.660 align:middle line:84%
to help them and serve them
and help them in their life.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do the spirits come
to you or do you go to them?

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.840 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: So that is
such an awesome question.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.050 align:middle line:84%
So before I really understood
what mediumship was,

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.370 align:middle line:90%
they were coming to me.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.340 align:middle line:84%
And it was an extremely
uncomfortable experience.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.730 align:middle line:84%
But now, it's not
that I come to them,

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.210 align:middle line:84%
but I open the door
to them in a sense.

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.290 align:middle line:84%
I allow them to come through
after I have permission

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.000 align:middle line:84%
from the person that
I'm reading for.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.730 align:middle line:84%
So I use visualizations
when I read.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.540 align:middle line:84%
I have an on switch, an
off switch, an open door,

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.740 align:middle line:90%
a closed door.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.520 align:middle line:84%
So I really have focused
specific boundaries

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.840 align:middle line:84%
so that I feel comfortable
and also the people

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.840 align:middle line:84%
that I'm reading for feel
comfortable, that they

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.370 align:middle line:90%
know they're safe with me.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.462 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they walk
into you, these spirits?

00:04:07.462 --> 00:04:09.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Into-- like
bump into me physically?

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.795 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah,
like, you remember

00:04:10.795 --> 00:04:12.010 align:middle line:90%
Whoopi Goldberg in "Ghost?"

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.810 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Totally.

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.079 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They would
literally step into her body.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:16.890 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Yes.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.807 align:middle line:84%
Well, that was like
possession kind of, right?

00:04:18.807 --> 00:04:19.607 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:04:19.607 --> 00:04:21.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: So no, I
don't get possessed.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.790 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:22.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
called walk-ins.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, no.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.540 align:middle line:90%
Thank goodness.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.190 align:middle line:84%
No, I don't have
walk-ins, but I do

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.340 align:middle line:84%
have walk bys where I'm
kind of like in a room

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.320 align:middle line:90%
and I'm sensing a lot of energy.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.960 align:middle line:84%
And I always say, guys,
I'm off right now.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.340 align:middle line:90%
Meet me in my office.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.690 align:middle line:90%
Schedule an appointment.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:37.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm off.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:38.160 align:middle line:90%
I have--

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they listen to you?

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.073 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Oh, yeah.

00:04:40.073 --> 00:04:42.070 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I'm pretty strong
when I want to be.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.690 align:middle line:84%
So I really work with
controlling boundaries.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.700 align:middle line:84%
But I have kids and
I have a husband

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.800 align:middle line:84%
and I want to be
able to focus on them

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.700 align:middle line:90%
when it's time to focus on them.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm doing readings
or working with spirit,

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.220 align:middle line:84%
I really like to do
that in my office

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.230 align:middle line:84%
and it's scheduled
in my calendar.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.330 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's
an amazing power

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.080 align:middle line:84%
in being able to work with
spirit when and how you choose.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Give me an example
of how you would work.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.800 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: So how I work.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.470 align:middle line:90%
So now, I work a lot on Zoom.

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.510 align:middle line:84%
But the way that
I would work say,

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.270 align:middle line:84%
if I were doing a reading
for you is number one,

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.770 align:middle line:84%
I'd want to make
sure you were here.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.780 align:middle line:84%
No one forced you to
get a reading, right?

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:19.980 align:middle line:90%
You really wanted a reading.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.510 align:middle line:90%
You wanted to connect.

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And I would kind of seal us
and surround us in a bubble.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.200 align:middle line:84%
I like to think of a big
beautiful bubble wand

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.610 align:middle line:90%
coming around us.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.970 align:middle line:84%
Sealing us in a protected space,
and also sealing our intention.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.085 align:middle line:84%
Our intention is
to work with high,

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:38.610 align:middle line:84%
high vibration, spirit guides,
loved ones who've crossed over,

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:39.420 align:middle line:90%
angels, right?

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.720 align:middle line:84%
So I seal us in that
intention, and then go in

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.310 align:middle line:90%
and we kind of do a meditation.

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And in my mind, I'm
opening the door

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.430 align:middle line:84%
and I'm turning on the light and
I'm tuning in to your station.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.260 align:middle line:84%
So the idea when
I do readings is,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm not creating anything
or yanking anything

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.820 align:middle line:90%
or doing anything at you.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.690 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, I'm just tuning in
to almost like a radio station

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.170 align:middle line:90%
that's already with you.

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.500 align:middle line:84%
So I think of the radio as
something that's always on.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.220 align:middle line:84%
You just tune into it or tune
out of it, turn out of it.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.823 align:middle line:90%
So when I work with spirits--

00:06:09.823 --> 00:06:12.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Unless it's my show,
which you never tune out of,

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.690 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:13.590 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Ever.

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.630 align:middle line:84%
I have a special
TV that's always

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.070 align:middle line:90%
playing with your show on it.

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.793 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: But yeah, it's a
tune in and it's a tune out.

00:06:19.793 --> 00:06:22.470 align:middle line:84%
But everyone is already
connected to spirit

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.540 align:middle line:84%
before they come to
me for a reading.

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:28.050 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not carrying
everyone's loved ones with me.

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:29.140 align:middle line:90%
They are.

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.940 align:middle line:90%
And so when I--

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you particularly
religious, Erika?

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.150 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: So I'm not
religious, but I'm very

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:37.410 align:middle line:90%
drawn towards religions.

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:38.940 align:middle line:90%
I love all religions.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.120 align:middle line:84%
I think they're beautiful
in so many different ways.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.245 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you spiritual?

00:06:42.245 --> 00:06:43.740 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Deeply spiritual.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.280 align:middle line:90%
Deeply, deeply spiritual.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do these
spirits want with you?

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.010 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Nothing.

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:50.850 align:middle line:90%
They really don't.

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:52.620 align:middle line:84%
They don't want
anything with me.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.270 align:middle line:90%
They are giving me an oppor--

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:59.140 align:middle line:84%
I have an opportunity to work
with them should I so choose.

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.760 align:middle line:84%
But I don't have anyone that's
banging on my door like go

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.650 align:middle line:90%
and tell this person that--

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:07.350 align:middle line:84%
it is a conscious opening
and closing for me

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:08.460 align:middle line:90%
to work with spirit.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they give you
information about things,

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:13.530 align:middle line:90%
events, the future?

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:16.620 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, so in terms
of events and the future,

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:20.550 align:middle line:84%
that is if I'm reading for
someone in a future event,

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:23.280 align:middle line:84%
they must know that
would help them so much

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.250 align:middle line:84%
and would help them in their
life that will come through.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.860 align:middle line:84%
But that's why I don't call
myself a psychic medium.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.070 align:middle line:84%
I call myself a spiritual medium
because the psychic component

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:34.170 align:middle line:90%
is something I cannot guarantee.

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:36.820 align:middle line:84%
I only can take what
spirit gives me,

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.990 align:middle line:84%
and then I deliver that in
the best way I possibly can.

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:42.600 align:middle line:84%
So I don't always know if a
psychic prediction is going

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.860 align:middle line:90%
to come through in a reading.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.902 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you know
you're not being tricked

00:07:45.902 --> 00:07:47.842 align:middle line:90%
by one of these spirits?

00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:50.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Oh, yeah, I
understand what you're saying.

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:52.838 align:middle line:84%
So after working with
spirit and reading

00:07:52.838 --> 00:07:53.880 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of people--

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.005 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something devious.

00:07:55.005 --> 00:07:56.760 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, I have so--

00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:01.050 align:middle line:84%
my beautiful gift is this
incredible gift of sensitivity,

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:03.270 align:middle line:84%
and I know when
something doesn't

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:06.240 align:middle line:90%
feel right very quickly.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And that happened
earlier on as a medium,

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.152 align:middle line:84%
but it does not
happen to me now.

00:08:10.152 --> 00:08:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And earlier on, that
did happen actually.

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:13.527 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I bet you're
intuitive that way

00:08:13.527 --> 00:08:14.670 align:middle line:90%
with people in real life.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:15.990 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Absolutely.

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:20.160 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I'm very oversensitive,
which is a plus and a minus.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:25.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Since you've
been doing this 15 years,

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:27.880 align:middle line:90%
what's next for you?

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:31.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, so as I'm
moving forward in mediumship,

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.370 align:middle line:84%
which I love to do and
love helping people,

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:37.390 align:middle line:84%
my guides have told me, as I've
spent all these years focusing

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:40.570 align:middle line:84%
on spirit and the dead
as we said earlier,

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:44.740 align:middle line:84%
now, it's really, really time to
work with spirit and my guides

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:49.090 align:middle line:84%
to focus on the living and
to help people that are here

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:50.960 align:middle line:90%
in the earth element right now.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Somebody
will come to you,

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.170 align:middle line:90%
a human, what do they want?

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:57.550 align:middle line:90%
What do they ask you for?

00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:59.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah,
so if they're not

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:03.388 align:middle line:84%
looking to connect with a loved
one, which is a lot of time,

00:09:03.388 --> 00:09:05.680 align:middle line:84%
but if they're not looking
to connect with a loved one,

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.530 align:middle line:84%
they are looking to find
direction, and purpose,

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:11.330 align:middle line:84%
and meaning in their life
here on Earth and this planet.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:12.790 align:middle line:90%
So much is happening.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:13.960 align:middle line:90%
We're so polarized.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.630 align:middle line:84%
People are feeling worse
than ever in many ways.

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:18.370 align:middle line:84%
Not in all ways,
but in many ways.

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And people are going,
this can't be it.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.590 align:middle line:90%
What am I here for?

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:22.970 align:middle line:90%
What is my purpose?

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And so they're hoping that
spirit can guide them and show

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.960 align:middle line:84%
them how to find that purpose
and shine it out in their life.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had a psychic
medium on my radio show

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:32.140 align:middle line:90%
several weeks ago.

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:33.410 align:middle line:90%
His name was John Russell.

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:34.660 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if you know John.

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:35.618 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: No, I don't.

00:09:35.618 --> 00:09:38.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he's in the
middle of the interview, which

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:42.570 align:middle line:84%
was a two-hour
interview, he stopped me.

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:46.640 align:middle line:84%
He stopped me and said,
there's somebody here

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.730 align:middle line:84%
and they just want you
to know they're OK.

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:52.680 align:middle line:90%
And I said, who is this?

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:53.810 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I don't know.

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:56.990 align:middle line:84%
He's not telling me his
name, but all I can see

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:59.990 align:middle line:90%
is roses all around him.

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:02.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, I had a friend
who died a year ago.

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And he went by the
name of Johnny Rose.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying to myself,
it's got to be him.

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:08.870 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Totally.

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:10.037 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's got to be him.

00:10:10.037 --> 00:10:15.140 align:middle line:84%
It was about a year anniversary,
and flowers all around them,

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:16.280 align:middle line:90%
roses.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.130 align:middle line:90%
And his name was Johnny Rose.

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:21.960 align:middle line:84%
So I said this to
the guy, I said,

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.660 align:middle line:90%
I think his name is Johnny Rose.

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And he said, it might be but
he wants you to know he's fine.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:29.540 align:middle line:90%
Something happened.

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:31.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, absolutely.

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:32.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was strange.

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:34.542 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Well, it's
so cool because what

00:10:34.542 --> 00:10:36.500 align:middle line:84%
happened with your friend,
what it sounds like,

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.875 align:middle line:84%
and I can't speak to that
reading because I wasn't there,

00:10:38.875 --> 00:10:42.740 align:middle line:84%
but what it sounds like is
your friend went, oh, awesome.

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:44.867 align:middle line:84%
George has a medium
and a psychic on.

00:10:44.867 --> 00:10:45.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Here's my chance.

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:47.033 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Here's my shot.

00:10:47.033 --> 00:10:48.147 align:middle line:90%
Let's get in there.

00:10:48.147 --> 00:10:49.730 align:middle line:84%
So that's a beauty--
that's beautiful.

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's so
amazing about readings,

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:54.650 align:middle line:84%
they can bring so much
healing and so much peace.

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:56.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can't
spirits get to you

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:57.740 align:middle line:90%
without a medium in between?

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:01.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Absolutely 100%,
because they're already

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:02.990 align:middle line:90%
with you.

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:05.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So why
did he not do that?

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.470 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Your friend Johnny?

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:07.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:08.340 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: I don't know.

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:09.770 align:middle line:90%
I don't know, and maybe he is--

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:10.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe he
figured it was easier?

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.403 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, or
maybe he is trying

00:11:12.403 --> 00:11:14.930 align:middle line:84%
to get-- not everyone
is constantly

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:17.240 align:middle line:84%
being receptive to medium,
mystic information, right?

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.610 align:middle line:84%
So maybe he has tried
to come through to you.

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:21.470 align:middle line:84%
Maybe he's tried
to send you signs,

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:24.020 align:middle line:84%
or maybe tried to come
through in a dream,

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.280 align:middle line:84%
and maybe you haven't quite
picked up on those signs.

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.252 align:middle line:84%
So he kind of used
his shot to hang

00:11:28.252 --> 00:11:30.710 align:middle line:84%
with you for a little bit when
you were seeing that medium.

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:32.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was a strange time.

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:34.370 align:middle line:84%
I was with him the
night before he died,

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:36.180 align:middle line:90%
and he just wasn't acting right.

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:36.980 align:middle line:90%
He was strange.

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And he owned his
own limo company.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And his driving was so
erratic, I sent him home.

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:46.280 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'm going to
take an Uber home.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.970 align:middle line:90%
And he said, no, I'll take you.

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:48.770 align:middle line:90%
I'll take you.

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:49.700 align:middle line:90%
I says, no, John.

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:50.990 align:middle line:90%
There's something wrong.

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:52.070 align:middle line:90%
Go home.

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:55.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, he did go home, and
then he died the next day.

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:59.210 align:middle line:84%
I kept also telling him
to go to the hospital,

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:01.430 align:middle line:90%
and he refused to do that.

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Wow, it's
like in those moments,

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.020 align:middle line:84%
you're wondering like, I wish
he had gone to the hospital.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And then you think,
but was that his time

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:10.270 align:middle line:90%
and was that the right thing?

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:11.070 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to know.

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:12.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is your time?

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.172 align:middle line:90%
What is the time?

00:12:13.172 --> 00:12:15.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: No one's getting
out of here alive, right?

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:16.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.430 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah.

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:20.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mediumship, how
does that make you feel,

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:21.330 align:middle line:90%
do what you do?

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:23.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Oh, yeah,
it makes me feel great.

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:27.120 align:middle line:84%
It makes me feel so happy
that I know why I'm here.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.580 align:middle line:84%
It makes me feel
excited to expand what

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:31.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing to help more people.

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:34.710 align:middle line:84%
I feel excited to show
other people how much they

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:37.590 align:middle line:84%
can connect with spirit on
their own without a medium,

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.210 align:middle line:90%
just like the question you had.

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:42.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm excited to use some
of the amazing things I've

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:44.850 align:middle line:84%
learned from all
of these readings

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:48.100 align:middle line:84%
to help as many
people as possible.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does mediumship give
you a different perspective

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:52.560 align:middle line:90%
on life on planet Earth?

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.760 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Yes, absolutely.

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:55.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How so?

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:59.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: I feel like
through being a medium,

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:03.480 align:middle line:84%
I have been able to connect
with some universal truths that

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:04.620 align:middle line:90%
are so powerful.

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:07.470 align:middle line:84%
Like, we are all one,
we are all connected,

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:10.350 align:middle line:84%
and that a piece of that
whole of that divine

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:12.540 align:middle line:90%
is in every single one of us.

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And that we're also
supposed to be here

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.930 align:middle line:90%
and we chose to come here.

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:19.470 align:middle line:84%
And when we know that
and we know those truths,

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:22.530 align:middle line:84%
we begin to understand that
our soul is here for a reason.

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And finding that reason,
and walking that path,

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:28.140 align:middle line:84%
and then shining it is
part of the adventure

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:29.820 align:middle line:84%
and the whole point
of why we're here.

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:32.500 align:middle line:84%
That we're not a mistake,
we're not an accident.

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:34.230 align:middle line:84%
We are supposed to
be here right now.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's an amazing
opportunity for our soul.

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:39.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's not a
terrible cross to bear.

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:42.030 align:middle line:84%
It's a beautiful thing
to come here and find

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:43.920 align:middle line:90%
our adventure and our purpose.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fascinating.

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:47.460 align:middle line:84%
Do they talk to you
about Heaven and Hell?

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:48.510 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Yes.

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:48.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:49.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's the difference?

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:51.212 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: It's so
interesting you're

00:13:51.212 --> 00:13:53.520 align:middle line:84%
asking that too
because when I first

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.980 align:middle line:84%
started to become a medium,
I asked all these questions.

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:56.430 align:middle line:90%
Like, wow.

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:57.720 align:middle line:90%
So what about Heaven and Hell?

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're like a kid
in the candy store, right?

00:13:59.130 --> 00:13:59.940 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Totally.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:01.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, oh, my gosh.

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:02.020 align:middle line:90%
Tell me everything.

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And so with Heaven and
Hell, I really went in

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.950 align:middle line:84%
and asked my guides, tell
me about Heaven and Hell,

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:09.240 align:middle line:90%
and just tell me the truth.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:12.240 align:middle line:84%
If there's some mean person
poking us with hot sticks

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.620 align:middle line:90%
below, give it to me straight.

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:17.470 align:middle line:84%
And the amazing thing is,
there is no Heaven and Hell.

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:18.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What?

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:19.895 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: So that
made me feel better,

00:14:19.895 --> 00:14:22.030 align:middle line:84%
and it made me feel a lot
worse at the same time.

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:23.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
we-- what is it?

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:24.508 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, right.

00:14:24.508 --> 00:14:25.990 align:middle line:90%
So we all go to the same place.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And when we get there, we review
our path, we review our life,

00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:32.140 align:middle line:90%
and we review our choices.

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:33.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, but
they're not going

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.910 align:middle line:84%
to put someone like you
who is good and righteous

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:37.167 align:middle line:90%
in with a serial killer.

00:14:37.167 --> 00:14:38.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: No, we have our own--

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.675 align:middle line:84%
I like to think we have
our own rooms at the hotel.

00:14:40.675 --> 00:14:41.550 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:43.245 align:middle line:90%
But everyone--

00:14:43.245 --> 00:14:44.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everyone in the hotel?

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.968 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: They're in
the hotel, but they're

00:14:46.968 --> 00:14:48.260 align:middle line:90%
going through their own review.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:52.250 align:middle line:84%
So if you take someone that's
done an immense amount of evil,

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:55.040 align:middle line:84%
right, they're probably
going to be in review--

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.630 align:middle line:90%
I don't know, maybe forever.

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:57.770 align:middle line:90%
Is that Hell?

00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:58.880 align:middle line:90%
Possibly.

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.880 align:middle line:84%
So what we do here, it
is reflected back to us

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.210 align:middle line:84%
not to torment or torture us,
but so that we understand.

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:07.640 align:middle line:84%
So does that become
torment and torture?

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.590 align:middle line:90%
Possibly, right?

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:12.497 align:middle line:84%
So we do review everything
and feel everything and all

00:15:12.497 --> 00:15:14.330 align:middle line:84%
of the actions we took
and all of the people

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.540 align:middle line:90%
we touched or hurt in our lives.

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:19.220 align:middle line:84%
So it's the same place, but
it's a different experience.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:22.250 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Do you talk to dead
people who have been murdered?

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:23.130 align:middle line:10%
>>GABRIEL: Yes.

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:23.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do?

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:24.380 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah.

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:25.797 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you do with this?

00:15:25.797 --> 00:15:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, so two
big things right now

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.700 align:middle line:84%
are mysterious
deaths or murdered,

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:35.570 align:middle line:84%
where they don't know how
they died or who killed them.

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:38.040 align:middle line:84%
And then also suicides
are huge right now.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.830 align:middle line:84%
People want to know,
was this on purpose

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:41.420 align:middle line:90%
or was this an accident?

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:44.390 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, so being able to
bring through that information

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:47.780 align:middle line:84%
is life-changing for those
that are still here living.

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.820 align:middle line:84%
I also worked with
police on a cold case,

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.152 align:middle line:90%
a 29-year-old cold case.

00:15:51.152 --> 00:15:52.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened?

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:54.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: So it
was-- a woman came in.

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:56.720 align:middle line:84%
She brought me in to
the police station,

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.100 align:middle line:84%
and I had been talking
to her for a while.

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And finally, I agreed
to go in and do it.

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And it was her sister
who had crossed over.

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:09.170 align:middle line:84%
She went missing, and they never
found out what happened to her.

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:12.110 align:middle line:84%
And so they laid
out on the table

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:15.500 align:middle line:84%
like, maybe 15 or 20
mug shots of people,

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.240 align:middle line:84%
and they said, just
what can you tell us?

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And so her lovely sister, who
was quite young when she died,

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.580 align:middle line:90%
came through.

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:25.237 align:middle line:90%
Lovely, beautiful, sweet soul.

00:16:25.237 --> 00:16:26.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pointed out the person?

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:27.987 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Pointed
out the person.

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:30.290 align:middle line:84%
And she said, this
is the person.

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And the police, he was a
Sergeant, and he said, yeah,

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:36.010 align:middle line:90%
that's--

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:37.468 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
who they suspected?

00:16:37.468 --> 00:16:40.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: That's who they
think, and he is on death row

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:44.570 align:middle line:84%
for a crime very similar to the
one that the sister described

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:45.900 align:middle line:90%
from spirit.

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:52.050 align:middle line:84%
So, and that was a painful and
horrible moment for her family,

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:53.840 align:middle line:84%
but it was also
incredibly healing.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.730 align:middle line:84%
When someone disappears
without a trace,

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:58.090 align:middle line:90%
it's just life-altering.

00:16:58.090 --> 00:16:59.680 align:middle line:84%
You just can't go
on in the same way.

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:00.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
law enforcement

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:01.885 align:middle line:90%
say about your abilities?

00:17:01.885 --> 00:17:04.150 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: You
know, the Sergeant

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:06.430 align:middle line:90%
that I worked with was cool.

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:08.131 align:middle line:84%
He was totally
cool and was like,

00:17:08.131 --> 00:17:10.089 align:middle line:84%
you know what, he was
actually about to retire.

00:17:10.089 --> 00:17:11.859 align:middle line:90%
This was a 29-year-old case.

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:13.630 align:middle line:84%
So he was like, what
do you got for us?

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:16.040 align:middle line:90%
He was super happy I was there.

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:19.599 align:middle line:84%
So I think everyone has so many
mixed feelings about mediumship

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:21.579 align:middle line:84%
through different
religions and beliefs.

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:23.440 align:middle line:90%
And it's all OK, right?

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.172 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
people on this Earth.

00:17:25.172 --> 00:17:26.589 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
different beliefs.

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:27.785 align:middle line:90%
It's all OK.

00:17:27.785 --> 00:17:30.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were ready to
bury that case, weren't they?

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.577 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Ready
to bury the case.

00:17:31.577 --> 00:17:32.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You saved it.

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:34.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: I think
I helped the family,

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:37.330 align:middle line:84%
and that makes me
happier than I could

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:39.370 align:middle line:90%
explain right here in the now.

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:42.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do the spirits
ever talk about the future?

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:44.610 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Sometimes.

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:46.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind of
picture do they paint?

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:49.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Actually,
when I work--

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:52.650 align:middle line:84%
when they talk to me about the
future, and it's frustrating,

00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:54.730 align:middle line:84%
it's maybe a frustrating
answer as well.

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:57.330 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
crossroads happening,

00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:59.468 align:middle line:84%
a lot of different
directions that they show me.

00:17:59.468 --> 00:18:00.510 align:middle line:90%
Not about the same thing.

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:03.190 align:middle line:84%
Usually, it'll be like two
directions about something.

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:05.190 align:middle line:84%
But they also tell
me that if you

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:08.730 align:middle line:84%
are someone that is constantly
putting out in the world

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:11.010 align:middle line:84%
and constantly
focusing on negativity

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:13.440 align:middle line:84%
and that this is all going
to hell in a handbasket,

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.810 align:middle line:84%
you are only contributing
to going down

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:17.380 align:middle line:90%
that more negative path.

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:20.100 align:middle line:84%
So that's why it's so
important, with spirit lessons

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:23.130 align:middle line:84%
as well, is that
understanding, finding

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:25.290 align:middle line:84%
your path and your
purpose and shining it,

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:27.930 align:middle line:84%
how much that helps the
collective consciousness,

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:31.410 align:middle line:84%
how much that steers our
ship onto a better path

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:32.640 align:middle line:90%
and in a better direction.

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.520 align:middle line:84%
Our responsibility is
huge in a beautiful way,

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.510 align:middle line:90%
not in a scary way.

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:39.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you glad you
have this gift, Erika?

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:40.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: I'm so
happy I have this gift.

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:41.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
your friends say?

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:45.030 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: My friends--

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:46.440 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my friends love what I do.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.265 align:middle line:90%
They think it's amazing.

00:18:47.265 --> 00:18:47.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they?

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:48.780 align:middle line:90%
How about your family?

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:50.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: My family
is so proud of me.

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:51.880 align:middle line:90%
They love what I do.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.190 align:middle line:90%
My kids love what I do.

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:55.000 align:middle line:84%
They ask me questions
all the time.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think I definitely
have people in my life

00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:59.640 align:middle line:84%
that don't understand on
a deep level of what I do,

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:00.550 align:middle line:90%
and that's OK too.

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:01.350 align:middle line:90%
They don't have to.

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:02.910 align:middle line:84%
I have friends that
work in finance.

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:06.180 align:middle line:84%
I literally know nothing about
finance, but I still love them.

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:08.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what's
currently happening

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:11.610 align:middle line:90%
on the planet spiritually?

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:14.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, so spiritually,
right now, a lot of people

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:16.230 align:middle line:90%
are waking up.

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:17.190 align:middle line:10%
They're changing.

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:21.000 align:middle line:10%
They're realizing, OK, I'm
not happy with the status

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.020 align:middle line:10%
quo of my life, of the
path, of the universe.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.430 align:middle line:90%
There has to be more.

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:29.250 align:middle line:84%
People are feeling
things, seeing things

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:31.020 align:middle line:90%
on a completely different level.

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:32.850 align:middle line:90%
It's an awakening in essence.

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And there's been many, but we
are going through an awakening.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And so that causes
a lot of turmoil.

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:44.280 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe that people
are going towards good, not bad.

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:47.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there some kind
of a shift in any of this?

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:49.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Yes, there
is a huge shift.

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:52.860 align:middle line:84%
And people are seeing
that there is so much

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:57.210 align:middle line:84%
more than just this chair,
this chair, this carpet,

00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:58.495 align:middle line:90%
this jacket, right?

00:19:58.495 --> 00:20:00.120 align:middle line:84%
There saying like,
well, wait a minute.

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:01.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm feeling things.

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm sensing things.

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:03.270 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And it can be really
overwhelming and scary.

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:08.130 align:middle line:84%
But if you're able
to tap into the idea

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:10.650 align:middle line:84%
that we are all connected,
we are all intuitive,

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:13.800 align:middle line:84%
and that we are safe,
it will propel you.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:17.020 align:middle line:84%
It will lift you to keep going
forward in a positive way,

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:18.130 align:middle line:90%
and not in a fearful way.

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:20.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever felt,
though, you were in danger?

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:23.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Before I understood
that I was a medium,

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.140 align:middle line:90%
I felt in a lot of danger.

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:26.430 align:middle line:90%
I felt scared.

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:27.870 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't sleep.

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:30.270 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I was being haunted,
just like you brought up

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:31.620 align:middle line:90%
Whoopi Goldberg and "Ghost."

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:33.720 align:middle line:90%
It felt almost like a haunting.

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:37.860 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that there was
more to spirit and spirituality

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:38.760 align:middle line:90%
than haunting.

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:40.140 align:middle line:84%
Whereas like,
haunting and ghosts

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:42.580 align:middle line:90%
are that first layer of energy.

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And when you move
through that, you

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:49.830 align:middle line:84%
are kind of opening up to an
incredible amount of support

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:53.010 align:middle line:84%
in spirit and light
and positivity

00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:56.130 align:middle line:84%
that comes from spirit, not
just getting stuck on ghosts.

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:57.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When
somebody comes to you,

00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:00.780 align:middle line:84%
do they want to know
something about a dead person?

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:02.330 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, absolutely.

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:03.130 align:middle line:90%
They want to--

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:04.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they want closure?

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:05.100 align:middle line:90%
What do they want?

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:07.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah,
people want closure.

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:10.050 align:middle line:84%
They want to know
if the person is OK.

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:13.770 align:middle line:84%
They also want to know too
what it was like to cross over,

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:16.440 align:middle line:84%
they want to know if
they were uncomfortable,

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.078 align:middle line:84%
and they want to know
who they're with.

00:21:18.078 --> 00:21:20.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they want to know
where the money's hidden?

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:21.775 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: 100% yes.

00:21:21.775 --> 00:21:22.575 align:middle line:90%
Totally.

00:21:22.575 --> 00:21:22.638 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They do.

00:21:22.638 --> 00:21:23.888 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people are into that?

00:21:23.888 --> 00:21:25.650 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Oh, yeah,
they want to know--

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:29.905 align:middle line:84%
Oh, they also like to
have scores settled a lot.

00:21:29.905 --> 00:21:31.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They want closure.

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:31.860 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: They want closure.

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:33.152 align:middle line:90%
Like, my brother got the house.

00:21:33.152 --> 00:21:34.777 align:middle line:84%
Did you want brother
to have the house,

00:21:34.777 --> 00:21:36.550 align:middle line:84%
or did you want me
to have the house?

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:38.760 align:middle line:84%
So there is a lot
of that comes up.

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:41.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was one of the
most strangest stories you've

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:42.988 align:middle line:90%
ever worked on?

00:21:42.988 --> 00:21:44.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: OK, let
me get a good one.

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:46.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I bet
there are many.

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:48.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Not
strange, but I think

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:51.300 align:middle line:84%
for me, the most powerful
things that happen

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:55.700 align:middle line:84%
are when unbelievably
specific details come up

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:58.070 align:middle line:84%
because the person is
maybe really skeptical.

00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:01.430 align:middle line:84%
So something comes
in right so specific

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:03.050 align:middle line:84%
to bring them that
peace and closure.

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:04.940 align:middle line:90%
So like, this was last week.

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:06.350 align:middle line:90%
I was reading for a woman.

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:07.880 align:middle line:90%
Her husband had crossed over.

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:09.710 align:middle line:84%
He's giving all
this information,

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:11.720 align:middle line:84%
and she still was having
trouble letting it in.

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:14.910 align:middle line:84%
And he started singing,
(SINGING) chim chiminey,

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:17.330 align:middle line:84%
chim chiminey,
chim, chim, cher-oo,

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:18.440 align:middle line:90%
which is "Mary Poppins."

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.310 align:middle line:84%
And he's singing
it and singing it.

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:22.950 align:middle line:84%
And as Erika, I'm kind of
like, OK, what's happening.

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And so I just started
singing it to her.

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment, it was like,
everything made sense to her

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:29.840 align:middle line:84%
because that was
his favorite movie

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.000 align:middle line:84%
and that was the last movie
they ever saw together.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.793 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wow, and
it just popped up.

00:22:33.793 --> 00:22:35.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: He started
singing in my ear.

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:37.490 align:middle line:84%
He was not a great singer,
but I knew the song.

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:39.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, and you didn't
know that, though, did you?

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:39.978 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: No, it was--

00:22:39.978 --> 00:22:41.960 align:middle line:84%
I only get people's
first and last name

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.080 align:middle line:90%
when they connect with me.

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:43.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's it.

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:44.755 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: That's it.

00:22:44.755 --> 00:22:45.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did she say?

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.720 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Oh, my god.

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.670 align:middle line:90%
And then she started crying.

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:51.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
afterlife mean to you?

00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:54.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: The afterlife
means many things to me.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.360 align:middle line:84%
But I will say from
doing readings,

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.850 align:middle line:84%
I see all kinds of people
doing all kinds of things

00:22:58.850 --> 00:22:59.730 align:middle line:90%
in the afterlife.

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:03.590 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes I see people,
they are literally retired.

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:06.920 align:middle line:84%
I will see them with their
feet up, on a lounge chair,

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:08.480 align:middle line:90%
on a beach.

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:11.360 align:middle line:84%
I see people sometimes
take jobs in spirit.

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.260 align:middle line:84%
I see a lot of
people in healing.

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:15.628 align:middle line:84%
So I see a lot of like, when
I see younger people that

00:23:15.628 --> 00:23:17.420 align:middle line:84%
have committed suicide,
I see a lot of them

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:20.000 align:middle line:84%
with animals, which
are extremely healing.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.130 align:middle line:84%
I think it's different
for everyone.

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:27.170 align:middle line:84%
I think the feeling of it is
completely dissimilar to Earth,

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:30.560 align:middle line:84%
but I get a lot of visuals that
are similar to Earth and are

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:32.115 align:middle line:90%
pictures that we have here.

00:23:32.115 --> 00:23:33.990 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's where
we're all going to go,

00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:36.223 align:middle line:84%
and I think it's where
we all came from.

00:23:36.223 --> 00:23:38.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lots of things are
happening on this planet

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:39.620 align:middle line:90%
right now, Erika.

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:45.950 align:middle line:84%
People are depressed, crime is
high, auto thefts, burglaries,

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:47.013 align:middle line:90%
what's going on?

00:23:47.013 --> 00:23:47.930 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Absolutely.

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:51.050 align:middle line:84%
I think from spirit, there
is almost a desperation.

00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:53.030 align:middle line:84%
There's a desperate
feeling happening.

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:55.730 align:middle line:84%
And with everything
going on in our world,

00:23:55.730 --> 00:24:00.510 align:middle line:84%
it is making people feel
worse and scared, not better.

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And so people are going to
lower vibration, they're lost.

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:06.680 align:middle line:84%
They're maybe going into
addiction, they're stealing,

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.360 align:middle line:90%
all the things you mentioned.

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:13.020 align:middle line:84%
It is our vibration is
getting so crushed right now.

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:18.530 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're able to do,
if you can find your way through

00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:21.930 align:middle line:84%
and hold on to this idea
that we are connected

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:23.430 align:middle line:84%
and that you're
supposed to be here,

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:25.910 align:middle line:84%
and that the universe is
for you, not against you,

00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:29.930 align:middle line:84%
you can then move yourself
like a cork floats up

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:32.600 align:middle line:84%
to a higher vibration and
move and shine your life

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:33.710 align:middle line:90%
and your purpose forward.

00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:34.910 align:middle line:90%
And that helps.

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:37.700 align:middle line:84%
The more we can
do for ourselves--

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:40.550 align:middle line:84%
to elevate ourselves, the
more we shine on the world,

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:42.560 align:middle line:84%
and then we lift the
vibration of the world.

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Us going down in our
vibration does not help it.

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:50.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are suicide victims
punished on the other side?

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:53.175 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: No, they're not.

00:24:53.175 --> 00:24:54.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's good.

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:55.008 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: They're not.

00:24:55.008 --> 00:24:56.030 align:middle line:90%
They're not punished.

00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:57.328 align:middle line:90%
I see a lot of times--

00:24:57.328 --> 00:24:58.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're hurting.

00:24:58.370 --> 00:24:59.520 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: They're hurting.

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:02.300 align:middle line:84%
I will say this to
anyone watching,

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:06.080 align:middle line:90%
I implore you to stay here.

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:10.073 align:middle line:84%
Suicide does not
make it all go away.

00:25:10.073 --> 00:25:11.490 align:middle line:84%
Part of the reason
why you're here

00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:14.130 align:middle line:84%
is, you're supposed to be
here and find why that is.

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:16.652 align:middle line:84%
So I do not think people
should commit suicide

00:25:16.652 --> 00:25:18.360 align:middle line:84%
just because we all
go to the same place,

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.820 align:middle line:84%
and we all go back to
spirit, and it's beautiful.

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:22.740 align:middle line:90%
But no, you're not punished.

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:25.380 align:middle line:84%
I do truly believe
that since you

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:27.930 align:middle line:84%
chose to come here and learn
these series of lessons,

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:29.880 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that
people choose to come

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:33.730 align:middle line:84%
back in a very similar
life situation once again.

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:35.888 align:middle line:90%
So while you're here, go for it.

00:25:35.888 --> 00:25:37.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And do it,
and do it in a big way.

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Correct, or at
least, in a way that you can

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:41.640 align:middle line:90%
find some harmony in your soul.

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:43.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have there ever
been a moment that you

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.300 align:middle line:90%
wished you weren't a medium?

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:46.200 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Yes.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened?

00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:49.440 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: I went to--

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:53.478 align:middle line:84%
a woman had me come and
surprise her husband for their--

00:25:53.478 --> 00:25:55.020 align:middle line:84%
I think it was a
wedding anniversary.

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:55.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was he dead or alive?

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:57.120 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: No, he was alive.

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And so I got there, and
I was like, surprise.

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:00.840 align:middle line:90%
Your wife had a medium come.

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:04.020 align:middle line:84%
So it was me and
this lovely couple,

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:07.340 align:middle line:84%
and their fridge was over
there in their kitchen.

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:11.625 align:middle line:84%
And when I was reading for
them, I flashed on their fridge.

00:26:11.625 --> 00:26:13.250 align:middle line:84%
Like, you know when
you go to a funeral

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:15.180 align:middle line:84%
and you get kind of
a fold like this,

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:18.140 align:middle line:84%
and it's usually a picture
of the person on the front.

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:20.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what those
are called, forgive me.

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:22.850 align:middle line:84%
But it's kind of like,
tells about the person

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:24.350 align:middle line:84%
and how the service
is going to go.

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And in my mind, I saw one
of those on their fridge

00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:29.940 align:middle line:84%
and it had a picture
of a young guy on it.

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:31.860 align:middle line:90%
And I was reading for them.

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:35.820 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, so
your son crossed over.

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:38.640 align:middle line:90%
And they were like, no.

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.250 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, oh, OK.

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw and
it wasn't there.

00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, so you didn't--
you didn't lose a son?

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And they said, no,
we have three sons

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:48.940 align:middle line:90%
and they're all still here.

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:50.500 align:middle line:90%
And it was like, OK.

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And then when the
person doesn't confirm

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:56.650 align:middle line:84%
something you're seeing, you
have to move on, and I did.

00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:59.170 align:middle line:84%
Twenty four hours
later, the woman

00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:06.070 align:middle line:84%
emails me and says, dear
Erika, my son accidentally--

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:11.170 align:middle line:84%
he was in a-- had a gun, they
were hunting and shot himself.

00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And so we know that you know
and you knew and you saw it.

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:18.105 align:middle line:84%
And can you come
back and talk to us?

00:27:18.105 --> 00:27:19.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You felt it.

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:21.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: And in that moment,
I just thought, I'm good.

00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:26.110 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- yeah, I was really sad
to be a medium in that moment.

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:27.470 align:middle line:90%
It was really, really sad.

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:29.320 align:middle line:84%
And I really grappled
because I was

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:33.040 align:middle line:84%
like, why did you just
show me the brochure?

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:35.460 align:middle line:90%
Why wasn't there more?

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:38.340 align:middle line:84%
Why didn't you tell me more
so that maybe something

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:41.730 align:middle line:84%
we could have done or said
could have changed that moment.

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And it was such a come to
whatever you want to call it,

00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:46.620 align:middle line:90%
"moment" for me in my life.

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And I worked with my
guides for a long time,

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:52.680 align:middle line:84%
and they just explained that was
not what you were there to do.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:56.700 align:middle line:84%
You were not there to alter
that young man's destiny.

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:58.950 align:middle line:84%
But being a sensitive
and being a medium,

00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:01.740 align:middle line:84%
you felt that energy
before it even happened.

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:05.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's assume you're
speaking to a crowd of skeptics

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.380 align:middle line:90%
about the other side.

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:08.490 align:middle line:90%
How do you begin?

00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:10.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: If I were
talking to skeptics,

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.450 align:middle line:84%
I would just tell
them, listen, you

00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:14.040 align:middle line:84%
don't have to work
with a medium.

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:14.940 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:16.690 align:middle line:84%
Find what you do
like to work with,

00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:20.950 align:middle line:84%
but if I give you anything
that you can take with you,

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:24.540 align:middle line:84%
it would be to allow
yourself to understand

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:29.190 align:middle line:84%
that you are more connected
with God and with spirit

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:31.650 align:middle line:84%
and with the other side
than you could ever know.

00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:35.320 align:middle line:84%
So allow your mind to be open in
a way that feels safe for you.

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And if it's not with
me, a medium, that's OK.

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:41.040 align:middle line:84%
I think people close
themselves off so tightly--

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:42.332 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they listen to you?

00:28:42.332 --> 00:28:44.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Well, I don't
deal with a ton of skeptics.

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:46.260 align:middle line:84%
When I feel somewhat
skeptical, I kind of

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:47.250 align:middle line:90%
have an aversion to that.

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:47.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So you run away.

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:48.892 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Well, kind of.

00:28:48.892 --> 00:28:52.090 align:middle line:84%
Not everyone has to believe
or feel everything I say,

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:56.280 align:middle line:84%
but you have to want to
engage with a medium.

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.930 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, when someone's
really skeptical, I'm like,

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:00.690 align:middle line:84%
I think you should
talk to someone else.

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:03.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
had a spirit question you?

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:05.740 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: A spirit question
me-- like, if what I'm saying

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:06.540 align:middle line:90%
is right?

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:07.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:09.150 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: No, they
don't question me.

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:11.140 align:middle line:84%
But I've had a spirit
get really annoyed.

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:11.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At you?

00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:13.290 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Oh, totally.

00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:14.820 align:middle line:90%
Like, no, you're not getting it.

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:15.937 align:middle line:90%
Say it like this.

00:29:15.937 --> 00:29:17.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
been physically hurt?

00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:18.630 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: No.

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:19.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing like that?

00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:20.210 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: No.

00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:21.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Has any medium been?

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:23.320 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: I don't know.

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:27.010 align:middle line:84%
But this is truly what
I believe if they have.

00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:29.740 align:middle line:90%
I feel like I don't believe--

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:32.140 align:middle line:84%
and I and I've asked
my guides as many times

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.030 align:middle line:84%
with my whole heart
and soul, I don't

00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:38.750 align:middle line:84%
believe a spirit can physically
attack you or harm you.

00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:40.300 align:middle line:90%
Let me rationalize that for you.

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:41.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's hope not.

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:42.650 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: No, no, they can't.

00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:46.200 align:middle line:84%
Think about this,
if you were murdered

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:49.770 align:middle line:84%
and you were in spirit, you're
deceased, you're in spirit,

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:53.600 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't you just come back
and murder your murderer

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.910 align:middle line:90%
or just beat up your murderer?

00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:58.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You would think or
torture them or something.

00:29:58.220 --> 00:29:58.475 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Correct.

00:29:58.475 --> 00:30:00.270 align:middle line:90%
Correct, but they can't do that.

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:02.580 align:middle line:84%
So I feel like when people
have physical reactions,

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:05.060 align:middle line:84%
they are reacting to a
really uncomfortable energy.

00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:06.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
about poltergeists?

00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:09.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: I mean, I don't
believe that poltergeist--

00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:11.473 align:middle line:84%
OK, let me explain
it to you this way.

00:30:11.473 --> 00:30:13.015 align:middle line:84%
Say, we're sitting
here, we're having

00:30:13.015 --> 00:30:14.123 align:middle line:90%
this lovely conversation.

00:30:14.123 --> 00:30:15.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which we are.

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:16.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Which we totally are.

00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:20.600 align:middle line:84%
And someone sits down, and
they're in a horrible place.

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:23.900 align:middle line:84%
They are angry, they're
upset, they're just

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:25.850 align:middle line:90%
in a terrible state, right?

00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:28.340 align:middle line:84%
And you and I sat here,
and they're right here.

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:30.560 align:middle line:84%
We would start to
feel like, OK, we're

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:34.310 align:middle line:84%
kind of starting to feel yucky
and uncomfortable now, right?

00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:37.430 align:middle line:84%
Spirit can affect our
energy, our feelings,

00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:38.563 align:middle line:90%
but they can't attack us.

00:30:38.563 --> 00:30:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I was talking
about in the beginning

00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:43.610 align:middle line:84%
of our conversation--
boundaries.

00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:46.580 align:middle line:84%
Honoring your energy,
honoring your own spirit,

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:49.670 align:middle line:84%
honoring your own self and
creating those boundaries

00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:53.570 align:middle line:84%
keeps you so powerful and
safe and working with spirit.

00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:55.140 align:middle line:90%
Same thing there.

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:56.540 align:middle line:90%
You have to work with energy.

00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:59.510 align:middle line:84%
But yes, I do think poltergeists
can go in people's houses

00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:01.250 align:middle line:90%
and just move stuff around.

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:03.133 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
ascension mean to you?

00:31:03.133 --> 00:31:04.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: I think
with ascension,

00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:08.270 align:middle line:84%
I think it is an
incredible release.

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:10.940 align:middle line:84%
When I think of going up
to spirit or ascension

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:14.870 align:middle line:84%
as you asked, I think
of someone in a bird--

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:18.020 align:middle line:84%
like, our body is
almost like a bird cage.

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And when you go to
spirit or go to heaven,

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:25.130 align:middle line:84%
it's like the little door is
opened and the bird flies out.

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And the soul is the bird
and the body is the cage.

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I think of
about crossing over or elevating

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:33.320 align:middle line:90%
our energy or going to spirit.

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:36.260 align:middle line:84%
It is a beautiful,
soaring release.

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:39.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
our destiny is as a human?

00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:41.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, so
destiny is so amazing

00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:46.760 align:middle line:84%
because some people come
here into this life with so

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:48.080 align:middle line:90%
many things in their destiny.

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:51.140 align:middle line:84%
So many things that are
like, blocks in their life

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:54.410 align:middle line:84%
that they put there to help
them on their path to fulfill

00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:55.820 align:middle line:90%
their purpose, right?

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:58.280 align:middle line:84%
Some people come
here with one thing,

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:01.640 align:middle line:84%
one small thing that's
like a block in their life

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:03.380 align:middle line:90%
that's destined.

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:05.780 align:middle line:84%
So everyone has a
series of destinies.

00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:07.760 align:middle line:84%
So for an example,
like, I was not

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:10.190 align:middle line:84%
destined to wear this
purple coat today, right.

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:12.140 align:middle line:84%
That was just a
choice, you know.

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:13.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It looks good on you.

00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:14.240 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Thank you so--

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.130 align:middle line:84%
we kind of match with the
light purple and the purple.

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:16.963 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That we do.

00:32:16.963 --> 00:32:18.920 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, it's
a good vibe for us.

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:21.620 align:middle line:84%
But so some people
have a ton of things

00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:24.380 align:middle line:84%
that are set in their
destiny, and some people

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:26.790 align:middle line:84%
have a few things that
are in their destiny.

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:29.730 align:middle line:84%
So kind of part of our path
is finding out what's what.

00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:32.610 align:middle line:84%
Do I believe that you can
shift and change your destiny?

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:34.110 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:38.400 align:middle line:84%
There is no man
sitting on a throne

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:41.700 align:middle line:84%
judging us and
puppeteering our life.

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:45.730 align:middle line:84%
We are incredibly
powerful spiritual beings.

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:47.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We determine
our own, don't we?

00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:50.290 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: 100%.

00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:52.060 align:middle line:90%
100%.

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:55.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In the movie,
"Christmas Carol," Scrooge was

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:59.590 align:middle line:84%
told by one of the
spirits about these events

00:32:59.590 --> 00:33:01.150 align:middle line:90%
that were going to occur.

00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And Scrooge's line,
I'll never forget it,

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:09.250 align:middle line:84%
were, "are these things
that will be or could be?"

00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's a little
bit with our destiny.

00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Are these things that
will happen to us

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.790 align:middle line:90%
or could happen to us?

00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:17.080 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Exactly.

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:18.760 align:middle line:90%
I think that's exactly right.

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think there
are things that

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:24.440 align:middle line:84%
are both-- they are a few
things that will happen,

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.810 align:middle line:84%
and then there's a
lot that could happen.

00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:30.430 align:middle line:84%
So much of our life is,
choose your own adventure.

00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:31.620 align:middle line:90%
So it's kind of interesting.

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And some things are they're
absolutely destined.

00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:34.630 align:middle line:90%
It's in our path.

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:36.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
make the shift to this?

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:38.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: To mediumship
or to teaching?

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:39.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Both.

00:33:39.810 --> 00:33:44.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: To mediumship, it was
like the most relieving moment

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:46.830 align:middle line:84%
of my life, George,
to become a medium.

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:48.720 align:middle line:90%
It made everything make sense.

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:51.600 align:middle line:84%
We kind of glossed over how I
got there, because we can only

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:52.570 align:middle line:90%
talk for so long.

00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:58.360 align:middle line:84%
But it was like the deepest
itch in my soul that was itched.

00:33:58.360 --> 00:33:59.160 align:middle line:90%
I got it.

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:01.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, oh, my
gosh, thank you.

00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:02.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm not crazy.

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:04.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm not haunted.

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:05.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm a medium.

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:07.660 align:middle line:90%
It felt so, so good.

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And with this switch
over into teaching

00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:14.130 align:middle line:84%
is when I started to hear all of
these readings over these years

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:17.429 align:middle line:84%
and understand that we
all want the same thing.

00:34:17.429 --> 00:34:19.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And who do you teach?

00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:21.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: So now,
I'm teaching people

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:23.010 align:middle line:84%
that want readings
or people that

00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:25.650 align:middle line:84%
are seeing that I'm moving
into spiritual teaching,

00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:27.630 align:middle line:84%
and people that
spirit bring to me.

00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:29.699 align:middle line:90%
So much of this is meant to be.

00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:33.179 align:middle line:84%
But I became aware that
no matter who we were,

00:34:33.179 --> 00:34:36.989 align:middle line:84%
young, old, rich, poor,
all over the world,

00:34:36.989 --> 00:34:38.889 align:middle line:90%
we all want the same things.

00:34:38.889 --> 00:34:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And spirit has a way of
helping us find those things,

00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:46.500 align:middle line:84%
helping us locate
blocks in our path.

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:48.780 align:middle line:84%
Work through them
to find our way

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:51.310 align:middle line:84%
and to really pinpoint the
exact place we want to go.

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:53.800 align:middle line:84%
And I started hearing these
messages over and over again.

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:55.679 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh,
my gosh, there's

00:34:55.679 --> 00:34:58.000 align:middle line:84%
something here that could
help a lot of people.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.640 align:middle line:84%
I can only read one on
one with so many people.

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:02.430 align:middle line:84%
So in the teaching,
I am able to work

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:04.350 align:middle line:90%
with large amounts of people.

00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:06.210 align:middle line:90%
And that is what is really--

00:35:06.210 --> 00:35:08.307 align:middle line:84%
that is that new itch
in my soul that's

00:35:08.307 --> 00:35:09.390 align:middle line:90%
being scratched right now.

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long
are these courses?

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, so I
have a five-week course.

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:14.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's intense.

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:15.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: It's super intense.

00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:20.190 align:middle line:84%
And right now, which by the
time people see this, it is out.

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:21.870 align:middle line:90%
It is on my website.

00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's three lessons, so you
can take it as long or as short

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:26.070 align:middle line:90%
as you want.

00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What have you learned,
Erika, about the spirit

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:31.200 align:middle line:90%
world at this point?

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:34.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, I learned that
the spirit world is with us.

00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:38.610 align:middle line:84%
I learned that the spirit world
is for us, not against us.

00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:42.180 align:middle line:84%
I learned that one of the
big, big questions people ask

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:46.380 align:middle line:84%
is, does my loved one in spirit,
who I'm missing desperately,

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:49.830 align:middle line:84%
see my accomplishments,
my graduation, my life,

00:35:49.830 --> 00:35:51.330 align:middle line:84%
my marriage,
whatever it may be--

00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:52.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And is proud of you.

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:55.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: And is proud of you,
and it's an emphatic yes, they

00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:56.190 align:middle line:90%
are with you.

00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:57.250 align:middle line:90%
They are seeing you.

00:35:57.250 --> 00:35:58.300 align:middle line:90%
They are watching you.

00:35:58.300 --> 00:35:59.790 align:middle line:90%
They are sending you signs.

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And the more you connect
with your intuition,

00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:04.050 align:middle line:84%
the more you can
connect with spirit.

00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:05.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they encourage you?

00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:07.050 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Absolutely.

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:09.960 align:middle line:84%
Your intuitive voice
is a direct line,

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:13.440 align:middle line:84%
it's a direct plug-in to
the divine and to spirit.

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:15.510 align:middle line:90%
And spirit is always a yes.

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:19.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What have you
learned, Erika, about the death

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:20.910 align:middle line:90%
and the dying?

00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:21.810 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, it
is, our soul is done.

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:28.380 align:middle line:90%
Our soul is ready to go back.

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:30.330 align:middle line:84%
And it seems so utterly
unfair at times.

00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:31.130 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:32.960 align:middle line:90%
Why now?

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Why would that person
have to go now?

00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And we don't always know why,
but part of what we have to do

00:36:38.570 --> 00:36:40.880 align:middle line:84%
is have faith that
our purpose is here,

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:43.250 align:middle line:84%
that we're here for a
reason, that our passing was

00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:44.150 align:middle line:90%
for a reason.

00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:46.310 align:middle line:84%
I think with death,
we have to remember

00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:50.950 align:middle line:84%
everyone is going to go, and
we all have our own time.

00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:52.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're just in no rush.

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:54.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Well, we hope
we're not in any rush.

00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:54.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm not in any rush.

00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:56.893 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What new projects
do you have coming out?

00:36:56.893 --> 00:36:58.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, so
right now, I have

00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:00.900 align:middle line:90%
a project called, "The Way."

00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:03.990 align:middle line:84%
And that is my
amazing new course.

00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:05.935 align:middle line:84%
It is the-- something
I've been more

00:37:05.935 --> 00:37:07.560 align:middle line:84%
excited about than
anything in my life.

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:09.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How'd you
call it, "The Way?"

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:10.530 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: My guides told me.

00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:11.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They named it.

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:11.970 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: They named it.

00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:12.930 align:middle line:84%
They said, it's
called "The Way."

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:14.380 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, the way for what?

00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:16.332 align:middle line:84%
And they said, the
way to your purpose,

00:37:16.332 --> 00:37:18.540 align:middle line:84%
the way to the person you
want to find that you love,

00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:21.820 align:middle line:84%
the way to your happiness,
the way to your joy,

00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:24.670 align:middle line:84%
the way to being strong
and fulfilled here

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:26.650 align:middle line:84%
in this life and
this incarnation.

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:27.820 align:middle line:90%
It's the way.

00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:28.690 align:middle line:90%
Let us tell you.

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And then I downloaded
three powerful lessons,

00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:35.380 align:middle line:84%
followed by super simple
cohesive Earth tools.

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:39.580 align:middle line:90%
And I filmed it and wrote it.

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:41.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you
weren't a medium,

00:37:41.290 --> 00:37:42.460 align:middle line:90%
what would you be doing?

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:44.293 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, number
one, I would think I

00:37:44.293 --> 00:37:46.490 align:middle line:84%
would be drawn towards any
kind of spiritual work.

00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:49.210 align:middle line:84%
But if it was completely
outside of the spiritual realm

00:37:49.210 --> 00:37:51.110 align:middle line:84%
and your makeup artists
can attest to this,

00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:53.300 align:middle line:84%
I would definitely be
working with makeup.

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:54.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:55.090 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Oh, I love makeup.

00:37:55.090 --> 00:37:55.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:57.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Especially
stage makeup.

00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:57.970 align:middle line:90%
I think it's so fun.

00:37:57.970 --> 00:37:59.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But aren't you glad
you're doing what you're doing?

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:01.010 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Oh, my gosh.

00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:02.920 align:middle line:90%
I would not give back a day.

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:04.520 align:middle line:90%
I love what I'm doing.

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:05.390 align:middle line:90%
It's why I'm here.

00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:06.190 align:middle line:90%
It's my purpose.

00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:09.373 align:middle line:84%
And it's with my whole
heart and soul, my joy.

00:38:09.373 --> 00:38:11.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, good luck
with that new course.

00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:11.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Thank you.

00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:12.190 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:13.232 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's exciting.

00:38:13.232 --> 00:38:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And how can people
sign up for that?

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:15.820 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Sure.

00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:17.830 align:middle line:10%
So they're going to go
to erikagabriel.com,

00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:19.293 align:middle line:10%
they're going to
click on courses,

00:38:19.293 --> 00:38:20.960 align:middle line:10%
and they're going to
click on "The Way."

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:25.060 align:middle line:10%
And they're going to join me for
an amazing, amazing, elevating,

00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:26.035 align:middle line:10%
beautiful experience.

00:38:26.035 --> 00:38:27.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And this
one is how long?

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:28.890 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: It's three lessons.

00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:30.790 align:middle line:84%
So you can take it in
whatever way you want.

00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:32.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And at any time.

00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:32.740 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: At any time.

00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:34.164 align:middle line:84%
And you own it
forever, so no rush.

00:38:34.164 --> 00:38:35.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you take
it chronologically?

00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:36.960 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: 100% chronological.

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:37.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You have to.

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:39.423 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, you
can't skip ahead.

00:38:39.423 --> 00:38:41.140 align:middle line:84%
Like, I read the last
page of every book

00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:43.870 align:middle line:84%
I read because the pressure
of not knowing is too great,

00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:45.260 align:middle line:84%
you can't do this
with my course.

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:46.510 align:middle line:90%
You have to do it as it comes.

00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:49.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If we never
get visited by those

00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:53.600 align:middle line:84%
that we love who have passed
on, what does that tell you?

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:58.330 align:middle line:10%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, it tells
me one you probably have,

00:38:58.330 --> 00:39:02.020 align:middle line:10%
but it just is coming in a
way that you are not seeing.

00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:04.420 align:middle line:84%
If you really just
have no visitation,

00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:07.090 align:middle line:84%
it does not mean that
they're not with you.

00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:10.180 align:middle line:84%
You may have a spirit on
the other side, that just

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:12.610 align:middle line:90%
doesn't really want to do that.

00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And that is deep in
the spirit world.

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:18.040 align:middle line:84%
I would also say and
implore people truly--

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:20.110 align:middle line:84%
if you don't think your
loved one is with you,

00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:21.400 align:middle line:90%
they are with you.

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:23.530 align:middle line:84%
Look for signs that
you may not expect.

00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:26.950 align:middle line:84%
You can see signs sometimes
in nature, in birds.

00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:31.300 align:middle line:84%
I've seen spirit leave
pennies in people's path.

00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:34.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I prefer
silver dollars myself.

00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:36.430 align:middle line:84%
Erika, thank you for
being on Beyond Belief.

00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:39.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: This was such a joy
and a pleasure to be with you.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:39.160 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:40.745 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're a
wonderful medium.

00:39:40.745 --> 00:39:41.620 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Thank you.

00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:44.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If I ever
became a spirit,

00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:47.370 align:middle line:84%
you'd be the one I'd want to
introduce me to the world.

00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:48.480 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Yes, I love it.

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:49.280 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:51.155 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:39:51.155 --> 00:39:54.240 align:middle line:90%
