>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.870 align:middle line:10%
We've got Reverend
Sarah Nash with us,

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.120 align:middle line:10%
the founder of The
White Light Express.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.660 align:middle line:10%
She has developed a
cosmic triage technique

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.715 align:middle line:10%
which helps people
to center ground

00:00:30.715 --> 00:00:34.820 align:middle line:10%
and protect themselves
during paranormal phenomena.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And today she is going to talk
about portals and gateways.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.810 align:middle line:90%
Sarah, welcome to the program.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:41.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SARAH NASH: Thank you.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:42.350 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.520 align:middle line:90%
It's lovely to be here.

>>NOORY: How have you been?

00:00:44.645 --> 00:00:47.060 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: I have been
great, busy, very busy.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.410 align:middle line:84%
I have a new Oracle deck, the
Cosmic Triage Oracle deck.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.750 align:middle line:10%
The Spiritus Mundi,
that's coming out.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.270 align:middle line:10%
I've been doing a lot
more talking about portals

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.190 align:middle line:10%
and gateways, and
so this is still

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.107 align:middle line:10%
kind of a new subject for me.

00:00:59.107 --> 00:01:01.190 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in this subject?

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.520 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Because I
had an experience,

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.560 align:middle line:84%
and I'm the world's most
skeptical psychic anyways.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yes, you are,
knowing you that I have.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.820 align:middle line:10%
>> NASH: And if I can't see it,
if I haven't experienced it,

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.800 align:middle line:10%
or if somebody's
telling me about it,

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.210 align:middle line:10%
I have to sit inside of it.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.840 align:middle line:10%
But my experience actually
walking into a portal

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.150 align:middle line:10%
is really what just threw me
into this whole experience

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.510 align:middle line:10%
of portals and
gateways and trying

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.490 align:middle line:10%
to find your way through
the supernatural realms.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are portals?

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.950 align:middle line:90%
What are gateways?

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.950 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Portals are
metaphysical bridges.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.330 align:middle line:90%
They're tangible.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.840 align:middle line:84%
You go literally from
one space to the next.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.990 align:middle line:84%
Gateways are more of a spiritual
experience, and they mark time.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.880 align:middle line:84%
Gateways like, for instance, the
Lions Gate, that's the big one.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.700 align:middle line:84%
The 8-8, it happens August 8,
and it has something to do with

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.210 align:middle line:90%
the planetary alignment.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.190 align:middle line:90%
But here's the key.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:09.440 align:middle line:84%
Gateways can usually be an
anniversary or a birthday.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.760 align:middle line:90%
It marks a time.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.740 align:middle line:84%
It marks a time for us to
sit down and pay attention.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.040 align:middle line:84%
And really, gateways
actually open portals.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where do portals lead?

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.660 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: That's the key.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.700 align:middle line:90%
No one really knows.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
mean, nobody knows?

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.360 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: My experience
in a portal,

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.920 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea what was going on.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.000 align:middle line:90%
Can I tell you about it?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.083 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell us about it.

00:02:34.083 --> 00:02:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Yeah, it happened at
the SeaTac airport, March 13,

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.640 align:middle line:90%
2019.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.490 align:middle line:84%
I was dropping my son
off to see his father.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.303 align:middle line:84%
He's an adult. He
was visiting his dad.

00:02:43.303 --> 00:02:44.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
in Seattle, right?

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.870 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Yeah, yeah.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And as I left, after
I dropped him off,

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.803 align:middle line:84%
I actually walked with
him into the airport.

00:02:51.803 --> 00:02:53.720 align:middle line:84%
There was something going
on with his luggage,

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.553 align:middle line:90%
and we weren't sure.

00:02:54.553 --> 00:02:57.290 align:middle line:84%
But anyways, normally,
I just drive up

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.620 align:middle line:90%
and drop them off and leave.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.870 align:middle line:84%
But this time I
actually had to park.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.110 align:middle line:84%
As I was coming back,
elevator doors opened,

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.470 align:middle line:84%
and I'm walking through
the parking garage.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.600 align:middle line:84%
And first of all, what looked
like the Super Mario Brothers

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.370 align:middle line:84%
we're getting onto the
elevator as I was getting off

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.840 align:middle line:90%
the elevator, and I laughed.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Is there
a comic con going on?"

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And the taller one who had
the green hat, he just kind of

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.320 align:middle line:84%
took off his hat, and he
looked at me as though--

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was offended, right?

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.180 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: A little bit, yeah.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.620 align:middle line:90%
But here's the thing.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.110 align:middle line:84%
As I left, the entire
parking garage was dusty.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.610 align:middle line:90%
The light was wrong.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.940 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't find
an exit anywhere.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.010 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't find my truck.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.310 align:middle line:84%
I think I had been in
there for about 10 hours.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like you were
in a different place.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.480 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: It was like the
show "Stranger Things."

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.980 align:middle line:90%
They call it The Upside Down.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.300 align:middle line:90%
I just wandered.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.900 align:middle line:84%
I just wandered through
the entire parking area.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.400 align:middle line:90%
And I heard this noise.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.410 align:middle line:84%
There was this noise, like a
very large, clunking, crushing

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.380 align:middle line:90%
sound.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know where
it was coming from,

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.603 align:middle line:84%
and it was really
very frightening.

00:04:08.603 --> 00:04:10.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
stumble out of the portal

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.020 align:middle line:90%
to come back to reality?

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.020 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: That's just it.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.360 align:middle line:90%
All of my guides--

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm a psychic, and as a
medium and a channeler,

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:21.779 align:middle line:84%
I do have people that I
speak to from the other side.

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:24.185 align:middle line:90%
None of that was available.

00:04:24.185 --> 00:04:28.360 align:middle line:84%
It was as though I was
completely not connected.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.630 align:middle line:90%
It was just me.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And as I wandered through
this parking garage, the dust

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.900 align:middle line:90%
and the noise--

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.910 align:middle line:84%
just that one
noise, that was it.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.670 align:middle line:84%
So I finally just had to cover
my heart, my heart space,

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.878 align:middle line:90%
and I asked God for help.

00:04:44.878 --> 00:04:45.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you scared?

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.022 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: I was terrified.

00:04:47.022 --> 00:04:48.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We happen to
have a video of you

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.700 align:middle line:84%
walking through your portal
experience at the SeaTac

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:52.640 align:middle line:90%
Airport.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.685 align:middle line:90%
This is amazing.

00:04:53.685 --> 00:04:56.710 align:middle line:90%


00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:02.030 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: So here I
am, at SeaTac airport.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.460 align:middle line:84%
I came out of an elevator,
and it didn't look like this.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.790 align:middle line:90%
It's a different floor.

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.840 align:middle line:84%
It definitely
wasn't this bright.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.800 align:middle line:84%
I noticed that, as I
walked, the cars began

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.170 align:middle line:90%
getting dustier and dustier.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.930 align:middle line:90%
And it looked like that.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.260 align:middle line:84%
There was no light,
and there was no sound,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:29.200 align:middle line:84%
except for this really odd
thumping and crushing sound.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.200 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't time it because--

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.220 align:middle line:90%
It didn't have these lights.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.620 align:middle line:90%
It did not have these lights.

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.400 align:middle line:84%
That would have been kind of
cool, but there were no lights.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.850 align:middle line:90%
And there was no--

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:42.460 align:middle line:90%
there was nothing.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.273 align:middle line:90%
And none of my usual--

00:05:45.273 --> 00:05:49.310 align:middle line:90%


00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.020 align:middle line:90%
my guides weren't with me.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.110 align:middle line:90%
I was alone.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.830 align:middle line:84%
I never felt more
alone in my life.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.720 align:middle line:90%
And so I literally had to stop.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.960 align:middle line:90%
I was thirsty.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.190 align:middle line:90%
I was tired.

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.496 align:middle line:84%
There were layers
of dust everywhere.

00:06:04.496 --> 00:06:07.800 align:middle line:90%


00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.640 align:middle line:84%
So I closed my eyes and I just
said, please, God, help me.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.660 align:middle line:90%


00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.950 align:middle line:84%
At that moment, behind
my eyes, I saw light.

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:24.510 align:middle line:84%
When I opened my eyes, there
was a car in front of me.

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:28.650 align:middle line:84%
The person behind the wheel was
just going, hey, crazy lady,

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:29.560 align:middle line:90%
get out of the lane.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.060 align:middle line:90%
And I was never so happy.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure they
thought I was insane.

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.730 align:middle line:90%
I was waving to them like, yay!

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.420 align:middle line:90%
And I could see--

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.060 align:middle line:90%
I could see daylight.

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.220 align:middle line:90%
It was absolutely terrifying.

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And by the time I
got out, I was never

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.750 align:middle line:90%
so glad to see this right here.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.080 align:middle line:90%


00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.460 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to get out quickly.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sarah, do you
think initially you

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:59.930 align:middle line:84%
were in the same place
at a different time

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.385 align:middle line:84%
or a different
place permanently?

00:07:02.385 --> 00:07:04.760 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: These are questions
that I've been asking myself

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.120 align:middle line:90%
ever since this happened.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's what really
catapulted me into learning more

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.310 align:middle line:90%
about portals.

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:12.440 align:middle line:84%
This was the first time
that anything like this

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.860 align:middle line:84%
had ever really happened to
me, and so I began interviewing

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.070 align:middle line:90%
a lot of my clients.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:20.840 align:middle line:84%
I put a lot of information out
there asking for other people

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.480 align:middle line:84%
to come forward with
their experiences.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:27.510 align:middle line:84%
This put me in a place of
shock for quite some time.

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:31.680 align:middle line:84%
I had to go through
the was I going crazy?

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.260 align:middle line:90%
Was I losing my mind?

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:37.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In the reenactment, you
seem disturbed just with that.

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:38.520 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Yeah, yeah.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.810 align:middle line:90%
And thank you.

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:45.140 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for noticing that
because even now it's shocking,

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.280 align:middle line:90%
and it was a little traumatic.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And as a trauma
recovery specialist--

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.520 align:middle line:84%
I have my master's degree
in behavioral science.

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And when I have to deal
with these kinds of things,

00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:02.330 align:middle line:84%
which is why I stop, drop, and
roll or center, ground, protect.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:06.750 align:middle line:84%
I had to use that
information for myself

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:08.900 align:middle line:90%
in this paranormal experience.

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:11.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's rule out
some kind of medical quirk.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.118 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Exactly, I had to.

00:08:13.118 --> 00:08:14.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can you do that?

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.245 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: I can, yeah.

00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:16.045 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:08:16.045 --> 00:08:18.822 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And I thought
that I had been--

00:08:18.822 --> 00:08:20.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe a stroke
or something like that.

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:22.370 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:23.370 align:middle line:90%
So you say none of that?

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:23.880 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: None of that.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:24.880 align:middle line:90%
None of that.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:25.680 align:middle line:90%
None of that.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I didn't tell
anybody about the experience.

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:30.720 align:middle line:90%
I didn't tell my family.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.895 align:middle line:90%
I didn't tell anyone.

00:08:31.895 --> 00:08:32.770 align:middle line:90%
I did tell my doctor.

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:33.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why not?

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:36.590 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Well, because here
here's what I know about when

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:40.650 align:middle line:84%
these traumatic experiences
happen for people.

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:42.720 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult
to talk about,

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:47.850 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't seem that
important when you're just

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:49.410 align:middle line:90%
in the retelling of it.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:51.340 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I got lost in
the parking garage.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:52.930 align:middle line:90%
No, I didn't get lost.

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:55.980 align:middle line:84%
I went to a different time
and a different place.

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And thank
God you came back.

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:04.470 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: And that's the key
because I had to find out what

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:07.960 align:middle line:90%
happened on March 13th of 2019.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And evidently-- I have
some notes about that,

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.200 align:middle line:84%
and we can talk a little
bit more about that later.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:18.300 align:middle line:84%
But there was a quantum
computer that had been set back

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.710 align:middle line:90%
a nanosecond in time.

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And so I feel that
those of us who

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:26.850 align:middle line:84%
are doing this scientific
research, the people who

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.150 align:middle line:84%
run CERN, for
example, I think we

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:34.810 align:middle line:84%
have a moral obligation
to take a step back.

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:37.710 align:middle line:84%
Christina Munns,
she's a physicist,

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:42.080 align:middle line:84%
the author of the Unified Field
Theory, and a friend of mine.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:46.870 align:middle line:84%
And even she said that
it was reprehensible what

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:47.810 align:middle line:90%
they were doing.

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:50.530 align:middle line:84%
You can't just go
around punching holes

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:53.140 align:middle line:84%
into the space time
continuum without some kind

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:55.220 align:middle line:90%
of repercussion.

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it conceivable
that there was a Sarah

00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:00.460 align:middle line:84%
Nash through this
portal, but there

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:04.870 align:middle line:84%
was a Sarah Nash in our
current life existence,

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:07.730 align:middle line:84%
and it was happening
simultaneously?

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:09.590 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: I've wondered
about that too.

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:14.630 align:middle line:84%
And so I went into meditation--
and I don't think so.

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:17.170 align:middle line:84%
All things are possible,
but I don't think so,

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:20.680 align:middle line:84%
because I was very aware
of who I was, where I was,

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.570 align:middle line:84%
and what the situation was,
and what was happening.

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:25.930 align:middle line:84%
I felt as though I'd been
wandering in that parking

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:27.170 align:middle line:90%
garage for about 10 hours.

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:28.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
physically feel OK?

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:29.170 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Yes.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't know
if you remember--

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:31.720 align:middle line:90%
you're a little too young--

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.700 align:middle line:84%
"The Twilight Zone"
episodes of the past.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.973 align:middle line:84%
But there was an episode
called "Little Girl Lost."

00:10:37.973 --> 00:10:39.140 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: It sounds familiar.

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:41.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Parents woke
up in bed one night,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.470 align:middle line:84%
and they heard their
daughter going, Mommy, Daddy,

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:45.620 align:middle line:90%
where are you?

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:46.700 align:middle line:90%
Where are you?

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:50.260 align:middle line:84%
So they went into her
bedroom, and she was gone.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:54.550 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't find her, but they
could hear her through the wall.

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:57.320 align:middle line:90%
Mommy, Daddy, I can't find you.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:02.260 align:middle line:84%
She had gone through a
portal into another dimension

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.240 align:middle line:90%
and could not find her way back.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And so "The Twilight Zone"
episode ended up being where

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.600 align:middle line:84%
the father tied a
rope around himself.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.670 align:middle line:90%
The wife held on to it.

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:18.350 align:middle line:84%
He went through the wall
and into the portal,

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:22.820 align:middle line:84%
found her, grabbed her, and
the mother pulled him back,

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:24.850 align:middle line:90%
and she was saved.

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:26.570 align:middle line:90%
Could that have happened to you?

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:31.550 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: [LAUGHS] Only if
somebody knew that I was there.

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:34.200 align:middle line:90%
And that was my biggest worry.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.247 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
people who go missing.

00:11:37.247 --> 00:11:38.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my god.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:38.860 align:middle line:90%
I was just going to tell you.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:40.300 align:middle line:90%
Do you know David Politis?

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:41.550 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: No, I don't know him.

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:43.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: David has
done extensive work

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:47.250 align:middle line:90%
on people missing in parks.

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:49.230 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Oh, right,
from the UFO-- yes.

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:51.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They just disappear.

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:54.960 align:middle line:84%
Little kids may be behind
their parents, giggling.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.950 align:middle line:84%
Two minutes later, the
parent turns around,

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:58.620 align:middle line:90%
and the kid's gone.

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:02.100 align:middle line:84%
No scream, no yelling, it's
not like a mountain lion

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:04.142 align:middle line:90%
came down and grabbed him.

00:12:04.142 --> 00:12:05.610 align:middle line:90%
He's gone.

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:07.318 align:middle line:84%
I think they're falling
through portals--

00:12:07.318 --> 00:12:08.568 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: I think they are too.

00:12:08.568 --> 00:12:10.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --and they can't
find their way back.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.710 align:middle line:90%
You can't see the opening.

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:13.990 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: It's terrifying.

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And so being there on
the other side, the dust,

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:20.222 align:middle line:90%
and it's like, what is time?

00:12:20.222 --> 00:12:21.430 align:middle line:90%
And that was the other thing.

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:23.980 align:middle line:84%
I had to start asking
myself, what is time?

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:28.650 align:middle line:84%
Because I truly felt that
I'd been in this place

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:29.618 align:middle line:90%
for at least 10 hours.

00:12:29.618 --> 00:12:31.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many times
has this happened to you?

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:35.180 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Once, just once, and
I only want it to happen once.

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:36.420 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many people
are experiencing this?

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:39.810 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Many.

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:42.220 align:middle line:90%
I have so many stories.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:45.840 align:middle line:84%
A friend of mine, actually,
a very good friend, he

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.800 align:middle line:84%
came forward after I told
him about my experience.

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And he said that a
very similar thing

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.050 align:middle line:84%
had happened to him at his
neighbor's house in Georgia

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:57.150 align:middle line:90%
when he was 20 years old.

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:59.880 align:middle line:84%
He ended up walking through
a corn field-- not corn,

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry, tomatoes.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And he ended up getting lost
in a tomato patch for hours.

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:06.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Geez.

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:10.810 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember the
story of Rip Van Winkle?

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:13.370 align:middle line:84%
This is during the
American Revolution.

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:18.460 align:middle line:84%
He sat by a tree and drank
himself into a stupor.

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:19.520 align:middle line:90%
He fell asleep.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.920 align:middle line:90%
He was so drunk.

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:27.060 align:middle line:84%
He woke up, and 20 years
had gone by, 20 years.

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:29.280 align:middle line:90%
His whole life had changed.

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.290 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that story.

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Well, when
we look at that story,

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:35.950 align:middle line:84%
we have to look at the
origins of that story.

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And again, Diogenes,
the Greek philosopher,

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:44.100 align:middle line:84%
wrote the first Rip Van Winkle,
if you will, "Epimenides."

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And evidently, he had
fallen asleep for 57 years.

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And he walked into a
cave-- he was a shepherd.

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And he walked into
a cave at Mount Ida.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
that these always seem

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:58.770 align:middle line:90%
to happen around caves too.

00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:00.670 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of caves
involved in that.

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:04.080 align:middle line:84%
And that also made me think
perhaps this parking garage was

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.260 align:middle line:90%
something like a cave too.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:06.843 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
portals do you think

00:14:06.843 --> 00:14:08.170 align:middle line:90%
there could be on the planet?

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:09.000 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: I think it's--

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:09.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unknown?

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.640 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Unknown,
so many, so many.

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:17.790 align:middle line:84%
And well, if we look at what
NASA discovered in 2012,

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:21.120 align:middle line:84%
they discovered what
they call these X spots.

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.658 align:middle line:90%
X marks the spot.

00:14:22.658 --> 00:14:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they're there,
and sometimes they're not.

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:29.440 align:middle line:84%
But they have literally found
wormholes or portals thousands

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:33.220 align:middle line:84%
of miles into our
upper atmosphere that

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.820 align:middle line:84%
appear and disappear, and
particles go into them.

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:39.572 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they open
and close at will?

00:14:39.572 --> 00:14:41.780 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: They're still trying
to figure that one out.

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do you think?

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.740 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: It depends on
what "at will" means.

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:49.930 align:middle line:84%
That would seem that there
would be something behind it

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:51.590 align:middle line:90%
causing that to happen.

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:52.870 align:middle line:90%
And that's the key.

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:57.760 align:middle line:84%
If we could figure out more
about how to open up a portal,

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:01.630 align:middle line:84%
for instance, travel
becomes easier.

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:03.407 align:middle line:84%
Can we think of
the opportunities

00:15:03.407 --> 00:15:04.990 align:middle line:84%
that we could have
to get from point A

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:07.740 align:middle line:84%
to point B in the
blink of an eye?

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:11.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you were able to see
portals throughout this planet,

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:14.870 align:middle line:84%
do you think the place
would-- like these lights,

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:16.850 align:middle line:90%
every little light is a portal.

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:20.010 align:middle line:90%
Would they be that numerous?

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:22.510 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Possibly,
but I don't think so.

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:26.190 align:middle line:84%
I think that it would actually
have to follow some kind of--

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:28.860 align:middle line:84%
based on my
research, there would

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:31.600 align:middle line:84%
have to be some kind
of pattern to it.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:35.650 align:middle line:84%
And so finding the pattern,
that's the key right there.

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:38.070 align:middle line:84%
The difference between
a gateway and a portal

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:41.290 align:middle line:84%
is gateways can often
lead to portals.

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:43.740 align:middle line:84%
So if we have very
specific gateways--

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:47.160 align:middle line:84%
if we think of our pagan
ancestors and how they

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.190 align:middle line:84%
celebrated the seasons
as they come and go--

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:53.580 align:middle line:84%
we have solstice, which is
coming up here very soon,

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:55.060 align:middle line:90%
and the equinoxes.

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:58.200 align:middle line:84%
But there's so many other
times and dates, too,

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.630 align:middle line:84%
that if we began to
pay more attention

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:05.130 align:middle line:84%
to the energy of the people
and the focus of the people,

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.810 align:middle line:90%
it's the power of intention.

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:12.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there an electronic
device that can find portals?

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:14.820 align:middle line:84%
Do we have any kind of
equipment like that?

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:19.200 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Supposedly, there
are, but I'm a little skeptical

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.170 align:middle line:90%
of those.

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:24.070 align:middle line:84%
I think more there are
devices that find energy,

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:26.240 align:middle line:90%
packets of energy, if you will.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.218 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you're
convinced portals exist?

00:16:28.218 --> 00:16:29.510 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: I've been through one.

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:32.690 align:middle line:84%
I can't unknow what
I've experienced.

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:34.727 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they are
different from gateways?

00:16:34.727 --> 00:16:35.560 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Absolutely.

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To me,
they sound similar.

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:38.320 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Right?

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:42.850 align:middle line:84%
If we think of a portal as
an elevator and the gateway,

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:45.880 align:middle line:84%
the sign that points
to the elevator,

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.350 align:middle line:84%
we can separate what
gateways are from portals.

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:50.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've heard the
phrase "monthly gateways."

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.410 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:54.590 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: The monthly gateways,
essentially, every month--

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:58.610 align:middle line:84%
and John Dee was the first
mathematician and philosopher.

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:00.920 align:middle line:84%
He was the astronomer
for Queen Elizabeth.

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:05.650 align:middle line:84%
But he said that all
of God and everything--

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:09.790 align:middle line:84%
you could know God if you knew
science, and, essentially, math

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:12.609 align:middle line:84%
and numbers was the
way to know God.

00:17:12.609 --> 00:17:15.849 align:middle line:84%
So with if we use the
Gregorian calendar,

00:17:15.849 --> 00:17:19.810 align:middle line:84%
we know that the monthly gateway
for January is on the first day.

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:22.250 align:middle line:84%
For February, it would
be the second day,

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:23.690 align:middle line:90%
and so forth and so on.

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:28.600 align:middle line:84%
The Lion's Gate, the 8-8 gate,
is the most powerful and the one

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:33.490 align:middle line:84%
that people talk about
more often because it has

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:38.540 align:middle line:84%
an alignment with,
I believe, Orion.

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:42.680 align:middle line:84%
And so what they call
the spiritual son

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.620 align:middle line:90%
of Sirius or Sirus--

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:47.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How can we use
these dates to our advantage?

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: I believe
that with each month,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.190 align:middle line:90%
and as a former broker--

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:54.155 align:middle line:84%
I used to work for Bank
of America, by the way.

00:17:54.155 --> 00:17:54.955 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, good.

00:17:54.955 --> 00:17:58.920 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: [LAUGHS] I would
follow the patterns.

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And after so many
years, I realized that--

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:05.520 align:middle line:84%
say, for instance,
yesterday was June 6.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:06.690 align:middle line:90%
That was a gateway.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:11.630 align:middle line:84%
But I would get more
done and more effectively

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:15.230 align:middle line:84%
and with a greater and
bigger and more positive

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:18.442 align:middle line:90%
outcome on the monthly gateways.

00:18:18.442 --> 00:18:20.275 align:middle line:84%
I promote those on the
White Light Express--

00:18:20.275 --> 00:18:22.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But how do you know?

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:24.050 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: By experience.

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:25.540 align:middle line:90%
The money talked.

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:27.165 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you put
them on a calendar?

00:18:27.165 --> 00:18:29.340 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Mm-hm.

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:30.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.520 align:middle line:84%
What's the earliest
time that we know of,

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.100 align:middle line:84%
documented, about
portals and gateways,

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:38.500 align:middle line:84%
where humans have talked about
what you have talked about?

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.990 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Well, we could go
back to The Epic of Gilgamesh.

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:42.550 align:middle line:90%
That's 4,000 years ago.

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:44.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened there?

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Well, essentially,
he had to go through a portal

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:51.152 align:middle line:84%
to meet the gods to
start this epic journey.

00:18:51.152 --> 00:18:52.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or a wormhole.

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:54.500 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
similarities here.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:57.730 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Well, I think
portals are wormholes.

00:18:57.730 --> 00:19:01.360 align:middle line:10%
I think that if we
really-- scientifically,

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:05.290 align:middle line:10%
there has got to be a reason
why what happened to me

00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:06.850 align:middle line:10%
at the airport--

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:10.615 align:middle line:10%
whether it was the velocity
of airplanes taking off,

00:19:10.615 --> 00:19:11.740 align:middle line:10%
the specific date--

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:13.550 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: --a fluke?

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:15.120 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: I don't think so.

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:19.770 align:middle line:84%
I wanted it to be, but that's
why I began looking at the--

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:22.650 align:middle line:84%
there has to be
more going on there.

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:25.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But as soon as
you walked into the portal,

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:27.850 align:middle line:90%
you popped out of it again.

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:28.900 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: No.

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:31.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long do you think,
time wise, you were in there?

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:34.210 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: I thought I was in
there for at least 10 hours.

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:36.543 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 10 hours?

00:19:36.543 --> 00:19:37.960 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: That's
what it felt like.

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:43.283 align:middle line:84%
When I looked at my cell phone
in my truck, it was 10 minutes.

00:19:43.283 --> 00:19:44.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nobody texted
you or called you

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:45.590 align:middle line:90%
during that time period?

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:46.923 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: My phone actually died.

00:19:46.923 --> 00:19:48.000 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.373 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I wonder why.

00:19:50.373 --> 00:19:51.290 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Oddly enough.

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:55.150 align:middle line:84%
But paying attention
to the gateways

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:57.910 align:middle line:84%
and following the
monthly seasons

00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:00.070 align:middle line:84%
and following the
numbers, I think

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:03.760 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be able
to imagine, if you will,

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:07.180 align:middle line:84%
laying out where the
portals will meet up

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:08.360 align:middle line:90%
on certain ley lines.

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.470 align:middle line:84%
If we look at Stonehenge,
that's on 14 ley lines.

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:14.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gobekli Tepe, all that.

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:18.070 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: All of that and
so many more, Machu Picchu.

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:20.808 align:middle line:90%
Those are the big ones, though.

00:20:20.808 --> 00:20:23.350 align:middle line:84%
Pretty soon we're going to have
to put SeaTac Airport on that

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:24.150 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:29.310 align:middle line:84%
But sincerely, there's just so
much behind that we don't know,

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:32.340 align:middle line:84%
and there has to be some
science behind it as well.

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
a temple in India

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:36.745 align:middle line:84%
that you believe is
a portal as well.

00:20:36.745 --> 00:20:38.120 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at
a picture of it?

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:38.977 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: 100%.

00:20:38.977 --> 00:20:40.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are we looking at?

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:42.050 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: That is Kopeshwar.

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:43.400 align:middle line:90%
It's a temple in India.

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.040 align:middle line:90%
And that's called the mandapa.

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.840 align:middle line:90%
This is rare here.

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:52.150 align:middle line:84%
The bottom line is, doesn't that
look like a stargate to you?

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:52.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It does.

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:55.880 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Kopeshwar
actually means angry god.

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.370 align:middle line:90%
Vishnu is angry, wrathful God.

00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:02.300 align:middle line:84%
So in order for him
to be calmed down,

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:04.560 align:middle line:90%
he brought Shiva to this place.

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And so I feel that we built
temples and sanctuaries

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:13.940 align:middle line:84%
over places that
have had essentially

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.230 align:middle line:90%
these kinds of experiences.

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:17.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there
common similarities

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:21.740 align:middle line:84%
in the portals, myths, and
stories all around the planet?

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.390 align:middle line:90%
Is there any common denominator?

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:27.590 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Missing time, odd
sounds, but most of all,

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:30.440 align:middle line:84%
the missing time,
that sense of--

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:32.150 align:middle line:84%
and I'm glad that
I didn't walk out,

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:34.040 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't 10
years later too.

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You apparently
have a labyrinth portal

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:37.790 align:middle line:90%
in your back yard.

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:42.620 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at you
wandering through it.

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:46.610 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: This labyrinth
is really about, well,

00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:49.100 align:middle line:84%
happy endings and
happy beginnings.

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:52.280 align:middle line:84%
You pick up a stone, and
you walk to the center,

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:55.310 align:middle line:84%
and you leave it there, and
that's your happy ending.

00:21:55.310 --> 00:22:02.176 align:middle line:84%
You say goodbye to something,
a friend, a lover, an event,

00:22:02.176 --> 00:22:02.976 align:middle line:90%
something.

00:22:02.976 --> 00:22:07.400 align:middle line:90%


00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:11.360 align:middle line:84%
As you walk out, that's
the happy beginning.

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.030 align:middle line:84%
You pick up a stone
that someone has left,

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:24.290 align:middle line:84%
and you carry that out because,
well, without each other,

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:26.570 align:middle line:90%
what good is this place anyways?

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:35.210 align:middle line:84%
But Lia, Rose, and I have spent
quite a bit of time in here.

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:40.910 align:middle line:84%
A labyrinth is a portal, and it
is also a gateway, but mostly

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:42.260 align:middle line:90%
a portal.

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And all the labyrinths
of the world

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:50.340 align:middle line:84%
are connected through this
beautiful labyrinth network.

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:54.140 align:middle line:84%
It is an energy that
appears all over the world.

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you, we've seen
some pretty spectacular things

00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:01.700 align:middle line:90%
here, visions of white reindeer.

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:03.363 align:middle line:90%
People have seen Bigfoot.

00:23:03.363 --> 00:23:08.090 align:middle line:90%


00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:11.333 align:middle line:84%
And one woman went into
labor directly after leaving.

00:23:11.333 --> 00:23:12.500 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember that, Peter?

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.750 align:middle line:90%
>>PETER: I do remember, yes.

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:18.650 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: So that was an
entrance for someone to come

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:20.030 align:middle line:90%
into the world too.

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:22.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Peter's your
husband that we heard?

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:22.880 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Yes.

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It looked like a
crop formation, doesn't it?

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:26.420 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Exactly.

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:27.980 align:middle line:84%
There are two types
of labyrinths,

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:31.050 align:middle line:84%
essentially, that you can
find all over the world.

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And the oldest labyrinth is
at least 12,000 years old,

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.370 align:middle line:90%
if not older.

00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:36.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:39.230 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: And they go back
and forth with regard

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:41.640 align:middle line:84%
to the documentation
and the timelines.

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:44.660 align:middle line:84%
But the labyrinth that
is most commonly known

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.720 align:middle line:84%
is the Cretan labyrinth or
the classical labyrinth,

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:49.260 align:middle line:90%
which looks like a brain.

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And that has shown up
all over the world,

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.860 align:middle line:90%
and it's cross-cultural.

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:59.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, the labyrinth that you
saw in my backyard, that

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:02.480 align:middle line:84%
is considered a
medieval labyrinth.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:05.795 align:middle line:84%
And the first one that
they've been able to find

00:24:05.795 --> 00:24:08.850 align:middle line:84%
is at Chartres
Cathedral in France.

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And so there have been
lots of ideas and theories

00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:17.400 align:middle line:90%
about what the labyrinth does.

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:20.520 align:middle line:84%
But I'll tell you, when I
have walked a labyrinth,

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:24.750 align:middle line:84%
as a medium, I have been
able to take spirits who are,

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:27.270 align:middle line:84%
if you will, trapped
here and help

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:30.940 align:middle line:84%
them move through because
a labyrinth is not a maze.

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:35.460 align:middle line:84%
A labyrinth is-- you don't
get lost in a labyrinth,

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:38.302 align:middle line:90%
and there are no false ends.

00:24:38.302 --> 00:24:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
come back from it.

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.343 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: And you
come back right away,

00:24:41.343 --> 00:24:43.410 align:middle line:84%
and you can see
where you're going.

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:47.730 align:middle line:84%
And so, essentially,
labyrinths are portals, though.

00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:54.030 align:middle line:84%
You can have a really beautiful
and enlightening experience

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:55.390 align:middle line:90%
as you walk a labyrinth.

00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:59.670 align:middle line:84%
They've hooked people up to
EKGs, EEGs, with their brains,

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:04.380 align:middle line:84%
and your right hemisphere
and your left hemisphere

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:06.910 align:middle line:84%
begin crossing as
you go through--

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:08.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're
very activated.

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:10.630 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Absolutely, absolutely.

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:13.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did the ancients
use portals and labyrinths

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:14.693 align:middle line:90%
in their cultures?

00:25:14.693 --> 00:25:16.110 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Absolutely
they did, yes.

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:17.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How so?

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:19.540 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Mostly
for tribal dancing.

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And they felt that, as they
danced through these, well,

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:27.630 align:middle line:84%
spiral paths, if
you will, they would

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:32.100 align:middle line:84%
be able to lead spirits
away into safety

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:36.450 align:middle line:84%
and hide evil and wicked
spirits, if you will,

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:41.400 align:middle line:84%
cause them to become
confused and not follow.

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:45.960 align:middle line:84%
What happens to us when we walk
through these things, anything

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:47.040 align:middle line:90%
physical?

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:49.180 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Yes,
absolutely physical.

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:53.350 align:middle line:84%
But it's more of what happens
to your heart and soul.

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And I have found,
when I began walking

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:59.370 align:middle line:84%
a labyrinth-- let's
say, for example, I'm

00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:01.330 align:middle line:90%
thinking about my grocery list.

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:04.870 align:middle line:84%
By the time I get to the
center, I've become calm.

00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:06.030 align:middle line:90%
My brain is calm.

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:07.050 align:middle line:90%
My mind is calm.

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:08.273 align:middle line:90%
My spirit is calm.

00:26:08.273 --> 00:26:10.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got some
more pictures of labyrinths,

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:14.070 align:middle line:84%
and I want you to explain
what we're looking at.

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:16.740 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: This labyrinth
here is found in Russia,

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:19.350 align:middle line:84%
and it is one of the
oldest labyrinths.

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:23.940 align:middle line:84%
There are over, I think, 14
different labyrinths found

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:25.470 align:middle line:90%
in this one specific area.

00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:26.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is Zayatsky?

00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:31.140 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Yes, and this is
an incredibly old labyrinth.

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:34.830 align:middle line:10%
Now, this labyrinth
here is considered

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:39.270 align:middle line:10%
one of the oldest on earth,
and it's found in India.

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:40.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who made that?

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.000 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Our ancestors.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do you
walk through these?

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:45.550 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: That's a good question.

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:48.630 align:middle line:84%
I wanted something really
amazing and spectacular

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:52.050 align:middle line:84%
to happen to me the first time
I walked a labyrinth because I'd

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:54.240 align:middle line:90%
been reading about them so much.

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:57.220 align:middle line:84%
What I found when I got
to the center was peace.

00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:58.450 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happens.

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:00.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's entailed
to walk through these?

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:05.440 align:middle line:84%
You walk through that pattern
around and around and around?

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.325 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Yes, that's
all there is to it.

00:27:07.325 --> 00:27:09.700 align:middle line:84%
And you would think that it
would be a very simple thing.

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:10.990 align:middle line:90%
It's actually not.

00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And here's the
fascinating thing.

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:16.050 align:middle line:84%
As you walk with
other people, you

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:18.810 align:middle line:84%
begin to understand that
this is the walk of life

00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:23.140 align:middle line:84%
because you can't all be on
the same path at the same time.

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:25.220 align:middle line:90%
But you can cross each other.

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:27.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
labyrinths have you walked?

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.230 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: At least
100, if not more.

00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:30.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:31.920 align:middle line:90%
That many?

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:34.440 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: As a former member
of The Labyrinth Society,

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:38.040 align:middle line:84%
anybody can find a labyrinth
to near them if they go

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:40.290 align:middle line:90%
to labyrinthlocator.com.

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:42.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you feel
energetic afterwards?

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:43.920 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Sometimes.

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:44.950 align:middle line:90%
It depends.

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And labyrinths have their
own personalities too,

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:48.870 align:middle line:90%
as do portals.

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:51.000 align:middle line:84%
Portals have their
own personalities.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm firmly convinced
that there's

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:55.860 align:middle line:84%
got to be the happy
portal and the sad portal

00:27:55.860 --> 00:28:00.870 align:middle line:84%
and then the portal of
terrifying, loud crunching

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:03.360 align:middle line:90%
noises in SeaTac.

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'm glad that I can
actually laugh about it now

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.740 align:middle line:90%
because for a while I couldn't.

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:09.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You took
this seriously.

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:11.100 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: I still do.

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:13.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's a vortex?

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: See now,
vortices, I think,

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:19.760 align:middle line:90%
are what may be fuel portals.

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:21.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they connected?

00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:23.350 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: 100%, I think so.

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And this is how we
have to find how all--

00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:28.600 align:middle line:84%
we have gateways, portals,
and then vortices.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:32.940 align:middle line:84%
And when we say vortex, I can't
help but think of a vacuum.

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:35.050 align:middle line:90%
But what does a vacuum do?

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:38.260 align:middle line:84%
It sucks one thing from one
place and puts it in another.

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And so you have this whirling
apparatus and, hence,

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:42.900 align:middle line:90%
we've got "The Wizard of Oz."

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:47.550 align:middle line:84%
A tornado, this vortex came in
and took Dorothy from one place

00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:48.930 align:middle line:90%
to the next.

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:51.990 align:middle line:84%
We have these
portals and vortices

00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:56.170 align:middle line:84%
and things that have shown
up in our history forever.

00:28:56.170 --> 00:28:58.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the most
famous mythological portal

00:28:58.620 --> 00:28:59.880 align:middle line:90%
that you know of?

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:03.420 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: I would have
to say it's Stonehenge.

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:06.600 align:middle line:84%
People tend to talk about
Stonehenge, even though there

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:08.910 align:middle line:84%
are thousands of
other stone circles

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:12.720 align:middle line:84%
that are bigger and
probably more energetic.

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:15.250 align:middle line:84%
Stonehenge, people
talk about Stonehenge.

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And I know that people have
had experiences there too.

00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:23.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you explain
these things scientifically?

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:24.513 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: That's the key.

00:29:24.513 --> 00:29:25.313 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can't.

00:29:25.313 --> 00:29:26.180 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: You can't.

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:30.810 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that, eventually,
in time, we will be able to.

00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:34.810 align:middle line:84%
I believe that scientists
out there right now know more

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:36.460 align:middle line:84%
than what they're
sharing with us,

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:41.650 align:middle line:84%
especially because of
NASA showing up and saying

00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:46.130 align:middle line:84%
since 2012, they've been
aware of these X spots.

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:48.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a
physics behind this, Sarah?

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:50.920 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Absolutely,
there has to be.

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:53.720 align:middle line:84%
It's beyond quantum
physics, though.

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:56.590 align:middle line:84%
Quantum physics, I
think, is the first step

00:29:56.590 --> 00:30:01.660 align:middle line:84%
into getting to the physics
of these metaphysical bridges,

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:03.100 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:05.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have
skeptics who say, come on,

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:06.920 align:middle line:90%
this is a bunch of malarkey.

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:10.360 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: [LAUGHS]
Everyone, including myself,

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:11.890 align:middle line:90%
until it happened to me.

00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:15.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I'm
here, if you will,

00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:17.770 align:middle line:90%
being something of a missionary.

00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:19.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
deal with the skeptics?

00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:20.800 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: You laugh at them.

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:22.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't care?

00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:25.310 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Well, I think
it's important to listen.

00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:28.420 align:middle line:84%
But if you're
skeptical, ask why.

00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:30.080 align:middle line:90%
Why are you being skeptical?

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.040 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:36.280 align:middle line:84%
Just because of all
the stories behind it?

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:39.320 align:middle line:84%
We look at the stories
like "Alice in Wonderland."

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:44.290 align:middle line:84%
We look at "Wizard of Oz."
we look at "Harry Potter."

00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:47.890 align:middle line:84%
There have been so
many stories out there.

00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:49.850 align:middle line:90%
And it makes for great fiction.

00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:52.610 align:middle line:84%
It truly does because
anything is possible.

00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:54.380 align:middle line:90%
But see, that's just it.

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:57.020 align:middle line:84%
What happened to
me is nonfiction.

00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And it was possible,
and I was terrified.

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:02.530 align:middle line:84%
It literally has to
be one of the worst

00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:03.940 align:middle line:90%
experiences of my life.

00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:05.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:09.820 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: If I can help anyone
avoid that kind of pain--

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What scared
you so much about it?

00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:15.350 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Not being able to
know if I was going to get out.

00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:17.530 align:middle line:90%
It just went on and on and on.

00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:19.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were there
any other cars there?

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:20.425 align:middle line:90%
You were looking for yours.

00:31:20.425 --> 00:31:21.225 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Right.

00:31:21.225 --> 00:31:22.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But were
there any other cars?

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:25.080 align:middle line:84%
Did you see any other people
or anything like that?

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:25.880 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Nothing.

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:27.380 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there
were cars, and they

00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:29.083 align:middle line:90%
were covered in layers of dust.

00:31:29.083 --> 00:31:30.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like they'd
been there forever.

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:31.550 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Yes.

00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:33.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like a nuke
went off or something.

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:34.610 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Exactly.

00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And that actually went
through my mind too.

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:39.110 align:middle line:84%
There were a lot of things
that went through my mind

00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:40.410 align:middle line:90%
during this experience.

00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:43.580 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly,
I'm here now with you,

00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:46.800 align:middle line:84%
and I'm able to share it with
you, which was not easy for me

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:47.600 align:middle line:90%
to do, by the way.

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:49.642 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you walk
through a portal with me?

00:31:49.642 --> 00:31:50.628 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: I would.

00:31:50.628 --> 00:31:51.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can we get back?

00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:55.190 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: [LAUGHS]
That's always the key.

00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:58.320 align:middle line:84%
However, it seems like
everybody does come back,

00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:59.580 align:middle line:90%
so that's the good news.

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:01.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You think?

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:02.980 align:middle line:84%
Those who have not
come back are gone.

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:04.480 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Those are
the missing ones.

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:06.063 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have
hundreds of thousands

00:32:06.063 --> 00:32:09.270 align:middle line:84%
of people disappearing on
this planet every year.

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:11.100 align:middle line:90%
Where in the heck do they go?

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:12.320 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Through portals.

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:13.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something's going on.

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:15.180 align:middle line:84%
Something is
definitely going on.

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:16.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
we looking at here?

00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:19.830 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: That is my
Cosmic Triage deck,

00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:23.580 align:middle line:84%
and that will be
available this August.

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:26.960 align:middle line:84%
But I've been using
this as a portal

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:29.780 align:middle line:84%
to help people get from
point A to point B,

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:32.780 align:middle line:84%
and I'd like to show
you how it works.

00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:34.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
inspired you to do it?

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:38.600 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Well, I have been
reading tarot cards for over 35

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:43.490 align:middle line:84%
years, and this deck actually
helps me set the path

00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:48.920 align:middle line:84%
or basically give me an idea of
where you're at before I even

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:51.130 align:middle line:90%
lay out any of my tarot cards.

00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:58.430 align:middle line:84%
As a Jungian analyst, signs and
symbols and sigils and images

00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:02.220 align:middle line:84%
have always been a very
important part of my work.

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And so when I developed
Cosmic Triage, this deck,

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:08.820 align:middle line:84%
called Spiritus
Mundi, what we have

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:11.080 align:middle line:84%
are red lights, green
lights, and yellow lights.

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:14.010 align:middle line:84%
So basically, if you get a
red light card, you stop.

00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:17.790 align:middle line:84%
Yellow light card, well, you
got to slow down or maybe even

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:18.850 align:middle line:90%
punch it to get through.

00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:20.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who picks
the cards, you or me?

00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:21.580 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: I do.

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:22.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's do it.

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:23.235 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Let's do it.

00:33:23.235 --> 00:33:24.480 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:26.820 align:middle line:84%
I've wanted to do this
with you for a while.

00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:29.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, with the
magic of television,

00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:32.310 align:middle line:84%
we have a table here, and we're
going to do a tarot reading.

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:34.830 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: We're going to start
out using the Cosmic Triage

00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:37.873 align:middle line:84%
Oracle Spiritus Mundi, the one
that I was telling you about

00:33:37.873 --> 00:33:39.790 align:middle line:84%
with the red light, green
light, yellow light.

00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:44.590 align:middle line:84%
So let's go ahead and find out,
and let's just do a general one.

00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:46.750 align:middle line:84%
We're going to find out
how things are going.

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:49.140 align:middle line:84%
And George, since you're
the man of the hour,

00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:52.950 align:middle line:84%
you'd want to hold an idea
or a thought in your mind,

00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:55.060 align:middle line:84%
and we'll just go
ahead and start.

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:57.220 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's really interesting.

00:33:57.220 --> 00:33:59.800 align:middle line:84%
You've got what is
called a yellow light.

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:04.140 align:middle line:84%
This particular card
here is the hawk.

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:06.780 align:middle line:84%
Can you see what it says
at the top over that?

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:08.490 align:middle line:84%
It's the universe
saying, slow down.

00:34:08.490 --> 00:34:11.116 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It says, the falcon.

00:34:11.116 --> 00:34:11.949 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: The falcon?

00:34:11.949 --> 00:34:12.830 align:middle line:90%
Did I call it a hawk?

00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:13.630 align:middle line:90%
It's my own deck.

00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:18.648 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] I think it's because
I saw a hawk earlier today.

00:34:18.648 --> 00:34:20.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
develop these cards?

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:20.860 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: I did.

00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:21.660 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:22.540 align:middle line:90%
I drew them.

00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, I've been
using them for over 10 years.

00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:32.219 align:middle line:84%
But they allow me to have an
idea of how best to approach

00:34:32.219 --> 00:34:36.670 align:middle line:84%
the person that I'm going to be
laying out the tarot cards for.

00:34:36.670 --> 00:34:38.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
cards do you pull?

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:40.179 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Just two of these.

00:34:40.179 --> 00:34:42.949 align:middle line:84%
One is called the crossing card,
and that's the crossing card.

00:34:42.949 --> 00:34:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This one
says, protection.

00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:47.233 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: And I think that has
an awful lot to do with the fact

00:34:47.233 --> 00:34:49.030 align:middle line:84%
that we've been
talking about portals.

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
important for people

00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:54.420 align:middle line:84%
to stay protected, too,
when they go places

00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:57.710 align:middle line:84%
and they do things, just
to be aware and mindful.

00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:59.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how do
you stay protected?

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:01.450 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Well, that's the key.

00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:04.240 align:middle line:84%
That's the mindfulness
part of it.

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:07.765 align:middle line:84%
That's where stop, drop, and
roll with the center, ground,

00:35:07.765 --> 00:35:08.640 align:middle line:90%
and protect comes in.

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:11.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many cards do
you pull for an individual?

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:13.260 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: When I'm doing
a full session, 12.

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:15.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
do a real quick one.

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:18.720 align:middle line:84%
It's you, the situation,
and a possible outcome.

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:23.130 align:middle line:84%
So normally I would spend a
little time shuffling these,

00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:24.790 align:middle line:90%
but we'll go ahead and start.

00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:30.450 align:middle line:84%
The first one is the
Five of Pentacles.

00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:34.892 align:middle line:10%
That represents you, the
person, everyone, the public.

00:35:34.892 --> 00:35:36.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What does that mean?

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:39.820 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: The Five of
Pentacles is about love.

00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:42.550 align:middle line:90%
This is representation of love.

00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:45.400 align:middle line:84%
It's the broken
hearted, if you will.

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:46.990 align:middle line:90%
It represents relationships.

00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:49.890 align:middle line:10%
So I can tell,
essentially, that this

00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:53.910 align:middle line:10%
has a lot to do with moving
around, talking to people,

00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:57.220 align:middle line:10%
and the things that happen to
us through miscommunication.

00:35:57.220 --> 00:36:00.960 align:middle line:10%
Now, the situation
is the Four of Cups,

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:03.490 align:middle line:10%
and that has an awful
lot to do with work.

00:36:03.490 --> 00:36:05.600 align:middle line:90%
So here it is.

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:08.870 align:middle line:90%
The final one is a Major Arcana.

00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:13.125 align:middle line:10%
There are 22 Major Arcana in--

00:36:13.125 --> 00:36:15.450 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It looks
like a mermaid.

00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:17.700 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Isn't it interesting
how tarot decks are very

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:18.130 align:middle line:90%
different?

00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:19.490 align:middle line:90%
There are so many out there.

00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:22.150 align:middle line:84%
The cosmic-- now, this is
like portals and gateways.

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:25.620 align:middle line:84%
The difference between
oracle cards and tarot cards

00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:30.830 align:middle line:84%
are the fact that oracles can be
anything that the designer wants

00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:31.630 align:middle line:90%
them to be.

00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:32.430 align:middle line:90%
They can--

00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:35.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So this is
already pulling on me?

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:36.420 align:middle line:90%
What does this mean?

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:40.830 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: What this means is that
we have a yellow light for this.

00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:43.080 align:middle line:84%
The universe wants
you to move slowly

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:49.510 align:middle line:84%
through the situation, the
outcome, and who you are.

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:52.240 align:middle line:84%
So this is like walking
through a portal, if you will,

00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:53.340 align:middle line:90%
with your mind.

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:55.360 align:middle line:84%
You take a look at
it, you lay it out,

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:57.320 align:middle line:90%
and you get your answers.

00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
portals should do.

00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:01.840 align:middle line:84%
Portals should give us answers,
rather than more questions.

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are these
cards telling you

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:06.175 align:middle line:84%
I'm moving too quickly
in life or what?

00:37:06.175 --> 00:37:07.250 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: It could be.

00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:08.380 align:middle line:90%
It could be.

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:11.070 align:middle line:84%
But it also means
slow down in love.

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:15.160 align:middle line:84%
Pay attention more to those
who you love and who love you.

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:16.832 align:middle line:84%
And that pretty much
goes for everyone.

00:37:16.832 --> 00:37:18.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That
doesn't mean I'm not.

00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:22.140 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: [LAUGHS] No,
it's a suggestion.

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:24.070 align:middle line:84%
It has an awful lot
to do with devotion.

00:37:24.070 --> 00:37:26.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do one more batch.

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:28.880 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Now, let's
do one for the world.

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:33.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The world, all
right, it'll be our last one.

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:34.598 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: How about that?

00:37:34.598 --> 00:37:35.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So tell us what it is.

00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:38.710 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: The universe is saying
everyone needs to slow down.

00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:41.410 align:middle line:84%
This is the second yellow
light card that we've gotten.

00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:44.010 align:middle line:84%
But it's also about
fanciful things.

00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:45.550 align:middle line:90%
This is the fairy bat.

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And I remember when I
created this particular card.

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:51.040 align:middle line:90%
It had an awful lot to do--

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:54.210 align:middle line:84%
and it's no coincidence that
it's actually showing up,

00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:57.660 align:middle line:84%
because we're talking about
fanciful things, things

00:37:57.660 --> 00:38:01.090 align:middle line:84%
that really don't make
any sense to people.

00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And is it a fairy
tale, or is it real?

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:07.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, bats are terrifying,
to some people.

00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:08.130 align:middle line:90%
Some people are--

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:09.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To a lot of people.

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:11.370 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: But if you
have a fairy bat--

00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:13.540 align:middle line:90%
look at his cute little face.

00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:17.470 align:middle line:10%
So essentially, if you can take
the terror out of something--

00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:22.570 align:middle line:10%
and not that you want to
make it common or mundane,

00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:24.520 align:middle line:10%
but, basically,
you just want to be

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:27.880 align:middle line:10%
able to say things
happen all the time.

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And how is the best way that we
can move forward and greet life?

00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:34.355 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So you just pull one?

00:38:34.355 --> 00:38:35.980 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Now we find
the crossing card.

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.660 align:middle line:10%
That's all, just one.

00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:41.875 align:middle line:10%
And that's what oracles do.

00:38:41.875 --> 00:38:43.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you do
readings for people?

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: I do, all the time.

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:46.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do they
get a hold of you?

00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:52.060 align:middle line:84%
>> NASH: Cosmictriage.org
or whitelightexpress.org.

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:54.290 align:middle line:84%
The White Light Express is
definitely the best way.

00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:56.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's your place.

00:38:56.730 --> 00:38:58.200 align:middle line:90%
And what is this, Sarah?

00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:00.240 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: This is chaos.

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:01.080 align:middle line:90%
So basically--

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:03.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is for
the world, chaos?

00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:04.290 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Exactly.

00:39:04.290 --> 00:39:07.110 align:middle line:84%
What crosses this
yellow light, it's

00:39:07.110 --> 00:39:10.050 align:middle line:84%
go slowly because
chaos is coming.

00:39:10.050 --> 00:39:12.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thank you for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:15.450 align:middle line:84%
Take care of yourself,
and watch those portals.

00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:16.950 align:middle line:90%
>> NASH: Absolutely.

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:18.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've never
walked through a portal,

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:20.960 align:middle line:90%
that I know of.

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:23.270 align:middle line:84%
But I guess it
would scare me too,

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:27.960 align:middle line:84%
wandering around for 10 hours,
not knowing where I was.

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:30.620 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
