00:00:05.274 --> 00:00:07.440 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.281 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:09.281 --> 00:00:11.586 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:11.586 --> 00:00:13.470 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.550 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:26.090 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And welcome
back to this edition

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:28.900 align:middle line:90%
of "Beyon Belief."

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:29.900 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.680 align:middle line:10%
As we continue our
discussion about a virus that

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.500 align:middle line:10%
is scaring the living
daylights out of the world.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.060 align:middle line:90%
It's called Ebola.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And our special guest,
infectious disease expert Dr.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.730 align:middle line:84%
Gary Ridenour, who
is wearing a mask

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.900 align:middle line:90%
to prevent getting this virus.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.890 align:middle line:84%
How can you breathe
in that thing, Gary?

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.460 align:middle line:10%
>>GARY RIDENOUR: It
is uncomfortable,

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.160 align:middle line:10%
and it is warm in here.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.442 align:middle line:10%
That's definitely a problem.

00:00:56.442 --> 00:00:57.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've
noticed because I fly

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.890 align:middle line:84%
a lot, a lot of people
on planes, primarily

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.319 align:middle line:84%
people from the Asian nations,
wear masks like that as well.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:08.730 align:middle line:84%
I always used to think they
look a little strange and goofy

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.910 align:middle line:90%
wearing that.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.360 align:middle line:90%
But I guess it's safe, huh?

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:11.942 align:middle line:90%
Does it work?

00:01:11.942 --> 00:01:12.900 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: Well, yeah.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.740 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
get contaminated.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.810 align:middle line:84%
The airplane recycles its
air, and the filter systems

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.520 align:middle line:84%
were taken out way back
when airlines stopped people

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.200 align:middle line:90%
from smoking on board.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.310 align:middle line:84%
So you're getting recycled
air coming through, too,

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.150 align:middle line:84%
so you could pick
it up in the air.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think you would
cause more panic just

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.350 align:middle line:84%
walking through an
airline wearing a mask.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.630 align:middle line:84%
People will try to wonder,
what's wrong with him?

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.490 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: Today that
would be the concern.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.950 align:middle line:84%
I just hope it
doesn't get to the day

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.310 align:middle line:84%
that it's so widely spread that
people even wear a mask just

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.837 align:middle line:84%
to go to the grocery
store-- and gloves.

00:01:50.837 --> 00:01:52.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm going to spare you.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.396 align:middle line:90%
You may take that off, Gary.

00:01:53.396 --> 00:01:54.312 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: Thank you.

00:01:54.312 --> 00:01:57.930 align:middle line:90%


00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:58.630 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean,
does it really work?

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what if you
get one little virus

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.005 align:middle line:90%
that splashes onto this thing?

00:02:06.005 --> 00:02:07.130 align:middle line:90%
Is it going to get through?

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.770 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: Well,
that's the problem.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.120 align:middle line:90%
This is called a NIOSH N95.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.840 align:middle line:90%
You get at hardware stores.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.710 align:middle line:84%
They said that there's another
one called a NIOSH 100.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:24.220 align:middle line:84%
And if you can't get the 100,
then just take another N95

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.860 align:middle line:84%
and glue it on the front and
you double your protection.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.520 align:middle line:84%
The problem is is that if you
get secretions on the mask,

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.670 align:middle line:84%
there's a possibility it'll
come through the mask,

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.569 align:middle line:84%
end up either in your nose or
your mouth, and you're off to--

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:40.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And that's it for you.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.150 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: And they still don't
know if a mask-- these masks

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.900 align:middle line:90%
are any good.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.711 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now this one
was made primarily,

00:02:46.711 --> 00:02:48.960 align:middle line:84%
I think, for like sawdust
and things like that, right?

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.250 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: Right.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.208 align:middle line:90%
And avian flu and that.

00:02:50.208 --> 00:02:56.184 align:middle line:84%
This is certified for
really fine particles.

00:02:56.184 --> 00:02:58.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gary, of course, is
the author of a couple books,

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.070 align:middle line:84%
one "Pandemic," the other
"Bowling for Ebola."

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.670 align:middle line:84%
How did you personally
get involved

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.820 align:middle line:90%
in studying infectious diseases?

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.810 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: Well, we had the
largest leukemia cluster,

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.490 align:middle line:84%
childhood leukemia cluster in
the world a number of years

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:13.260 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.920 align:middle line:84%
And we published about
17 scientific papers

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.140 align:middle line:84%
on the cluster, found out that
it was a mixture of jet fuel

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.144 align:middle line:84%
and tungsten that
caused these infections.

00:03:26.144 --> 00:03:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And while we were
working with it,

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.000 align:middle line:84%
one of the researchers from
the University of Arizona

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.470 align:middle line:84%
goes, you know,
this avian flu is

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.000 align:middle line:90%
getting really hot in Vietnam.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, I've
got some connections,

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:38.570 align:middle line:90%
and you're the doctor.

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:39.700 align:middle line:90%
You're coming.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And you'll train
the people on board

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.490 align:middle line:90%
how to wear these space suits.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to go into
Vietnam and study patients.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And the younger Communists
in the party said, yeah.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.250 align:middle line:84%
We got to the hardcore
and they went, no.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.750 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:59.910 align:middle line:90%
Americans aren't coming.

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.050 align:middle line:90%
So it fell apart.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And so then I kept working
with the avian flu,

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.110 align:middle line:84%
wrote my book "Pandemic"
and sent it to Art Bell.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And Art went, god,
I love this book.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:12.740 align:middle line:90%
I want you on for three hours.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.080 align:middle line:90%
So I started doing that.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And then I continued to start
tracking flus, like the avian

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.940 align:middle line:84%
flu and the swine flu,
self-educated myself

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.440 align:middle line:84%
on all the latest
things on viruses,

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.510 align:middle line:84%
because most doctors when you
start to talk about viruses,

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.530 align:middle line:84%
they start getting
walleyed on you

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.990 align:middle line:84%
and start looking
at the ceiling,

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.230 align:middle line:84%
because they don't know
really much about a virus.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.570 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm trying
to do is, you know,

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.420 align:middle line:84%
educate people at
what a virus is.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.830 align:middle line:84%
We would see, when
I was in training,

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.173 align:middle line:84%
some sort of lung disease
and there was no bacteria

00:04:50.173 --> 00:04:53.780 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't responding
to antibiotics, so we'd go,

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.980 align:middle line:90%
oh, it's a virus.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, today we have
better techniques

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.689 align:middle line:84%
for identifying the
viruses at least.

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:00.980 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What happened to SARS?

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.670 align:middle line:10%
What happened to the avian
flu when the World Health

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.760 align:middle line:10%
Organization kept saying
pandemic, pandemic coming,

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:08.840 align:middle line:10%
watch out.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.900 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: That's a question
answered in two answers.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.560 align:middle line:84%
First answer, they thought it
was going to really break out.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And it was mutating and
its infectious rate kind of

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.240 align:middle line:90%
went down a little bit.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.330 align:middle line:84%
Like in Vietnam, they
killed hundreds of thousands

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.754 align:middle line:84%
of chickens and ducks and
everything that were carriers.

00:05:32.754 --> 00:05:34.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what do
they do, burn them?

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:35.128 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: Yeah.

00:05:35.128 --> 00:05:35.930 align:middle line:90%
They burn them.

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And then China did
the same thing.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.290 align:middle line:84%
And that cut down the
original carriers.

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.740 align:middle line:84%
But in Africa, we don't know who
the carrier is is our problem.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.890 align:middle line:84%
So then also politics
and economics

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.680 align:middle line:84%
got involved, which
was we don't want

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.370 align:middle line:84%
to broadcast that we have the
avian flu or the swine flu

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.380 align:middle line:84%
here because we're
going to lose tourism.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.840 align:middle line:84%
People are going to stop
shipping stuff to us

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.840 align:middle line:90%
and shipping stuff back.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.740 align:middle line:84%
I got a helicopter the
other day from China.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.720 align:middle line:90%
And I'm opening the box up.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm going, I wonder who
sneezed into this box

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.930 align:middle line:84%
before he packed it,
because the virus could

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.510 align:middle line:84%
be right in the
package right now.

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:22.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't know.

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.720 align:middle line:84%
How long will a
virus live like that?

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:30.100 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: The Ebola
is 4 to 10 days.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.360 align:middle line:84%
At temperatures below 50
below zero, indefinitely.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And we had a theft of Ebola
virus yesterday in Guinea.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.700 align:middle line:84%
A lot of blood has to
be taken by taxicab way

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.980 align:middle line:84%
far away and then sometimes
even flown somewhere--

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They took
the blood, right?

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.188 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: Yeah.

00:06:50.188 --> 00:06:52.900 align:middle line:84%
And then the blood has
to be flown somewhere

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.040 align:middle line:84%
where they've got the
laboratory equipment that

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.180 align:middle line:90%
sophisticated to test it.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:01.170 align:middle line:84%
Somebody stopped the taxi
and took all the blood.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:04.250 align:middle line:84%
And they think some
of it had Ebola in it.

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What will
they do with it?

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.490 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: Worst
case scenario is

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:11.150 align:middle line:84%
you could make it into
a biological weapon.

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:17.270 align:middle line:84%
First thing you could do
is take 8 or 10 extremists,

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.970 align:middle line:84%
have them all take a sip of the
Ebola blood, get on a plane,

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:23.590 align:middle line:84%
fly to the United States,
scatter themselves

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:26.340 align:middle line:84%
around the US, and
suddenly, boom.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.060 align:middle line:90%
Chicago's got 15 cases.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.070 align:middle line:90%
Well, what's going on?

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah.

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:31.590 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: Phoenix
has got 15 cases.

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:33.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would they
actually do that?

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:33.840 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: They can do it.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:34.881 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sinister people.

00:07:34.881 --> 00:07:36.700 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: And we'd
be like a dartboard.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:37.340 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:37.881 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:07:37.881 --> 00:07:39.950 align:middle line:84%
But you'd see symptoms
in these people, right?

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:40.270 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: Oh, yeah.

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:40.770 align:middle line:90%
You would.

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it would
scare everybody.

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:47.560 align:middle line:84%
My scenario was that
it's New Year's Eve.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.810 align:middle line:90%
The ball's coming down.

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:51.930 align:middle line:84%
There's 150,000
people on the street.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.480 align:middle line:84%
You're running up
on top of a building

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.290 align:middle line:84%
a machine that
blows confetti out.

00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:00.160 align:middle line:84%
You've got a compressed
tank of water and Ebola.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And you just keep spreading,
spraying the confetti

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:04.850 align:middle line:90%
as it falls down.

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.990 align:middle line:84%
In 10 days, you'll have
4,000 people with Ebola

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:09.470 align:middle line:90%
in New York City.

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.412 align:middle line:84%
In another 10 days,
you may have--

00:08:11.412 --> 00:08:12.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
pretty scary, Gary.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:17.890 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: --15,000 with Ebola,
totally overwhelming the health

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:19.270 align:middle line:90%
care facilities.

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:22.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the
multiplying factor here?

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:24.540 align:middle line:90%
10 becomes what?

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:29.877 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: Well, 10-- it
almost doubles every week.

00:08:29.877 --> 00:08:30.835 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 10 becomes 20.

00:08:30.835 --> 00:08:31.372 align:middle line:90%
20 becomes--

00:08:31.372 --> 00:08:32.080 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: Yeah.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.520 align:middle line:90%
It just doubles every week.

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And the other problem is
that the average patient,

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:43.039 align:middle line:84%
as we said before, puts out
23 billion viruses a day.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:45.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, does it double,
or does it become a multiplier?

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:50.261 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is it 10, 20,
40 or is it 10, 20, 400?

00:08:50.261 --> 00:08:52.260 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: It's hard to
tell because it depends

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.720 align:middle line:84%
on how many cells in your body
are infected that are going

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.440 align:middle line:84%
to blow open and throw
these viruses out.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:02.380 align:middle line:84%
But they estimate
23 billion a day.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And even after you're
cured from Ebola,

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:10.190 align:middle line:84%
men can carry it in the
semen for up to 90 days.

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:12.719 align:middle line:90%
It'll also be in breast milk.

00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:13.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.270 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: And so
it's a nasty little--

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:17.345 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have babies come
down with Ebola, Gary?

00:09:17.345 --> 00:09:18.220 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: Oh, yeah.

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:19.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In those
west African nations?

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.330 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: Babies
have died, and there

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:22.710 align:middle line:90%
are-- and very quickly.

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot of
orphans in these countries

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:28.485 align:middle line:84%
now because their
mothers and fathers

00:09:28.485 --> 00:09:31.660 align:middle line:84%
and aunts and
uncles are all dead.

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:32.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's frightening.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.080 align:middle line:84%
In our previous "Beyond
Belief" program,

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.920 align:middle line:90%
we talked about why West Africa.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.860 align:middle line:90%
Why is it hitting there?

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.750 align:middle line:84%
But we have had cases
here in the United States.

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:45.220 align:middle line:90%
Not a lot, but we have had some.

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.060 align:middle line:90%
A couple people have died.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.250 align:middle line:90%
A couple people have lived.

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:51.840 align:middle line:84%
How are we doing
here to fight Ebola?

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:56.510 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: Well, technically
we have two centers

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:58.250 align:middle line:90%
to take care of Ebola patients.

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:02.920 align:middle line:10%
One is in Nebraska, University
of Nebraska, Dr. Gold.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:07.310 align:middle line:10%
They used their own money
and built a very, very good

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:08.520 align:middle line:10%
facility.

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:15.610 align:middle line:84%
And then in-- next to the
CDC is Emory Hospital.

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And so CDC has got kind
of their own lab at Emory.

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:26.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's costing an average
of $35 million per patient

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:28.170 align:middle line:90%
to treat them right now.

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:29.045 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: $35 million?

00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:29.878 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: Million.

00:10:29.878 --> 00:10:30.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A patient?

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.130 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: Yes,
because you also

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:34.340 align:middle line:84%
have to go and track
down all their contacts

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:35.237 align:middle line:90%
and test all of them.

00:10:35.237 --> 00:10:35.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Geez.

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:40.360 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: And New York City
just asked for $120 million

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.850 align:middle line:90%
to pay off their medical bills.

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:45.631 align:middle line:84%
And interesting thing
is the gentleman--

00:10:45.631 --> 00:10:46.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We can't afford that.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:47.505 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: No.

00:10:47.505 --> 00:10:50.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, and the gentleman that had
Ebola in Dallas, the first one,

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.470 align:middle line:90%
he went to a hospital.

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:54.580 align:middle line:90%
And he was sick and everything.

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:56.920 align:middle line:84%
I think he even mentioned
he was from Ebola.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.499 align:middle line:84%
They gave him antibiotics
and sent him home.

00:10:59.499 --> 00:11:00.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hmm.

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:00.920 align:middle line:90%
That didn't work.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.670 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: Well, you know
why they sent him home?

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:05.060 align:middle line:90%
He didn't have health insurance.

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:07.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I was going to
ask you about that, though.

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:08.910 align:middle line:84%
Even if you did have
health insurance,

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:12.240 align:middle line:84%
do those carriers really
want to pay those kind--

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.070 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: They are
not talking at all

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:16.040 align:middle line:84%
about covering
something like this.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.930 align:middle line:84%
But that gentleman had
no health insurance.

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:19.805 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They probably
have a clause in there

00:11:19.805 --> 00:11:21.840 align:middle line:84%
that says Ebola is not
covered by this policy.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: I would think that
they might be doing that now.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:29.920 align:middle line:84%
The family of the gentleman who
died in Dallas, the hospital's

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.934 align:middle line:84%
already settled out
of court with them.

00:11:31.934 --> 00:11:32.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:32.890 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: Yeah.

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:34.098 align:middle line:90%
They didn't even go to court.

00:11:34.098 --> 00:11:37.810 align:middle line:84%
They just plunked down a cash
amount and said, we're sorry.

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:40.122 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not
their fault, is it?

00:11:40.122 --> 00:11:42.080 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: It was their
fault they let him go.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he came in,
said, I'm from Liberia

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.090 align:middle line:84%
and I've got nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea.

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:48.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
had to accept him?

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:49.770 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: No,
they don't have to.

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:52.180 align:middle line:84%
They gave him an antibiotic
and go, you've got the flu.

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:53.840 align:middle line:90%
Go home.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The flu?

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:59.090 align:middle line:84%
The normal flu kills about
36,000 people a year.

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:02.910 align:middle line:84%
If we would say today on my
radio show or any other media

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:07.330 align:middle line:84%
outlet that 36,000 Americans
died of Ebola last year,

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.690 align:middle line:84%
people would be
panicking in the streets.

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:12.390 align:middle line:84%
How come there's no panic when
we talk about the normal flu

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:13.640 align:middle line:90%
when so many people have died?

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:15.056 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: Well,
that's exactly--

00:12:15.056 --> 00:12:18.530 align:middle line:84%
because the normal flu virus
has been around for so long

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:20.390 align:middle line:90%
that you just take it in stride.

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Osterholm a
couple years ago reviewed

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:31.010 align:middle line:84%
all research on our flu vaccine
and published a 123-page report

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:33.580 align:middle line:84%
showing that in
children it didn't work.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:38.350 align:middle line:84%
In adults it reduces
your symptoms by 30%.

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:40.820 align:middle line:84%
Over the age of 55,
it does nothing.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:44.900 align:middle line:84%
So with that, then
the CDC got together

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:50.780 align:middle line:84%
and by committee voted to put
different kinds of chemicals

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:54.150 align:middle line:84%
into the vaccine for
last year and this year.

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:59.590 align:middle line:84%
The big problem is that they'll
announce 36 million people died

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:02.510 align:middle line:84%
from the flu this year
so you ask the CDC

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:05.560 align:middle line:84%
and you go, well, how
many got the flu shots?

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And they go, we're not
tasked to look at that.

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:13.819 align:middle line:84%
And you're going like, don't you
think that would be important?

00:13:13.819 --> 00:13:14.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You would think.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:15.120 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: Yeah.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.000 align:middle line:90%
You would think so.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.960 align:middle line:90%
They don't look at that.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If I went into
an Ebola-stricken area

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.710 align:middle line:84%
without the mask,
without coverings,

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:27.270 align:middle line:84%
what are the odds of me
coming down with Ebola?

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:32.780 align:middle line:10%
>>RIDENOUR: If you're in one
of the major cities in Liberia,

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:35.920 align:middle line:10%
I'd say 50%, 60%
chance if you didn't

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:39.590 align:middle line:10%
take good care of yourself, if
you didn't wear rubber booties,

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:42.820 align:middle line:10%
if you didn't wash
yourself and so on.

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:46.460 align:middle line:84%
But so much of these
towns are contaminated

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:50.430 align:middle line:84%
that what they should do is
bring in military transport

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:55.260 align:middle line:84%
planes, rig them up with
crop spraying equipment

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.580 align:middle line:84%
and just come through
these towns and just spray

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:00.360 align:middle line:84%
them with chlorine
water and just

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:04.500 align:middle line:84%
get it off all the
stuff on the outside.

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.351 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Chlorine water
will eradicate this.

00:14:06.351 --> 00:14:06.850 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:08.510 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: It will.

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:09.350 align:middle line:90%
Chlorine--

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:10.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The virus is not alive.

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.070 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: It gets into
the virus cell wall,

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:18.220 align:middle line:84%
disrupts it, and allows the
immune system to eat it.

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:19.860 align:middle line:90%
Chlorine's very good.

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:24.810 align:middle line:84%
There are some quacks out there
that are selling combinations

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:25.990 align:middle line:90%
of a bunch of liquids.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And somebody said, one of the
liquids in this fogging machine

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.070 align:middle line:84%
is the active
chemical in Listerine.

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:36.031 align:middle line:90%
I went, well, that's alcohol.

00:14:36.031 --> 00:14:37.530 align:middle line:84%
Alcohol will kill
it too, because it

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:39.130 align:middle line:90%
will dry the cell out.

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And what they do is they
come into your house

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:45.540 align:middle line:84%
and they fog your whole house
with this secret solution.

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And then after the
fog settles, they

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.310 align:middle line:84%
ask you to open up your
windows and dry it off.

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:54.700 align:middle line:84%
Now you've got this secret
solution on everything

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:56.680 align:middle line:90%
and you're Ebola-free.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.125 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With just alcohol?

00:14:58.125 --> 00:14:59.010 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: Yeah.

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And to get it passed by the
government, FDA and that,

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:04.100 align:middle line:90%
is going to take years.

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:04.900 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:08.370 align:middle line:84%
There is, in 1986 there's
a loophole law, though,

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:11.680 align:middle line:84%
that if we got a vaccine
and it looks good,

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:15.470 align:middle line:84%
we can jump around the
three-year testing periods

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:19.150 align:middle line:84%
and put it right out on the
market and let people try it.

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons we're
bringing people back here

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:26.760 align:middle line:84%
is basically guinea pigs
so we can learn more,

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.270 align:middle line:84%
because we're sending
people over there

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:33.047 align:middle line:84%
and we don't really know
exactly what we're dealing with.

00:15:33.047 --> 00:15:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The several
people who've come back

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:39.710 align:middle line:84%
and have been cured, it had not
gone through a higher stage.

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:42.940 align:middle line:84%
The couple people that have
died in this country who

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:45.750 align:middle line:84%
have come here had it
pretty bad, didn't they?

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:46.640 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: They did.

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And there were many,
many days down the road.

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:54.810 align:middle line:84%
The first two that
came back, I really

00:15:54.810 --> 00:16:00.080 align:middle line:84%
think that good
fluid resuscitation

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.680 align:middle line:84%
and good nourishment
and watching them,

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:07.360 align:middle line:84%
they were one of the--
in the 30% group that

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:09.640 align:middle line:90%
was going to survive anyway.

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:14.430 align:middle line:84%
But as we talked about before,
after you survive Ebola,

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:18.080 align:middle line:84%
boy, in Africa, I
mean you're a leper.

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.040 align:middle line:90%
Nobody wants to get near you.

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:23.900 align:middle line:84%
People want to come and
buy your blood in Liberia

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:28.570 align:middle line:84%
to inject people with your blood
so they can give you immunity

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:29.100 align:middle line:90%
to it.

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And the other big
problem is that it

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:35.870 align:middle line:84%
stays in breast milk
they don't know how long.

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And we know for 90 days it
stays in semen in a male.

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:45.750 align:middle line:84%
So a male could be cured,
go out, infect his wife.

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:46.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or whomever.

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:49.417 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: Anyone, yes.

00:16:49.417 --> 00:16:51.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it more dangerous
than the AIDS virus?

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:54.260 align:middle line:90%


00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:55.710 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: No.

00:16:55.710 --> 00:17:00.050 align:middle line:84%
The AIDS-- well, it's
a tough question.

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:03.470 align:middle line:84%
The AIDS virus
dies very rapidly,

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:08.040 align:middle line:84%
so it had to find a medium
where it could be transported

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:11.640 align:middle line:84%
from inside one human
inside the other human.

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:15.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it hit
the gay community.

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:20.569 align:middle line:84%
The Ebola once it gets
going doesn't discriminate

00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:22.569 align:middle line:90%
sexual orientation or anything.

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:24.280 align:middle line:90%
It just hits everybody.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:27.374 align:middle line:84%
So you know, AIDS has
gotten a lot of publicity.

00:17:27.374 --> 00:17:28.540 align:middle line:90%
And once again, here we are.

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:33.470 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at AIDS, and we
don't have a vaccine for AIDS

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:34.440 align:middle line:90%
either.

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:38.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we ban, out there
in these West African nations,

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.730 align:middle line:84%
eating bushmeat
and this bat meat

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:44.720 align:middle line:84%
and stuff like that
where this virus lives?

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.830 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: We could.

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:49.070 align:middle line:84%
The bulk of the
care out there is

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:52.660 align:middle line:84%
being covered by
missionary groups.

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:55.330 align:middle line:84%
Mostly Protestant missionary
groups are doing it.

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And they're putting their life
on the line to go out there.

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:02.480 align:middle line:84%
Like, the 101st Airborne
that's there right now

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.920 align:middle line:84%
have been ordered to have
no contact with the people

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.750 align:middle line:90%
or go into the towns.

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:10.350 align:middle line:84%
So you would have
to have people that

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:13.654 align:middle line:84%
risk their lives to go in
and start educating people.

00:18:13.654 --> 00:18:15.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gary, tell me
about your latest work,

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:18.520 align:middle line:90%
"Bowling for Ebola."

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: That book is because
of the fact that every time

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:26.510 align:middle line:84%
Ebola throws the
ball, it's a strike.

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:28.960 align:middle line:84%
Every time we get
the bowling ball,

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:31.080 align:middle line:84%
we get our finger
stuck in the ball.

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.870 align:middle line:84%
The ball gets thrown
back into the audience.

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:35.440 align:middle line:90%
We throw gutter balls.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.350 align:middle line:84%
We haven't knocked
a pin down yet.

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:39.600 align:middle line:90%
So it seems to be winning.

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.224 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we
even getting close?

00:18:41.224 --> 00:18:43.640 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: I would say the
ball rolls right up to the pin

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:44.300 align:middle line:90%
and stops.

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:46.092 align:middle line:90%
That's about it.

00:18:46.092 --> 00:18:48.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sounds like one
of my bowling pitches.

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:48.758 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: Yeah.

00:18:48.758 --> 00:18:51.110 align:middle line:90%
Me, too.

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot of companies
working on vaccines right now.

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And of course they're getting
good government funding

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.420 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:07.070 align:middle line:84%
And that runs us into Obama,
his $6 billion health care

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:09.270 align:middle line:90%
package for Ebola.

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And of that $6.2 billion,
my god, CDC gets $1 billion.

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:18.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Merry Christmas.

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:19.950 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: Yes.

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:26.050 align:middle line:84%
Homeland Security get $700
million for a Christmas gift.

00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:28.920 align:middle line:84%
The hospitals in the
US will get money

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:32.020 align:middle line:84%
to instruct people on
how to handle Ebola.

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's really a boondoggle,
because a lot of the money

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.570 align:middle line:84%
is just going to be
spent here trying

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:41.240 align:middle line:90%
to protect us from the Ebola.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And so it's kind of like we're
building a great big fort here

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.270 align:middle line:84%
because there's
an attack coming,

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:51.270 align:middle line:84%
where we should be going out
and hitting the attackers

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:53.190 align:middle line:90%
before they get organized.

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:55.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With what's
been happening

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:58.570 align:middle line:84%
in this fight
against Ebola, can we

00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:01.840 align:middle line:84%
win the battle in the
long run, in your opinion?

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:05.620 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: We can, and
it'll take $30, $40 billion.

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:10.290 align:middle line:84%
It will take the participation
of a lot of countries.

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And right now, the UN's put
in, oh, $500 million or so.

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:20.710 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the big what are
called the G20 companies

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:22.860 align:middle line:84%
have donated
practically nothing.

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:24.820 align:middle line:90%
They're not interested.

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:28.840 align:middle line:84%
But if you put a couple
oil wells down there,

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:30.740 align:middle line:90%
interest would pick up.

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:34.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: "Bowling for Ebola."

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:38.900 align:middle line:84%
Once you wrote that, did you
see what was happening worldwide

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.870 align:middle line:84%
and say, hey, I've got to
change a chapter or two?

00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:45.040 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: I'm kind of
stalled right now because Ebola

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:48.210 align:middle line:84%
was all over everything
up to the elections.

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:52.020 align:middle line:84%
When the elections disappeared,
it just dropped right off

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:54.294 align:middle line:84%
the television set like
it's not there anymore.

00:20:54.294 --> 00:20:55.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not the
big story anymore.

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:56.072 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: Yeah.

00:20:56.072 --> 00:20:57.447 align:middle line:84%
Oh, it's not a
big story anymore.

00:20:57.447 --> 00:21:00.280 align:middle line:90%
And so it's still going on.

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And you know, you can go to the
website for the 101st Airborne

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:08.690 align:middle line:84%
and see what they're doing, but
it looks like right now they're

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:13.320 align:middle line:84%
going to put in facilities
to hold 1,700 people.

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:16.830 align:middle line:84%
When you've got 300 or 400
people a day coming in,

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:19.296 align:middle line:84%
1,700 beds is a
drop in the bucket.

00:21:19.296 --> 00:21:21.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, the
scrambling, Gary,

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:25.580 align:middle line:84%
for a vaccine, why wasn't
it done 30 years ago?

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:27.540 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: Well,
30 years ago we

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:30.434 align:middle line:84%
thought it was self-contained
and some little freaky thing.

00:21:30.434 --> 00:21:32.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it wasn't
here so we didn't care.

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:32.805 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: And it wasn't here.

00:21:32.805 --> 00:21:34.030 align:middle line:90%
It was over in Zaire.

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:35.750 align:middle line:90%
And so we're OK.

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing now
is is that this stuff is

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:45.240 align:middle line:84%
way over in-- 99% of the people
listening can't draw you a map

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:48.660 align:middle line:84%
and show your where
Liberia is at.

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:55.320 align:middle line:84%
The problem is is that Liberia,
if you go head down country

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:59.560 align:middle line:84%
to country, there
are 15 countries that

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:02.240 align:middle line:90%
can get infected with Ebola.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And the World Bank
just said that this

00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:09.436 align:middle line:84%
is going to have significant
impacts on the world economy.

00:22:09.436 --> 00:22:10.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You think it will?

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:12.810 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: Well, yeah,
because of the amount of money

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:17.040 align:middle line:84%
they're going to have to shell
in there to get it going.

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.495 align:middle line:84%
The lack of food, you're going
to have to get them food.

00:22:19.495 --> 00:22:21.120 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have
to get them water.

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.540 align:middle line:84%
You've got to rebuild
their power plants.

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:28.640 align:middle line:84%
And it interrupts international
trade in those areas.

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And of course if it starts
popping up in other countries,

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:35.830 align:middle line:84%
you and I talked
about this before,

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:38.354 align:middle line:84%
is that it's one
plane flight away.

00:22:38.354 --> 00:22:40.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was it a mistake
letting these people

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:44.190 align:middle line:84%
who had Ebola into
the United States?

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:45.540 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: That's 50-50.

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:48.070 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it was a mistake
because of the chance

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:51.320 align:middle line:84%
that we know in Liberia
and the other countries

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:54.840 align:middle line:84%
so many people
have been infected.

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:57.720 align:middle line:84%
Health care workers have
been infected and died.

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:01.210 align:middle line:90%
So that is very dangerous.

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:04.070 align:middle line:84%
There's only one plane
in the world that

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:07.350 align:middle line:84%
is equipped to carry
an Ebola patient.

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:08.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: One plane?

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:09.160 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: One plane.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And the patients that
have been flown home

00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:18.470 align:middle line:84%
have come in just private
jets, so contamination could--

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:19.692 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What does that cost?

00:23:19.692 --> 00:23:20.358 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: Huh?

00:23:20.358 --> 00:23:23.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does that cost,
to fly somebody somewhere?

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:27.154 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: $8,000
to $10,000 at least.

00:23:27.154 --> 00:23:30.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's about $1,700 an
hour, somewhere in there,

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:32.060 align:middle line:90%
for a commercial jet.

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:34.240 align:middle line:90%
And so there's a lot of money.

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And you're taking
care of these people.

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:39.136 align:middle line:84%
And basically what
they're doing is

00:23:39.136 --> 00:23:41.880 align:middle line:90%
is they're getting fresh virus.

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:46.170 align:middle line:84%
They're getting ideas on how
to treat the thing, which

00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:48.420 align:middle line:90%
is massive volumes of fluids.

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
some of these people

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:57.360 align:middle line:84%
have a really bad
form of the Ebola,

00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.310 align:middle line:84%
and no matter what
you do, it's going

00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:01.326 align:middle line:84%
to overwhelm everything
and kill you.

00:24:01.326 --> 00:24:03.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gary, I'm
concerned about this theft

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.210 align:middle line:84%
of the Ebola-tainted
blood, which

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:10.340 align:middle line:84%
you said could be used as some
kind of biological weapon.

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:12.180 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: Yep.

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:14.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would a
sophisticated terrorist who

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:17.030 align:middle line:84%
understands chemistry
and biologicals,

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:19.280 align:middle line:84%
would they be able to
do something with this?

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:23.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how sophisticated
do you have to be?

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:26.950 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: Well, with this,
you've already got the virus,

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:29.950 align:middle line:84%
and so you don't have
to build a virus.

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:31.500 align:middle line:90%
You've got the virus.

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:37.650 align:middle line:84%
So you get monkeys or
other test animals,

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:39.630 align:middle line:90%
put the virus into the animal.

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:43.090 align:middle line:84%
When the animal starts to
show signs of getting sick,

00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:45.080 align:middle line:84%
then you take his
blood out and put it

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.160 align:middle line:90%
into the next couple animals.

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And then what
you're doing, you're

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.080 align:middle line:84%
making it more and
more infectious.

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And when it only takes
a small amount of blood,

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:59.380 align:middle line:84%
the guy up on top
of the building

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:04.170 align:middle line:84%
with the confetti machine, he
may need only 10 CCs of blood

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:06.019 align:middle line:84%
to be able to knock
down 4,000 people.

00:25:06.019 --> 00:25:07.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And your goal is what?

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:09.656 align:middle line:84%
These 4,000 people
to breathe it?

00:25:09.656 --> 00:25:11.280 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: Well, it
would land on you.

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.520 align:middle line:90%
The confetti would land on you.

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:18.150 align:middle line:84%
It would dry or you'd go--
and then you go, oh, it's wet.

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:20.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If an Ebola
virus landed on you, one,

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:21.970 align:middle line:90%
you don't know it.

00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:24.600 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, what if it's
just right here on my skin?

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:26.290 align:middle line:90%
Is that going to enter my body?

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:27.430 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: No.

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:31.040 align:middle line:84%
Skin, it's going to look for
a skin break to get into.

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.490 align:middle line:84%
Skin's a good
protective barrier.

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:32.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:33.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's got to get through your
mouth or something like that.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:34.108 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: Yeah.

00:25:34.108 --> 00:25:36.420 align:middle line:84%
Mouth, or you've got to cut
on your hand or something

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:37.140 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:38.940 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time,
it's hand to mouth,

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:41.110 align:middle line:90%
where you get your hand in it.

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And then sooner or later
you eat or do this.

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's into the
mouth and away it goes.

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you more
concerned about Ebola

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:51.910 align:middle line:84%
or are you more concerned
about flesh-eating bacteria,

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:54.420 align:middle line:84%
for example, that
people contract when

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:56.222 align:middle line:90%
they're in a lake, for example?

00:25:56.222 --> 00:25:56.930 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: Yeah.

00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:58.490 align:middle line:90%
I've seen flesh-eating bacteria.

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:00.440 align:middle line:90%
It's usually streptococcus.

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And if we can jump
on it fast enough

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:06.830 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of antibiotics,
sometimes there's

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:11.740 align:middle line:84%
a lot of damage done, but
these people, most of them

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:12.876 align:middle line:90%
do survive from it.

00:26:12.876 --> 00:26:14.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
know the difference

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:17.890 align:middle line:84%
between Ebola and
the common flu?

00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:19.280 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR:
Interesting question.

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:22.320 align:middle line:84%
About a month ago,
they announced

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:26.040 align:middle line:84%
that there were 5,000
people showed up

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:28.780 align:middle line:84%
in emergency rooms
in the United States

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:31.205 align:middle line:84%
because they thought
they had Ebola.

00:26:31.205 --> 00:26:31.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 5,000?

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:32.930 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: 5,000 cases.

00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:33.971 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A lot of people.

00:26:33.971 --> 00:26:36.667 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: And as you
talk about it more,

00:26:36.667 --> 00:26:38.000 align:middle line:90%
you're going to get more people.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to get the
news out and say, look,

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.380 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be
throwing up blood.

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:44.590 align:middle line:84%
You'll have blood
coming out of your eyes.

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:48.500 align:middle line:84%
You'll have 20 loose
bowel movements per day.

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:51.700 align:middle line:84%
You won't be able to
walk you'll be so sick.

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:52.870 align:middle line:90%
Then come on in.

00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:54.766 align:middle line:84%
And you run 102 or 103
degree temperature.

00:26:54.766 --> 00:26:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You'll feel
like you're dying.

00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:56.920 align:middle line:90%
And you are.

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: And you are dying,
whereas the flu you might

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:02.130 align:middle line:84%
throw up, have a little bit
of diarrhea, and feel crappy.

00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And then you think
back and go, OK,

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:06.800 align:middle line:90%
who was I near that had Ebola?

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.160 align:middle line:90%
Nobody.

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.010 align:middle line:84%
I live out in Kansas
City, let's say.

00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:15.440 align:middle line:84%
The chances that Ebola's
bouncing around there is low.

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:18.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you do with the
body after the person has died?

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:19.790 align:middle line:90%
Do you burn it?

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:20.290 align:middle line:90%
Cremate it?

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:21.248 align:middle line:90%
What do you do with it?

00:27:21.248 --> 00:27:23.310 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: Cremation
is the best way.

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:29.000 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, the burial
habits in these countries

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.570 align:middle line:84%
is to take the body and undress
it and then wash it down

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:40.230 align:middle line:84%
by hand, no gloves, wash it
down and prepare it and dress

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:42.800 align:middle line:90%
it and get it ready for burial.

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:46.520 align:middle line:84%
So everybody that's working
on the body gets contaminated.

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:48.860 align:middle line:90%
And they're buried.

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:51.380 align:middle line:84%
A lot of places now,
because of the number

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:55.520 align:middle line:84%
of people dying per day,
they're cremating them

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:58.420 align:middle line:84%
even though it's against
the religious beliefs

00:27:58.420 --> 00:27:59.550 align:middle line:90%
of the people.

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:01.310 align:middle line:84%
They just want to
cremate the bodies just

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:03.550 align:middle line:84%
to get them out of
there completely.

00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:06.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As an infectious
disease expert,

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:10.491 align:middle line:84%
are you concerned about
coming down with Ebola?

00:28:10.491 --> 00:28:11.490 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: No, I'm not.

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:14.190 align:middle line:90%


00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:16.120 align:middle line:10%
I'm really safe with
everything I do.

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:19.530 align:middle line:10%
I mean, when I-- at the airport,
if I go to the men's room,

00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:21.520 align:middle line:10%
I put my hand up
high on the door,

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.680 align:middle line:10%
because everybody else hit
the bottom of the door.

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:25.471 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or you take
a tissue or something.

00:28:25.471 --> 00:28:27.920 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: No, I just put
my-- oh, I'm not quite Monk.

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:29.220 align:middle line:90%
I put my hands in there.

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:30.650 align:middle line:90%
I wash my hands.

00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest thing is
just good safety stuff.

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:37.870 align:middle line:84%
Wash your hands a
couple times a day.

00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:43.800 align:middle line:84%
And just stay away from anybody
that's coming out of Liberia.

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That would be nice.

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:47.690 align:middle line:84%
How many people don't
realize that there

00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:51.090 align:middle line:84%
are germs on an
escalator railing,

00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:53.350 align:middle line:90%
on the gas pump that you use?

00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:54.610 align:middle line:90%
They're everywhere.

00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:58.130 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: There are
more bacteria in our body

00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:02.570 align:middle line:84%
right now than there are
human cells in our body.

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:04.680 align:middle line:90%
But they aid in digestion.

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:07.230 align:middle line:84%
And they have all kinds
of other jobs to do.

00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:11.470 align:middle line:84%
I tell my pediatric patients,
I go, when you sneeze,

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:14.740 align:middle line:84%
I want you to do the
vampire sneeze and go--

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:15.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:18.370 align:middle line:84%
I've got a producer who shakes
hands with his fists, right?

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:18.670 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: Yeah.

00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:18.880 align:middle line:90%
That's another thing.

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They won't do this.

00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:21.120 align:middle line:90%
He does that.

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:24.137 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: And of course,
my god, handling money.

00:29:24.137 --> 00:29:24.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my gosh.

00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:25.695 align:middle line:90%
Money's everywhere.

00:29:25.695 --> 00:29:26.030 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: Yeah.

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:27.820 align:middle line:84%
Money's everyone, and
it's awfully dirty.

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:28.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unbelievable.

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:29.800 align:middle line:84%
Gary, thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:30.760 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: Thank you.

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:31.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So all right.

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:33.790 align:middle line:84%
You look at this mask,
and you say, hey,

00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:37.070 align:middle line:84%
can this prevent some
infectious disease?

00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:39.000 align:middle line:90%
Can this prevent Ebola?

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:39.879 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:29:39.879 --> 00:29:40.420 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:41.170 align:middle line:90%
It's up to you.

00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:43.380 align:middle line:84%
You have to decide if
you want to walk around

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:45.940 align:middle line:90%
with something like this.

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:48.310 align:middle line:10%
Anyway, thanks for
watching "Beyond Belief,"

00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:52.300 align:middle line:10%
and I hope we educated you
just a little about Ebola.

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:53.740 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:55.920 align:middle line:10%
See you on our next edition.

00:29:55.920 --> 00:30:11.634 align:middle line:90%
