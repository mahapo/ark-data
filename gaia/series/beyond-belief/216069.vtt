00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:21.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to Beyond Belief.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.430 align:middle line:84%
We've got an amazing
program for you.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.690 align:middle line:10%
Ryan S. Wood is with us,
a leading UFO researcher,

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.110 align:middle line:10%
focused on crash retrievals
and the Majestic 12 documents.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, he's the author
of Majic Eyes Only,

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.340 align:middle line:84%
Earth's Encounters with
Extraterrestrial Technology,

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.800 align:middle line:84%
and developed The UFO Decks,
an AI-powered platform for UFO

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.550 align:middle line:90%
research and disclosure.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.320 align:middle line:90%
Ryan, you're one of a kind.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.685 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the program.

00:00:47.685 --> 00:00:48.180 align:middle line:90%
>>RYAN S. WOOD: Thanks, George.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.888 align:middle line:84%
It's great to be here,
and happy to share

00:00:49.888 --> 00:00:51.810 align:middle line:90%
my insights with the audience.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.643 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And our
condolences to your father.

00:00:53.643 --> 00:00:54.643 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Well, thank you.

00:00:54.643 --> 00:00:55.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was the best.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Yeah, he was 96 and
spent 40 years in ufology,

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.820 align:middle line:84%
working on the Majestic
documents, along with me,

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.812 align:middle line:90%
and their authentication.

00:01:05.812 --> 00:01:07.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of
us are here today

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.510 align:middle line:84%
because of the work of
your father, by the way.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.310 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Thank you.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.540 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, I mean, he,
long ago, recognized

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.870 align:middle line:10%
the importance of
these leaked documents,

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.500 align:middle line:10%
and trying to authenticate them.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And a few years ago,
we lost another great ufologist,

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.990 align:middle line:84%
Stanton Friedman,
who you met at, what?

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.070 align:middle line:90%
15 years old?

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Yeah, I'd say
that's about right, 15.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.850 align:middle line:10%
He was working for my father,
at Douglas Aircraft Company,

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.220 align:middle line:10%
on gravity control, not
that he had any ET craft,

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.290 align:middle line:10%
but they were doing fundamental
physics research on,

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.070 align:middle line:10%
how do you change
the speed of light?

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And what's the details
of understanding

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.420 align:middle line:90%
the nature of gravity?

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.680 align:middle line:90%
So they did experiments.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.610 align:middle line:90%
They did theory.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.290 align:middle line:84%
They even did a regression
hypnosis of abductees and things

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.090 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.260 align:middle line:84%
So they had a broad
brush on the phenomenon

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.520 align:middle line:84%
and how to understand
the nature of gravity.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And Stan was working
for my father

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.640 align:middle line:90%
at Douglas Aircraft Company.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.370 align:middle line:90%
And I met him at dinner.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.449 align:middle line:84%
So that was my early
indoctrination or exposure

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:16.635 align:middle line:84%
to ufology and the
physics of UFOs.

00:02:16.635 --> 00:02:18.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind
of void is there

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.030 align:middle line:84%
with the loss of people
like your father and Stanton

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.910 align:middle line:90%
Friedman?

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.000 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well,
there's a huge void.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.960 align:middle line:84%
As going through all the
files that my father had,

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.490 align:middle line:84%
23 boxes in the
garage and so forth,

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.030 align:middle line:84%
you just get a
fresh understanding

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:41.440 align:middle line:84%
of the depth of focus
and understanding

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.740 align:middle line:84%
and partnerships and
sophistications that was

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.730 align:middle line:90%
going on, that you had no idea.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm sure Stan
was the same way.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.080 align:middle line:84%
The archivists, going through
Stan's library in Canada,

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.140 align:middle line:84%
are probably blown away
at all these relationships

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.340 align:middle line:84%
and understandings
that he had, that

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.620 align:middle line:90%
weren't obvious to the public.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Majestic
12 documents,

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.480 align:middle line:84%
tell us what they were and
how they got discovered.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.570 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, the
first Majestic document

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.410 align:middle line:84%
was in 1984, with a leak of
undeveloped film to Jaime

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.130 align:middle line:84%
Shandera, an LA producer,
which is called The Eisenhower

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.070 align:middle line:90%
Briefing Document.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And Stan Friedman
did a lot of research

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.670 align:middle line:84%
and wrote a book,
Top Secret/Majic,

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.550 align:middle line:84%
about that document
and its authentication

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.160 align:middle line:84%
and the whole conversation
of ufology and documents.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.490 align:middle line:84%
But in general, the big brush
is that there's some 3,500 pages

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.410 align:middle line:84%
of UFO or Majestic documents,
spanning from top-secret code

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.480 align:middle line:84%
word to top secret to secret to
confidential to some stuff out

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.610 align:middle line:90%
of people's file drawers.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.500 align:middle line:90%


00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:58.090 align:middle line:84%
And it spans some 19 years of
leaks, from in 1984 to 1999.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.160 align:middle line:84%
So there's a huge
trove of knowledge.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
unusual part about it.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And then the next major event
happened in the Majestic

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.149 align:middle line:84%
documents in 1994, when
undeveloped Tri-X film

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:23.190 align:middle line:84%
was delivered to Don
Berliner, a famous Aviation

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.910 align:middle line:90%
Week and Space reporter.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:31.650 align:middle line:84%
And that film turned out to
be the Special Operations

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.230 align:middle line:84%
Manual, Extraterrestrial
Entities, Technology, Recovery,

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.080 align:middle line:90%
and Disposal.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And that is the most damning
and the most compelling

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.830 align:middle line:84%
and the most authentic
leaked Majestic document.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
you and your father

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.490 align:middle line:90%
authenticate these documents?

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.630 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: There's a lot
of different approaches.

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.970 align:middle line:84%
Some are films, some
are photocopies,

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.540 align:middle line:84%
some are original, original
onionskin, original inks

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.380 align:middle line:84%
and stamps and pencil
write marks, and things

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.890 align:middle line:90%
you can do forensic analysis.

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:06.220 align:middle line:84%
So you can look at the
forensics, naturally.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.810 align:middle line:84%
You can look at the provenance
of where things come from.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And you can look at
things like entomology,

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.010 align:middle line:84%
the word usage, and
how that's done,

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.350 align:middle line:84%
or do historical research on the
names and dates and time frames,

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.560 align:middle line:84%
and try to find supporting,
authentic material

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.840 align:middle line:84%
from the National
Archives or the FBI

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:35.090 align:middle line:84%
files or other credible sources,
to bolster the authenticity.

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.120 align:middle line:84%
But in some cases,
you can't do anything

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.950 align:middle line:84%
because there's
nothing to check,

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.450 align:middle line:84%
like the Aquarius,
documents, for example.

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ryan, there are
several challenges to ufology.

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.000 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Yeah, after a
long time in this field,

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.310 align:middle line:90%
there's three big challenges.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.060 align:middle line:90%
So one is credibility.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.330 align:middle line:84%
Try to improve the
credibility of the field.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:57.610 align:middle line:90%
Is it mainstream?

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:58.410 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not.

00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:59.463 align:middle line:90%
It's still marginalized.

00:05:59.463 --> 00:06:00.630 align:middle line:90%
Is it in The New York Times?

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.970 align:middle line:84%
It is a part of the daily
conversation of life.

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:04.400 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.430 align:middle line:84%
Despite all the hard
work of you and Coast

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.500 align:middle line:84%
to Coast and Beyond
Belief and so forth,

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.830 align:middle line:84%
that's number one,
improving the credibility.

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And the second
thing is leadership.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, who's the
CEO of ufology?

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.600 align:middle line:84%
It's a loose-knit
organization of people,

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.630 align:middle line:90%
trying to do their best.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And everybody tries to
accomplish something positive,

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.620 align:middle line:84%
and push the needle
forward or push

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.510 align:middle line:84%
the ball down the court or any
analogy you want to use there.

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:34.050 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, the
elephant in the room is money.

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:35.837 align:middle line:90%
It's funding.

00:06:35.837 --> 00:06:38.420 align:middle line:84%
There's maybe a couple million
dollars spent in all of ufology

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:39.710 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.570 align:middle line:90%
And it needs $15 million.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:49.370 align:middle line:84%
I've outlined $15 million
at the last UFON conference

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:50.970 align:middle line:90%
of specific projects.

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.680 align:middle line:84%
If I was the CEO, I
would do a research

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.660 align:middle line:90%
on this and this and this.

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the number-one
thing that the "bad guys"

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:07.750 align:middle line:84%
want to try to ensure that the
community is underfunded and is

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.680 align:middle line:84%
not accomplishing more,
and digging deeper,

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.782 align:middle line:90%
and exposing the truth.

00:07:13.782 --> 00:07:14.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who's winning?

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.240 align:middle line:90%
The good guys or the bad guys?

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: It's hard to tell.

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.630 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm rooting
for the good guys.

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:25.030 align:middle line:84%
That's us, trying to
make a difference,

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.310 align:middle line:84%
and push the ball
down the court,

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:33.310 align:middle line:84%
and try to accelerate a better
understanding for the public,

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:39.590 align:middle line:84%
and to extract the technology
of UFOs in gravity control,

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:45.040 align:middle line:84%
which is what is holding back
planet Earth's trajectory

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.560 align:middle line:84%
to become the "cosmic
kindergarten,"

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.540 align:middle line:90%
as Stan Friedman used to say.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:52.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And his gray basket.

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:53.930 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yes, his gray basket.

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've got a book
out called Majic Eyes Only.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.400 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell me about that.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:04.420 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, Majic Eyes Only,
I wrote it first in 2005,

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:07.160 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the UFO
crash retrieval conferences,

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:11.410 align:middle line:84%
what ran from 2003
to 2009 or so.

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And it had 74 crashes from
around the world in 2005.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And then I republished
it about a year ago.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And it has 104 crashes
from around the world.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.510 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And I suspect the real number
is probably close to 200,

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:30.790 align:middle line:84%
because we underreport
China and Russia and Africa

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:34.705 align:middle line:90%
and many other locations.

00:08:34.705 --> 00:08:38.450 align:middle line:84%
So not all of them
are real in my mind,

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:42.200 align:middle line:84%
but it only takes
one to be, oh, yeah,

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:46.220 align:middle line:84%
we really have crash retrievals
and alien bodies and so forth.

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:49.190 align:middle line:84%
So that's what
the book is about.

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's referenced
and footnoted.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And every case has an
authenticity rating,

00:08:55.580 --> 00:09:00.690 align:middle line:90%
from 0 to 5.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:03.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would talk with
Linda Moulton Howe a lot, Ryan,

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:04.870 align:middle line:90%
about crop formations.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:05.670 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Mhm.

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:09.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And she'd say, I
can't get all of them solved.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.300 align:middle line:90%
And I said, just solve one.

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.810 align:middle line:90%
That's all you need.

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And then all of the
others fall into place.

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:20.600 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Yep, that's
the exact same analogy

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.950 align:middle line:84%
that I'm using for
crash retrievals,

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:29.820 align:middle line:84%
is that you just need one good
one to make a big difference,

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:33.470 align:middle line:84%
although Roswell's
been pretty compelling

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:37.050 align:middle line:90%
in the genre for a long time.

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:38.660 align:middle line:90%
But we need another one.

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.420 align:middle line:90%
We need a more modern one.

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:44.720 align:middle line:90%
My cases basically stop in 2008.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And we need a current, fresh
one, that's highly credible.

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:50.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your book
looks at the 1941 Cape

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:52.950 align:middle line:90%
Girardeau, Missouri crash.

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:54.250 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that.

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:57.630 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Yeah, I'm not
the primary investigator

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:01.440 align:middle line:84%
on all these crashes, but
that particular case, I am.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:05.250 align:middle line:84%
So one of the leaked
Majestic documents

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:07.560 align:middle line:84%
has a reference to
the '41 Missouri

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:12.690 align:middle line:84%
crash and the testimony, a
deathbed-confessed testimony

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:16.390 align:middle line:84%
of Floy Huffman, the
wife of Reverend Huffman,

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:21.540 align:middle line:84%
which was the Baptist minister
in Cape Girardeau, Missouri.

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:29.940 align:middle line:84%
He was called out to provide
blessings for three dead aliens.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And the police and fire
and everybody was there.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:36.420 align:middle line:84%
And it was all the
buzz of the town

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.520 align:middle line:84%
of Cape Girardeau,
Missouri, where

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:43.158 align:middle line:90%
Rush Limbaugh was a major--

00:10:43.158 --> 00:10:44.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's from there.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.130 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah, he's from there.

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:46.172 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: God rest his soul.

00:10:46.172 --> 00:10:46.972 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:10:46.972 --> 00:10:50.810 align:middle line:90%
And his son grew up there.

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And when his son had a
his radio show in Florida,

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:01.240 align:middle line:84%
somebody called in and said,
what about this Cape Girardeau

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.210 align:middle line:90%
UFO crash?

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And he basically said, yeah,
there's a lot more to the story

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.530 align:middle line:84%
than meets the eye, but I'm not
going to talk about it on air.

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:14.630 align:middle line:84%
So it was a low-level
endorsement of its reality.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:17.960 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot of evidence
about that particular case,

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:23.080 align:middle line:84%
from aerial footage
to fire logs to--

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.180 align:middle line:90%
I started this.

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And Paul Blake Smith wrote
a book called Missouri 41.

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:33.920 align:middle line:84%
And he continued on with
the research, as well.

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What exactly happened
with that crash, Ryan?

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:40.510 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Oh, I suspect that it's
typical of all the crashes,

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:43.180 align:middle line:84%
where the military comes,
and they sweep it all up,

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:44.920 align:middle line:90%
and they cart it all off.

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:50.060 align:middle line:84%
And it gets taken
to Area 51, S4,

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:54.230 align:middle line:84%
or a Wright-Patterson
BLUE lab, or some other--

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:56.180 align:middle line:84%
more likely,
Wright-Patterson BLUE

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:58.610 align:middle line:84%
lab, in 441, or
Wright-Patterson,

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:00.680 align:middle line:84%
or some other secure
location, to start

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:03.835 align:middle line:90%
analyzing the technology.

00:12:03.835 --> 00:12:05.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've
always wondered how

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:08.600 align:middle line:84%
they have incredible
technology to get here,

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:09.660 align:middle line:90%
and then they crash.

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:10.460 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:11.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happens?

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:12.630 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah, exactly.

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:16.220 align:middle line:84%
You have lots of
different scenarios,

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:19.550 align:middle line:84%
from we shoot it down,
to radar interference,

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:22.590 align:middle line:84%
to natural phenomena with
big, negative lightning bolts,

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:26.330 align:middle line:84%
which are 10x stronger than
positive ones, which are common,

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:32.990 align:middle line:84%
to oh, the aliens realize that
when you explode an atomic bomb,

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:36.740 align:middle line:84%
planet Earth has suddenly
changed a step function in its

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:39.800 align:middle line:84%
technological development,
and the best way to solve

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:45.510 align:middle line:84%
the trajectory of planet Earth
is to seed them with technology

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:51.780 align:middle line:84%
that just allows them to focus
on semiconductors or a different

00:12:51.780 --> 00:13:00.600 align:middle line:84%
pathway, or deliberate seeding
of a kindergarten planet,

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:05.550 align:middle line:84%
or these are just
biological drones.

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:10.890 align:middle line:84%
They're not worth picking
up, like in Ukraine, we

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:12.040 align:middle line:90%
shoot down drones.

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:17.740 align:middle line:84%
But do people give them a proper
burial and care about them?

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.090 align:middle line:90%
No, no, they don't.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:23.010 align:middle line:84%
So the ETs may have a
different perspective

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:28.300 align:middle line:84%
on the sentience of these
alien craft and occupants.

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The late
Colonel Philip Corso

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:34.000 align:middle line:84%
claimed that we have
reversed UFO technology.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.250 align:middle line:90%
We've given it to industry.

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:37.600 align:middle line:90%
They've played with it.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.820 align:middle line:84%
They've massaged
it a little bit.

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:40.990 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:42.323 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Well, I think it's true.

00:13:42.323 --> 00:13:44.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he talked
about fiber optics.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.070 align:middle line:84%
He talked about
integrated circuits.

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:47.750 align:middle line:84%
He talked about
night-vision goggles.

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And he certainly
was highly credible.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.910 align:middle line:90%
He did what he said he did.

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:57.640 align:middle line:84%
He wrote a good book about
it, The Day after Roswell.

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:03.860 align:middle line:84%
And so I think industry
has been, in a mild way,

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:08.600 align:middle line:84%
exposed to some aspects,
through patents and so forth.

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.940 align:middle line:84%
But most of it is
all classified.

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:15.310 align:middle line:84%
The Aerospace Corporation or
Bechtel or Northrop or Lockheed

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:20.650 align:middle line:84%
Martin, in these
classified areas, EG&G,

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:25.060 align:middle line:84%
these other corporations
have classified

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:26.830 align:middle line:90%
contracts that are all buried.

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:32.050 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe there's
some extra corporate,

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:38.320 align:middle line:84%
not in the corporate
structure, organizations

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:41.870 align:middle line:84%
that focus on this technology
and reverse engineering.

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:44.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ryan, are we
getting eyewitness testimony

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:46.790 align:middle line:90%
to back this stuff up?

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:49.620 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: A few, I
guess, is the answer.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:54.110 align:middle line:84%
I'd say, we have
limited evidence

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:57.320 align:middle line:90%
for eyewitness testimony.

00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:01.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you think of
Bob Lazar, for example,

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:05.000 align:middle line:84%
with his comments in
Area 51 and Element

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.930 align:middle line:84%
115 and seeing gravity
control craft, or Ed Fouché.

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:14.280 align:middle line:84%
There are a few
witnesses around.

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:17.000 align:middle line:84%
But I think that we need
more witnesses, and more

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.810 align:middle line:84%
credible witnesses, with more
documentation and more evidence.

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:25.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Vannevar Bush,
from the well-named family,

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:27.950 align:middle line:84%
talked to Franklin
Delano Roosevelt

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:31.920 align:middle line:84%
a long time ago, requesting
funding for this.

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.860 align:middle line:90%
Whatever happened?

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:38.150 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Yeah, one of the early
leaked Majestic documents,

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:44.520 align:middle line:84%
basically, as maybe an input
from the Missouri '41 crash,

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:47.850 align:middle line:84%
is he wrote to
Roosevelt and said, hey,

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:52.690 align:middle line:84%
we have these "celestial gifts"
that we need to explore and tap.

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And Roosevelt's response was,
well, hurry up, win the war,

00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:01.840 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll give you money,
and allow you to explore,

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:08.190 align:middle line:84%
reverse engineer, and capitalize
on this unfathomable new

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:12.000 align:middle line:84%
technology that they
want to try to exploit

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.760 align:middle line:84%
for the benefit of the military,
primarily, at the time.

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.893 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Brian, what is
the White Hot Report?

00:16:18.893 --> 00:16:20.310 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Yeah, the
White Hot Report

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:24.010 align:middle line:84%
is another leaked
Majestic document.

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:28.830 align:middle line:84%
It's basically the
report to Truman,

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:30.810 align:middle line:84%
by Nathan Twining,
a General Nathan

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:34.860 align:middle line:84%
Twining, three-star
lieutenant general,

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:38.910 align:middle line:84%
all about the work of
analyzing the Roswell events,

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:41.900 align:middle line:90%
all during the summer of 1947.

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.820 align:middle line:90%
And it's a 25-page report.

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:46.990 align:middle line:84%
It's got a description of
a neutronic power plant

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:50.030 align:middle line:84%
inside, with all the
various elements.

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's very damning,
in that it basically

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:59.590 align:middle line:84%
summarizes, at a high level,
the research and development

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:05.260 align:middle line:84%
effort that went on,
to analyze the Roswell

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:09.310 align:middle line:90%
crashes of early July, of '47.

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:13.099 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was Roswell the impetus
for changes within government?

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:16.089 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah, I think so.

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:23.359 align:middle line:84%
You now had this report, that
was dated September 24, 1947,

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:27.220 align:middle line:84%
and oh, lo and behold,
we get the CIA formed,

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:30.610 align:middle line:84%
we get the National Security
Administration formed.

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:37.030 align:middle line:84%
We have a change, and the
splitting of the Army Air Forces

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:38.730 align:middle line:90%
into the Army and the Air Force.

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:43.340 align:middle line:84%
So it is definitely
an inflection point

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:46.590 align:middle line:84%
in our government
organizational structure.

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:51.710 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was driven
by these alien crashes.

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And this White Hot Report
highlights, Dear Mr. Truman,

00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:00.890 align:middle line:84%
let's establish a
top-secret research

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:02.720 align:middle line:84%
and development,
intelligence-gathering

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:05.490 align:middle line:84%
organization,
called Majestic 12.

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:09.030 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the exact
language in the report.

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:10.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's an
amazing story, isn't it?

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:12.540 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: It is an amazing story.

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:16.566 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Roswell, the crash was
on a farmer's land, Mac Brazel?

00:18:16.566 --> 00:18:17.510 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Mm-hmm.

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:18.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened there?

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:24.690 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, it's a little
fuzzy, as to the exact,

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:28.160 align:middle line:84%
but certainly, you seem
to have multiple craft.

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.680 align:middle line:84%
One explodes on
the Brazel ranch,

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:37.110 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of different shards
or debris or metal-like foil.

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:39.930 align:middle line:84%
We hear stories of foil you
could pick up and crunch,

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:41.810 align:middle line:90%
and it would come back to life.

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:46.200 align:middle line:90%


00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So like aluminum foil?

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:49.920 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Like
aluminum foil, but it

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.560 align:middle line:90%
pops back to its memory shape.

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And then there was another
location, Landing Zone 2, where

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:01.420 align:middle line:90%
you had a more intact craft.

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:05.400 align:middle line:84%
At the time, they called them
ULATS, Unidentified Lenticular

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.025 align:middle line:90%
Aerodyne Technology.

00:19:07.025 --> 00:19:07.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a name.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:08.680 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah, exactly.

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:09.850 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's a military name.

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:18.180 align:middle line:84%
You get that clear style,
that it's ULAT 1 and ULAT 2.

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And there's lots of names for
saucers now, or UFOs, or UAPs.

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:27.130 align:middle line:90%
It just goes on.

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:29.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was the
Kecksburg case, Ryan?

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:31.260 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, Kecksburg's
another example

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:34.650 align:middle line:84%
of work that Stan
Gordon, who wrote a book

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:38.050 align:middle line:84%
and did primary investigation
on the Kecksburg.

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:41.260 align:middle line:90%
I think it was 1964.

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:46.310 align:middle line:84%
This acorn-shaped craft
crashed into Pennsylvania.

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:49.035 align:middle line:84%
It had all these hieroglyphic
writings on the side.

00:19:49.035 --> 00:19:52.160 align:middle line:90%


00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.060 align:middle line:84%
Leslie Kean did work on
that, and Stan Gordon.

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:58.840 align:middle line:10%
And I actually had a remote
viewing project done,

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:03.460 align:middle line:10%
about this guy Murphy,
who was a reporter there,

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:08.530 align:middle line:10%
that allegedly took a bunch
of pictures of the craft,

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:13.330 align:middle line:10%
and palmed the film,
but mysteriously

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:23.180 align:middle line:10%
died in a head-on collision in
Ventura County, on Highway 101.

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:29.620 align:middle line:84%
But it's just another
interesting, highly-credible UFO

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:30.560 align:middle line:90%
crash case.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:32.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
think the government

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:34.830 align:middle line:84%
is feeding misinformation
to all of us,

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:38.030 align:middle line:90%
to cover up these stories?

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:41.160 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: 10, 20 years
ago, I thought so.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.260 align:middle line:84%
Today, I think they
just ignore it.

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:46.380 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think the
evidence for disinformation

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:50.760 align:middle line:84%
or psychological warfare
is very strong at all.

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:52.980 align:middle line:84%
There's too many
different sources,

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:55.710 align:middle line:84%
spanning too long a
time, with such a varying

00:20:55.710 --> 00:21:00.280 align:middle line:84%
degree of quality, of
leaked Majestic documents.

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:04.290 align:middle line:84%
There have been cases,
like Philip Klass used

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:08.820 align:middle line:84%
to come, or Richard Doty, with
his problems, or Paul Bennewitz,

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:17.850 align:middle line:84%
with his psychological problems,
that were potentially induced.

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:22.030 align:middle line:84%
But I think nowadays,
it's best to ignore it.

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:25.260 align:middle line:84%
But if anybody
really credible gets

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:29.710 align:middle line:84%
at a higher and higher level,
you get some disinformation.

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:35.000 align:middle line:84%
Maybe Grusch was exposed
to some level of that.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.130 align:middle line:84%
So the answer is,
for the most part,

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:40.340 align:middle line:90%
don't give them any credibility.

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:44.480 align:middle line:84%
Just ignore them unless
there's some real threat.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:46.340 align:middle line:84%
If you had real
crashed hardware,

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:49.720 align:middle line:84%
if you had a part, a hatch,
with hieroglyphics, then

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:51.860 align:middle line:84%
I think you're far
more in trouble.

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:53.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And maybe we do.

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.040 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Maybe.

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:55.010 align:middle line:90%
Well, I don't know.

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:59.180 align:middle line:84%
In the private world,
we have the arts parts,

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:02.530 align:middle line:84%
the layered bismuth magnesium
parts, the small little part

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:03.880 align:middle line:90%
that Linda Moulton Howe got.

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And people are doing
analysis on it.

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's really weird, but
nobody knows how to make it.

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's not clear
what it's good for.

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:14.740 align:middle line:84%
But there's an example where
you could get five people

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:20.260 align:middle line:84%
to earn PhDs in, how do you
understand this potential piece

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:21.850 align:middle line:90%
of Roswell wreckage?

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:23.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we have
craft capable of going

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.850 align:middle line:90%
beyond our solar system?

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:28.160 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: I think there are craft.

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:32.435 align:middle line:84%
I think we figured out
gravity control in the late

00:22:32.435 --> 00:22:35.900 align:middle line:84%
'50s or early '60s,
according to my research.

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And I really put it at the
doorstep of the Glenn L. Martin

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:45.140 align:middle line:84%
Company, and George
Scott Trimble

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:49.670 align:middle line:84%
Jr., who was part of
the Glenn Martin Company

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:54.500 align:middle line:84%
and the RIAS Group, Research
Institute of Advanced Studies,

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:58.550 align:middle line:84%
that Bruce DeWitt was
there along with Ruth

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:01.080 align:middle line:90%
Arno and many other physicists.

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:05.520 align:middle line:84%
So there was a lot of
research and a lot of buzz,

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:10.220 align:middle line:84%
a lot of newspapers, articles
in The New York Herald

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:14.270 align:middle line:84%
and an article called,
The G Engines are Coming,

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:19.110 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of buzz, all in the
'50s, about gravity control.

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:21.300 align:middle line:90%
But then it disappears.

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:24.530 align:middle line:90%
It's not in the press anymore.

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:32.350 align:middle line:84%
The companies of Lear
and Northrop and--

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:33.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Grumman

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:35.580 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Glenn L. Martin
companies just disappear.

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:37.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
always been talk

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:41.380 align:middle line:84%
that we have relationships going
with extraterrestrial races.

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:42.670 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:45.010 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, I'd
love more evidence.

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:51.210 align:middle line:84%
But there's the Holloman Air
Force base alleged meeting.

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And we have these
relationships established,

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.710 align:middle line:90%
or diplomatic relationships.

00:23:56.710 --> 00:24:00.030 align:middle line:84%
I am fascinated by the
work of Dan Sherman, who

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:04.630 align:middle line:84%
wrote a book called Above
Black, where he said, hey,

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:05.920 align:middle line:90%
I worked for the NSA.

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:10.570 align:middle line:84%
I was, basically a psychic
communicator with alien races.

00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:14.530 align:middle line:90%
And we had a deal.

00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:18.520 align:middle line:84%
Basically, we get ET technology
and you can abduct humans.

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:19.720 align:middle line:90%
That's what he said.

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:21.280 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot more
to it in his book,

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:23.610 align:middle line:84%
but he would be
very great interview

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:28.260 align:middle line:84%
to find, if he's still alive,
or all his friends, or people

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:35.620 align:middle line:84%
that used to work at the NSA,
who did that sort of function.

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:38.680 align:middle line:84%
So I think that
there's truth to that.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:41.120 align:middle line:90%
But the evidence is shallow.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:43.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do we know
about gravity control?

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:46.180 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: We know that there was
a lot of buzz and excitement

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:48.290 align:middle line:90%
in the '50s about doing that.

00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of scientists,
who did a lot of work

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:54.080 align:middle line:90%
on trying to figure it out.

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:56.920 align:middle line:84%
Even Edward Teller
writes a paper, in 1976,

00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:03.910 align:middle line:84%
about counter-rotating,
spinning mercury or other heavy

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:10.670 align:middle line:84%
metals as being a path to
change the nature of gravity.

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:12.680 align:middle line:84%
People talked about
gravity insulators.

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's been a conundrum
of the physics organization

00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:20.320 align:middle line:84%
for a long time, to
try to figure out

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:21.620 align:middle line:90%
the nature of gravity.

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:24.110 align:middle line:84%
But people got all excited
about string theory.

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And all the bright
physicists went off

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:29.360 align:middle line:84%
on string-field
theory, which may

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:33.300 align:middle line:84%
have been psychological
warfare or misdirection,

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:38.150 align:middle line:84%
to go work on that, rather
than focus on gravity.

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:43.040 align:middle line:84%
Babson, a philanthropist,
put a lot of money,

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:48.330 align:middle line:84%
in the '50s and 60s,
into gravity research.

00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And that work should
be re-accelerated.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:54.570 align:middle line:84%
If there was anything
I would focus on,

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:56.430 align:middle line:84%
if I was going to
spend $10 million,

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:57.990 align:middle line:84%
I would focus on
gravity research.

00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's rediscovering it
because the classified world

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:05.810 align:middle line:90%
knows the equations.

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:09.885 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
got to rediscover.

00:26:09.885 --> 00:26:12.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Don't some of
the Majestic 12 documents

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:15.120 align:middle line:84%
talk about neutronic
plant information?

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:16.910 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Yeah, the
White Hot Report

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:19.220 align:middle line:84%
talks about the
neutronic power plant,

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:24.570 align:middle line:84%
and gives 10 points of elements
that they found in 1947.

00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:27.660 align:middle line:84%
So in 1947, they had
mass spectrometers.

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And they could do a certain
level of scientific analysis

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:40.020 align:middle line:84%
about the nature of what's
in a fusion-like power plant.

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:44.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happened in 1952,
with the fifth annual report

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.920 align:middle line:90%
on reverse engineering, from ET?

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:51.370 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Yeah, part of the
Majestic Documents is 1952,

00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:57.490 align:middle line:84%
they had this annual report, was
leaked reports, 15 pages or so.

00:26:57.490 --> 00:27:04.500 align:middle line:84%
But there's mentions of serums
collected from the Roswell

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:09.150 align:middle line:84%
bodies, that can offer
unheard of breakthroughs

00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:12.940 align:middle line:84%
in creating biological
and chemical weapons.

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:17.340 align:middle line:84%
That's like, wow, that's the
worst nightmare you can imagine

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:19.530 align:middle line:84%
is, oh, let's take
some ET bodies

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:24.270 align:middle line:84%
and try to make biological
weapons out of their bloods

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:25.840 align:middle line:90%
and organs and biology.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:27.093 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or pharmaceuticals?

00:27:27.093 --> 00:27:28.760 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Yeah, or
pharmaceuticals, right.

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:34.810 align:middle line:84%
So I think that
that's definitely--

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:38.260 align:middle line:84%
now, the '50s were the time
when that sort of stuff was

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:40.510 align:middle line:84%
definitely in vogue
in mainstream.

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:48.220 align:middle line:84%
Nowadays, it would be
extremely, allegedly, verboten.

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:51.230 align:middle line:84%
But I think back then,
they were doing it.

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:52.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What was Item G?

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:53.560 align:middle line:90%
Explain that.

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: They take whatever
they can from these biologies.

00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:58.780 align:middle line:84%
When you have this
Roswell crash,

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:01.120 align:middle line:84%
where you have this
hardware aspect,

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:03.220 align:middle line:84%
and you have the
biology aspect, those

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:05.450 align:middle line:84%
are two immediate
compartmentalization.

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And so in the
biology part, you'd

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:09.800 align:middle line:84%
probably try to
understand, well,

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:11.270 align:middle line:90%
how do you do pharmaceuticals?

00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:17.020 align:middle line:84%
Can we learn anything, from
using the biology of the aliens,

00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:20.150 align:middle line:84%
to make better pharmaceuticals
or better weapons?

00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:23.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Once the public really
understands the Majestic 12

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:26.340 align:middle line:84%
Documents, from your
book, for example,

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:30.020 align:middle line:84%
what do you think
their reaction will be?

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:36.273 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: I think surprise,
incredulousness, anger.

00:28:36.273 --> 00:28:38.901 align:middle line:90%


00:28:38.901 --> 00:28:39.776 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Frustration?

00:28:39.776 --> 00:28:40.920 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Frustration.

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:44.270 align:middle line:90%


00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:50.030 align:middle line:84%
It will be a range of emotions,
depending upon the person's

00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:50.970 align:middle line:90%
sophistication.

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:56.255 align:middle line:84%
One aspect, people
say, I'm still

00:28:56.255 --> 00:28:58.130 align:middle line:84%
going to go to work
tomorrow, even if there's

00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:00.960 align:middle line:90%
aliens living among us.

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:01.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.760 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: But on the other
hand, some intellectual

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:07.160 align:middle line:84%
would say, my God, this
could be the solution

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:13.250 align:middle line:84%
to uplifting all of planet Earth
into a cosmic kindergarten.

00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And why haven't the
ETs made open contact?

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:21.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, because planet
Earth isn't ready.

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:24.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, have we gotten
rid of all our nukes?

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:25.825 align:middle line:90%
Have we fed everybody?

00:29:25.825 --> 00:29:26.950 align:middle line:90%
Have we educated everybody?

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:29.320 align:middle line:84%
Have we cleaned up
the environment?

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:33.780 align:middle line:84%
In my mind, that's the criteria
for starting a relationship

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:38.970 align:middle line:84%
with advanced extraterrestrial
civilizations,

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:45.630 align:middle line:84%
is that when you do that,
we'll show up and start to have

00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:47.590 align:middle line:90%
a different relationship.

00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:49.992 align:middle line:84%
And my prediction,
everybody says

00:29:49.992 --> 00:29:52.450 align:middle line:84%
disclosure's going to happen,
disclosure's going to happen.

00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:57.060 align:middle line:84%
I just think there'll be
limited, titrated hooey.

00:29:57.060 --> 00:30:01.440 align:middle line:84%
I think 2050, 2060 is
the more realistic frame,

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:05.820 align:middle line:84%
when you'll have open,
clear ET contact.

00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:08.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We'll be a hundred
years old by then, Ryan.

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:08.820 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: I know.

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:11.610 align:middle line:90%
I hope to live to the day.

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:14.620 align:middle line:84%
But it's going to
be a long time.

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:20.550 align:middle line:84%
Or President Xi could just
announce it or provide evidence.

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:22.950 align:middle line:84%
Or somebody else could
provide enough evidence.

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:27.690 align:middle line:90%
But it's a very damning problem.

00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:30.860 align:middle line:84%
The government tries to balance
secrecy and transparency.

00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:32.630 align:middle line:84%
those that's the back
and forth that they

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:36.110 align:middle line:90%
have to do all the time.

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:41.190 align:middle line:90%
And that's the crime, really.

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:42.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
believe the Majestic 12

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:44.400 align:middle line:90%
documents are authentic.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:48.150 align:middle line:84%
But could they have been
created to mislead us?

00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:53.870 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Maybe to mislead other
foreign intelligence services,

00:30:53.870 --> 00:31:00.500 align:middle line:84%
but if you're trying to scare
the Russians or the Chinese

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:03.540 align:middle line:84%
or some other party
that, don't mess with us,

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:06.840 align:middle line:84%
we got ET technology, we
got lasers, we got weapons,

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:13.250 align:middle line:84%
we got all sorts of stuff that
may render your nukes worthless,

00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:20.430 align:middle line:84%
maybe you can slip that into the
spy world in an authentic way.

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:26.990 align:middle line:84%
But what you have is this
broad brush of documents,

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:30.390 align:middle line:84%
in varying quality, over
such a long period of time.

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:33.680 align:middle line:84%
And they don't tell
the story of a threat

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:38.050 align:middle line:84%
to other geopolitical
adversaries.

00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:38.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At all?

00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:40.410 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Not at all.

00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:41.660 align:middle line:90%
I just don't think it's--

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:44.045 align:middle line:84%
I wrote a whole paper
on psychological warfare

00:31:44.045 --> 00:31:45.170 align:middle line:90%
and the Majestic documents.

00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:46.550 align:middle line:90%
It's in my book.

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:49.140 align:middle line:84%
It's on the
majesticdocuments.com website.

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:53.220 align:middle line:84%
And people can read it, and
get a deeper understanding.

00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:56.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have skeptics try
to discredit the documents?

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:58.800 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah, from time to time.

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:00.300 align:middle line:90%
I think of Philip Klass.

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:07.070 align:middle line:84%
I think of naysayers saying,
well, it's not real because.

00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:12.120 align:middle line:84%
But anybody that says it's fake
because, well, that's exciting.

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:13.460 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:16.850 align:middle line:84%
I welcome that because
then we have something

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:18.240 align:middle line:90%
to really talk about.

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:22.740 align:middle line:84%
And every document and its
authenticity and its provenance

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:24.310 align:middle line:90%
is unique.

00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:29.580 align:middle line:84%
And people say the first
annual report is fake

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:32.970 align:middle line:84%
because they use the word
retro-virus, retro, hyphen,

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:37.020 align:middle line:84%
virus, and it wasn't invented or
understood in the public domain

00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:40.480 align:middle line:90%
until several years later.

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:42.690 align:middle line:84%
But when you actually
dig through the research

00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:47.370 align:middle line:84%
and find the medical literature
and find all the retro hyphen

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:51.360 align:middle line:84%
examples, you
discover, oh, no, this

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:54.220 align:middle line:84%
is a credible use of this
language at the time.

00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:57.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have what
is called the UFOdex.

00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:58.510 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:32:58.510 --> 00:33:03.730 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: This is one of my
new, fun things, is long ago,

00:33:03.730 --> 00:33:07.140 align:middle line:84%
I believe the way to fight
back against the bad guys

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:11.050 align:middle line:84%
is to basically have
intelligence dominance.

00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:15.760 align:middle line:84%
This is war, basic strategy, is
I want intelligence dominance.

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:19.600 align:middle line:84%
So UFOdex is a
repository of right now,

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:26.690 align:middle line:84%
about 750,000 pages
of UFO documents.

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:29.170 align:middle line:84%
About 750 books have
all been scanned

00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:35.600 align:middle line:84%
in an OCR, National Archive
material, FBI files, podcasts,

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.060 align:middle line:84%
periodicals, all
the MUFON journals,

00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:41.980 align:middle line:84%
all the work from CUFOS
and Flying Saucer Review

00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:43.280 align:middle line:90%
and all of this.

00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:45.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's all in
an AI engine, when

00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:48.880 align:middle line:84%
you can go to UFOdex.com
and literally type

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:54.430 align:middle line:84%
in any question you want, and
tell me all the disinformation

00:33:54.430 --> 00:34:04.150 align:middle line:84%
examples in ufology, or what are
the top-10 cases where UFOs were

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:11.659 align:middle line:84%
seen sucking up water, out of
lakes, or any other question,

00:34:11.659 --> 00:34:13.489 align:middle line:84%
everybody has their
own perspective.

00:34:13.489 --> 00:34:16.810 align:middle line:84%
Some people like the
abduction phenomenon

00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:19.190 align:middle line:84%
and want to understand, well,
what are the communications

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:19.990 align:middle line:90%
and messages?

00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:21.210 align:middle line:90%
What are crop circles about?

00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And you can ask it any
question, and it gives you

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:28.699 align:middle line:84%
thousand-word, well-referenced,
clean, AI-enabled answer

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:33.139 align:middle line:84%
from this knowledge
base that is unique.

00:34:33.139 --> 00:34:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And I keep adding,
there's only, maybe,

00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:41.190 align:middle line:84%
at most, a million and a half
pages of quality information.

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:42.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's all.

00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:47.190 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Yeah, that's all,
compared to dentistry,

00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:50.120 align:middle line:84%
which might have a
hundreds million pages,

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:52.320 align:middle line:90%
or some medical profession.

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:59.510 align:middle line:84%
So ufology is a rare
and bounded world.

00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it is lost
to people's archives

00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:04.940 align:middle line:90%
and backgrounds.

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:10.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's not clear
what is really

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:12.510 align:middle line:90%
understood by the open public.

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:15.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You use a lot of
artificial intelligence

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.730 align:middle line:90%
to get your info?

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:23.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: This tool, UFOdex,
has this brain, this implant.

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:28.990 align:middle line:84%
Think of it as a knowledge
implant into the AI tool.

00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:33.790 align:middle line:84%
It's a Retrieval-Augmented
Generated or RAG database.

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:39.090 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just everything,
the way ChatGPT-4 is,

00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:42.780 align:middle line:84%
or something like that, which
gives terrible answers if you

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:45.960 align:middle line:84%
ask it about, what's
Roswell, for example.

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:48.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very
dedicated knowledge

00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:53.250 align:middle line:90%
with no hallucination at all.

00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:56.230 align:middle line:84%
So I basically
created it that way.

00:35:56.230 --> 00:36:01.110 align:middle line:84%
So it queries the
data set it has.

00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's still a garbage
in, garbage out problem.

00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:06.130 align:middle line:84%
That's why I'm
curating what's in it.

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:09.670 align:middle line:84%
And there's a minimal
amount of stuff off the web.

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And there's mostly high-quality
materials that are in there.

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:16.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And that's UFOdex.com?

00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right, UFOdex.com.

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:24.550 align:middle line:84%
And I originally started it,
collecting this information,

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:26.715 align:middle line:84%
at the crash-retrieval
conferences.

00:36:26.715 --> 00:36:29.090 align:middle line:84%
So I've been collecting this
information for a long time.

00:36:29.090 --> 00:36:30.770 align:middle line:90%
But I'm really accelerating now.

00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:33.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did you think
of the late J. Allen Hynek?

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, in
my father's files,

00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:37.450 align:middle line:84%
as I was going
through them all, I

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:40.780 align:middle line:84%
found lots of correspondence
between J. Allen Hynek

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:43.060 align:middle line:90%
and my father, Dr. Bob Wood.

00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:46.480 align:middle line:90%
And it was fun to read.

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And they were very much
peers, communicating

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:56.410 align:middle line:84%
about the nature of the
challenge and the breakthrough,

00:36:56.410 --> 00:36:58.850 align:middle line:84%
and understanding
what was going on.

00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:01.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The late Apollo 14
astronaut, Edgar Mitchell,

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:02.960 align:middle line:90%
God rest his soul--

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:05.950 align:middle line:84%
we're losing so many of
these incredible people--

00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:10.150 align:middle line:84%
told me, George, I've been
told by people in government,

00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:12.710 align:middle line:90%
we are being visited.

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Edgar, when
you were on the moon,

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:15.985 align:middle line:90%
did you see anything?

00:37:15.985 --> 00:37:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And he said, no, I did not, but
I'm told we're being visited.

00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:23.280 align:middle line:90%
And I trust these people.

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:24.780 align:middle line:90%
What did you think of him?

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:26.970 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, I
met Edgar Mitchell.

00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:28.680 align:middle line:90%
I think he's got two PhDs.

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:29.880 align:middle line:90%
And he's been to the moon.

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:32.460 align:middle line:90%
And he's a great guy.

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And I trust his commentary
and his statement.

00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:39.620 align:middle line:90%
And it's just one of many.

00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:44.913 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Ben Rich, in my
book, UFOs, Who Knows?--

00:37:44.913 --> 00:37:46.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Skunk Works, right?

00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:48.785 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Yeah Skunk Works, 15
years ahead of Lockheed Skunk

00:37:48.785 --> 00:37:53.520 align:middle line:84%
Works, said at his
retirement, in 1993,

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:56.870 align:middle line:84%
in a public forum at UCLA,
yeah, we have the technology

00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:59.040 align:middle line:90%
to take ET home.

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:01.530 align:middle line:84%
We found a "mistake"
in the equations.

00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:03.188 align:middle line:90%
Wait, in equations?

00:38:03.188 --> 00:38:04.730 align:middle line:84%
You found a mistake
in the equations?

00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:09.320 align:middle line:90%
Human beings find equations.

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:11.280 align:middle line:90%
And we now can do this.

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And it won't take a
lifetime to do it.

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:17.290 align:middle line:84%
So somehow, he implies that
we have gravity control,

00:38:17.290 --> 00:38:19.260 align:middle line:90%
we have time control.

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And so that's a very
credible source.

00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:27.210 align:middle line:90%
There's many others.

00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:31.470 align:middle line:84%
A Wright-Patterson secretary
by the name of June Crain

00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:32.670 align:middle line:90%
is in the book.

00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:35.970 align:middle line:84%
She was 19 years old
at the parachute group

00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:37.660 align:middle line:84%
at Wright-Patterson
Air Force base.

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:40.140 align:middle line:90%
And she was young and cute.

00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And the officers used to
come in and here, June,

00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:45.720 align:middle line:84%
look at this piece
of Roswell debris.

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And it was all, try to cut it
with scissors, break it up.

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:51.210 align:middle line:90%
And she couldn't do that.

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And her comment to Police
Sergeant Jim Clarkson

00:38:55.050 --> 00:39:00.960 align:middle line:84%
was, by '52, I think there was
at least three crashes that she

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:04.420 align:middle line:84%
was aware of, that she
felt hardware parts for.

00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:10.870 align:middle line:84%
This is just 1 of 185 quotations
in my book, UFOs, Who Knows?

00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And we had a great conversation
about that on Coast to Coast.

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:15.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We did.

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:17.360 align:middle line:84%
Keep doing what
you're doing, Ryan.

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:18.290 align:middle line:90%
We need you.

00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:19.700 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: All right,
well, thank you, George.

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:22.058 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where do people get
the book, Majic Eyes Only?

00:39:22.058 --> 00:39:23.600 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: Well,
everything's on Amazon,

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:30.160 align:middle line:10%
so you can go to Amazon and
type in my name or M-A-J-I-C,

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:33.740 align:middle line:10%
Military Assessment of the
Joint Intelligence Committee,

00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:38.930 align:middle line:10%
Magic Eyes Only, or my name,
and you can get it all.

Or look at all the Majestic
Documents yourself.

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:52.100 align:middle line:10%
Just read them at
majesticdocuments.com.

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:54.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thank you for
being on Beyond Belief.

00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:55.103 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Thank you, George.

00:39:55.103 --> 00:39:56.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One day, we
will get the answer

00:39:56.980 --> 00:40:01.630 align:middle line:84%
to the UFO mystery because
of people like Ryan Wood.

00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:05.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching Beyond Belief.
