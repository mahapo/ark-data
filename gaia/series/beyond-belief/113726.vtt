people today don't

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.338 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

have a program for you tonight

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:28.820 align:middle line:10%
on "Beyond Belief."

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.300 align:middle line:10%
Welcome, I'm George Noory.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And our special guest, retired
Lieutenant Colonel Kevin

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.480 align:middle line:90%
Randle.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.525 align:middle line:90%
Kevin is a noted UFO researcher.

00:00:36.525 --> 00:00:40.650 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, his
latest work, "The UFO Dossier,"

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.860 align:middle line:84%
is about incredible UFO
stories and government secrets.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.627 align:middle line:84%
And here he is on
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:47.627 --> 00:00:48.960 align:middle line:90%
Kevin, good to have you with us.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:49.560 align:middle line:90%
>>KEVIN RANDLE: Thank you.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.250 align:middle line:90%
Glad to be here.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.032 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in UFO research?

00:00:54.032 --> 00:00:55.490 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDLE: I always
blame my mother.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:56.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah-ha!

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.150 align:middle line:90%
Mom did it.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.320 align:middle line:90%
She did it to me, too.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.560 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDLE: She had an
interest in science fiction.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.140 align:middle line:10%
Science fictions about alien
beings, interstellar travel,

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.830 align:middle line:10%
life on other worlds,
and it's not a great step

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.410 align:middle line:10%
from that into UFOs.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.970 align:middle line:84%
So I blame her for getting--
sparking my interest in that.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.726 align:middle line:84%
In fact, she took me to a
movie, "Earth versus the Flying

00:01:14.726 --> 00:01:16.350 align:middle line:84%
Saucers," when I was
just a little kid.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.145 align:middle line:90%
So that sort of did it.

00:01:18.145 --> 00:01:20.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You and I were
both born on June 4.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.320 align:middle line:84%
Your mother got you
interested in UFOs.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.022 align:middle line:84%
My mother got me
interested in UFOs.

00:01:27.022 --> 00:01:28.730 align:middle line:84%
She brought me home
a book called "We Are

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:29.992 align:middle line:90%
Not Alone" by Walter Sullivan.

00:01:29.992 --> 00:01:30.950 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDLE: I've read it.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.241 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A "New York Times"
science writer at the time.

00:01:33.241 --> 00:01:34.980 align:middle line:90%
I was obsessed with things.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.780 align:middle line:84%
And then "Look"
magazine came out

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.760 align:middle line:84%
with the "Interrupted Journey,"
the Barney and Betty Hill case,

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.850 align:middle line:84%
the New Hampshire
abduction case.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.170 align:middle line:90%
And after that, I was hooked.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.630 align:middle line:84%
So our moms played a huge
role in our development.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.620 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDLE: Yes, absolutely.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As you evolved
into this, of course,

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.550 align:middle line:84%
you know, you're
in the military.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.140 align:middle line:90%
You've been in Iraq.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.400 align:middle line:84%
You're a retired
lieutenant colonel.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.980 align:middle line:84%
Were you dabbling with
UFOs at that time?

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.720 align:middle line:84%
I always kept my eye
open, but I never

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.490 align:middle line:84%
really ran into
anything interesting

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.634 align:middle line:90%
while I was in the military.

00:02:07.634 --> 00:02:09.509 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDLE: When I was an
intelligence officer,

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.160 align:middle line:84%
they had something called
the Weekly Intelligence

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.070 align:middle line:84%
Brief, which was kind
of classified stuff,

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.857 align:middle line:90%
but some of it was unclassified.

00:02:14.857 --> 00:02:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And periodically, a UFO
sighting would show up in there,

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.481 align:middle line:90%
and it was always unclassified.

00:02:18.481 --> 00:02:19.630 align:middle line:90%
It was a flight crew.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.100 align:middle line:84%
And the one I remember was
they were approaching Japan

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.330 align:middle line:90%
and had seen something.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.250 align:middle line:84%
Not a really
spectacular sighting,

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.210 align:middle line:84%
but something that appeared in
the Weekly Intelligence Brief.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.990 align:middle line:84%
But I really never saw
anything about UFOs

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.560 align:middle line:90%
while I was in the military.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And I kept my eyes open to
see if something would lead me

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:36.970 align:middle line:90%
in that direction.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.420 align:middle line:84%
Since then, talking
to people that I

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.280 align:middle line:84%
met in the military
and others, I've

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.600 align:middle line:84%
gotten a few clues about what
to look for and where to go.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.907 align:middle line:84%
In the documentation that's been
released in the last 10 years

00:02:50.907 --> 00:02:52.740 align:middle line:84%
from the military, I'm
able to understand it

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.990 align:middle line:84%
at a level that's some of the
other researchers who have not

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.156 align:middle line:84%
had military experience are
unable to understand it.

00:02:57.156 --> 00:02:58.975 align:middle line:84%
So I understand
things about it that

00:02:58.975 --> 00:03:01.760 align:middle line:84%
is helpful in learning
more about UFOs.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
were in the Army,

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.370 align:middle line:84%
did anybody else talk
to you about UFOs?

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.090 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDLE: Oh, absolutely.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.975 align:middle line:84%
In fact, while I was in Iraq, we
had a first Sergeant named Gil.

00:03:12.975 --> 00:03:14.475 align:middle line:84%
And he would talk
to me periodically

00:03:14.475 --> 00:03:15.690 align:middle line:90%
and call me the UFO guy.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:16.890 align:middle line:90%
And he was very interested--

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:17.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The UFO guy.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.371 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDLE: He was very
interested in NASCAR.

00:03:19.371 --> 00:03:22.156 align:middle line:84%
So how would you like to be
addressed as a NASCAR guy?

00:03:22.156 --> 00:03:23.280 align:middle line:90%
So that kind of ended that.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.613 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, they would talk to me.

00:03:24.613 --> 00:03:28.691 align:middle line:84%
And I was out in the company
area one day and these two NCOs

00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:30.690 align:middle line:84%
came up and said, do you
have a younger brother?

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:31.530 align:middle line:90%
And I said what do you mean?

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.946 align:middle line:84%
They said, well,
we saw a guy that

00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:35.860 align:middle line:84%
looked an awful lot like
you on a history documentary

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.230 align:middle line:84%
just last night with
the same last name.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.230 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, that was
probably me 10 years ago.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.631 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:03:41.631 --> 00:03:45.580 align:middle line:84%
You are one of the most
prolific researchers and authors

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.470 align:middle line:84%
in this field, and you take
this pretty darn seriously,

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.060 align:middle line:90%
don't you?

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.970 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDLE: I think
of it as something

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.100 align:middle line:90%
that's very important.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.670 align:middle line:84%
I also think about what I would
consider committing is UFO

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.150 align:middle line:84%
suicide simply because I
cannot embrace everything.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.990 align:middle line:84%
If there's some case that
gets a lot of publicity,

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.510 align:middle line:84%
and I think that there's a
rational explanation for it,

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.510 align:middle line:84%
I have to embrace
the explanation.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think too many
of the researchers

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.750 align:middle line:84%
just embrace everything and
just look at the surface.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.499 align:middle line:84%
I try to go beyond
that, deeper into it,

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:20.290 align:middle line:84%
to see if I can find
a solution for a case.

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.670 align:middle line:84%
Because if we're going to
prove that alien visitation is

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.060 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial, we're going
to have to look at that evidence

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.880 align:middle line:84%
from multiple points of view
to see if we can establish

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.340 align:middle line:84%
multiple chains of evidence--
witness testimony, interaction

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.910 align:middle line:84%
with the environment, landing
traces, radio or EM effects,

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.010 align:middle line:90%
radar trackings.

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.760 align:middle line:84%
All of that stuff has
to be brought to bare.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have been dealing
with several eras of UFO study.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.490 align:middle line:84%
The ancient ones where
Zecharia Sitchin got involved

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.320 align:middle line:84%
and then the modern UFO cases
that a lot of people think

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.300 align:middle line:84%
started when Kenneth
Arnold saw his UFOs in 1947

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.740 align:middle line:90%
and Roswell occurred in 1947.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:06.986 align:middle line:90%
You think otherwise.

00:05:06.986 --> 00:05:08.360 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDLE: I think
the case can be

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.800 align:middle line:84%
made that the modern era
began during World War II

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.345 align:middle line:90%
with the Foo Fighters.

00:05:13.345 --> 00:05:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And if you take a
look at the history--

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.440 align:middle line:84%
now Keith Chester has
done a wonderful book

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.470 align:middle line:84%
about that called
"Strange Company."

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.672 align:middle line:84%
And he found documentation
and interviewed

00:05:22.672 --> 00:05:24.630 align:middle line:84%
people who were involved
in this sort of thing.

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.046 align:middle line:84%
So we know that
this was something

00:05:26.046 --> 00:05:29.940 align:middle line:84%
that was extremely important
to the Allied command

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:30.890 align:middle line:90%
during World War II.

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.847 align:middle line:84%
If the Nazis, the
Japanese, were developing

00:05:34.847 --> 00:05:36.430 align:middle line:84%
some sort of secret
weapon, and that's

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.263 align:middle line:84%
what they thought the
foo fighters might be,

00:05:38.263 --> 00:05:39.910 align:middle line:84%
they needed to be
able to counter that.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.950 align:middle line:84%
So they were very
deeply involved

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.570 align:middle line:84%
in investigating these things
and very concerned about them.

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.370 align:middle line:84%
When the war ended, of
course, that priority

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.295 align:middle line:84%
ended as well, because there's
no longer that pressure.

00:05:50.295 --> 00:05:52.170 align:middle line:84%
But one of the guys that
was involved in that

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:56.260 align:middle line:84%
was a fellow named
Colonel Howard McCoy.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.370 align:middle line:84%
Within a year, there
with the ghost rockets

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.740 align:middle line:84%
flying over Scandinavia
mainly but into Europe

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.500 align:middle line:84%
and other areas, and they
were very worried about that.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.870 align:middle line:84%
Thought it might be some
kind of a Soviet attempt

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.910 align:middle line:84%
to intimidate
Sweden, for example.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.380 align:middle line:84%
A lot of those sightings--
the Swedish military

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.660 align:middle line:90%
was very concerned about it.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.370 align:middle line:84%
They asked for assistance from
the United States and Great

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:18.980 align:middle line:90%
Britain.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.520 align:middle line:84%
But they had to do it
kind of behind the scenes

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.520 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't want
to alienate the Soviet

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.080 align:middle line:90%
Union with that kind of thing.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.010 align:middle line:84%
One of the guys very deeply
involved in that investigation

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.340 align:middle line:90%
was Colonel Howard McCoy.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.900 align:middle line:84%
When we get to December
of 1946, now we're

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.130 align:middle line:84%
six months prior
to Kenneth Arnold,

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:40.280 align:middle line:84%
McCoy gets a call during
their Christmas party,

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.620 align:middle line:84%
early December of
1946, to set up

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.880 align:middle line:84%
an investigation of UFOs--
an unofficial investigation

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:46.380 align:middle line:90%
of the UFOs.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.800 align:middle line:84%
When Arnold's side had broke and
they decided to go officially,

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.910 align:middle line:84%
then that became the
official investigation.

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.910 align:middle line:84%
The guy that was called to
do that was Howard McCoy.

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:57.310 align:middle line:84%
When you get to
September of 1947

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.370 align:middle line:84%
and Twining issues
his letter that said,

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.810 align:middle line:84%
this is something that's
not visionary or fictitious,

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:06.740 align:middle line:84%
the guy who actually drafted
that letter was Howard McCoy.

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.350 align:middle line:84%
So the whole thing begins
with the foo fighters,

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:12.600 align:middle line:84%
and we have this string that
connects it all, showing

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.750 align:middle line:84%
an American intelligence
interest from the foo fighters,

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.380 align:middle line:84%
to the ghost rockets,
prior to Arnold,

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.320 align:middle line:84%
into what's called
the modern era.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:24.980 align:middle line:84%
Explain what the
foo fighters were.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.530 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDLE: Foo fighters
were mostly balls of fire,

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.870 align:middle line:84%
but there were some
sightings of solid craft.

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And these would intercept our
bomber formations, our fighter

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.330 align:middle line:90%
formations, during World War II.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.657 align:middle line:84%
And they would follow along,
nobody knew what they were,

00:07:41.657 --> 00:07:43.240 align:middle line:84%
but they thought it
might be some kind

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.550 align:middle line:84%
of an anti-aircraft weapon being
developed mainly by the Nazis,

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:49.060 align:middle line:84%
but there were foo fighter
sightings in the Pacific,

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.520 align:middle line:84%
in the China Burma
India theater as well.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.600 align:middle line:84%
But they were most
mostly balls of light

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.620 align:middle line:90%
following our aircraft.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:56.550 align:middle line:90%
Len Stringfield--

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:57.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like orbs?

00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:00.730 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDLE: Orbs, that kind of
thing, glowing balls of fire.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:03.780 align:middle line:84%
But at times they
would see solid craft.

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:07.580 align:middle line:84%
Len Stringfield, who had
done a lot of work-- very--

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.027 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: God rest
his soul, right?

00:08:09.027 --> 00:08:10.110 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDLE: Yes, absolutely.

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:13.200 align:middle line:84%
But a-- but a
well-respected ufologist.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:17.060 align:middle line:84%
As he was going to Japan
right after World War II,

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.060 align:middle line:84%
he was on one of
the first airplanes

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.680 align:middle line:84%
to go into Japan after the
Japanese had surrendered.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.256 align:middle line:84%
Near Iwo Jima, his aircraft was
approached by three objects.

00:08:25.256 --> 00:08:26.880 align:middle line:84%
The engines began
cutting out, and they

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.280 align:middle line:84%
were preparing to ditch until
the objects left, flew off

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.420 align:middle line:90%
into the distance.

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:33.549 align:middle line:84%
So there's one of the
first electromagnetic cases

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:35.715 align:middle line:84%
where something approached
close enough to interfere

00:08:35.715 --> 00:08:37.710 align:middle line:84%
with the electrical
systems of the aircraft.

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:41.049 align:middle line:84%
So they were mainly
just the orbs,

00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:43.490 align:middle line:84%
but there were other sightings
embedded in that as well.

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:45.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were there
any cases, Kevin,

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:49.900 align:middle line:84%
where these craft, or orbs,
or whatever they were, truly

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:54.334 align:middle line:84%
engaged with our craft to
do something destructive?

00:08:54.334 --> 00:08:56.250 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDLE: I have seen
nothing to suggest that,

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.780 align:middle line:84%
but I do know that our guys
fired on them frequently.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:00.701 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not smart.

00:09:00.701 --> 00:09:02.700 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDLE: Well, they
didn't know what they were.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.960 align:middle line:84%
And anything approaching
you in that environment

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.020 align:middle line:90%
is considered the enemy.

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:06.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You fire.

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:07.671 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDLE: You fire at it.

00:09:07.671 --> 00:09:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And they would report that
sometimes the bullets seemed

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.550 align:middle line:90%
to go through them.

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.890 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the bullets
seem to be absorbed.

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes the
bullets would bounce off.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.780 align:middle line:84%
So we've got a wide variety
of things going on there.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.320 align:middle line:84%
But it was something
that was of great concern

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.290 align:middle line:84%
to the Allied command
during the Second World War.

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:30.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was going on in
the '40s-- besides the war--

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:32.940 align:middle line:84%
that would get "them"
interested in what

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.480 align:middle line:90%
was happening on this planet?

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:39.210 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDLE: If you look
at what Carl Sagan said,

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:41.460 align:middle line:84%
he said that we could
expect one visit

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.690 align:middle line:84%
from an alien-- visit
of alien civilization

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:46.205 align:middle line:90%
every 10,000 years.

00:09:46.205 --> 00:09:47.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, when do you
start counting?

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:48.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:51.000 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDLE: If you visited
10,000 years ago,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.090 align:middle line:84%
you would find a planet that
is not very industrialized,

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:56.770 align:middle line:84%
mainly an agrarian
society, but it's got

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:58.500 align:middle line:90%
the beginnings of civilization.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.630 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't you then
take great interest

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:02.750 align:middle line:90%
in that society or that planet?

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:04.760 align:middle line:84%
If you visited
sometime later, you'd

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.454 align:middle line:84%
begin to see civilization
spreading over the globe.

00:10:07.454 --> 00:10:09.120 align:middle line:84%
You would see all
these things going on.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.000 align:middle line:84%
That would induce you
to visit more often,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.550 align:middle line:90%
to keep eyes on these guys.

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:15.495 align:middle line:84%
As we move into the
Industrial Revolution,

00:10:15.495 --> 00:10:19.010 align:middle line:84%
and we begin to develop a
capability of moving off

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:22.400 align:middle line:84%
the planet's surface, and
they see our very warlike

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.950 align:middle line:84%
propensities, it
might induce them

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:26.320 align:middle line:90%
to keep a closer eye on it.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.720 align:middle line:84%
So that they would have
shown up during that time

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.170 align:middle line:84%
and see us engaged
in this world war

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:34.960 align:middle line:84%
that ended up with the
atomic bombs being used.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.100 align:middle line:84%
That would induce them
to come more frequently.

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:39.510 align:middle line:90%
So that might be the inducement.

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:41.968 align:middle line:84%
But there, again, we're dealing
with an alien civilization.

00:10:41.968 --> 00:10:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure that we can
deduce from our point of view

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.749 align:middle line:90%
what an alien might do.

00:10:46.749 --> 00:10:48.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your latest
work, of course,

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:51.177 align:middle line:90%
is called "The UFO Dossier."

00:10:51.177 --> 00:10:51.760 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDLE: Yes.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.577 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
about this work.

00:10:53.577 --> 00:10:55.910 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDLE: That is kind of a
follow on to the "Government

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:58.310 align:middle line:84%
UFO Secrets," where I
propose the idea that we've

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:01.350 align:middle line:84%
got this continuous
investigation going on

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:02.600 align:middle line:90%
from the 1940s.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:06.270 align:middle line:84%
This looks at it from a more
worldwide point of view,

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:08.090 align:middle line:84%
but it also talks
about the cases

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:09.780 align:middle line:90%
where people have been injured.

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:12.766 align:middle line:84%
Most of the injuries
are the result

00:11:12.766 --> 00:11:15.220 align:middle line:84%
of people getting too close
to the object, not something

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:18.320 align:middle line:84%
that the object
has done to them--

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.910 align:middle line:90%
with a couple of exceptions.

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:22.160 align:middle line:84%
It looks at what other
governments have done.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
just struck me as absolutely

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:29.390 align:middle line:84%
hilarious was the Australians
were very interested in UFOs,

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:36.050 align:middle line:84%
and they had a high level
politician to report on UFOs.

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And he quoted from
Donald Keyhoe.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.320 align:middle line:84%
So the Australian
government contacted--

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.060 align:middle line:84%
or the Australian Air
Force contacted our force--

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:46.290 align:middle line:84%
they said, ah, you can't believe
anything Keyhoe has to say

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:50.320 align:middle line:84%
and took that as the
official government policy

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.910 align:middle line:84%
and followed the same path
that the United States Air

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:53.410 align:middle line:90%
Force did.

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:55.326 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I thought Keyhoe
was pretty credible.

00:11:55.326 --> 00:11:57.960 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDLE: Keyhoe turns out
to be extremely credible.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.120 align:middle line:84%
But at the time
this was going on,

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:04.650 align:middle line:84%
Keyhoe was being marginalized
by the United States Air Force.

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:06.260 align:middle line:84%
Because he had a
lot of stuff right--

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.445 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Didn't he form NICAP,
the National Investigations

00:12:08.445 --> 00:12:08.820 align:middle line:90%
Committee on Aerial Phenomena?

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:09.080 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDLE: Yes.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.830 align:middle line:84%
He was really very,
very instrumental

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:12.310 align:middle line:90%
in the beginning of NICAP.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:15.307 align:middle line:84%
Their organizational
philosophy, I guess,

00:12:15.307 --> 00:12:17.140 align:middle line:84%
was more looking at the
government cover up.

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:19.100 align:middle line:84%
APRO, which was done
by the Lorenzens,

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.860 align:middle line:84%
was more looking at
gathering UFO cases.

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:24.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of two
different organizations

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:26.240 align:middle line:84%
with two different
points of view,

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.280 align:middle line:84%
studying sort of
the same phenomenon.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:32.100 align:middle line:84%
But what struck me is Keyhoe
had said during the Levelland

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:34.880 align:middle line:84%
sightings over 1957-- that's
where the craft got close

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.820 align:middle line:90%
to the ground, interfered with--

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great sighting.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.210 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDLE: --interfered
with vehicles

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:41.530 align:middle line:90%
and that sort of thing.

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:43.774 align:middle line:84%
Keyhoe said there were
nine witnesses to that.

00:12:43.774 --> 00:12:45.690 align:middle line:84%
The Air Force said, no,
there were only three.

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:48.290 align:middle line:84%
They get into this big fight
over the number of witnesses.

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:50.700 align:middle line:84%
If you go back to the
Project Blue Book files,

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:54.510 align:middle line:84%
you find out witnesses
at 13 separate locations

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:58.820 align:middle line:84%
reported some kind of
activity with the UFO.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:02.960 align:middle line:84%
Had they investigated that case,
either the Air Force or NICAP

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:06.286 align:middle line:84%
or APRO or somebody investigated
that case at that time,

00:13:06.286 --> 00:13:08.410 align:middle line:84%
we'd probably be having a
different discussion now.

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:11.830 align:middle line:84%
Because here is an opportunity
to really get some answers.

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:15.160 align:middle line:84%
But they were so busy arguing
about philosophies and numbers

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.020 align:middle line:84%
of witnesses, it took
it off in a tangent,

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.670 align:middle line:84%
which I guess is a typical
political strategy.

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:22.960 align:middle line:84%
If I don't like the
question you ask,

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:25.600 align:middle line:84%
I'll try to divert
it to something else.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.227 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, good work in
this-- "The UFO Dossier."

00:13:28.227 --> 00:13:29.310 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDLE: Well, thank you.

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:33.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We need more and
more stories like that.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.940 align:middle line:84%
There are some great
researchers out

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:37.570 align:middle line:84%
there who have done
dedicated work like you have,

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:40.790 align:middle line:84%
Kevin, that try to get
answers to this subject.

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:46.610 align:middle line:84%
We seem to get really
close but not close enough.

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:49.490 align:middle line:84%
Steve Bassett and I
argue-- Steve, of course,

00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:52.000 align:middle line:84%
working on government
disclosure.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's
coming from government.

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:56.540 align:middle line:84%
I think it's going to
come from whistleblowers,

00:13:56.540 --> 00:14:01.009 align:middle line:84%
like the astronauts, and
pilots, and insiders.

00:14:01.009 --> 00:14:03.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's going
to come from government.

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:03.625 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:14:03.625 --> 00:14:04.490 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDLE: I don't
think it's going

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:06.285 align:middle line:84%
to come from the
whistleblower's either.

00:14:06.285 --> 00:14:07.680 align:middle line:84%
I think it's going to
come from the aliens.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.513 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:14:08.513 --> 00:14:12.230 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDLE: At which point,
there's nothing we can do.

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:15.190 align:middle line:84%
If they land and say, here
we are, here's our craft,

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:16.820 align:middle line:90%
here's where we come from.

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:17.500 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.290 align:middle line:90%
The discussion is over.

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:21.900 align:middle line:84%
But you see whistleblowers
come forward,

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:25.735 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't matter what
context that whistleblower

00:14:25.735 --> 00:14:28.880 align:middle line:84%
is in-- whether it's
UFOS or something else--

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.630 align:middle line:84%
the government moved to
smear that whistleblower.

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen that
time and time again

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:40.020 align:middle line:84%
when interesting bits of
intelligence, if you will,

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:42.190 align:middle line:84%
have come out that
the government wished

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:43.360 align:middle line:90%
hadn't come out.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.660 align:middle line:84%
And so we see them
smearing the people

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:49.010 align:middle line:84%
rather than
addressing the issues.

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And so I think
disclosure is not going

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:53.995 align:middle line:84%
to come from anything
from the government,

00:14:53.995 --> 00:14:56.370 align:middle line:84%
unless we happen to find a
bunch of documents by mistake.

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And that was how we learned
about project Moon Dust.

00:14:58.370 --> 00:14:58.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:14:58.580 --> 00:14:58.790 align:middle line:90%
Good point.

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:00.623 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDLE: The State
Department inadvertently

00:15:00.623 --> 00:15:03.220 align:middle line:84%
released a batch
of documents to-- I

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:05.040 align:middle line:90%
think it was Robert Todd.

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And there were some
marked Project Moon Dust.

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:09.490 align:middle line:84%
And he began looking
into Moon Dust.

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:12.770 align:middle line:84%
I know Bruce Maccabee
also looked into that.

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:14.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was writing
"Government UFO Files,"

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.110 align:middle line:84%
I've got a complete set of
the Project Blue Book files

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:18.055 align:middle line:90%
on microfilm.

00:15:18.055 --> 00:15:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'm scanning through
it looking for a sighting,

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:23.300 align:middle line:84%
and I thought I saw the
words Moon Dust go by.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.880 align:middle line:84%
And I stopped and went back,
and I found four cases right

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.106 align:middle line:90%
around September of 1960.

00:15:28.106 --> 00:15:29.480 align:middle line:84%
In the Project
Blue Book files it

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.195 align:middle line:90%
said-- it said Moon Dust cases.

00:15:31.195 --> 00:15:32.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right there.

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:33.930 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDLE: And I'm
thinking, these things

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:36.180 align:middle line:84%
had been out for 10 years
before Todd got the message.

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:38.013 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He just couldn't
tie them together.

00:15:38.013 --> 00:15:39.830 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDLE: And they had
been out, and nobody

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:43.100 align:middle line:84%
had found this reference
until I inadvertently

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.170 align:middle line:90%
accidentally found it in there.

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:47.280 align:middle line:90%
The cases are really bad cases.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.990 align:middle line:84%
They're just-- they're probably
meteors or something like that,

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:51.590 align:middle line:84%
but they're marked
Moon Dust, which

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:53.764 align:middle line:84%
is very relevant the fact
they're marked Moon Dust.

00:15:53.764 --> 00:15:56.180 align:middle line:84%
There's a letter in the Blue
Book files that also gives us

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:59.480 align:middle line:84%
the beginning of Moon Dust,
which is December of 1957.

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.190 align:middle line:84%
So when you hear this
other stuff about it,

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:04.292 align:middle line:84%
that's based on the best
guess of the researchers.

00:16:04.292 --> 00:16:06.500 align:middle line:84%
But we've now got a letter
from the Project Blue Book

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:09.470 align:middle line:84%
files from December
talking about the creation

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:10.142 align:middle line:90%
of Moon Dust.

00:16:10.142 --> 00:16:10.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:13.860 align:middle line:84%
We've got a series of videos
I want to look at and get

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:16.420 align:middle line:90%
your reaction to them.

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:18.127 align:middle line:84%
Nick Pope, of course,
our dear friend--

00:16:18.127 --> 00:16:18.710 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDLE: Yes.

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:20.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Former
member of the Ministry

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:22.610 align:middle line:90%
of Defense in Great Britain.

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:26.430 align:middle line:84%
The Ministry of Defense seems
to be releasing a few more

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:29.140 align:middle line:84%
documents on UFOs
Let's take a look.

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:32.535 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: According to the
UFO files, in August 1990,

00:16:32.535 --> 00:16:35.540 align:middle line:84%
two hikers were walking in
the Scottish highlands close

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:39.434 align:middle line:90%
to Calvine, north of Pitlochry.

00:16:39.434 --> 00:16:41.100 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, they saw
something incredible.

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:50.600 align:middle line:90%


00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:53.030 align:middle line:84%
It was a chance for the
picture of a lifetime.

00:16:53.030 --> 00:17:01.610 align:middle line:90%


00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:04.990 align:middle line:84%
The hikers immediately contacted
journalists from the "Scottish

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:06.304 align:middle line:90%
Daily Record" newspaper.

00:17:06.304 --> 00:17:09.480 align:middle line:90%


00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.950 align:middle line:84%
After viewing their
photos, the journalists

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:14.531 align:middle line:84%
chose to share both
pictures and negatives

00:17:14.531 --> 00:17:15.739 align:middle line:90%
with the Ministry of Defense.

00:17:15.739 --> 00:17:18.819 align:middle line:90%


00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:22.210 align:middle line:84%
The UFO desk files say
that the images were then

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:24.279 align:middle line:84%
analyzed by the best
team in the business.

00:17:24.279 --> 00:17:27.060 align:middle line:90%


00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:29.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NICK POPE: The Defense
Intelligence staff

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:31.570 align:middle line:84%
sent these images
to JARIC, that's

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:34.970 align:middle line:84%
the Joint Air Reconnaissance
and Intelligence Center.

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:40.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is the UK's military
training center of expertise

00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:44.170 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to
imagery analysis.

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:47.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: They identified a
small jet in the background.

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:50.710 align:middle line:84%
But the large, diamond-shaped
craft in the foreground

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:51.713 align:middle line:90%
defied classification.

00:17:51.713 --> 00:17:55.630 align:middle line:90%


00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:57.450 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: These
intelligence personnel

00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:00.490 align:middle line:84%
come to the conclusion that
these photographs are real.

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:02.450 align:middle line:90%
It's a solid craft.

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:06.470 align:middle line:84%
And no one has the
faintest idea what it is.

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:08.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: At the
time, Nick Pope

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:10.800 align:middle line:84%
was a junior member
of the UFO team.

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:15.790 align:middle line:84%
He remembers the response
of the MOD's top UFO expert.

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: He started
gesticulating.

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, we know
it's not the Americans,

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.237 align:middle line:84%
and he pointed his
finger that way.

00:18:24.237 --> 00:18:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And he flipped it the
other way and he said,

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:29.040 align:middle line:90%
it's not the Russians.

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.962 align:middle line:90%
And he said, that only leaves.

00:18:32.962 --> 00:18:34.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So I love,
Kevin, how Nick

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:39.770 align:middle line:84%
pointed up as if, oh, boy,
this is where they came from.

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:43.170 align:middle line:84%
There was no Photoshop
in those days.

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:46.280 align:middle line:84%
That must've been
an incredible case.

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:49.670 align:middle line:10%
>>RANDLE: If you take a look
at that, the history of UFOs,

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:54.190 align:middle line:10%
you look at the pictures taken
earlier in the 19-- late 1940s,

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:57.510 align:middle line:10%
1950s, 1960s, you
find out 90% of them

00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:00.850 align:middle line:10%
were taken by teenage boys,
and 90% of them are hoaxed.

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:03.744 align:middle line:84%
But there are an awful
lot of very good pictures

00:19:03.744 --> 00:19:05.910 align:middle line:84%
that have not been explained,
and that-- that's just

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:07.180 align:middle line:90%
another example of that.

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:09.670 align:middle line:84%
The McMinnville
sighting from 1950

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:14.500 align:middle line:84%
taken by two farmers in that
area-- a farmer and his wife.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:17.270 align:middle line:84%
You've got movie
footage taken first

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:19.890 align:middle line:84%
in Great Falls, Montana
that shows the object-- two

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:21.290 align:middle line:90%
objects moving across the sky.

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:23.690 align:middle line:84%
You've got the Tremonton,
Utah film taken

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:27.290 align:middle line:90%
by a Navy ward officer in 1952.

00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And you're knowing that if
you're taking movie footage,

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:30.740 align:middle line:84%
these guys would
have had to have

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.300 align:middle line:84%
some kind of a
special effects lab

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:34.540 align:middle line:90%
to be able to fake that stuff.

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:39.190 align:middle line:84%
But you also see them working
very hard-- and not necessarily

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:41.630 align:middle line:84%
the British, but of course,
in the American instance--

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:44.710 align:middle line:84%
to suggest
explanations for that.

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:46.780 align:middle line:84%
And they'll find something
that sort of fits,

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:49.370 align:middle line:84%
and they'll say, well,
that must be what it is.

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:51.570 align:middle line:84%
The Great Falls,
Montana film-- well,

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:53.617 align:middle line:84%
that was two fighter
planes in the area.

00:19:53.617 --> 00:19:55.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, why don't they
ever resolve themselves

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:59.030 align:middle line:84%
so we can see that they're
not these glowing objects

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:00.880 align:middle line:90%
moving across the skyline?

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.750 align:middle line:84%
In the Tremonton, Utah
they say, well, it

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:05.990 align:middle line:90%
was birds soaring on thermos.

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:07.370 align:middle line:90%
And I'm thinking-- seagulls--

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They always have
an excuse for something.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:09.580 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDLE: Yeah.

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:12.300 align:middle line:84%
But I think that explanation
has been around forever.

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think every time I go
out driving around or looking

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:17.440 align:middle line:84%
around, and I've done
this for decades,

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.870 align:middle line:84%
looking at formations
of birds to see

00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:22.370 align:middle line:84%
if they resolve themselves
in the period of time

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:25.080 align:middle line:84%
these things were on that
film, and they always have.

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.170 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
you-- you can see

00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:30.390 align:middle line:84%
for two and a half,
three minutes and say,

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:31.890 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
the heck that is.

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:34.680 align:middle line:84%
They always resolve
themselves in some fashion.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.152 align:middle line:84%
So we get to the Ministry
of Defense in Great Britain,

00:20:37.152 --> 00:20:39.610 align:middle line:84%
and I see them doing the same
things that the United States

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:42.920 align:middle line:84%
Air Force did, probably somewhat
in collusion with the United

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:43.710 align:middle line:90%
States Air Force--

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:44.501 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Had to be.

00:20:44.501 --> 00:20:48.580 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDLE: --taking their notes
from the United States Air

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:49.260 align:middle line:90%
Force.

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:52.120 align:middle line:84%
But you see this sort
of thing going on.

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:55.600 align:middle line:84%
Nobody wants to come
out publicly and say,

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:56.770 align:middle line:90%
I saw a flying saucer.

00:20:56.770 --> 00:21:00.960 align:middle line:84%
Because when they do that,
it impacts their careers.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And to me
it sounds like what

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:07.930 align:middle line:84%
we're dealing with--
physical-- physical craft

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:09.870 align:middle line:90%
from other planetary systems.

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:13.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people will say they're
coming from other dimensions.

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:14.870 align:middle line:90%
They're demons.

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:17.320 align:middle line:84%
They're coming from
a hollow Earth.

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:20.230 align:middle line:84%
I think they're coming from
other planetary systems.

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:21.424 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDLE: I do, too.

00:21:21.424 --> 00:21:23.590 align:middle line:84%
But I also look at some of
these other explanations,

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:24.900 align:middle line:84%
because some of
them are fun-- time

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:26.050 align:middle line:90%
travelers from Earth's future.

00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:26.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Love it.

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:27.630 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDLE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:28.780 align:middle line:90%
Love that one.

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:30.510 align:middle line:90%
Could they be inter-dimensional?

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:31.930 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely they could be.

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:37.780 align:middle line:84%
The evidence suggests they're
solid beings, solid craft

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:40.850 align:middle line:84%
coming from other
worlds in our galaxy

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:42.660 align:middle line:84%
and probably our
portion of the galaxy

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:44.420 align:middle line:90%
given the vast distances.

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:47.320 align:middle line:84%
Unless there's a way to defeat
these vast distances that we're

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:51.940 align:middle line:84%
not aware of, I mean, that's
kind of what it suggests to us.

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:58.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In May of 2015, a
couple great UFO researchers,

00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:01.000 align:middle line:90%
I think, got duped.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.840 align:middle line:84%
There was a huge story that
they had in their possession

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:10.040 align:middle line:84%
slides of actual
pictures-- when we had

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:12.980 align:middle line:90%
slides-- of extraterrestrials.

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:14.570 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at that video.

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:16.380 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIME MAUSSEN:
We have hybrids.

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:21.260 align:middle line:84%
It's a very-- the two cases,
even though the creatures

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:24.750 align:middle line:84%
are different, they
have some similitude,

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:26.970 align:middle line:84%
like the size--
20-- 20 centimeters,

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:33.060 align:middle line:84%
around 20 centimeters, or
let's say seven, eight inches.

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And you have this DNA
somehow very similar,

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:43.100 align:middle line:84%
demonstrating some kind
of experiment-- hybrids

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:45.510 align:middle line:84%
that are being
created here on Earth.

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:49.480 align:middle line:84%
There are many questions--
why, who did it?

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.870 align:middle line:84%
But you have the
evidence right there.

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:53.880 align:middle line:90%
I have it in my position.

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.870 align:middle line:84%
But it's very
difficult to advance.

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:59.720 align:middle line:84%
I have six different
analyses of DNA.

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And we cannot prove this,
because nobody is willing

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:08.290 align:middle line:84%
to take it exactly with that
kind of creature, you know?

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:11.860 align:middle line:90%
To take it to a different level.

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:14.700 align:middle line:84%
But you have two
cases, physical,

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.470 align:middle line:84%
where it's physical
evidence that could

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:21.000 align:middle line:90%
prove that we are not alone.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.760 align:middle line:84%
I believe those
are smoking guns.

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.498 align:middle line:84%
There are many others,
but right there you

00:23:26.498 --> 00:23:32.200 align:middle line:84%
have these cases and this
evidence that proved that there

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.672 align:middle line:90%
is something going on.

00:23:33.672 --> 00:23:35.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So Kevin,
that was Jaime Maussan

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:38.390 align:middle line:84%
from some other cases that
he has been working on.

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:42.260 align:middle line:84%
But the creatures were very
similar to some of the pictures

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:43.550 align:middle line:90%
we saw on those slides.

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:45.340 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDLE: What you
see in the slide

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:50.040 align:middle line:84%
that they had in Mexico is--
well, in fact, it's a mummy.

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:54.020 align:middle line:84%
But there's mummies from
around the world that have

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:57.710 align:middle line:90%
the same sort of look to them.

00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:00.760 align:middle line:84%
So-- so when, I
think, Tom and Don

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:03.330 align:middle line:84%
had an opportunity to
see scans of the slides,

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:07.190 align:middle line:84%
and it was suggested to them
what this was, they were-- they

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:09.380 align:middle line:90%
attempted to validate that.

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:14.060 align:middle line:84%
But the being in the slides
does have an alien look to it--

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:14.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:15.740 align:middle line:90%
There's no-- no doubt.

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:16.660 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDLE: --when you look at it.

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:18.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It looks like the
little creature Steven Greer

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:19.890 align:middle line:90%
has been running around with.

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:20.473 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDLE: Yes.

00:24:20.473 --> 00:24:21.240 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:24.180 align:middle line:84%
So-- so when they're
presented with this--

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:29.780 align:middle line:84%
and they went to Kodak to
validate the slide image-- not

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:30.780 align:middle line:90%
the image but the slide.

00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:31.705 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The slides themselves.

00:24:31.705 --> 00:24:33.038 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDLE: The slides themselves.

00:24:33.038 --> 00:24:36.340 align:middle line:84%
They found out that the slide
holder was from the proper era,

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:39.050 align:middle line:84%
and apparently testing
on the chemicals used

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:42.250 align:middle line:84%
for the creation of the film
and the developing process

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:44.090 align:middle line:90%
was from the late 1940s.

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:46.227 align:middle line:84%
So they were able
to date the slides

00:24:46.227 --> 00:24:48.060 align:middle line:84%
to the proper era,
which, of course, doesn't

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:49.740 align:middle line:84%
make the image in it
an alien creature.

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:52.780 align:middle line:84%
It just means the photograph
was taken in the proper time.

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:55.807 align:middle line:84%
And I think that also
suggested to them

00:24:55.807 --> 00:24:57.640 align:middle line:84%
that they're dealing
with something that had

00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.290 align:middle line:90%
to do with the Roswell case.

00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:02.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When people are
duped or that there are some,

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:05.640 align:middle line:84%
you know, fraud
involved from people,

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.040 align:middle line:90%
does that hurt the field?

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:11.870 align:middle line:84%
Does that destroy things that
people like you who are honest,

00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:14.730 align:middle line:84%
hardworking, no
nonsense researchers,

00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:16.370 align:middle line:90%
does that screw that up for you?

00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:18.010 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDLE: Absolutely.

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:22.560 align:middle line:84%
Remember, um, people know
who Bill Buckner is not

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:24.795 align:middle line:84%
because he was a
great baseball player,

00:25:24.795 --> 00:25:27.510 align:middle line:84%
but because he missed
one ground ball.

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:31.520 align:middle line:84%
And they remember that, and
it kind of follows his career.

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.410 align:middle line:84%
That's what they know
about Bill Buckner.

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:36.500 align:middle line:84%
So when you get into the UFO
field, which right there is

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:41.740 align:middle line:84%
controversial enough, and
somebody is involved in a hoax,

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:44.870 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the alien autopsy
or one of these other things,

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:46.730 align:middle line:84%
people remember the
hoax and say, oh, well,

00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:47.920 align:middle line:90%
the whole thing is a fraud.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:51.370 align:middle line:90%
So anything like this hurts us.

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:56.662 align:middle line:84%
Had-- I think had Don and Tom
not been so enthusiastic--

00:25:56.662 --> 00:25:57.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they were.

00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:59.320 align:middle line:84%
Because they came on
my show, the radio

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:02.740 align:middle line:84%
show prior to, along
with Richard Dolan,

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:04.850 align:middle line:84%
and I mean, you
would think, my god.

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:06.260 align:middle line:90%
We finally got it.

00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:07.230 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDLE: Yes.

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And I think-- I think Tom
more so than Don was really

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:16.960 align:middle line:84%
wanting the evidence, the
solid proof, that Roswell

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:17.950 align:middle line:90%
was extraterrestrial.

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:20.030 align:middle line:90%
And he thinks, now I've got it.

00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And I-- I emailed
him in December

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:24.840 align:middle line:90%
of this-- of last year.

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to
think of-- without having

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:30.050 align:middle line:84%
seen the slides-- what
could it possibly be?

00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And the only things
I could think of

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:34.535 align:middle line:84%
was it was some kind of creation
for a movie in the 1940s.

00:26:34.535 --> 00:26:36.777 align:middle line:84%
And I went through the
books I have on that suff--

00:26:36.777 --> 00:26:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good point.

00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:39.350 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDLE: --and look for it
and couldn't find anything.

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:42.060 align:middle line:84%
I looked at magazine covers
from the 1940s science fiction,

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:44.050 align:middle line:90%
and they went really weird.

00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
I thought, well,

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:47.049 align:middle line:84%
could it possibly
have been a mummy,

00:26:47.049 --> 00:26:49.600 align:middle line:84%
given that it was
supposedly found

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:52.995 align:middle line:84%
in southern-- southeastern--
southwestern United States?

00:26:52.995 --> 00:26:54.120 align:middle line:90%
Could it have been a mummy?

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And Tom wrote back,
no, it's not a mummy.

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:58.080 align:middle line:84%
So we've looked at 500
images, it's not them.

00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And I think what Tom
was doing was looking

00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:02.000 align:middle line:84%
for that specific
image as opposed

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.610 align:middle line:84%
to seeing how closely
their image matched

00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:07.490 align:middle line:90%
these other images as well.

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:09.974 align:middle line:84%
I think he got-- just
got too enthusiastic

00:27:09.974 --> 00:27:11.390 align:middle line:84%
about the whole
thing, and I think

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:13.930 align:middle line:84%
that's what kind
of led him astray.

00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:16.710 align:middle line:84%
Don has said to me that he was
believing what the experts were

00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:18.793 align:middle line:84%
saying, and some of the
experts were saying, well,

00:27:18.793 --> 00:27:21.390 align:middle line:84%
this is clearly not
a human of any kind.

00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:24.170 align:middle line:84%
And so he believed what
the experts were saying.

00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:29.240 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, within days
of the slides being released

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:31.597 align:middle line:84%
so that everybody
could see them,

00:27:31.597 --> 00:27:33.430 align:middle line:84%
it was discovered that
this was a mummy that

00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:34.820 align:middle line:90%
had been on display in--

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:37.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Instantly people got--

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:40.250 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDLE: --in a
Mesa Verde museum.

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And coincidentally, the mummy
had been moved in May of 1947

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:51.600 align:middle line:84%
to Montezuma's castle, which
is another museum in Arizona.

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:54.737 align:middle line:84%
So they knew the pictures were
now taken part of May of 1947.

00:27:54.737 --> 00:27:57.070 align:middle line:84%
But it's clearly the pictures
were taken in this museum,

00:27:57.070 --> 00:27:59.470 align:middle line:84%
because the floor matches,
the other placards match.

00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:01.390 align:middle line:84%
You can see other displays
in the background.

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:03.900 align:middle line:84%
But once-- but from
what Don told me,

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:07.090 align:middle line:84%
he had never seen
the actual slides.

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:09.130 align:middle line:84%
He and Tom and been
working from scans.

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:10.019 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah.

00:28:10.019 --> 00:28:12.060 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDLE: And had they'd
seen the actual slides--

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:13.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They might have known.

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:13.450 align:middle line:90%
They might have known better.

00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:14.510 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDLE: Well, I
think the placard

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:16.010 align:middle line:84%
would have been
read, because it was

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:19.010 align:middle line:84%
read so easily when they got
a scan of sufficient quality.

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And that was taken off
Adam Due's website.

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:25.480 align:middle line:84%
The day after the
reveal in Mexico City,

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:28.169 align:middle line:84%
he put up a better quality
scan on his website.

00:28:28.169 --> 00:28:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's what people
used to deblur the placard

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:31.660 align:middle line:90%
to see what it said.

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:32.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:37.110 align:middle line:84%
We have a call from Cindy in
Fort Worth, Texas for you.

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:38.314 align:middle line:90%
Let's see what Cindy has.

00:28:38.314 --> 00:28:40.272 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: This is Cindy
in Fort Worth, Texas.

00:28:40.272 --> 00:28:42.024 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to
know if Kevin thinks

00:28:42.024 --> 00:28:44.110 align:middle line:84%
there's a piece of
evidence that stands out

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:47.072 align:middle line:84%
from the rest that shows
us that UFOs represent

00:28:47.072 --> 00:28:47.780 align:middle line:90%
alien visitation.

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:52.015 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of course, that
is the $64,000 question.

00:28:52.015 --> 00:28:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDLE: And I think
there's a good answer for it,

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:56.340 align:middle line:84%
and I think we talked about
it a little bit earlier,

00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:58.210 align:middle line:84%
and that would be
the Levelland case.

00:28:58.210 --> 00:29:01.010 align:middle line:84%
Because here you have all
these independent witnesses,

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:03.490 align:middle line:84%
including law
enforcement who see it.

00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:06.660 align:middle line:84%
You've got the UFO interacting
with the environment,

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:09.940 align:middle line:84%
stalling the car engines, and
there's a misnomer about that.

00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:12.711 align:middle line:84%
People think that the cars
restart spontaneously.

00:29:12.711 --> 00:29:14.460 align:middle line:84%
But if you go back and
you read the cases,

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:17.800 align:middle line:84%
you realize that the driver did
something to start the engine.

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:20.880 align:middle line:84%
The electromagnetic
field stalled the engine,

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.020 align:middle line:90%
they had to restart it.

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:23.436 align:middle line:84%
It didn't come
back spontaneously.

00:29:23.436 --> 00:29:24.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:26.330 align:middle line:84%
Close encounters
of the third kind.

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:28.500 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDLE: There is
discussion-- Don Burleson, who

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:32.310 align:middle line:84%
went into Levelland in
2000 I think it was,

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:34.250 align:middle line:84%
talked to the daughter
of the sheriff.

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:36.670 align:middle line:84%
He said that there was a
landing trace, which nobody

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:37.820 align:middle line:90%
had heard of prior to that.

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:39.565 align:middle line:84%
And that's because the Air
Force moved in and shut

00:29:39.565 --> 00:29:40.850 align:middle line:90%
that sort of thing down.

00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Within hours, there was
another series of sightings

00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:47.570 align:middle line:90%
at White Sands Missile Range.

00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And there is now discussion that
one of those service members

00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:54.160 align:middle line:90%
was injured.

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.534 align:middle line:84%
And the reason the Air
Force didn't interview him--

00:29:56.534 --> 00:29:57.950 align:middle line:84%
they interviewed
the other three--

00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:00.000 align:middle line:84%
they didn't interview him,
because he was in the hospital.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.417 align:middle line:84%
And nobody wanted to mention
that one of them was injured

00:30:02.417 --> 00:30:03.250 align:middle line:90%
and in the hospital.

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:05.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to
check that out now.

00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And I've spent months
trying to get the morning

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:11.060 align:middle line:84%
reports from that
unit at that time,

00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:12.940 align:middle line:84%
because it'll tell
me where the guy was.

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:15.420 align:middle line:84%
The explanation was he
was on a three-day pass.

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:17.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know and I know
that a three-day pass

00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:19.730 align:middle line:90%
has a limited range you can go.

00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:20.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.254 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDLE: So that
you can get back.

00:30:21.254 --> 00:30:21.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You've got to get back.

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:22.620 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDLE: If you can get back.

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And they don't want you trying
to make a long drive home

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:27.432 align:middle line:84%
and getting killed
in a car wreck.

00:30:27.432 --> 00:30:29.723 align:middle line:84%
So had the guy been on a
three-day day pass and the Air

00:30:29.723 --> 00:30:31.515 align:middle line:84%
Force sends an officer
down to investigate,

00:30:31.515 --> 00:30:33.890 align:middle line:84%
they could have got the guy
back within a matter of hours

00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:34.872 align:middle line:90%
to interview.

00:30:34.872 --> 00:30:36.330 align:middle line:84%
So the question
is, why didn't they

00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:38.580 align:middle line:84%
interview him and
get his word as well?

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:41.810 align:middle line:84%
So there's just this string
of sightings that took place

00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:45.210 align:middle line:84%
on November 2, November
3 of 1957 that is just

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:47.020 align:middle line:84%
an incredible string
of sightings that

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:48.730 align:middle line:90%
may have given us the answers.

00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:53.500 align:middle line:84%
But people were so busy arguing
about the number of witnesses

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.770 align:middle line:84%
and that sort of
thing, that they

00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:59.132 align:middle line:84%
didn't get to the point of
really investigating the case.

00:30:59.132 --> 00:31:00.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing stuff.

00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:02.590 align:middle line:84%
You had mentioned the
Japanese Airlines case.

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And I want us to look at a
video for a Japanese airlines

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:09.430 align:middle line:90%
case that is pretty compelling.

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:12.220 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: On
November 17, 1986,

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:15.970 align:middle line:10%
a Boeing 747 cargo freighter
with Japan Airlines

00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:19.910 align:middle line:10%
was flying over Alaska en
route to Narita, Tokyo.

00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:22.430 align:middle line:10%
The pilot was Captain
Kenju Terauchi,

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:25.080 align:middle line:10%
an ex-fighter pilot with
more than 10,000 hours

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:26.920 align:middle line:10%
of flying experience.

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:30.160 align:middle line:10%
With him were co-pilot
Takanori Tamefuji and flight

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.820 align:middle line:10%
engineer Yoshio Tsukuba.

00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:36.270 align:middle line:10%
After entering Alaskan
airspace shortly after 5:00 PM,

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:38.990 align:middle line:10%
Captain Terauchi noticed
two lights in the distance

00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:41.020 align:middle line:10%
keeping pace with the
plane, so that they

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:44.570 align:middle line:10%
appeared to be standing still
from inside the cockpit.

00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:47.730 align:middle line:10%
Tamefuji radioed in to
Anchorage Air Centre in Alaska

00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:50.530 align:middle line:10%
to ask if there were any
aircraft in the area.

00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:52.330 align:middle line:90%
They said that there were not.

00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:54.530 align:middle line:84%
The apparent object
once again showed up

00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:57.750 align:middle line:84%
on the flight crew's radar and
an operator at Elmendorf Air

00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Force Base picked up
an uncorrelated target

00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:02.030 align:middle line:90%
in the plane's vicinity.

00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:05.580 align:middle line:84%
The operator watched the
target move around Flight 1628

00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:08.820 align:middle line:84%
at the exact time and
in the exact same manner

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:12.200 align:middle line:84%
that Terauchi described while
viewing the object in person.

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:15.290 align:middle line:84%
The radar operator in Anchorage
also picked up the target

00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:18.410 align:middle line:84%
at certain points
in the sighting.

00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:21.260 align:middle line:84%
The FAA control tower
requested that Terauchi

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:24.070 align:middle line:84%
perform a 360-degree
turn in order

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:26.330 align:middle line:84%
to see if the
object would follow.

00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:29.840 align:middle line:84%
The Elmendorf operator watched
this turn on his radar screen

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:32.090 align:middle line:84%
and confirmed that the
unknown object trailed

00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:34.360 align:middle line:84%
the plane the entire
time then returned

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:37.976 align:middle line:84%
to the same position in which
it had been before the turn.

00:32:37.976 --> 00:32:40.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kevin, that seems
like a pretty authentic case.

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:42.870 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDLE: It's-- it's
one of the great cases,

00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:45.170 align:middle line:84%
because you have multiple
chains of evidence.

00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:47.170 align:middle line:84%
You have the sighting
by the witnesses.

00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:51.360 align:middle line:84%
You have credible witnesses
who are experienced airmen.

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:54.200 align:middle line:90%
There is discussion of radar.

00:32:54.200 --> 00:33:00.650 align:middle line:84%
The FAA has a complete
set of the entire incident

00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:02.130 align:middle line:90%
on radar tapes.

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:05.827 align:middle line:84%
And John Callahan, who
was the lead investigator

00:33:05.827 --> 00:33:07.910 align:middle line:84%
on that-- I've spoken to
him personally and talked

00:33:07.910 --> 00:33:09.190 align:middle line:90%
to him about that.

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And he talked about how they had
been called to the White House

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:14.070 align:middle line:90%
to present their evidence.

00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And once they were
done, he noted

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:18.300 align:middle line:84%
there were a couple of
fellows from the CIA there.

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And he was told by them--
we were never here.

00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:21.360 align:middle line:90%
Don't mention that.

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:24.310 align:middle line:84%
But you've got a complete log
of everything that happened,

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:29.300 align:middle line:84%
timed out, so that you can watch
it in real time, if you will.

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:33.129 align:middle line:84%
And I mentioned that reporting
UFOs impact on your career.

00:33:33.129 --> 00:33:33.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:37.190 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDLE: Once that
sighting came out,

00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:39.880 align:middle line:84%
the captain was removed
from flying duty.

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:41.340 align:middle line:90%
He was now flying a desk.

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:42.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They thought he
was drinking or something.

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:43.100 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDLE: Yeah.

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:44.270 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't be trusted.

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:46.160 align:middle line:84%
You see the same thing
from Air Force pilots.

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:48.440 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to report
UFOs for the same reason--

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:52.140 align:middle line:84%
commercial pilots,
police officers.

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Manuel Amparo, who saw
an object in California,

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.330 align:middle line:90%
was burned by it.

00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:01.540 align:middle line:84%
The documentation shows
that he was burned.

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:06.810 align:middle line:84%
A workman's compensation
claim was filed for him

00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:11.320 align:middle line:84%
to be compensated for this, so
you've got the documentation.

00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:17.679 align:middle line:84%
And I just got an email from
him in the last week about how

00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:19.090 align:middle line:90%
it had affected his career.

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:20.639 align:middle line:84%
And he was not
promoted as he should

00:34:20.639 --> 00:34:22.510 align:middle line:84%
have been because
the sheriff didn't

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:24.306 align:middle line:90%
like being involved with UFOs.

00:34:24.306 --> 00:34:25.889 align:middle line:84%
So you see it impacting
their careers.

00:34:25.889 --> 00:34:28.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad to say the captain
here got back to flying status,

00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:31.760 align:middle line:84%
and that was at the thanks
of a number of Americans

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.584 align:middle line:84%
as well that helped
him get back--

00:34:33.584 --> 00:34:35.709 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's still out
there now doing this thing,

00:34:35.709 --> 00:34:36.570 align:middle line:90%
or is he retired now?

00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:38.486 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDLE: I'm not sure
if he's still doing it,

00:34:38.486 --> 00:34:39.510 align:middle line:90%
because this was 1986.

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:41.199 align:middle line:84%
He's probably
retired by this time,

00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:43.047 align:middle line:84%
but he eventually got
back to flying status.

00:34:43.047 --> 00:34:44.130 align:middle line:90%
But this was a great case.

00:34:44.130 --> 00:34:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And again, if it had been
investigated properly

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:50.590 align:middle line:84%
at the time-- there
are two radar tracks,

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:53.820 align:middle line:84%
the one the FAA kept, and
then they saw the object also

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:55.480 align:middle line:90%
on their on-board radar.

00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:59.050 align:middle line:84%
So there were two
separate radar sightings.

00:34:59.050 --> 00:35:01.580 align:middle line:84%
There apparently
is a single feed

00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:03.510 align:middle line:84%
that goes into the
air defense radar that

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:05.820 align:middle line:90%
also goes to the FAA radar.

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:08.430 align:middle line:84%
They have different
discriminators on them,

00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:10.210 align:middle line:84%
so you don't get the
same sort of things.

00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And I communicated with Peterson
Field Cheyenne Mountain to see

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:20.390 align:middle line:84%
if I could learn anything about
it but couldn't-- couldn't find

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:24.640 align:middle line:84%
out if there was a
different radar feed.

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:26.017 align:middle line:84%
Getting two
different radar feeds

00:35:26.017 --> 00:35:27.600 align:middle line:84%
would be an important
thing as opposed

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:30.950 align:middle line:84%
to a single feed that was split
into two different arenas.

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:33.010 align:middle line:84%
But you do have two
separate radars.

00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:34.380 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that would
have made it better--

00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:35.671 align:middle line:90%
if their pictures had come out.

00:35:35.671 --> 00:35:36.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, exactly.

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:38.330 align:middle line:90%
What does this tell you, Kevin?

00:35:38.330 --> 00:35:43.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm sure deep down
inside you've concluded

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:45.690 align:middle line:90%
some things about all of this.

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:47.890 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you haven't
published it yet,

00:35:47.890 --> 00:35:50.720 align:middle line:84%
but I have a
feeling, a suspicion,

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:52.490 align:middle line:84%
your gut is telling
you something.

00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:53.380 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:57.620 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDLE: It's very clear that
the United States government

00:35:57.620 --> 00:36:01.537 align:middle line:84%
has manipulated the data to lead
us to a specific conclusion,

00:36:01.537 --> 00:36:02.870 align:middle line:90%
and you can see that repeatedly.

00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:04.578 align:middle line:84%
The Condon Committee,
which was down here

00:36:04.578 --> 00:36:08.060 align:middle line:84%
at the University
of Colorado, clearly

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:11.890 align:middle line:84%
had-- from the documentation--
their conclusions

00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:12.955 align:middle line:90%
given to them prior.

00:36:12.955 --> 00:36:15.770 align:middle line:84%
They accepted the money and
began the investigation.

00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:19.710 align:middle line:84%
There were cases that took place
during their investigation,

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:23.110 align:middle line:84%
Shag Harbor being an example,
which is a great case filled

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:24.320 align:middle line:90%
with documentation.

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:26.130 align:middle line:84%
All they did was make
a telephone call,

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:27.838 align:middle line:84%
decide that the
witnesses were teenagers,

00:36:27.838 --> 00:36:29.400 align:middle line:84%
and didn't bother
to follow up on it.

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:30.850 align:middle line:84%
This is during
their investigation

00:36:30.850 --> 00:36:31.910 align:middle line:90%
they didn't do that.

00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:37.940 align:middle line:84%
They concluded that a
UFO sighting in Labrador

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:43.890 align:middle line:84%
in the 1950s was a natural
phenomenon so rare it had never

00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:45.680 align:middle line:90%
been seen before or since.

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:47.820 align:middle line:84%
What the hell kind of
an explanation is that?

00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:50.139 align:middle line:90%
That could be a flying saucer.

00:36:50.139 --> 00:36:50.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:53.060 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDLE: An alien spacecraft.

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:55.810 align:middle line:84%
Condon said-- before
he wrote the report--

00:36:55.810 --> 00:36:58.220 align:middle line:84%
and he said it in front
of a number of scientists,

00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:01.437 align:middle line:84%
that there's nothing
to this, but I'm not

00:37:01.437 --> 00:37:03.520 align:middle line:84%
supposed to come to that
conclusion for another 18

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:04.580 align:middle line:90%
months.

00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:07.250 align:middle line:84%
There is a letter from an Air
Force officer to the Condon

00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:10.490 align:middle line:84%
committee that says we need to
get-- we need to stop this now.

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:12.577 align:middle line:84%
Because if you guys don't
conclude it this way,

00:37:12.577 --> 00:37:14.660 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be stuck
investigating these things

00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:16.280 align:middle line:90%
for-- it continues on.

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:17.740 align:middle line:90%
This is our chance to end it.

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:19.757 align:middle line:84%
And they said, yeah, OK,
we'll do what you want.

00:37:19.757 --> 00:37:20.590 align:middle line:90%
So they followed it.

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:23.230 align:middle line:84%
They said something positive
about the Air Force-- Condon

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:25.850 align:middle line:84%
said something positive about
the Air Force investigation.

00:37:25.850 --> 00:37:29.180 align:middle line:84%
But he said it didn't
affect national security,

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:32.357 align:middle line:84%
and they should close
out the investigation

00:37:32.357 --> 00:37:34.565 align:middle line:84%
because nothing of a scientific
value would be found.

00:37:34.565 --> 00:37:36.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's how they
qualify these things.

00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:36.940 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDLE: Yes.

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:39.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to conclude
this with a little clip

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:42.730 align:middle line:84%
of our friend Apollo 14
astronaut, Edgar Mitchell,

00:37:42.730 --> 00:37:44.710 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll come back
and talk very briefly

00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:47.130 align:middle line:84%
about a controversy
surrounding that.

00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:48.097 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:37:48.097 --> 00:37:50.430 align:middle line:10%
>>EDGAR MITCHELL: Let's put
all that aside for a moment,

00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:53.070 align:middle line:10%
because we're here to
talk about disclosure.

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:55.020 align:middle line:10%
And what I am
suggesting is it is now

00:37:55.020 --> 00:38:06.780 align:middle line:10%
time to put away this embargo of
truth about the alien presence.

00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:10.650 align:middle line:10%
And I call upon our
government to open up

00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:13.030 align:middle line:10%
like other governments have--
and you will hear about

00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:15.230 align:middle line:10%
that this morning--
like the Belgians have,

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:17.690 align:middle line:10%
the French have,
the Brazilians have,

00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:21.730 align:middle line:10%
the Argentines, the Mexicans
have all released their files.

00:38:21.730 --> 00:38:24.710 align:middle line:10%
It's about time now that
we do the same thing

00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:30.220 align:middle line:10%
and become a part of this
planetary community that is now

00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:35.572 align:middle line:10%
trying to take our proper role
as a space faring civilization.

00:38:35.572 --> 00:38:37.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kevin, Edgar Mitchell
has told me personally

00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:40.520 align:middle line:84%
that he has never seen a
UFO, did not see anything

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:43.800 align:middle line:84%
on the moon, but that
he is a staunch believer

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:47.550 align:middle line:84%
that this planet is being
visited by extraterrestrials.

00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:50.350 align:middle line:84%
A little controversy
lately where

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:52.880 align:middle line:84%
he was quoted by a
British newspaper

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:56.150 align:middle line:84%
as saying that
extraterrestrials saved us

00:38:56.150 --> 00:39:00.060 align:middle line:84%
from a nuclear war between the
United States and the Soviet

00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:01.220 align:middle line:90%
Union.

00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:04.120 align:middle line:84%
Edgar has said that
is not what I said.

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:06.090 align:middle line:90%
The paper stands behind it.

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:09.340 align:middle line:84%
Bottom line still is
you've got an Apollo 14

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:12.360 align:middle line:84%
astronaut, a man who
walked on the moon, who

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:14.617 align:middle line:90%
believes we're being visited.

00:39:14.617 --> 00:39:16.450 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDLE: And he's not
alone in that belief.

00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:18.484 align:middle line:84%
There's an awful
lot of astronauts.

00:39:18.484 --> 00:39:20.150 align:middle line:84%
There's an awful lot
of military pilots.

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:21.900 align:middle line:84%
There's an awful lot
of military officers,

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:24.584 align:middle line:84%
a lot of police officers,
astronomers, you name it.

00:39:24.584 --> 00:39:26.500 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of people
who believe that we're

00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:30.010 align:middle line:84%
being visited, but they're
very reticent to say anything

00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:31.540 align:middle line:90%
because it impacts their career.

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:32.509 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It does.

00:39:32.509 --> 00:39:34.050 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDLE: J. Allen
Hynek did a survey

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:37.127 align:middle line:84%
in 1952 of a large
number of astronomers--

00:39:37.127 --> 00:39:38.460 align:middle line:90%
whether they had seen something.

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:40.730 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them didn't even want
to bother with the question,

00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:42.105 align:middle line:84%
but some of them
said, yes, we've

00:39:42.105 --> 00:39:46.950 align:middle line:84%
seen some very strange
things that are inexplicable.

00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:49.410 align:middle line:84%
So we've got a wide range
of people saying it,

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:51.740 align:middle line:84%
but there is, as he
said, an embargo on this.

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:55.360 align:middle line:84%
Because if you say
these things openly,

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:57.520 align:middle line:84%
it impacts your career--
with the exception

00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:58.950 align:middle line:90%
maybe of James A. Van Allen.

00:39:58.950 --> 00:40:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And I had an opportunity
to interview him right

00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:04.460 align:middle line:84%
after we began the
Roswell investigation.

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:07.617 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him
about scientists

00:40:07.617 --> 00:40:09.950 align:middle line:84%
not being interested in this,
and he was very interested

00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:10.450 align:middle line:90%
in this.

00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about
the Tunguska explosion,

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:16.090 align:middle line:84%
and he was very
interested in that.

00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:18.700 align:middle line:84%
But he says, well, if you're
in the middle of Wyoming,

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:20.240 align:middle line:90%
you don't expect to see a zebra.

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:22.200 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean
they're not there,

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:23.437 align:middle line:90%
but you don't expect them.

00:40:23.437 --> 00:40:24.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: True.

00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:25.395 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDLE: And that
long ago I saw

00:40:25.395 --> 00:40:27.570 align:middle line:84%
a report of a zebra running
around loose in Wyoming.

00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:28.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love it.

00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:28.870 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDLE: Which I
thought was hilarious.

00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:29.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It does happen.

00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:30.600 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDLE: It does happen.

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:32.750 align:middle line:84%
But-- but he wasn't
worried about his career,

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:34.696 align:middle line:90%
because he's James Van Allen.

00:40:34.696 --> 00:40:36.070 align:middle line:84%
What are they
going to do to him?

00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:38.500 align:middle line:84%
But people who are
not James Van Allen,

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:40.320 align:middle line:90%
they're very hesitant to speak.

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And I've had people talk to
me off the record about things

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:46.579 align:middle line:84%
that are extraordinary, but you
can't say anything about it.

00:40:46.579 --> 00:40:48.370 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
violate their confidence.

00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:49.640 align:middle line:90%
They were off the record.

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:52.200 align:middle line:84%
But they're telling you
extraordinary things.

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And if all that information
was collected properly

00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:57.197 align:middle line:84%
and investigated
properly, we'd be

00:40:57.197 --> 00:40:59.780 align:middle line:84%
having a different discussion,
which would probably be-- where

00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:01.310 align:middle line:90%
do you think they're from?

00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And are they hostile,
or are they benign?

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the
history of ufology,

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:09.220 align:middle line:90%
you're going back to the 1940s.

00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:10.640 align:middle line:84%
You're saying,
well, they haven't

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:13.530 align:middle line:84%
shown any real hostile
intent to this point,

00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:15.080 align:middle line:84%
but maybe they're
very long lived

00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:17.330 align:middle line:84%
and they're just
planning the invasion.

00:41:17.330 --> 00:41:21.271 align:middle line:84%
I suspect-- I suspect
they're benign, but--

00:41:21.271 --> 00:41:22.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You never know.

00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:23.311 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDLE: You never know.

00:41:23.311 --> 00:41:27.850 align:middle line:84%
But-- but the real point
is the evidence is there,

00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:31.360 align:middle line:84%
and every time you
present good evidence,

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:34.300 align:middle line:84%
there is someone on
the other side who

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:37.400 align:middle line:84%
is going to ridicule it,
whether it is proper or not.

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:39.040 align:middle line:90%
And you see this all the time.

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:40.170 align:middle line:90%
Well, this guy's a liar.

00:41:40.170 --> 00:41:40.950 align:middle line:90%
Why is he a liar?

00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:44.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, he said he saw aliens, and
there is no alien visitation.

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:46.960 align:middle line:10%
Well, you can reject
his testimony,

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:49.800 align:middle line:10%
if you don't like it, but
you cannot reject it for that

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:50.450 align:middle line:10%
reason.

00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:52.670 align:middle line:10%
You have to have a better
reason for rejecting it,

00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:55.040 align:middle line:10%
because he may really
have seen an alien.

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:56.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For people
who want to track you,

00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:59.250 align:middle line:84%
Kevin, and follow you,
give us your blog.

00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:00.830 align:middle line:10%
>>RANDLE: I do an
awful lot of work

00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:02.610 align:middle line:10%
at A Different
Perspective, which

00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:03.901 align:middle line:10%
is at kevinrandle.blogspot.com.

00:42:03.901 --> 00:42:06.600 align:middle line:90%


00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And we link to other blogs
that have relevant information.

00:42:11.490 --> 00:42:18.700 align:middle line:84%
For example, with the May 5th
extravaganza in Mexico City,

00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:20.772 align:middle line:84%
I've linked to a lot
of different places

00:42:20.772 --> 00:42:22.480 align:middle line:84%
where you can get
additional information.

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:23.563 align:middle line:90%
They've linked back to me.

00:42:23.563 --> 00:42:26.865 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of information
about that since May 5th that

00:42:26.865 --> 00:42:27.740 align:middle line:90%
would be interesting.

00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:28.890 align:middle line:90%
So that's the place to go.

00:42:28.890 --> 00:42:30.410 align:middle line:84%
Or you can take a
look at the books,

00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:33.907 align:middle line:84%
because I try to get everything
in the books that is relevant.

00:42:33.907 --> 00:42:34.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you do.

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:36.500 align:middle line:84%
Lieutenant Colonel,
thank you so much.

00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:37.333 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDLE: Thank you.

00:42:37.333 --> 00:42:40.812 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's "The UFO
Dossier" by Kevin Randle.

00:42:40.812 --> 00:42:42.270 align:middle line:10%
Folks, I got to
tell you, you know,

00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:44.890 align:middle line:10%
that book that my mom
gave me many years ago,

00:42:44.890 --> 00:42:48.020 align:middle line:10%
"We Are Not Alone" by
Walter Sullivan, truly

00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:51.620 align:middle line:10%
has had an impact on my
life, because I will always

00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:54.740 align:middle line:10%
believe we are not alone.

00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:58.270 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
