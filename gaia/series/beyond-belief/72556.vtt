00:00:06.045 --> 00:00:08.390 align:middle line:84%
>> I think many people today
don't know what to believe

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:09.236 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

going to keep on to, uh,

00:00:12.032 --> 00:00:13.861 align:middle line:84%

was watching me.

>> We weren't given
all the information,

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.250 align:middle line:84%
we weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.620 align:middle line:84%
>> STEVEN KATES:
Welcome, sky watchers.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.950 align:middle line:84%
Mankind has had a love
affair with the night sky

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.880 align:middle line:90%
since the beginning of time.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.657 align:middle line:84%
I would like to share
that love of all

00:00:35.657 --> 00:00:37.810 align:middle line:90%
that is in the sky with you.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.730 align:middle line:84%
As an astronomer, I have
searched the night sky

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.040 align:middle line:84%
in hopes of gaining a
better understanding of what

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.380 align:middle line:84%
the universe is telling
us, from the surface

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.340 align:middle line:84%
of the moon to the planets
of the solar system

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.100 align:middle line:84%
to the most distant
stars and galaxies.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.750 align:middle line:84%
It is my pleasure to help
educate and entertain

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.900 align:middle line:84%
the masses on all these
great mysteries in hopes

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.770 align:middle line:84%
that mankind will see our
purpose in the universe

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:59.910 align:middle line:90%
and beyond.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.830 align:middle line:84%
Astronomy and space is
truly the final frontier.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.338 align:middle line:84%
Join me as we explore these
great topics, but above all,

00:01:07.338 --> 00:01:11.894 align:middle line:84%
always remember to keep
your eyes to the skies.

00:01:11.894 --> 00:01:13.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Now
isn't that exciting?

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.774 align:middle line:84%
That is Doctor
Sky, Steven Kates.

00:01:15.774 --> 00:01:17.440 align:middle line:10%
You know, ever since
I was a little boy,

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.690 align:middle line:10%
I, too, looked
toward that heavens.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.900 align:middle line:10%
There was nothing more
fascinating for me

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.144 align:middle line:10%
than the night sky.

00:01:24.144 --> 00:01:26.060 align:middle line:10%
Steven, it's always a
pleasure to talk to you.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.110 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: George, a pleasure.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.160 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for having
me here on "Beyond Belief"

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.980 align:middle line:84%
and also, thank you for having
me on your national radio show.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Always, you
do just a great job

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.160 align:middle line:84%
and you provide a great
service to people.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.319 align:middle line:84%
You make looking at
the stars exciting.

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:41.610 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: Well thank you,
George, for those compliments.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.450 align:middle line:10%
As you saw in the
opening piece, uh,

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.080 align:middle line:10%
something that we produced
in our own television studio,

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.150 align:middle line:10%
it's so amazing, folks, to look
into the nighttime sky, George,

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.120 align:middle line:10%
and we all have those
first recollections

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.880 align:middle line:10%
of when we looked at the sky
and-- sad to say, though,

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.930 align:middle line:10%
to your entire audience,
as we know, here

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.030 align:middle line:10%
in the big light
polluted cities here,

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.110 align:middle line:10%
not only around America,
but around the world,

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.360 align:middle line:10%
we have less of an
opportunity to see what maybe

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.800 align:middle line:10%
our forebearers and
our great grandparents

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.139 align:middle line:10%
before us had to see, but
still so much wonderful-- many

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:09.660 align:middle line:10%
wonderful things to see.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When I'm out
on a lake or the ocean,

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.130 align:middle line:84%
or in an area that doesn't
have a big city around it,

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.380 align:middle line:90%
you see so many stars up there.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.080 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely unbelievable.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.001 align:middle line:90%
You can't count them.

00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:23.250 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: And it's amazing,
because a lot of the things

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.208 align:middle line:10%
I'm asked to do, George,
in the education role,

00:02:25.208 --> 00:02:27.380 align:middle line:10%
is to speak in front
of a lot of the schools

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.930 align:middle line:10%
and to the colleges,
and particularly

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:29.846 align:middle line:10%
to the young children.

00:02:29.846 --> 00:02:32.830 align:middle line:84%
I do a lot with the inner
city schools, because so many

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.370 align:middle line:84%
of them, as we know, do not
have the iPhone, the iPad,

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.547 align:middle line:84%
or the opportunity
to ever see that,

00:02:37.547 --> 00:02:39.630 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure, like yourself
and many people who've

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.600 align:middle line:84%
watch the sky and continue
to search for these answers,

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.680 align:middle line:84%
it's so amazing when you hear
the expressions of people

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.110 align:middle line:84%
who look out when you show
them the rings of Saturn,

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.670 align:middle line:90%
for instance.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.066 align:middle line:84%
The most amazing thing that
they say is, wow, this is just--

00:02:52.066 --> 00:02:53.940 align:middle line:84%
and it kind of is
addictive, don't you think?

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.023 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:55.023 --> 00:02:57.930 align:middle line:84%
I remember growing up as
a boy in Detroit, Steven.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.990 align:middle line:84%
My parents bought me a
three-inch refractor telescope.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.870 align:middle line:84%
Now that means the
mirror is three inches,

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.510 align:middle line:84%
it's not a three-inch telescope,
and I was fascinated with that,

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.620 align:middle line:84%
and after about a month or
two of looking at the heavens,

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.787 align:middle line:84%
I found Jupiter, and I found
four little moons around it.

00:03:15.787 --> 00:03:17.370 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: You did
Galileo's experiment.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I found
Saturn and saw the rings,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.070 align:middle line:90%
and I was hooked.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.490 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Oh, it's amazing.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:22.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I had to do that.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.050 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: And that's
what we like to do.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.180 align:middle line:84%
As the role of an
entertainer, trying to be one,

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.830 align:middle line:84%
is let the audience
determine that and the people

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.990 align:middle line:84%
that we speak in front of, but I
think we see so much in science

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.160 align:middle line:84%
today where some people
say, oh, that stuff is just

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.740 align:middle line:84%
so mundane or I don't
have an interest, so I'm

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.280 align:middle line:84%
trying the very best I can,
as a lot of other good people

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.300 align:middle line:84%
are out there, to give us that
inspiration with a little bit--

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.924 align:middle line:84%
how do I say it-- you have to be
a little bit of an entertainer

00:03:44.924 --> 00:03:45.440 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And again, I'm grateful
for being on your show,

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.990 align:middle line:84%
because of all the great
people that are still searching

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.482 align:middle line:84%
for these answers of the
mysteries of the unknown.

00:03:53.482 --> 00:03:55.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind of
competition is out there today?

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.620 align:middle line:84%
With video and your smartphone
and everything else.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.327 align:middle line:84%
For young people, are they
interested in astronomy?

00:04:03.327 --> 00:04:04.910 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: They are,
George, and there's

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.760 align:middle line:84%
so much-- there's a
wealth of information

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.930 align:middle line:84%
out there-- just Google
any of these things.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.680 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
fascinating things, folks,

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.263 align:middle line:84%
is to take a look
in the nighttime sky

00:04:12.263 --> 00:04:13.990 align:middle line:84%
with one of these
go to telescopes.

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.220 align:middle line:84%
So nowadays, people
have a telescope,

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.570 align:middle line:84%
they're kind of forced to
learn this thing, which

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.430 align:middle line:84%
is astro-- it actually
navigates the sky for you,

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.550 align:middle line:84%
so this high technology wasn't
around 20 or 30 years ago,

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.990 align:middle line:84%
but with the advent
of the iPhone

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.480 align:middle line:84%
and the iPad, all these
apps that are out there.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.030 align:middle line:84%
One in particular
that I love is an app

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.970 align:middle line:84%
that's called Exoplanets,
and people can just

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.250 align:middle line:90%
simply download it.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.580 align:middle line:10%
And as you know, and as you
talk to the vast audiences

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.140 align:middle line:10%
across the planet
number three, the Earth,

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.270 align:middle line:10%
we now know that there's
well over 200 more at least

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.885 align:middle line:10%
identifiable exoplanets
and maybe 1,000 or more--

00:04:47.885 --> 00:04:48.760 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Or billions.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.920 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: --or billions.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.480 align:middle line:10%
So this particular app,
George, is so phenomenal

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.990 align:middle line:10%
because it takes you into a
view, graphically, of what

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.120 align:middle line:10%
the whole galaxy, the
Milky Way, looks like,

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.160 align:middle line:10%
and you can move
yourself anywhere there,

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.670 align:middle line:10%
but it shows you the great
distances that are there.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.200 align:middle line:84%
But to answer your
question completely,

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.250 align:middle line:84%
we're just inundated with so
many great technology devices

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.330 align:middle line:84%
today that it's an
assist, but I try

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.810 align:middle line:84%
to do this just the opposite
in many of my programs.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.200 align:middle line:84%
I go back to the
basic star chart,

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.010 align:middle line:84%
just like we had in
National Geographic

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:17.520 align:middle line:90%
when we'd get the paper maps.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.080 align:middle line:10%
I say to people, learn the
nighttime sky the old fashioned

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.480 align:middle line:10%
way, because simply this--
if your batteries fail

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.530 align:middle line:10%
on high tech, now at
least you can remember,

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.510 align:middle line:10%
and people say, and you've
probably heard this,

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.340 align:middle line:10%
it takes like 3,000 repetitive
motions to make something

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.330 align:middle line:10%
a habit, so if you start
using the simplistic way,

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.390 align:middle line:10%
learn the nighttime sky,
because all the people

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.416 align:middle line:10%
that call your shows, they
now have an opportunity

00:05:38.416 --> 00:05:40.790 align:middle line:10%
to report what they're seeing
instead of saying something

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.920 align:middle line:10%
like this, well, the bright
object went from here to there.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.237 align:middle line:90%
Now you're going to know.

00:05:45.237 --> 00:05:47.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like a
kid with a calculator--

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.879 align:middle line:84%
ask them to do
arithmetic without it--

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:50.670 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Precisely.

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:51.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --and they can't.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:52.088 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Exactly.

00:05:52.088 --> 00:05:54.616 align:middle line:84%
So we don't want to depend
too much on the technology,

00:05:54.616 --> 00:05:56.240 align:middle line:84%
though George, the
answer in completion

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.760 align:middle line:84%
is we're so fortunate
to have these tools,

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.740 align:middle line:84%
and I think like anything, in
moderation, it's a great thing,

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.240 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just proud to be able
to share this with the viewers

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.360 align:middle line:84%
today and all the folks
on your radio show.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did the
boy of Steven Kates,

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.454 align:middle line:84%
how did he become
interested in astronomy?

00:06:10.454 --> 00:06:11.870 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: Very quick
story, George.

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.828 align:middle line:84%
I don't really like to
talk a lot about myself,

00:06:13.828 --> 00:06:16.120 align:middle line:84%
but this one, I think,
many people can relate to.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.620 align:middle line:84%
When I was seven years of age,
my parents, Bob and Delores,

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.400 align:middle line:84%
we lived in the big light
pollution of New York City.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.860 align:middle line:84%
They took us to the top
of an apartment building,

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.330 align:middle line:84%
and what happened on this
particular night back in 1966,

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.510 align:middle line:84%
George, I remember
the night exactly,

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.356 align:middle line:90%
it was November the 16 of 1966.

00:06:32.356 --> 00:06:34.730 align:middle line:84%
We were told that there was
going to be this great Leonid

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:37.220 align:middle line:84%
meteor shower that
we still see today,

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.640 align:middle line:84%
and in that great
light pollution

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.292 align:middle line:84%
that we have in New York City,
my parents basically said,

00:06:41.292 --> 00:06:43.000 align:middle line:84%
let's sit it out and
see what we can see.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.940 align:middle line:84%
And we actually
got to see meteors,

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.020 align:middle line:84%
but George, for the
rest of the country,

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.220 align:middle line:84%
there was probably the
most amazing shower

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.900 align:middle line:84%
that morning visible in
the western United States.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.414 align:middle line:10%
How about this, folks-- a half
a million meteors per minute.

00:06:56.414 --> 00:06:57.580 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: To see, to witness?

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.320 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: Imagine seeing them,
like driving through a blinding

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.440 align:middle line:10%
snowstorm, but the
short answer for me

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.000 align:middle line:10%
is they encouraged
the education,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.104 align:middle line:10%
and that's obviously the
thing that I try to do.

00:07:06.104 --> 00:07:08.020 align:middle line:84%
I never had children,
but I'm saying if I did,

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.520 align:middle line:84%
I would certainly
do the same thing,

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.336 align:middle line:84%
and I try my best as a non
parent to help children,

00:07:12.336 --> 00:07:14.210 align:middle line:84%
but for me, it started
off there in New York.

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.960 align:middle line:84%
I was actually a child model
and in television a long time

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.250 align:middle line:84%
in my life, and with
that experience I had,

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:21.720 align:middle line:84%
I had a little extra
time, as I would say,

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:25.030 align:middle line:84%
as I traveled around, to
share with a lot of people

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.710 align:middle line:90%
my early education in astronomy.

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:29.470 align:middle line:84%
But I actually taught
classes in college,

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.557 align:middle line:84%
I taught classes in high school,
I did a lot of adult education

00:07:32.557 --> 00:07:34.640 align:middle line:84%
classes, because just like
all of the viewers that

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.926 align:middle line:84%
watch the show, they want to
know more about the unknown,

00:07:37.926 --> 00:07:39.800 align:middle line:84%
and you can start right
in your own backyard.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.092 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I bet you make it fun.

00:07:41.092 --> 00:07:43.133 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: I try, and thank
you for the compliment.

00:07:43.133 --> 00:07:44.890 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What do
people want to see?

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:45.616 align:middle line:10%
What do they ask?

00:07:45.616 --> 00:07:47.365 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: George, the
most impressive thing

00:07:47.365 --> 00:07:49.010 align:middle line:10%
is that you have a
gathering of folks,

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.940 align:middle line:10%
and what they're going to say
you is-- you know, they're

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.422 align:middle line:10%
honest-- and they say, I really
know nothing about the sky.

00:07:53.422 --> 00:07:54.880 align:middle line:84%
They want to know
first off, how do

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.340 align:middle line:84%
you find the North
Star in the sky,

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.880 align:middle line:84%
and it sounds like
it's a very easy thing,

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.510 align:middle line:84%
and if like when Jay Leno
did all of his on the street,

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:04.437 align:middle line:84%
you know, the man on the street
interviews, a lot of people

00:08:04.437 --> 00:08:06.270 align:middle line:84%
didn't know the answers
to simple questions.

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:08.220 align:middle line:84%
So if you say to people,
can you find the North Star,

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.010 align:middle line:84%
or what's the brightest
star in the sky,

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:12.670 align:middle line:84%
you hear repetitively the
North Star-- how incorrect.

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:14.920 align:middle line:84%
What they want to know is
they want to find the north,

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.329 align:middle line:84%
they want to understand
how to navigate in the sky,

00:08:17.329 --> 00:08:19.120 align:middle line:84%
and I show them a simple
technique, George,

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:19.828 align:middle line:90%
it's real simple.

00:08:19.828 --> 00:08:22.670 align:middle line:10%
If you take your thumb and
index finger and extend it out,

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.200 align:middle line:10%
that's 15 degrees
against the sky.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.080 align:middle line:10%
So I say, try this
experiment at home,

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.520 align:middle line:10%
and it's safe for children
and safe for adults.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.250 align:middle line:10%
Look in the general
direction of north,

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.640 align:middle line:10%
and then they say, well, Dr.
Sky, how do you find north,

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.841 align:middle line:84%
and a simple little compass
will help you there.

00:08:35.841 --> 00:08:37.049 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Until things change.

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:39.640 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: Exactly, until
things change dynamically.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.190 align:middle line:84%
So once you have that for
the local time-- for the time

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:43.909 align:middle line:84%
being, you now
are looking north,

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:46.150 align:middle line:84%
so you're looking into
the nighttime sky.

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.310 align:middle line:10%
From your horizon,
where my thumb would be,

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:51.429 align:middle line:10%
15 degrees is where the index
finger is, so just go up.

00:08:51.429 --> 00:08:52.970 align:middle line:10%
If you're looking
in the north, you'd

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:56.080 align:middle line:10%
be seeing the only bright
star in the northern sky,

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.950 align:middle line:10%
so from Phoenix, where
I'm hailing from,

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:01.535 align:middle line:10%
the North Star is 32 degrees
high, so George, as you know,

00:09:01.535 --> 00:09:04.310 align:middle line:10%
two of these is 30,
and lo and behold,

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:07.120 align:middle line:10%
right above it a few
degrees is the North Star.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.880 align:middle line:84%
So I say to folks,
where would the North

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.338 align:middle line:84%
Star be if you were at the
pole, and we get a lot of people

00:09:11.338 --> 00:09:13.747 align:middle line:84%
jump in and say, of course,
90 degrees overhead.

00:09:13.747 --> 00:09:16.080 align:middle line:84%
But the other things that
they're interested in seeing--

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.390 align:middle line:84%
people are so fascinated
with the moon,

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:21.597 align:middle line:84%
and since the 12 humans that
have gone to the surface

00:09:21.597 --> 00:09:23.680 align:middle line:84%
of the moon, as we all
know, in the great history,

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.580 align:middle line:84%
America's greatest
technology achievement--

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or more if you
listen to "Coast to Coast."

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:28.671 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Oh, yes, there you go.

00:09:28.671 --> 00:09:32.440 align:middle line:84%
Well let's not discount that at
all, but as we talk with NASA,

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.405 align:middle line:84%
say 12 humans that
we think, of course,

00:09:34.405 --> 00:09:36.030 align:middle line:84%
did descend to the
surface of the moon,

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:37.519 align:middle line:84%
people want to know
about the moon,

00:09:37.519 --> 00:09:39.310 align:middle line:84%
because it interacts,
as you know, with all

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:41.890 align:middle line:84%
your great guests, the tides
that we're still dependent

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:42.590 align:middle line:90%
upon.

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:44.950 align:middle line:84%
This particular time and
in the years that we're

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:47.500 align:middle line:84%
doing this particular interview,
in this time of season,

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.220 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing the
moon come very close,

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:51.205 align:middle line:84%
and we all know they're
called super moons.

00:09:51.205 --> 00:09:52.580 align:middle line:84%
They're close
enough to the Earth

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.967 align:middle line:84%
that they are just spectacular,
and people want to know that,

00:09:55.967 --> 00:09:57.800 align:middle line:84%
and they always ask,
when are we going back?

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.925 align:middle line:84%
And I say, I really wish
I knew the answer to that,

00:09:59.925 --> 00:10:01.570 align:middle line:84%
but the truth is,
George, I don't

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:04.092 align:middle line:84%
think we're going back
anytime soon, sad to say.

00:10:04.092 --> 00:10:04.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I agree.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:05.299 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: We

00:10:05.299 --> 00:10:06.262 align:middle line:90%
see so many nations--

00:10:06.262 --> 00:10:07.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Another nation will.

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:08.030 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: I think so.

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:10.446 align:middle line:84%
I mean people look at it and
say the Chinese will probably

00:10:10.446 --> 00:10:12.420 align:middle line:84%
do it, and if you
ask those experts,

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:15.529 align:middle line:84%
they'll probably tell you
within the next 10 years,

00:10:15.529 --> 00:10:16.820 align:middle line:90%
there will probably be manned--

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:18.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we already
won the horse race.

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:23.340 align:middle line:84%
What's so amazing is we
landed there first in 1969.

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.600 align:middle line:84%
They're just
starting to catch up.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:29.380 align:middle line:84%
We were the only country
to have a man on the moon.

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:34.940 align:middle line:84%
Look at us-- here we are
now in 2014-- oh my God,

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:36.834 align:middle line:84%
and they haven't
caught up with us yet.

00:10:36.834 --> 00:10:39.000 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: And now that gap
is shrinking tremendously.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.396 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did we have that
kind of technology so far back

00:10:42.396 --> 00:10:43.520 align:middle line:90%
and they don't have it yet?

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.800 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: It's interesting,
and I don't really

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.460 align:middle line:84%
know the good answer to that,
but I think, as one astronaut,

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.720 align:middle line:84%
and I never got to
actually speak with him,

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.300 align:middle line:84%
but when they had the great
Apollo fire back in January

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:55.190 align:middle line:84%
of '67, Grissom, Chaffee,
and White perished.

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:58.490 align:middle line:84%
Gus Grissom, when asked
in a media environment

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:01.222 align:middle line:84%
for simple interviews,
he said well, they

00:11:01.222 --> 00:11:02.930 align:middle line:84%
asked him this question--
they said, well

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:04.430 align:middle line:84%
what does it take
to be an astronaut

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:06.524 align:middle line:84%
and how do you feel
about going to the moon,

00:11:06.524 --> 00:11:08.940 align:middle line:84%
and they probably would have
been the first manned mission

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:10.340 align:middle line:84%
to the moon if
they didn't perish.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:11.464 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was Apollo 1.

00:11:11.464 --> 00:11:13.970 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: Apollo 1, and
disastrous fire, and people

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:16.960 align:middle line:84%
really don't remember this,
just a horrible oxygen fire.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.454 align:middle line:84%
But what Gus Grissom said,
and he looked the reporters

00:11:19.454 --> 00:11:21.370 align:middle line:84%
in the eye and he said
it rather convincingly,

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:22.900 align:middle line:90%
he said, just do good work.

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean we were just
so polished on getting

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.640 align:middle line:84%
this done not only because of
President Kennedy's mandate,

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.160 align:middle line:84%
but George, if you think back
to all the great scientists--

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.146 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Werner von Braun, his entire
rocket team-- how many people,

00:11:34.146 --> 00:11:35.770 align:middle line:84%
when you go to the
Kennedy Space Center

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:38.490 align:middle line:84%
and see that large Saturn
V lying on its side

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:40.090 align:middle line:90%
are not amazed?

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:43.300 align:middle line:84%
1960s, that
technology was there--

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:46.120 align:middle line:84%
the most powerful machine,
ladies and gentleman, that's

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.970 align:middle line:84%
ever been produced is the
Saturn V rocket made by mankind.

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:50.730 align:middle line:90%
Amazing.

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:53.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm told that
our smart phones today

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:56.100 align:middle line:84%
have more computer
power than what

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:57.225 align:middle line:90%
we had in the lunar module.

00:11:57.225 --> 00:11:59.600 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: You are so correct,
and I've heard it this way--

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.450 align:middle line:84%
if you go to one of
your $0.99 cent stores

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:03.820 align:middle line:84%
and look at one of the
little pocket calculators,

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:07.740 align:middle line:84%
that, even, a little $0.99
item, this particular spacecraft

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:08.950 align:middle line:90%
had less power.

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:10.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unbelievable.

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:10.690 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Totally unbelievable.

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:12.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yet we got to the moon.

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:15.784 align:middle line:84%
So you can only imagine the kind
of technology we have today.

00:12:15.784 --> 00:12:17.200 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: Oh, it's
just incredible.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You would think it
would be simple to go back.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.736 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: I would
think so, George,

00:12:20.736 --> 00:12:22.530 align:middle line:10%
but obviously politics
is a big thing here.

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:23.030 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And money.

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:24.738 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: And money,
that's a major thing.

00:12:24.738 --> 00:12:27.200 align:middle line:10%
I think we're into it, and
as we listen to your shows,

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.222 align:middle line:10%
we hear about a global
meltdown financially,

00:12:29.222 --> 00:12:30.680 align:middle line:10%
and it's not
something that I think

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.490 align:middle line:10%
is fake-- I mean we all
agree something's going on--

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:35.925 align:middle line:10%
but hopefully, better
minds in the world,

00:12:35.925 --> 00:12:38.050 align:middle line:10%
and I would have a little
gripe with NASA thinking,

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:40.350 align:middle line:10%
well, folks, you know,
mining an asteroid may not

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:42.270 align:middle line:10%
necessarily, in my
personal opinion,

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:45.660 align:middle line:10%
be the number primo uno program.

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:48.580 align:middle line:84%
Let us return to the moon, as
Doctor Harrison Schmidt has

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.700 align:middle line:84%
said, the former
United States senator.

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:52.510 align:middle line:84%
We know on the
surface of the moon

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:55.030 align:middle line:84%
that there's an incredible
isotope of helium that

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:57.825 align:middle line:84%
lies within the material
on the surface of the moon.

00:12:57.825 --> 00:12:59.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have to get it
here, but the simple thing

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:02.670 align:middle line:84%
is if we were able to
extrapolate-- or, extract

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:04.500 align:middle line:84%
that and bring it
to the Earth, we

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:08.236 align:middle line:84%
would be able to not
depend on our petro fuels,

00:13:08.236 --> 00:13:09.860 align:middle line:84%
and the whole world
would be different,

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:11.850 align:middle line:84%
as you have great guests
on these subjects.

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:16.196 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe one day, we'd
have a 239,000-foot pipe.

00:13:16.196 --> 00:13:17.320 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: See, there you go.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.195 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right there.

00:13:18.195 --> 00:13:19.870 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: And working 24-7.

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:22.240 align:middle line:10%
To lower-- right,
less dependence

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.490 align:middle line:10%
on fossil fuels, which I
think everybody would agree

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:26.340 align:middle line:10%
on, but again,
some of the things

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.185 align:middle line:10%
that people are asking
me in the programs--

00:13:28.185 --> 00:13:29.560 align:middle line:10%
they want to know
about the moon,

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.894 align:middle line:10%
they want to know about life
in the universe and George,

00:13:31.894 --> 00:13:34.185 align:middle line:10%
I think it's only fair to
mention this to your viewers.

00:13:34.185 --> 00:13:36.810 align:middle line:84%
Probably during my college days,
I was pretty much a skeptic,

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:38.230 align:middle line:90%
and I have to be very honest--

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:38.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Skeptic of?

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:40.644 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: Of the fact of
life in the universe,

00:13:40.644 --> 00:13:43.800 align:middle line:84%
because I kind of looked
along the story of the Drake

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:47.140 align:middle line:84%
Equation, about exoplanets and
planets that would possibly

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:49.980 align:middle line:84%
be habitable, and even then,
I believed that there probably

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:53.252 align:middle line:84%
were planets like that, but the
whole concept of the visitation

00:13:53.252 --> 00:13:54.210 align:middle line:90%
I had a hard time with.

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:57.596 align:middle line:84%
But I've had a total,
complete turnaround on this,

00:13:57.596 --> 00:13:58.970 align:middle line:84%
and it's because
I've interviewed

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:01.880 align:middle line:84%
so many interesting people
in my life that have given me

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.976 align:middle line:84%
that open mindedness
that I once thought,

00:14:03.976 --> 00:14:05.600 align:middle line:84%
and I'm being candid
with the audience.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.558 align:middle line:10%
I was a little less,
because science, sometimes

00:14:07.558 --> 00:14:10.190 align:middle line:10%
what does it do-- it puts
us in these horse blinders

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:13.380 align:middle line:10%
sometimes, and unfortunately,
that kind of academia

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.059 align:middle line:10%
I totally look the
other direction.

00:14:15.059 --> 00:14:16.350 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Now you're a believer.

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:18.580 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: Absolutely, and
I mean that sincerely,

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:21.370 align:middle line:10%
because if we look, George,
at the most interesting thing,

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:25.500 align:middle line:10%
this object that was recently
discovered 16 light years away,

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.315 align:middle line:10%
this Gliese particular planet--

00:14:27.315 --> 00:14:28.440 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Earth-like planet.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.580 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Earth-like planet.

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.740 align:middle line:84%
If it, indeed, is
as they describe,

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:34.142 align:middle line:84%
in that habitable zone,
where life could--

00:14:34.142 --> 00:14:36.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do they
call it, the Goldilocks--

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: The Goldilocks
area, or the region,

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:41.980 align:middle line:84%
this Goldilocks region is
someplace in the solar system,

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:45.600 align:middle line:84%
universe I should say, for stars
or their local solar system,

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.086 align:middle line:84%
where we believe habitation
could occur as if you look

00:14:49.086 --> 00:14:49.960 align:middle line:90%
at the way Earth is--

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:50.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Water is liquid.

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:53.530 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: Water, we have minerals
that we think could be fluid,

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:55.790 align:middle line:10%
we have oxygen,
carbon dioxide, but

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:57.960 align:middle line:10%
in this Gliese
particular star that

00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.620 align:middle line:10%
was 16 light years
away, they're saying

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:02.170 align:middle line:10%
the only problem with that is--
and this is just theoretical

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:04.090 align:middle line:10%
now-- is that the
size of the object

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:06.505 align:middle line:10%
is much larger than
the Earth by five times

00:15:06.505 --> 00:15:09.780 align:middle line:10%
and it probably, George, could
be a hot-- not a hot Jupiter,

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:13.360 align:middle line:10%
but a hot Venus, and we know
the horrible temperatures

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.230 align:middle line:10%
on the surface of
Venus, so, thus,

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:17.490 align:middle line:10%
life as we know it
may not exist there.

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:20.521 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: If you
were to go to Venus,

00:15:20.521 --> 00:15:22.770 align:middle line:10%
and it's been a long time
since we've had any probes--

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:24.395 align:middle line:10%
I think the last one
was a Russian one.

00:15:24.395 --> 00:15:26.394 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: The Venera series,
the Veneras to the--

00:15:26.394 --> 00:15:28.380 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What does Venus
like under the clouds?

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:29.480 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: Very
interesting question.

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.396 align:middle line:84%
If people go and look
at these different apps,

00:15:31.396 --> 00:15:33.360 align:middle line:84%
they see this
scarred planet that

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.940 align:middle line:84%
looks like it's
just been pummeled,

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:37.660 align:middle line:84%
but it has more fractures
from molten material,

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:39.710 align:middle line:84%
so if you looked under
the surface of the Earth

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:42.840 align:middle line:84%
and see these images,
you see lots of scrapes,

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:45.060 align:middle line:84%
so the surface of
Venus, basically, it

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:47.270 align:middle line:84%
looks like it's not really
like a tectonic where

00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:48.680 align:middle line:90%
you moved continents.

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.840 align:middle line:84%
It's as if it bubbled
up and masses were just

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.870 align:middle line:84%
sliding violently
against each other.

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:53.892 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it solid?

00:15:53.892 --> 00:15:55.100 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: We know it is solid.

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:57.555 align:middle line:84%
It's a terrestrial planet, but
the hard thing about Venus,

00:15:57.555 --> 00:15:59.180 align:middle line:84%
and the hard thing
for people to fathom

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:01.700 align:middle line:84%
is, your pressures on
the surface of Venus,

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:04.420 align:middle line:84%
as verified by the
Venera spacecraft,

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:07.300 align:middle line:84%
are well over 15
to 20 atmospheres

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.280 align:middle line:84%
on the surface
with a temperature,

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:13.070 align:middle line:84%
George, get a load of this, of
over 900 degrees Fahrenheit--

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:14.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, that's hot.

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:15.900 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: So here's what
probably happened to the Venera.

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.510 align:middle line:84%
We can't prove this, but
they stopped communicating.

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:21.840 align:middle line:10%
It would be as if I had a
soda can here, was empty,

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:25.250 align:middle line:10%
and I just came by and I just
violently smashed the soda can

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:26.880 align:middle line:10%
in any direction you want.

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.900 align:middle line:10%
That's probably what
happened to the spacecraft,

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.420 align:middle line:10%
because it was meant to
handle a high temperature

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:34.330 align:middle line:10%
environment, but not that high
pressure of an environment.

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:35.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It just--

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:37.790 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: It's crazy, and the
reason, the driving force

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:40.850 align:middle line:84%
for all the temperature on
Venus is a very simple thing.

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:45.070 align:middle line:84%
The day on Venus is
longer than its year,

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:47.140 align:middle line:84%
and the planet
rotates backwards.

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:48.905 align:middle line:90%
So Earth rotates west to east.

00:16:48.905 --> 00:16:50.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's the only
planet that does that.

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: Yes, in our solar
system, correct, but here's

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:55.480 align:middle line:84%
the dynamic, and we
can all relate to this.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:58.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm from Phoenix and
I go out or wherever we're from

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:00.290 align:middle line:90%
or wherever we're watching from.

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:02.570 align:middle line:84%
Just imagine instead of
the sun rising in the east

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:05.540 align:middle line:84%
and going across in
a twelvish-hour day,

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:08.420 align:middle line:84%
the sun on Venus, George,
would rise in the west,

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:13.579 align:middle line:84%
spend some 243 days,
Earth days, moving slowly

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:16.190 align:middle line:84%
across the Venusian
sky, and yet,

00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:18.577 align:middle line:84%
that's insane, because
imagine all the burn

00:17:18.577 --> 00:17:19.410 align:middle line:90%
that you're getting.

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:20.243 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh my gosh.

00:17:20.243 --> 00:17:22.819 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: So it's nothing
but a large pressure cooker.

00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:25.177 align:middle line:10%
It's a global
warming gone crazy--

00:17:25.177 --> 00:17:26.510 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: There's no water there.

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:27.470 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: None that we know of.

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:29.011 align:middle line:84%
I mean that would
be highly unlikely.

00:17:29.011 --> 00:17:30.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mercury, just as bad.

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:32.450 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: Mercury, kind
of an interesting planet.

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:35.080 align:middle line:10%
It has a temperate zone
between the dark and light

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:39.450 align:middle line:10%
on the planet that some say
has temperatures that oscillate

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:41.580 align:middle line:10%
that could be
considered Earth like,

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:43.980 align:middle line:10%
or Phoenix like, but only
for a short period of time.

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:47.770 align:middle line:84%
But there again, nothing that
we would want for habitation.

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:49.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean let's go the
other direction.

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:51.103 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wonder why
the astrologers always

00:17:51.103 --> 00:17:52.994 align:middle line:90%
say Mercury is in retrograde.

00:17:52.994 --> 00:17:54.160 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Right, interesting.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't necessarily
study astrology as much,

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean that's not my
area of specialization,

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:00.360 align:middle line:84%
but I can say this
again-- I have

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:03.030 align:middle line:84%
a profound respect for
this, because I believe,

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:05.880 align:middle line:84%
and who am I to say,
it's just speculation,

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.260 align:middle line:84%
that all the things that
happen in our universe

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:09.420 align:middle line:90%
happen for a reason.

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:10.128 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I agree.

00:18:10.128 --> 00:18:12.920 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: I think everything
is connected, interconnected.

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:14.940 align:middle line:10%
I believe the more
we learn, the more we

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:17.570 align:middle line:10%
come up to looking at some--
I don't know what it is-- some

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:20.400 align:middle line:10%
say the God force, I don't want
to alienate those that believe

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.240 align:middle line:10%
fervently in religion, but
from a scientific perspective,

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:25.290 align:middle line:10%
George, I would say
that, like most people,

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:29.220 align:middle line:10%
common sense-- I believe
some other power or something

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:33.170 align:middle line:10%
is behind the scenes, behind
the curtain, controlling it.

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:34.920 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The puppet
and the puppet master.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.000 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: Absolutely.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.982 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What fascinates you,
Dr. Sky, the most about space?

00:18:40.982 --> 00:18:42.440 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: George,
I think that if we

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:45.750 align:middle line:84%
look at the length and time
for the distance of objects

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:48.660 align:middle line:84%
in space, if we believe, folks,
that the universe started

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:50.870 align:middle line:84%
some 13 and a half
billion years ago

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:53.910 align:middle line:84%
from this tiny
infinitesimally small speck

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:56.562 align:middle line:84%
and it exploded, that
they say, in my hand,

00:18:56.562 --> 00:18:58.770 align:middle line:84%
the size of a grapefruit in
a trillionth of a second.

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have a difficult
time comprehending that.

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:01.215 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Isn't this incredible--

00:19:01.215 --> 00:19:01.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:03.620 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: --that in a
trillionth of a second,

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:05.430 align:middle line:10%
we could see or hold--

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:06.450 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's crazy.

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:08.200 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: --everything--
this conversation,

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.540 align:middle line:10%
all the things in this studio,
every event, every spoken word,

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:12.040 align:middle line:10%
everything--

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:12.873 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Every star.

00:19:12.873 --> 00:19:14.550 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: Every single
thing happened.

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:16.490 align:middle line:10%
So to me, George, the
most amazing thing

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:19.680 align:middle line:10%
is the whole concept
of how this came to be.

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.295 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it did
explode, like the cosmo--

00:19:22.295 --> 00:19:24.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a cosmologist, but
as the cosmologists say,

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:26.755 align:middle line:84%
the explosion that
continues to move on,

00:19:26.755 --> 00:19:29.300 align:middle line:84%
but to answer this
question with specifics,

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:31.070 align:middle line:90%
here's what I would say to you.

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:33.720 align:middle line:84%
What we see, folks, is that
as the universe continues

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.960 align:middle line:84%
to expand, you
would expect, just

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:39.000 align:middle line:84%
like if you throw a
pebble into the calm pond

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.390 align:middle line:84%
and you see the ripple
effect going outward,

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:43.650 align:middle line:84%
eventually that signal
is going to fade out.

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:44.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fade out.

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.691 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Well, what do we know?

00:19:45.691 --> 00:19:47.420 align:middle line:84%
As we go deeper
out into the cosmos

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:50.070 align:middle line:84%
and deeper out into the
universe as it expands,

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:52.569 align:middle line:84%
I'm waiting, like many,
for the slow down, but no.

00:19:52.569 --> 00:19:53.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's not slowing down.

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:54.735 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: We're having
an acceleration--

00:19:54.735 --> 00:19:55.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:56.540 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: --and nobody
can calculate--

00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:57.660 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's the opposite.

00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:58.826 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: Isn't this amazing?

00:19:58.826 --> 00:20:01.750 align:middle line:10%
So to me, that is the most
amazing-- the dark energy

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:02.250 align:middle line:10%
concept.

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:04.041 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And, when you
say it's expanding--

00:20:04.041 --> 00:20:04.920 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Yes.

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:06.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --what's
it expanding into?

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:07.511 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: That's exactly--

00:20:07.511 --> 00:20:09.907 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To me, there's
something on the other end.

00:20:09.907 --> 00:20:10.740 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Sure, sure.

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:11.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't understand.

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:12.640 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: I don't know
it either, George.

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.690 align:middle line:84%
Again, I'm not a
cosmologist, but from reading

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:18.110 align:middle line:84%
and interviewing a lot of folks
on my own shows about this,

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:20.540 align:middle line:84%
there is a good school
of thought out there,

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:22.040 align:middle line:84%
and this may be
sounding laughable

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.580 align:middle line:84%
to many of the viewers,
that the universe is

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:26.834 align:middle line:84%
a series of, like, sausages,
all linked together.

00:20:26.834 --> 00:20:27.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Many of them.

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:30.980 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: Many of these, and
that obviously in the universe,

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:32.980 align:middle line:84%
there's many different
planes-- obviously,

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:34.450 align:middle line:90%
from guests on your show.

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:36.535 align:middle line:84%
We talk about the afterlife,
and what's between.

00:20:36.535 --> 00:20:37.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:38.993 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: We're probably
not able, as humans,

00:20:38.993 --> 00:20:42.210 align:middle line:84%
with our small capacity
brain, to experience these

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:44.490 align:middle line:84%
interdimensional layers,
but what I think,

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:46.590 align:middle line:84%
from reading this, this
is just my opinion,

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:49.600 align:middle line:84%
and you're asking me, that I
believe there's many of these

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.950 align:middle line:84%
segmented sausages called
individual universes and that

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:54.654 align:middle line:84%
there's probably
so many of these,

00:20:54.654 --> 00:20:56.070 align:middle line:84%
which would even
boggle the mind--

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, boy.

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.060 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: --even more.

00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:57.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:20:57.780 --> 00:20:58.880 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: So that is
totally phenomenal.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:01.467 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they all could have
planets and stars and life--

00:21:01.467 --> 00:21:02.300 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Absolutely.

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:02.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --everything.

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:04.450 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: And just here,
I mean think of it.

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:05.908 align:middle line:84%
And I share this
with people-- it's

00:21:05.908 --> 00:21:08.620 align:middle line:84%
common knowledge-- if you take a
laser and point it at the wall,

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:12.560 align:middle line:84%
the light's traveling
186,282 miles per second.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:15.250 align:middle line:84%
We know that, but it didn't
come easy to learn that,

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:18.380 align:middle line:84%
but the more important part
of this is as you look,

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:22.280 align:middle line:84%
the light travel is about
11 million miles a minute.

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.520 align:middle line:10%
So think about this--
if we had astronauts

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.860 align:middle line:10%
on the surface of the moon
and we would communicate,

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:29.030 align:middle line:10%
it would be pretty much
in real time-- hi, George,

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:32.080 align:middle line:10%
how are you on the moon,
1.2 seconds back and forth.

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:35.820 align:middle line:10%
But do Mars, nine or 10
minutes, do Jupiter, 45 minutes,

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:37.680 align:middle line:10%
do Saturn, 74 minutes.

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:40.510 align:middle line:84%
Now that's-- the show
is just starting.

00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:43.997 align:middle line:84%
The nearest star,
4.16 light years away.

00:21:43.997 --> 00:21:46.330 align:middle line:10%
Now, George, we look at the
other side of our Milky Way,

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:50.555 align:middle line:10%
the spiral-- a hundred
to 150,000 light years--

00:21:50.555 --> 00:21:51.680 align:middle line:10%
look how big everything is.

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:52.840 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Those stars
could be gone--

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:53.210 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: Absolutely.

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:54.010 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: --that we're look at.

00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:55.430 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: We're seeing
these flashes of light,

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:57.930 align:middle line:10%
and I tell people, when you
look at the North Star at night,

00:21:57.930 --> 00:21:59.190 align:middle line:10%
do this experiment.

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:02.500 align:middle line:84%
It's allegedly 430
light years away.

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm not smart enough to do the
mental calculation right here

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.950 align:middle line:84%
in the studio, but 2014 minus
430, whatever that answer is,

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:12.550 align:middle line:84%
simply the light left then,
and now it's just getting here.

00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:15.570 align:middle line:84%
So the year that it left,
let's use that as an example,

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:16.580 align:middle line:90%
you're right.

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:18.460 align:middle line:10%
It might have
changed dynamically,

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:21.080 align:middle line:10%
it may be totally gone, it--
and that's only a small one.

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:22.000 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And we've
changed dramatically

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.100 align:middle line:10%
by the time it got here.

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:24.230 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: Most definitely.

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:27.030 align:middle line:10%
So the time dilation that
Einstein talked about,

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:29.160 align:middle line:10%
the distance of these
objects in space,

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:33.200 align:middle line:10%
this is just a mere
warming up for the program.

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:35.790 align:middle line:84%
Like I mentioned before, my
most prolific thing that I think

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:39.390 align:middle line:84%
is most fascinating is still
looking deep into the cosmos

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:42.160 align:middle line:84%
13 and a half
billion light years.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.196 align:middle line:90%
It boggles the mind.

00:22:43.196 --> 00:22:45.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You brought us
some graphics, Steve.

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:45.560 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: I sure did, George.

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:46.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take
a look at them.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:46.120 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: Absolutely.

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:49.099 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: One, of course, is
a binocular type telescope.

00:22:49.099 --> 00:22:49.640 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:51.150 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: This is an
important way to start,

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:52.450 align:middle line:84%
and this is one of--
many of the questions

00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:54.270 align:middle line:84%
you asked me,
people always ask--

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:56.150 align:middle line:84%
how do I get started
in astronomy.

00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:59.750 align:middle line:10%
Simple answer from me, Dr. Sky,
is that a pair of binoculars

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:01.500 align:middle line:10%
is your gateway to the heavens.

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:02.320 align:middle line:10%
Why?

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.890 align:middle line:10%
Well, as you can see on your
screen, they're easy to use.

00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:07.569 align:middle line:84%
You pick them up and you can
use them for many other events--

00:23:07.569 --> 00:23:09.360 align:middle line:84%
sporting events, camping,
whatever you're--

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:10.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You just take
it off the tripod, right.

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:12.210 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: Take it off
the tripod, use it.

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:14.751 align:middle line:84%
But here's the example that I'd
like to leave everybody with.

00:23:14.751 --> 00:23:17.510 align:middle line:84%
As you see on the screen,
there's the binoculars.

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:19.620 align:middle line:84%
With that full
screen of the image,

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:23.050 align:middle line:84%
the binocular area will cover
up or zoom into a small area,

00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:24.530 align:middle line:90%
say, the size of the binoculars.

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:27.490 align:middle line:84%
If you take a telescope, George,
it would zoom into an area

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:29.030 align:middle line:90%
the size of one of those lenses.

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:29.946 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:23:29.946 --> 00:23:32.450 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: So we want to have
people start off the right way.

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:35.170 align:middle line:84%
Inexpensive-- nobody has an
excuse not to find binoculars.

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:37.457 align:middle line:84%
They're relatively
inexpensive, start that way.

00:23:37.457 --> 00:23:38.290 align:middle line:90%
They're fascinating.

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:38.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, I love it.

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:39.629 align:middle line:10%
The next one is--

00:23:39.629 --> 00:23:40.836 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: This is interesting.

00:23:40.836 --> 00:23:41.370 align:middle line:10%
As we look--

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:42.703 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Strange looking device.

00:23:42.703 --> 00:23:45.220 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: This is the most
amazing aircraft or space

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:47.730 align:middle line:10%
vehicle combination that
I think I've ever seen,

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:49.830 align:middle line:10%
but the Rutan
brothers are geniuses,

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:52.400 align:middle line:10%
and we're hoping not too
far in the distant future,

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.990 align:middle line:10%
SpaceShipOne becomes a real
reality with Richard Branson.

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:58.880 align:middle line:84%
As we see the mother ship, this
is what you and I would go on,

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.194 align:middle line:90%
if only I had $250,000 to do it.

00:24:01.194 --> 00:24:02.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:02.980 align:middle line:90%
That's a heck of a ticket.

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:05.146 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: It's a heck of a
deal if you can afford it,

00:24:05.146 --> 00:24:07.660 align:middle line:84%
but imagine, folks, you're
looking at SpaceShipOne.

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:08.810 align:middle line:90%
Why are we showing this?

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:11.016 align:middle line:84%
Because this is the
gateway for people

00:24:11.016 --> 00:24:12.640 align:middle line:84%
who are interested
in knowing that you,

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:15.190 align:middle line:84%
too, one day, can
do the same thing

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:17.720 align:middle line:84%
that Alan Shepard did--
America's first astronaut

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:18.530 align:middle line:90%
in space.

00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:21.790 align:middle line:10%
But George, that is just an
amazing piece of technology,

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:24.630 align:middle line:10%
and with our photo team,
the Photorecon.net people,

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:27.070 align:middle line:10%
we're going to be hanging
around this particular area

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:30.980 align:middle line:10%
in the Mojave Desert and also
in New Mexico to watch as many

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:33.140 align:middle line:10%
of these launches, if
we're not able to afford

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:34.580 align:middle line:10%
to go up to be astronauts.

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:37.152 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How's the competition
with privatization?

00:24:37.152 --> 00:24:39.360 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: There is some
competition right now, George,

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:42.200 align:middle line:10%
but I think Richard Branson
has done this the right way,

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.450 align:middle line:10%
and I think you're going
to see him become extremely

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:47.000 align:middle line:10%
successful at this
in short order.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.630 align:middle line:84%
I don't know enough about this,
to be honest with your viewers,

00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:51.950 align:middle line:84%
but what they're looking
at is the final approvals,

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:52.997 align:middle line:90%
and once they get those--

00:24:52.997 --> 00:24:53.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's going.

00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:55.490 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: --I think
they have a backlog.

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:56.073 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:24:56.073 --> 00:24:58.495 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: So, he's taking
his family up first.

00:24:58.495 --> 00:25:00.620 align:middle line:84%
I guess the only thing
people probably want to know

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:02.286 align:middle line:84%
is what does it take
to be an astronaut?

00:25:02.286 --> 00:25:03.790 align:middle line:90%
Not the "Right Stuff" stuff.

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:08.400 align:middle line:84%
If you go up, allegedly, above
the Earth about 61 or 62 miles,

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.365 align:middle line:90%
you qualify to be in space.

00:25:10.365 --> 00:25:12.919 align:middle line:84%
You're in space, and
weightless we would be,

00:25:12.919 --> 00:25:13.960 align:middle line:90%
and wouldn't that be fun?

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What a great way,
though, to get from Los Angeles

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:16.782 align:middle line:90%
to New York.

00:25:16.782 --> 00:25:18.490 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: Oh, yeah,
that would be awesome.

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:19.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Twenty minutes.

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:19.887 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Exactly.

00:25:19.887 --> 00:25:20.470 align:middle line:90%
Don't be late.

00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:21.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I would love that.

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:23.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A flat
map of the planet.

00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:25.140 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: Well, there's
another reason behind this.

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:27.050 align:middle line:84%
If you look at all the
areas on the screen,

00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:29.020 align:middle line:84%
and viewers are seeing
this, the areas that are

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:33.280 align:middle line:84%
lit up in green and yellow and
all white-- light pollution.

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:34.560 align:middle line:90%
This is our big nemesis.

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:35.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: These are big cities?

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:36.410 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: These are major cities.

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:38.785 align:middle line:84%
If you look across the eastern
part of the United States,

00:25:38.785 --> 00:25:40.330 align:middle line:84%
it's not really that
definitive line,

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:41.704 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a
spacecraft line,

00:25:41.704 --> 00:25:45.230 align:middle line:84%
but the point is look at
the world as we see it.

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:48.080 align:middle line:84%
All those areas that
light up the continents--

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:50.510 align:middle line:84%
it's great to have lighting,
George, but like I say

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:52.270 align:middle line:84%
in my local Phoenix
environment, I'm

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:54.970 align:middle line:84%
blinded by the light when
I drive down the freeway

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:57.310 align:middle line:84%
and I see these incredibly
bright, big signs.

00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:59.880 align:middle line:84%
Great technology, but
every one of those

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:02.400 align:middle line:84%
degrades your sky
and my sky, and I

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.612 align:middle line:84%
think we can have a common
balance between the two of--

00:26:05.612 --> 00:26:07.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I
think the only way

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:08.850 align:middle line:84%
is to go somewhere where
you can really see.

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:09.440 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: This is true.

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:09.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:10.890 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to the next one.

00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:11.320 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Absolutely.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:12.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's see
what we've got there.

00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:14.820 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: Well, George, we're
in solar activity season,

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:16.920 align:middle line:84%
as you report on the
show all the time.

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:18.090 align:middle line:90%
This is so fascinating.

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:20.640 align:middle line:84%
What viewers are seeing
is an image of the sun,

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.510 align:middle line:84%
and around it, you're
seeing an immense, big

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:25.180 align:middle line:84%
what we call coronal
mass ejection.

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And not to get too complicated
on the show, but simply

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:30.360 align:middle line:84%
the dynamics of the sun-- it's
a beau-- a big ball of fusion

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:31.110 align:middle line:90%
power.

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:33.834 align:middle line:84%
It's converting four million
tons of hydrogen into--

00:26:33.834 --> 00:26:34.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All the time?

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:36.660 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: All the time,
and it's so amazing.

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:39.050 align:middle line:10%
Imagine our local
electric fuel bill

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:41.830 align:middle line:10%
if we had to pay this--
totally astronomical--

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:45.300 align:middle line:10%
but the driving force is fusion
energy, hydrogen to helium,

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:48.390 align:middle line:10%
the loss of material
is the energy created.

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:51.140 align:middle line:84%
But now, as we see
on the screen here,

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:54.840 align:middle line:84%
this large puff of white
that goes around the sun

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:57.850 align:middle line:84%
is the material that
the sun belches.

00:26:57.850 --> 00:27:01.210 align:middle line:10%
And going back into history, we
all know the great Carrington

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:02.276 align:middle line:10%
Event that in--

00:27:02.276 --> 00:27:03.400 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Eighteen hundreds.

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:05.990 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: --and in that
time, which is so amazing,

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:07.940 align:middle line:10%
can you imagine today
the proliferation

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:10.030 align:middle line:10%
of all these electronic devices?

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:14.310 align:middle line:84%
Then, it was reported, that
telephone wires went on fire,

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:14.860 align:middle line:90%
ablaze.

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:16.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's exactly right.

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:17.410 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: Could you imagine
if we got the kill shot?

00:27:17.410 --> 00:27:18.280 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: We'd be fried today.

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:18.988 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: Totally.

00:27:18.988 --> 00:27:21.359 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: We have
talked about X flares.

00:27:21.359 --> 00:27:21.900 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Yes.

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:24.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I am taking up a
personal campaign on "Coast

00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:25.119 align:middle line:90%
to Coast" radio--

00:27:25.119 --> 00:27:25.660 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Yes?

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:27.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --to try
to get Congress

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:30.239 align:middle line:84%
to pass a law to
insulate the power grid.

00:27:30.239 --> 00:27:32.280 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: You know, George,
I commend you on that.

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:33.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
what I want to do.

00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:35.150 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: I mean then it gets
into the political story,

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:37.360 align:middle line:10%
because obviously what
happens if we had a big EMP

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:38.160 align:middle line:10%
attack, too?

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:38.760 align:middle line:90%
So we need to insulate.

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:39.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same thing.

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Very good, my friend.

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:40.810 align:middle line:90%
I salute you.

00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:43.226 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want the individual
states to act on their own,

00:27:43.226 --> 00:27:45.374 align:middle line:84%
but I also want the federal
government to step in

00:27:45.374 --> 00:27:46.290 align:middle line:90%
and do something, too.

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:47.900 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: George, you've
got a foot soldier here.

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:49.095 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Because we're
going to save the planet--

00:27:49.095 --> 00:27:49.803 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: You bet.

00:27:49.803 --> 00:27:51.810 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: --and this
country if we can do this.

00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:52.893 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: I consider that--

00:27:52.893 --> 00:27:55.050 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's not a
matter of if, it's

00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:57.920 align:middle line:10%
a matter of when one
of those two scenarios

00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:58.780 align:middle line:10%
is going to occur.

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:00.130 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: Well, George, you've
got a foot soldier sitting

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:01.420 align:middle line:84%
right across from
you in the studio.

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:02.760 align:middle line:84%
I'd be more than happy
to carry the message.

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:03.870 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You can
be my spokesperson.

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:04.940 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: Well, we can talk.

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:06.670 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Here's our next
graphic, our last one.

00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:08.530 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: It goes to the
origins of the space program,

00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:09.910 align:middle line:84%
as people can see
on the screen--

00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:12.150 align:middle line:84%
the Redstone rocket with
the Mercury capsule.

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:17.190 align:middle line:84%
How amazing to know
that we, as a nation,

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:19.850 align:middle line:84%
put these particular
astronauts into orbit, though,

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:21.140 align:middle line:90%
albeit not the first.

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:23.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean obviously, political
tensions for younger viewers--

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:26.300 align:middle line:84%
they may not understand
that at this time in history

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:29.070 align:middle line:84%
in America, there was
great political tensions.

00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:31.780 align:middle line:84%
The Russians, of course, put
a man into space before us,

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:34.530 align:middle line:84%
but not too far after
that, we did it.

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:36.240 align:middle line:84%
It's a salute to
the great astronauts

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:40.380 align:middle line:84%
of the Mercury Program-- the
most amazing times, I think,

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:41.570 align:middle line:90%
in America's space program.

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:44.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did the Russians,
the Soviets at the time,

00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:46.734 align:middle line:90%
lose the momentum that they had?

00:28:46.734 --> 00:28:48.150 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: It's
interesting, George.

00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:51.780 align:middle line:84%
My only answer to this is
political change in Russia.

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:53.630 align:middle line:84%
Khrushchev, as we know,
it seems like they

00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:56.757 align:middle line:84%
purge all these different
leaders every so often,

00:28:56.757 --> 00:28:57.840 align:middle line:90%
and I'm saying it with a--

00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:58.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Except now.

00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:58.980 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: --smile.

00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:00.660 align:middle line:10%
Right, except for now.

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:02.760 align:middle line:10%
In the past, they purged
these political leaders

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:04.650 align:middle line:10%
in violent overthrows,
but I think

00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:07.532 align:middle line:10%
what happened is the Soviet
Union at the time had

00:29:07.532 --> 00:29:09.240 align:middle line:10%
this great impetus
like the United States

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.370 align:middle line:10%
to go to the moon.

00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:13.390 align:middle line:84%
They had great scientists, they
have a great delivery system,

00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:15.920 align:middle line:84%
so I think the timing was
right-- their politics,

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.050 align:middle line:90%
their mission.

00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:19.970 align:middle line:84%
Obviously they weren't
doing it just to amuse us.

00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:22.000 align:middle line:10%
They were doing it for
military superiority,

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.560 align:middle line:10%
and they admit that,
and when they launched,

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:27.110 align:middle line:10%
of course, Yuri Gagarin,
on his first flight,

00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:30.170 align:middle line:10%
people need to understand it was
dynamically different than what

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:33.040 align:middle line:10%
Alan Shepard did, because
this particular start

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:35.780 align:middle line:10%
of the Russian space
program went off course,

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:38.390 align:middle line:10%
we also saw, even
before that time.

00:29:38.390 --> 00:29:43.610 align:middle line:10%
A 184-pound sphere of stainless
steel running around the Earth,

00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:45.060 align:middle line:10%
known as Sputnik 1, folks--

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:46.240 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Scared the
daylights out of us.

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.073 align:middle line:10%
>>KATES: Scared the
bejeebers out of people,

00:29:48.073 --> 00:29:50.000 align:middle line:10%
because now they knew,
as we all know now,

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.590 align:middle line:10%
you looked up in the
night sky and oh my gosh,

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:54.360 align:middle line:10%
that's over American territory--

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:55.740 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And it's not ours.

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:57.032 align:middle line:90%
>>KATES: Psychological warfare.

00:29:57.032 --> 00:29:58.115 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:29:58.115 --> 00:29:59.770 align:middle line:84%
Steven, if people
want more information

00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:02.054 align:middle line:90%
on Dr. Sky, what do they do?

00:30:02.054 --> 00:30:04.220 align:middle line:84%
>>KATES: Simply I'd be happy
to answer your emails--

our photo and aviation
website, photorecon.net,

00:30:15.050 --> 00:30:17.970 align:middle line:10%
where we talk about
America's military, the air

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:19.240 align:middle line:10%
crews from the Blue Angels.

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.620 align:middle line:10%
We go to air shows
and we kind of

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:24.850 align:middle line:10%
cover that as participants in
the great story of air races

00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:26.950 align:middle line:10%
like the Reno Air
Races and so much more.

>>NOORY: On our next
edition of "Beyond Belief,"

Dr. Sky will talk about the
American space program--

00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:36.920 align:middle line:10%
where does it stand today and
where will it be tomorrow?
