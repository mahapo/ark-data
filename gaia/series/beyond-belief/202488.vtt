Thank you very much.

I'm really happy to

>>NOORY: What is it like dealing
with a mind-body therapy?

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.280 align:middle line:10%
>>HENDRICKS: Well, what it's
like is-- have you ever noticed

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.160 align:middle line:10%
that when somebody
is talking to you,

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.440 align:middle line:10%
the words are coming
out here, but it's

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.480 align:middle line:10%
their body that's really
telling you what's going on?

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.420 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What the
story is, yeah.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.890 align:middle line:10%
>>HENDRICKS: Like,
for example, I

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.640 align:middle line:10%
was working with a man who
came in, and he had back pain.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.460 align:middle line:10%
But he wasn't getting any better
with chiropractors and massage

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.880 align:middle line:10%
and that kind of thing.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed, as he
was talking about it,

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.945 align:middle line:84%
that he kept
touching his heart--

00:01:25.945 --> 00:01:26.745 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:01:26.745 --> 00:01:28.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HENDRICKS: --unconsciously.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just like this?

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HENDRICKS: Yeah.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.870 align:middle line:84%
He would be talking to
me about his back pain,

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.500 align:middle line:90%
but he kept doing this.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, Andy, I noticed
that you touch your heart

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.450 align:middle line:84%
frequently when you're
talking about your back pain.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.480 align:middle line:84%
That was the key to it because
it was really a heart issue.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.570 align:middle line:84%
He was in grief about
something that had happened,

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.580 align:middle line:84%
and he didn't know how
to deal with the grief.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.620 align:middle line:84%
And so he kind of
stuffed it into his back

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.835 align:middle line:84%
because he did know how
to deal with back pain.

00:01:51.835 --> 00:01:52.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.170 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: And so that's
why body-mind therapies

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.220 align:middle line:84%
are so important-- because the
body is talking all the time.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed early on,
even before I really

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.440 align:middle line:84%
went and got my PhD and
this and everything like

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.380 align:middle line:84%
that, I started noticing
that members in my family

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.310 align:middle line:90%
would even do that.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.900 align:middle line:84%
So I caught my
attention when I was

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.340 align:middle line:84%
a little kid that my mother,
who was the mayor of my town

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.680 align:middle line:84%
that I lived in
Leesburg, Florida--

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.020 align:middle line:84%
I would hear her on
the phone being mayor.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And she would be talking,
da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.000 align:middle line:84%
But I would be noticing
that she would be with--

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.610 align:middle line:84%
doing these other things
like lighting a cigarette

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.700 align:middle line:90%
and writing furiously.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.370 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: And
it was like there

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.000 align:middle line:84%
was two parts of her, the mayor
part and then the real part.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The mayor part
and then the other part.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HENDRICKS: Yeah.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that's what
really began to key me

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.660 align:middle line:84%
in on body language,
and that became

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.130 align:middle line:90%

Does everybody do
something like that?

>>HENDRICKS: I think so.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.920 align:middle line:90%
Pretty much.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.130 align:middle line:84%

with other species.

I was just finishing my

but that were little
startups back then.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I noticed,
that-- all of these people

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.060 align:middle line:84%
were incredibly
brilliant in their minds,

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.050 align:middle line:84%
but they didn't have a clue
about their emotional life.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.700 align:middle line:84%

in everyday life

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.300 align:middle line:84%
that we get sad about or
scared about or angry about.

And unless we know how to deal
with those in a direct way,

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.550 align:middle line:84%
they're going to get stuffed
somewhere in our bodies

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:22.870 align:middle line:90%

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.050 align:middle line:84%
that I'd been on that I had
to go into a regular airport.

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:15.092 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Since this mess.

00:06:15.092 --> 00:06:17.897 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: Since the mess--
and I was just blown away

00:06:17.897 --> 00:06:19.730 align:middle line:84%
by the very thing that
you're talking about,

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.040 align:middle line:84%
that it's a whole
different experience now,

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.800 align:middle line:84%
having people-- the
bottom half of their face

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.860 align:middle line:84%
missing, that you
get to read body

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.330 align:middle line:90%
language, though by their eyes.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.227 align:middle line:84%
And they really are the
windows to the soul.

00:06:31.227 --> 00:06:32.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.730 align:middle line:84%
"Mystery Teachings" host,
Dr. Theresa Bullard,

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:39.727 align:middle line:84%
talks about how the people in
our lives are part of this.

00:06:39.727 --> 00:06:42.310 align:middle line:10%
>>THERESA BULLARD: There's both
an art and science to building

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.680 align:middle line:10%
synergistic relationships.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.330 align:middle line:10%
And it's some of the
biggest challenges

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.910 align:middle line:10%
we encounter in our lives.

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:51.910 align:middle line:10%
That's because we humans
are social creatures.

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.130 align:middle line:10%
And yet, we also have
all of our flaws,

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.650 align:middle line:10%
attachments, and
egos to contend with.

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:00.640 align:middle line:10%
We both love and
despise each other.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.370 align:middle line:10%
We uplift, and we tear down.

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.490 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes we can really
grate on each other's nerves,

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:10.690 align:middle line:10%
while other times, we help each
other feel safe and cared for.

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.930 align:middle line:10%
And it's shocking to see
how quickly these feelings

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:16.000 align:middle line:10%
and dynamics can
shift from one end

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.320 align:middle line:10%
of the spectrum to the
other, sometimes overnight.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:25.310 align:middle line:10%
How can we gain greater mastery
in this aspect of our lives?

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:28.180 align:middle line:10%
Well, for starters, there's
nothing like the relationships

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.700 align:middle line:10%
in our lives to really
show us where we still

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.930 align:middle line:10%
need to work on ourselves.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.200 align:middle line:10%
The people in our lives
are mirrors for us

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.310 align:middle line:10%
to see ourselves.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:40.970 align:middle line:10%
Unfortunately, most people
don't want to see themselves.

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:43.030 align:middle line:10%
So rather than own
their own stuff

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:46.240 align:middle line:10%
they project it onto others.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.670 align:middle line:10%
If we could just
shift this one thing

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:50.650 align:middle line:10%
and start seeing the
people in our lives

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:53.200 align:middle line:10%
as reflections of
ourselves, it would

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.690 align:middle line:10%
make a world of difference.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:57.820 align:middle line:10%
Stop pointing the
finger out there,

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:00.460 align:middle line:10%
and start looking in here.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is it about the
eyes of the facial gestures,

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:08.685 align:middle line:84%
Gay, that let you determine
exactly their emotional state?

00:08:08.685 --> 00:08:10.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: I
just had a memory,

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.640 align:middle line:84%
as we were watching the
video, of the first time

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.870 align:middle line:90%
I met my wife 40 years ago.

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:16.750 align:middle line:84%
We had this amazing
conversation that

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:19.000 align:middle line:90%
actually involved her eyes.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And I had just gotten out
of a troubled relationship

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:26.770 align:middle line:84%
I'd been in for about five
years, and I'd made a vow.

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:29.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm never going to get
into another relationship

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.120 align:middle line:84%
unless both of us
agree that we're

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.419 align:middle line:84%
going to be absolutely honest
with each other and both of us

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:36.520 align:middle line:84%
agree that we're not
going to get into blame.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.567 align:middle line:84%
We're going to actually
take responsibility

00:08:38.567 --> 00:08:40.150 align:middle line:84%
when things come up
and say, oh, yeah,

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:41.358 align:middle line:90%
I can see how I created that.

00:08:41.358 --> 00:08:42.442 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, I did that.

00:08:42.442 --> 00:08:43.760 align:middle line:90%
>>HENDRICKS: Yeah, I did that.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing I'd learned
was I'm a creative person.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.600 align:middle line:84%
I go in a room for two or
three hours a day, at least,

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.680 align:middle line:90%
and write books.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:54.318 align:middle line:84%
And so if my partner isn't
a creative person too,

00:08:54.318 --> 00:08:56.110 align:middle line:84%
they might be jealous
of that, or they want

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:57.470 align:middle line:90%
me to be doing something else.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And that had been a real issue
in other relationships of mine.

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:02.980 align:middle line:84%
So I had this great
conversation when I met my wife.

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.650 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'd love to take
you out for a cup of coffee.

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:07.480 align:middle line:84%
But first, I've
got to let you know

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.880 align:middle line:84%
that I'm only interested
in relationships where

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:13.840 align:middle line:84%
both people tell the truth
and both people claim

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.120 align:middle line:84%
responsibility for
things rather than blame

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:19.870 align:middle line:84%
and both people are committed
to their creativity.

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:22.835 align:middle line:84%
On those terms, would you
like to go out with me, Katie?

00:09:22.835 --> 00:09:24.460 align:middle line:84%
And here's what
happened with her eyes.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:27.310 align:middle line:84%
She went like this--
ding-ding-ding-ding-ding.

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:31.060 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like she
was a computer on overload.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Intentionally?

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:33.490 align:middle line:90%
Or that was just part of her--

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:34.870 align:middle line:90%
>>HENDRICKS: No, that was her--

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:35.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was her reaction.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.570 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: That her
reaction, was-- oh, my god.

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:38.980 align:middle line:90%
What have I gotten myself into?

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:41.230 align:middle line:84%
Who is this crazy
guy that's just

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:43.180 align:middle line:90%
told me this strange thing?

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:47.950 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, finally she
said, how about lunch?

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:51.060 align:middle line:84%
But I just wanted to illustrate
that the eyes are always

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:51.860 align:middle line:90%
going to be--

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.423 align:middle line:84%
they're going to go this
direction, this direction,

00:09:54.423 --> 00:09:55.840 align:middle line:84%
this direction,
or this direction.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And each one of
them has some kind

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.490 align:middle line:84%
of a message from
our brain that's

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:01.780 align:middle line:90%
getting down to our eyes.

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:04.480 align:middle line:84%
See, it only takes
1/20th of a second or so

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.120 align:middle line:84%
for our body language
to occur, but it takes

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.200 align:middle line:90%
longer for language to develop.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.680 align:middle line:84%
So that's the reason
the body is speaking

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.017 align:middle line:90%
before our minds are speaking.

00:10:13.017 --> 00:10:15.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isn't it amazing,
though, how that works?

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:16.437 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the eyes are the eyes.

00:10:16.437 --> 00:10:17.770 align:middle line:90%
They're shaped the way they are.

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:19.300 align:middle line:90%
They don't change.

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:24.640 align:middle line:84%
Yet, the way you open your eyes
and you close your eyes or you

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:25.600 align:middle line:90%
look--

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.348 align:middle line:84%
people can tell
what your mood is.

00:10:27.348 --> 00:10:29.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: I was
watching a documentary--

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:31.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one of those
"48 Hours" type

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.120 align:middle line:84%
shows with a
courtroom situation.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And they had a person
on the stand who

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:38.740 align:middle line:90%
was telling a whopper of a lie.

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.270 align:middle line:84%
And when she was
telling the lie,

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:42.732 align:middle line:84%
her eyes were actually
going like this,

00:10:42.732 --> 00:10:43.690 align:middle line:90%
darting back and forth.

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:44.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, that's
obvious, right?

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:46.045 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: Yeah,
it's really obvious.

00:10:46.045 --> 00:10:48.670 align:middle line:84%
But everybody's doing some small
version of that kind of thing

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:49.700 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.760 align:middle line:84%
I think what really
works though is

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.760 align:middle line:84%
for us to catch onto that in
ourselves and start noticing,

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.855 align:middle line:84%
hm, I notice I just
crossed my arms.

00:10:56.855 --> 00:10:57.730 align:middle line:90%
What am I doing here?

00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:58.960 align:middle line:90%
Am I afraid of something?

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.040 align:middle line:90%
Or am I defensive?

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:03.453 align:middle line:84%
Or, hm-- kind of begin to wonder
about ourselves a little bit.

00:11:03.453 --> 00:11:05.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's it mean
when you're, like, standing,

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.960 align:middle line:84%
talking to people, and you
put your hand in your pocket?

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.160 align:middle line:90%
Is there a meaning?

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.117 align:middle line:84%
Does every gesture
have a meaning?

00:11:11.117 --> 00:11:12.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: I don't
think you can say

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:13.867 align:middle line:90%
every gesture has a meaning.

00:11:13.867 --> 00:11:16.270 align:middle line:84%
It may have a meaning for
that individual, though.

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:18.730 align:middle line:84%
You have to look at it in
an individual kind of thing

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:23.260 align:middle line:84%
because one person might be
putting his hand in his pocket

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.417 align:middle line:84%
to protect himself, and
another might be doing it just

00:11:26.417 --> 00:11:28.750 align:middle line:84%
to kind of, I don't know,
relax, or something like that.

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:29.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Relax, sure.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:30.880 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: I
know my granddad--

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.088 align:middle line:90%
I grew up around my granddad.

00:11:32.088 --> 00:11:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And I could always tell when
he was happy and relaxed

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:37.720 align:middle line:84%
because he'd be standing around,
and he'd be jingling his change

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:38.550 align:middle line:90%
in his pocket.

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And it was just this
little mannerism,

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:43.750 align:middle line:84%
but it was always happy granddad
when he was standing around

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:45.645 align:middle line:90%
kind of jingling his change.

00:11:45.645 --> 00:11:47.770 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You have a book
out called "The Big Leap,"

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:48.880 align:middle line:10%
one of your first books.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.950 align:middle line:10%
You wrote this 10 years ago.

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:52.280 align:middle line:10%
Tell me about that.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:55.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: Well, "The Big
Leap" is about two things.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.040 align:middle line:84%
It's about what I call
the upper limit problem.

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed with-- especially
with successful people--

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:04.390 align:middle line:84%
that almost all successful
people have a tendency

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.280 align:middle line:90%
to upper limit themselves.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:08.920 align:middle line:84%
When they start getting
more and more successful,

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:12.698 align:middle line:84%
they find some way to
sabotage themselves for it.

00:12:12.698 --> 00:12:13.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Self-destructive

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:15.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: Yeah,
self-destructive.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.980 align:middle line:90%
Like, a person would have--

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.610 align:middle line:84%
like, a Silicon Valley
executive I worked with--

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:21.680 align:middle line:84%
he'd have a great day
at work, and then he'd

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.742 align:middle line:84%
go home and pick a
fight with his wife

00:12:23.742 --> 00:12:24.950 align:middle line:90%
and spend the whole evening--

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:26.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Taking it out on her.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.485 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: Yeah, stuff
that he would have stuffed

00:12:28.485 --> 00:12:31.790 align:middle line:84%
in the back pocket during
conflicts during the day--

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:34.070 align:middle line:84%
he would come home and
take it out on her.

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:37.970 align:middle line:84%
So the upper limit problem is a
tendency to sabotage ourselves

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:40.260 align:middle line:90%
when things start going well.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
"The Big Leap" is about

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:44.990 align:middle line:84%
is about what happens
once you cure yourself

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:46.700 align:middle line:90%
of your upper limit problem.

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:48.170 align:middle line:84%
In the book, I
show that there are

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:50.530 align:middle line:84%
only a few fears that are
underneath the upper limit

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:51.330 align:middle line:90%
problem.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And once you learn
how to deal with them,

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.220 align:middle line:84%
then you can move
through it into what

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.290 align:middle line:90%
I call the genius zone.

00:12:57.290 --> 00:13:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you're doing
what you most love to do

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:03.200 align:middle line:84%
and what you're having
a biggest impact doing.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.515 align:middle line:84%
I would say you're definitely
in your genius zone.

00:13:05.515 --> 00:13:07.890 align:middle line:84%
This is the first time I've
been on your television show,

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:10.700 align:middle line:84%
but I've heard your radio
show many, many times.

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's obvious when a
person's in their genius zone

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:18.140 align:middle line:84%
because they look like
they're loving what they do.

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:19.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:20.900 align:middle line:90%
I'd do it for free.

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:21.225 align:middle line:90%
Shh.

00:13:21.225 --> 00:13:21.550 align:middle line:90%
Don't tell 'em.

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:22.925 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: Yeah,
that's exactly

00:13:22.925 --> 00:13:24.382 align:middle line:84%
the way I feel
about my job, too.

00:13:24.382 --> 00:13:25.340 align:middle line:90%
I would do it for free.

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:27.080 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in "The
Big Leap," I say

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.720 align:middle line:84%
that's one of the
characteristics of the genius

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:33.770 align:middle line:84%
zone, is you're doing something
you like to do so much that you

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:37.250 align:middle line:84%
can do it all day long, and you
don't get tired, and you can--

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:41.637 align:middle line:84%
you'd do it for free if you had
some way of paying your rent.

00:13:41.637 --> 00:13:42.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:44.780 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing this
coast-to-coast radio show now

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:47.900 align:middle line:84%
for nearly 18 years,
and I have not

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:51.354 align:middle line:84%
taken one straight
week of vacation.

00:13:51.354 --> 00:13:52.187 align:middle line:90%
>>HENDRICKS: Really?

00:13:52.187 --> 00:13:52.310 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:53.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not one.

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:56.750 align:middle line:84%
I will take an occasional
Friday night off just

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:59.630 align:middle line:84%
to go out and do my
thing, but I have not

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:03.830 align:middle line:84%
taken one week vacation
because I miss this show.

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:04.670 align:middle line:90%
I miss doing it.

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:08.060 align:middle line:84%
I enjoy coming to the
Denver/Boulder area

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:10.580 align:middle line:84%
to do our "Beyond Belief"
tapings every month.

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:14.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're just
energizing for me.

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.200 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.760 align:middle line:84%
Is that something
I taught myself?

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.188 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:14:18.188 --> 00:14:19.730 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: A lot
of times, it comes

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:21.920 align:middle line:84%
from a succession
of small choices

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:25.130 align:middle line:84%
where you choose more and more
to do more and more things you

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:26.540 align:middle line:90%
love to do.

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:27.622 align:middle line:90%
I worked in radio--

00:14:27.622 --> 00:14:29.330 align:middle line:84%
actually, I worked my
way through college

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:32.120 align:middle line:84%
on the radio four hours a day
and going to college at night.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:32.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:34.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: Yeah, I was on
a Top-40 rock and roll radio

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:37.037 align:middle line:84%
station back in the '60s
in Orlando, Florida.

00:14:37.037 --> 00:14:38.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you talk
right up to that post?

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:40.578 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: Oh, yeah,
right up to that--

00:14:40.578 --> 00:14:42.107 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Playing the big hits!

00:14:42.107 --> 00:14:44.690 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: And we had jingles
that played in the background.

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:46.130 align:middle line:84%
But what I was
going to say about

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:48.870 align:middle line:84%
that is I was on the
air for four hours,

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:51.420 align:middle line:84%
but it really seemed like
about 45 minutes every time.

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:52.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:53.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: I would
go on at 10 o'clock,

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:57.170 align:middle line:84%
and I'd get up at 2 o'clock
and say, where have I been?

00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:58.485 align:middle line:90%
Because the whole thing--

00:14:58.485 --> 00:14:59.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It zooms by.

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.735 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: Yeah,
just zooms by.

00:15:00.735 --> 00:15:04.250 align:middle line:84%
And so god bless any one of
us that finds work like that

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:05.100 align:middle line:90%
because--

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:06.800 align:middle line:84%
there's an old
Yiddish saying that

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.350 align:middle line:84%
says if you find
work you love, you

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:11.220 align:middle line:84%
should ask for no other
blessing in life--

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:12.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:12.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: --because
you're getting

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:15.410 align:middle line:84%
to spend all day doing
what you most love to do.

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:17.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you see
emotion with children, too,

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.695 align:middle line:84%
the same way as you
can with an adult?

00:15:19.695 --> 00:15:20.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HENDRICKS: More so.

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:21.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:23.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: Yeah, more so,
because children hide it less.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.610 align:middle line:84%
By the time you get
out of high school--

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:26.240 align:middle line:90%
well, listen to this.

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.200 align:middle line:90%
You won't believe this.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.610 align:middle line:90%
My wife is a movement therapist.

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:31.910 align:middle line:84%
She works a lot with
movement and helping people

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:34.070 align:middle line:84%
learn to integrate their
bodies and minds better

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:35.360 align:middle line:90%
through movement.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.920 align:middle line:90%
Kids, when they start--

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.510 align:middle line:90%
before they go to school--

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:42.620 align:middle line:84%
have 2,000 or 3,000 body
movements they can do.

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:44.600 align:middle line:84%
By the time they graduate
from high school,

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:48.080 align:middle line:84%
they're down to only 200
or 300 body movements

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.190 align:middle line:90%
that they can do.

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:53.450 align:middle line:84%
So we become kind of frozen
in the process of those 16

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:57.092 align:middle line:84%
years sitting in-- or 12
years sitting in desks

00:15:57.092 --> 00:15:58.050 align:middle line:90%
and that kind of thing.

00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:01.760 align:middle line:84%
So she's a big advocate
for building more movement

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.820 align:middle line:90%
into workday and the school day.

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:07.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My granddaughter has
a little 9-month-old baby,

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:10.760 align:middle line:84%
which makes me a
great grandfather--

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.040 align:middle line:84%
makes my mother a
great-great-grandmother.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.600 align:middle line:90%
It's almost unheard of.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And my granddaughter tells
me-- she says, Papa, Mila--

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:20.800 align:middle line:90%
that's the little girl--

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.220 align:middle line:84%
is going to be so determined
when she gets older.

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm asking her, and I said,
Ari, how do you know this?

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And she said, look
at this video.

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:30.310 align:middle line:84%
So she sent me a
video of the kid

00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:32.580 align:middle line:90%
looking for her little puppy.

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And she's looking
underneath the couch,

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:36.540 align:middle line:90%
and she's looking in the bed.

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:38.580 align:middle line:84%
But when she
couldn't find it, you

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:41.100 align:middle line:84%
could see this look on this
little 9-month-old's face,

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.260 align:middle line:90%
like, oh.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.290 align:middle line:84%
Already at 9 months-- so
you're absolutely right.

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:47.370 align:middle line:90%
You can tell.

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:48.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: Well
I got the pleasure

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:51.510 align:middle line:84%
when I was in graduate
school of being able to study

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:53.340 align:middle line:90%
newborn babies for a while.

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:55.590 align:middle line:84%
The PhD program had
a good relationship

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:56.905 align:middle line:90%
with the medical school.

00:16:56.905 --> 00:16:58.530 align:middle line:84%
So I was over there
observing newborns.

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And you'd be surprised
at the range of emotions

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.030 align:middle line:90%
that even little babies have.

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:03.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:05.488 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: They're most famous
for two or three emotions,

00:17:05.488 --> 00:17:07.410 align:middle line:84%
but they really have a
subtle play of emotions

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:08.410 align:middle line:90%
from the very beginning.

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:10.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you predict
what their personality will

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:14.760 align:middle line:84%
be like in the future by looking
at some of their gestures

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.859 align:middle line:90%
and motions?

00:17:16.859 --> 00:17:18.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: That's
a very long question,

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:20.490 align:middle line:84%
but let me make it
a short question.

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And that is that people
have two personalities.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:25.109 align:middle line:84%
Personality number
one is very easy

00:17:25.109 --> 00:17:27.960 align:middle line:84%
to spot early on because
personality number

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:31.380 align:middle line:84%
one is their outgoing way
of relating to the world.

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:34.050 align:middle line:84%
But we all have
personality two, which

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:37.230 align:middle line:84%
is what we have to develop
to get along in a world that

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:39.960 align:middle line:84%
may have some stresses
and difficulties

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.630 align:middle line:84%
and may have a lot
of challenges to it.

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:45.000 align:middle line:84%
So we learn a second
personality that's

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.790 align:middle line:84%
wrapped around our
personality number one.

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:51.130 align:middle line:84%
But in personality number
one, you see spontaneity.

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:52.110 align:middle line:90%
You see wonder.

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:53.310 align:middle line:90%
You see aliveness.

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:54.750 align:middle line:90%
You see smiles.

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:56.500 align:middle line:90%
You see authentic emotion.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.150 align:middle line:84%
If the person is
hungry, they let

00:17:58.150 --> 00:17:59.910 align:middle line:84%
you know about it
if they're a baby.

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:02.100 align:middle line:84%
If they're wet, they
let you know about it.

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:05.280 align:middle line:84%
But in adult life, we
learn to conceal ourselves

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:08.850 align:middle line:84%
so much that that's where a
lot of our physical illnesses

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:09.720 align:middle line:90%
come from.

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:10.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:14.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: I've worked
with-- probably 400 by now--

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.800 align:middle line:84%
people with back
pain or headaches.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And in 90% of the cases, it has
to do with an emotional issue

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.360 align:middle line:90%
as much as anything physical.

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:25.945 align:middle line:84%
In other words, there's
nothing actually deteriorating

00:18:25.945 --> 00:18:26.745 align:middle line:90%
about their spine.

00:18:26.745 --> 00:18:29.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the emotional issue
is physically getting to them.

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:32.010 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: Yes, because--
especially with the issue

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:33.030 align:middle line:90%
of anger--

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:35.190 align:middle line:84%
people, when they
hide their anger,

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:37.180 align:middle line:90%
usually tense their muscles.

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And if you do that in your back,
that causes pain very quickly.

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:42.890 align:middle line:90%
And so I've found that--

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:46.080 align:middle line:84%
well, my mentor, John
Sarno, M.D., who's now

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:48.150 align:middle line:84%
passed on-- but he
was a great doctor

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:50.070 align:middle line:90%
at Rusk Rehab in New York.

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:53.370 align:middle line:90%
And I studied his work a lot.

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:56.895 align:middle line:84%
And he said that
90% of back pain

00:18:56.895 --> 00:18:58.270 align:middle line:84%
has nothing to do
with your back,

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:00.760 align:middle line:84%
really, that that's
just where you put it.

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:02.730 align:middle line:90%
And because another person--

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:06.317 align:middle line:84%
I've also worked with a lot of
people with chronic headaches.

00:19:06.317 --> 00:19:07.275 align:middle line:90%
And chronic headaches--

00:19:07.275 --> 00:19:08.075 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Migraines?

00:19:08.075 --> 00:19:10.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: --also
have a lot to do with--

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:14.820 align:middle line:84%
migraines often have more to
do with the feeling of fear

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:17.070 align:middle line:84%
and sadness down in the
middle of their bodies.

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:19.440 align:middle line:84%
I've noticed that a lot of
times when people are getting

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.450 align:middle line:84%
migraines, they're
sad about something

00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:22.720 align:middle line:90%
or scared about something.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:23.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.687 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: There's also
a physical component, too.

00:19:25.687 --> 00:19:27.330 align:middle line:84%
I want everybody to
make sure that they

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:30.060 align:middle line:84%
are getting the medical
side of things handled, too.

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:32.190 align:middle line:84%
But you need to often
look a little deeper

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:35.430 align:middle line:84%
if you want to cure these
things on a permanent basis.

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:37.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gay, on one
of the Gaia programs,

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:40.590 align:middle line:84%
Marie Forleo shares
her beliefs about

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:43.108 align:middle line:90%
these self-limiting abilities.

00:19:43.108 --> 00:19:45.650 align:middle line:10%
>>MARIE FORLEO: When it comes
to understanding whether or not

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:48.140 align:middle line:10%
we have limiting
beliefs, one clue

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:51.170 align:middle line:10%
is to see if there's a
recurring pattern in your life.

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:52.700 align:middle line:10%
If there's something
that you say

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:56.810 align:middle line:10%
that you want but it's
not a reality for you

00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:59.618 align:middle line:10%
and it's been true for
years and years and years,

00:19:59.618 --> 00:20:01.160 align:middle line:10%
or even months and
months and months,

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.530 align:middle line:10%
and you've been working on
it, that's probably a clue

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:05.900 align:middle line:10%
that there could be a
limiting belief under there

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.360 align:middle line:10%
that you need to
investigate and then

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.100 align:middle line:10%
consciously work on changing.

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.370 align:middle line:10%
So I think when it comes
to limiting beliefs,

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:16.550 align:middle line:10%
if there's any area in her
life that consistently creates

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:20.120 align:middle line:10%
a lot of pain, a lot of stress,
a lot of struggle or anxiety,

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.020 align:middle line:10%
a good place to peek
around is say, well,

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:23.630 align:middle line:10%
what do I believe about this?

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:25.580 align:middle line:10%
Do I believe that it's
possible to resolve?

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:28.850 align:middle line:10%
Do I believe I'm worthy
of having this resolved?

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:32.450 align:middle line:10%
I think investigating it on that
level from a place of curiosity

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:36.110 align:middle line:10%
is step one because if you're
not aware of the belief,

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:37.163 align:middle line:10%
it's hard to change it.

00:20:37.163 --> 00:20:38.705 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
agree with that, Gay?

00:20:38.705 --> 00:20:40.330 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: I totally
agree with that.

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:42.680 align:middle line:84%
In fact, "The Big Leap"--
you mentioned "The Big Leap."

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:46.250 align:middle line:84%
A lot of "The Big Leap"
is about the three or four

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:51.020 align:middle line:84%
fundamental limiting
beliefs that we have.

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:52.710 align:middle line:90%
One of them is--

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:54.940 align:middle line:84%
and you wouldn't believe
how prevalent this is.

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:57.520 align:middle line:84%
Many people have a belief
inside that there's

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:01.870 align:middle line:84%
something fundamentally
wrong or flawed about them.

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:04.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that maybe
they've been told as a kid.

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:06.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or beaten
down or something.

00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:08.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: Beaten down, or
you're stupid, or you're ugly,

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:09.580 align:middle line:90%
or--

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:12.100 align:middle line:84%
so there's some kind of
a thing inside that says,

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:13.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm fundamentally flawed.

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:16.330 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
biggest limiting beliefs.

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:20.140 align:middle line:84%
The second one is,
I better not be

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:23.170 align:middle line:84%
more successful because
if I'm more successful,

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:27.220 align:middle line:84%
I'll outshine other people,
and that's a bad thing.

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:29.257 align:middle line:84%
That'll make other
people feel bad.

00:21:29.257 --> 00:21:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And so you wouldn't be-- you'd
be surprised at the number of--

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:32.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The hold back?

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:33.847 align:middle line:90%
>>HENDRICKS: They hold back.

00:21:33.847 --> 00:21:35.740 align:middle line:84%
They don't go to
their full potential

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:39.370 align:middle line:84%
because they're afraid of
outshining someone else.

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:41.950 align:middle line:84%
Another one is a big
fear a lot of people have

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:44.740 align:middle line:84%
of that-- if I'm
more successful,

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:48.010 align:middle line:84%
it'll be a bigger burden,
and I don't want more burden

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:49.150 align:middle line:90%
in my life.

00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:51.280 align:middle line:90%
And in a way that's--

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:54.790 align:middle line:84%
if you don't work success
right, it can be a burden.

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:56.440 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with--
as you probably

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:59.920 align:middle line:84%
have-- with people who have won
Grammys and Oscars and things

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:02.440 align:middle line:84%
like that, and they're
just dying with it.

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.762 align:middle line:84%
You know, they're so
overloaded with the commitments

00:22:04.762 --> 00:22:06.220 align:middle line:84%
and everything,
and they don't know

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:08.690 align:middle line:84%
how to deal with the
conflicts in their life.

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:12.550 align:middle line:10%
And so success comes with a
kind of a double edge to it

00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:15.520 align:middle line:10%
that unless you know how
to rise with your success

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:19.810 align:middle line:10%
in a graceful way and
uncover your upper limits

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:23.620 align:middle line:10%
and reveal those kind of
limiting beliefs that we all

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:27.100 align:middle line:10%
carry around, you can really
kind of keep in the same rut

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:29.920 align:middle line:10%
and routine for years
and years and years.

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:33.370 align:middle line:84%
Whereas in "The Big Leap,"
what I want you to do

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:36.430 align:middle line:84%
is free yourself from
those limiting beliefs

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:38.890 align:middle line:84%
by dealing with those
fears that are right

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:41.710 align:middle line:84%
underneath the surface, like
the fear that there's something

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:44.470 align:middle line:84%
wrong with me or
the fear that I'm

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:46.540 align:middle line:84%
going to outshine other
people or the fear

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:48.370 align:middle line:90%
that I'm going to be burdened.

00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:51.830 align:middle line:84%
And I want people to deal with
those in a straightforward way

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:54.130 align:middle line:84%
so they can move
into that genius zone

00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:55.180 align:middle line:90%
that I'm talking about.

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:56.957 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
Hendricks Institute?

00:22:56.957 --> 00:22:58.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: The
Hendricks Institute--

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:00.770 align:middle line:90%
we've been around since 1989.

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:03.970 align:middle line:84%
We're a center
that teaches people

00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:07.630 align:middle line:84%
how to do our form of
counseling and therapy--

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:09.880 align:middle line:84%
our form of body-centered
transformation.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:10.765 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:23:10.765 --> 00:23:12.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: So we train
professionals there.

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:16.480 align:middle line:84%
We've trained about 2,000
medical doctors, lawyers,

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:19.180 align:middle line:84%
counselors, therapists,
coaches over the years.

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And also, we have seminars
for the general public,

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:23.902 align:middle line:90%
too, on relationships.

00:23:23.902 --> 00:23:25.360 align:middle line:10%
My wife and I have
written a number

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.490 align:middle line:10%
of books on
relationships, primarily

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:31.360 align:middle line:10%
being one called "Conscious
Loving" that thanks to Oprah

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.342 align:middle line:10%
got out into the world
about 30 years ago.

00:23:33.342 --> 00:23:34.300 align:middle line:10%
And so we've teaching--

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:35.320 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Good old Oprah.

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:36.737 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: Yes,
god bless Oprah.

00:23:36.737 --> 00:23:38.728 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I wouldn't be
here without her.

00:23:38.728 --> 00:23:40.270 align:middle line:84%
She's kind of a
neighbor of ours now.

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:43.880 align:middle line:84%
We live a stone's
throw over from her.

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, wonderful lady.

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:50.530 align:middle line:84%
But in our relationship work,
we have seminars that we teach.

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:53.620 align:middle line:84%
And also, we have a non-profit
foundation that does things

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:55.357 align:middle line:84%
like fund a lot of
documentary films--

00:23:55.357 --> 00:23:56.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, good for you.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:59.023 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: --and fun research
projects and things like that.

00:23:59.023 --> 00:24:02.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
professionals don't get it?

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:03.610 align:middle line:90%
Don't understand?

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:06.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: Well, this gets
into a sore subject to mine

00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:07.150 align:middle line:90%
because--

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:07.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I know.

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:08.440 align:middle line:90%
I must have touched--

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:09.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm seeing it on your face.

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:10.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: Did you see
my body language there?

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:11.503 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I saw your body--

00:24:11.503 --> 00:24:12.970 align:middle line:90%
I saw your eyes.

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:15.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: Well, I'll
tell you a personal story.

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:18.680 align:middle line:84%
I went to a meeting one time--
a very traditional psychiatrist,

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:20.560 align:middle line:90%
psychologist, and social worker.

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And I came out later,
and I said to my wife,

00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:25.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting depressed because
I was so concerned about where

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:31.870 align:middle line:84%
our field is because our field
has gotten itself so heady

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:35.560 align:middle line:84%
that we've lost the heart
component a lot of times.

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And I always tell people
the longest journey

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:41.740 align:middle line:84%
any human being ever makes is
a 12-inch journey from here

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:45.580 align:middle line:84%
down to here to get that
body and mind, that heart

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:48.680 align:middle line:90%
and mind working together.

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:52.390 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately, a
lot of mental health

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:58.930 align:middle line:84%
has gotten too mental and not
enough about the whole person.

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:00.820 align:middle line:84%
See, mental health
has a lot to do

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:03.370 align:middle line:84%
with how you relate
to other people

00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:05.780 align:middle line:84%
and how you relate
to your community.

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:08.630 align:middle line:84%
It's not just an
internal kind of thing.

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:09.580 align:middle line:90%
So I think--

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:13.240 align:middle line:84%
I have hope because I think
about maybe 10% or 15%

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:17.050 align:middle line:84%
of my field now really gets
what we're talking about here

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:20.900 align:middle line:84%
and really sees the
person as a body

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:25.870 align:middle line:84%
and a spirit and an emotion and
a mind and a heart all at once.

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:27.670 align:middle line:84%
But unless we do
that, we're kind of

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:31.210 align:middle line:84%
like driving a car with only
one or two cylinders firing.

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:34.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How in the world did
you get involved in this field?

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:36.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: Well, I'm a
classic wounded healer.

00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:38.510 align:middle line:90%
I used to weigh 320 pounds.

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:39.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:39.790 align:middle line:90%
How tall are you?

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:40.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HENDRICKS: I did.

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:41.970 align:middle line:90%
I was six feet tall,

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:42.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:44.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: And I
was still 6 feet tall

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:45.656 align:middle line:90%
when I weighed 300 pounds, too.

00:25:45.656 --> 00:25:45.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, exactly.

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:47.200 align:middle line:90%
>>HENDRICKS: Unfortunately.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.070 align:middle line:90%
But I grew up as a fat kid.

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:52.200 align:middle line:84%
I was taken around to lots of
different medical personnel

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.960 align:middle line:84%
because I was the only
fat person in a family

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:55.990 align:middle line:90%
of all skinny people.

00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:58.120 align:middle line:84%
So there was obviously
something wrong with me.

00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.330 align:middle line:84%
I was eating the
same stuff they were.

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:03.120 align:middle line:84%
They later found there was all
sorts of glandular problems.

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:07.650 align:middle line:84%
But I'll tell you, once having
weighed 320 pounds and now,

00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:09.120 align:middle line:84%
for the last 50
years, weighing--

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:09.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're trim and fit.

00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:11.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HENDRICKS: --180 pounds.

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:16.320 align:middle line:84%
So I got into this
field to cure myself,

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:20.430 align:middle line:84%
basically-- to find out
why I weighed 320 pounds.

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:22.500 align:middle line:84%
Because the medics
weren't doing it for me.

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:23.970 align:middle line:84%
I was taking all
the pills, and I

00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:27.210 align:middle line:84%
was taking amphetamines
and all that stuff.

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:28.873 align:middle line:84%
But none of them
really helped me

00:26:28.873 --> 00:26:30.165 align:middle line:90%
lose the weight or permanently.

00:26:30.165 --> 00:26:31.165 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing worked.

00:26:31.165 --> 00:26:33.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: And so I
did it the natural way.

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:35.370 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of your
viewers will appreciate it

00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:40.260 align:middle line:84%
because I found out on one magic
day when I was 24 years old--

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:44.115 align:middle line:84%
I realized I was not just
a body and not just a mind.

00:26:44.115 --> 00:26:45.055 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At that age?

00:26:45.055 --> 00:26:46.890 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: I
was a spirit, too.

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:50.250 align:middle line:84%
I discovered that part
of me that's pure spirit.

00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't exactly
a religious conversion.

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:54.970 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't a religion
associated with it.

00:26:54.970 --> 00:26:57.570 align:middle line:84%
It actually it happened
when I fell on my back

00:26:57.570 --> 00:26:59.020 align:middle line:84%
on the ice one day
in New England.

00:26:59.020 --> 00:26:59.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ouch.

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:02.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: And I didn't
knock myself out, but I--

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:04.800 align:middle line:84%
I say now I had an
out-of-Hendricks experience.

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:08.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're sprawled on
your back just thinking, what

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:08.910 align:middle line:90%
have I done?

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:10.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HENDRICKS: What have I done?

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.930 align:middle line:84%
Because to my right
was a jagged rock.

00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, if I'd
fallen 6 inches to the right,

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:17.708 align:middle line:84%
I might have a hole
in my skull right now.

00:27:17.708 --> 00:27:19.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, you may be dead.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: So that was a
moment of waking up for me.

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:26.520 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment, I could
feel that spirit part of me

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.150 align:middle line:90%
for the first time.

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And so for the next year, I ate
only foods that fed my spirit.

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.070 align:middle line:84%
I ate apples instead
of candy bars,

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:39.420 align:middle line:84%
and I ate blueberries instead
of ice cream, and I ate--

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:41.880 align:middle line:84%
I just ate food that
I'd never eaten before.

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:44.620 align:middle line:84%
I discovered the magic
of fruits and vegetables.

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:47.640 align:middle line:84%
And within a year, I'd
lost more than 100 pounds.

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:48.750 align:middle line:90%
And not only that--

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:49.720 align:middle line:90%
my sight changed.

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.720 align:middle line:84%
I no longer had to wear
glasses after that year.

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:51.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:52.670 align:middle line:90%
That's dramatic.

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:53.470 align:middle line:90%
>>HENDRICKS: Yeah.

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:55.170 align:middle line:84%
I can pass my
driver's test now--

00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:56.127 align:middle line:90%
I'm 75 years old.

00:27:56.127 --> 00:27:57.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm still passing my
driver's test without--

00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:58.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:00.108 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS:
--wearing any glasses.

00:28:00.108 --> 00:28:02.640 align:middle line:84%
The other thing
that happened was I

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:06.510 align:middle line:84%
developed what I now call
light psychic capabilities.

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:09.900 align:middle line:84%
I began to be able to
see things in my clients.

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:11.923 align:middle line:84%
And I don't make a
profession out of this,

00:28:11.923 --> 00:28:12.840 align:middle line:90%
or anything like this.

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:15.870 align:middle line:84%
But I'm open to it when
I work with my clients.

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:19.080 align:middle line:84%
I was working with a person
one day, and all of a sudden

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:22.410 align:middle line:84%
the image came to
me of that person

00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:25.230 align:middle line:84%
finding a dead person
when they were little

00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:27.190 align:middle line:84%
and it having some
kind of impact.

00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:28.380 align:middle line:90%
And I just blurted it out.

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:30.670 align:middle line:84%
I said, did you
have some experience

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:32.660 align:middle line:84%
with seeing a dead person
when you were a kid?

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:33.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just popped--

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:33.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HENDRICKS: Popped.

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:34.870 align:middle line:90%
It just popped out.

00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:37.810 align:middle line:90%
And her jaw dropped.

00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:39.498 align:middle line:90%
And she said, oh, my god.

00:28:39.498 --> 00:28:41.290 align:middle line:84%
That was one of the
worst times of my life.

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:41.515 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:28:41.515 --> 00:28:43.400 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: She
was coming home when

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:45.430 align:middle line:84%
she was, like, 8
or 10 years old,

00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:47.830 align:middle line:90%
and she saw a person in a ditch.

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And she thought it
was a dead person,

00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:52.330 align:middle line:84%
and she ran home and told
her parents about it.

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:53.777 align:middle line:84%
And they came--
and it turned out

00:28:53.777 --> 00:28:55.360 align:middle line:84%
to be a drunk person
who'd passed out.

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:56.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who'd passed out.

00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:58.035 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: But the
trauma was the way

00:28:58.035 --> 00:28:59.480 align:middle line:90%
it was handled in her family.

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:00.840 align:middle line:90%
It became a big joke.

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:02.903 align:middle line:84%
Oh, look, she thought
the person was dead.

00:29:02.903 --> 00:29:03.820 align:middle line:90%
It was actually drunk.

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:06.490 align:middle line:84%
So she was kind of
humiliated for this thing,

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:08.330 align:middle line:90%
and it became a family joke.

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And so it came in
handy in therapy

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:15.220 align:middle line:84%
to have things like
that just come to me.

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:16.570 align:middle line:90%
And I've used it now--

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:19.630 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with something
like 1,000 business executives

00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:20.680 align:middle line:90%
over the past 30 years.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:24.470 align:middle line:84%
And I even use it with, like,
the CEO of a big company

00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:25.270 align:middle line:90%
when I'm in there.

00:29:25.270 --> 00:29:26.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:29.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: I think that any
therapist worth their salt

00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:30.750 align:middle line:84%
has got to be a
little bit psychic.

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:31.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:32.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: Otherwise,
you should go

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:33.940 align:middle line:90%
into some other line of work.

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And certainly you should be
open to receiving information

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.710 align:middle line:90%
from other places.

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:40.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gay, on the
Gaia "Inspirations" show

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:43.600 align:middle line:84%
with Regina Meredith,
David Francis talked

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:46.900 align:middle line:84%
about how people can lose
their authentic selves

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:48.487 align:middle line:90%
in relationships.

00:29:48.487 --> 00:29:51.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: You have this
relationship in the beginning

00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:52.970 align:middle line:90%
that has this exuberance to it.

00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And before you know it,
fear starts seeping in.

00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:56.320 align:middle line:90%
Oh, this is so wonderful.

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.930 align:middle line:84%
What if I lose
this relationship?

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:01.720 align:middle line:84%
And that seems to
distort and throw--

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:04.030 align:middle line:84%
I know women in particular--
them into patterns

00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:05.710 align:middle line:90%
of becoming pleasers.

00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:08.250 align:middle line:84%
The man was originally attracted
to their authentic signal,

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:09.050 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:09.940 align:middle line:90%
And vise versa.

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:10.180 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID FRANCIS: Yes, yes, yes.

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:10.600 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:13.190 align:middle line:84%
A great example is a radio
set-- just a simple, practical

00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:13.990 align:middle line:90%
example.

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:15.720 align:middle line:84%
The old fashioned
kind with a dial?

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:17.590 align:middle line:84%
And when you get
the dial on station,

00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:19.090 align:middle line:90%
you get this beautiful music.

00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:20.980 align:middle line:84%
But if the dial
turns off station,

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:22.510 align:middle line:90%
you start to get static.

00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:24.850 align:middle line:84%
So when a person starts
to produce static

00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:28.360 align:middle line:84%
because they're no longer true
to their own authentic self,

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:32.160 align:middle line:84%
then it's very hard
to pick up their song.

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And so what gets
attracted is no longer

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:36.580 align:middle line:90%
what's on their frequency.

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:38.230 align:middle line:84%
So we actually
are in a situation

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:40.180 align:middle line:84%
where when we can be
true to ourselves,

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:41.890 align:middle line:90%
we sing our own song.

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:44.620 align:middle line:84%
When that song goes
out into the ether,

00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:47.500 align:middle line:84%
someone else can actually
register and pick up

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.820 align:middle line:84%
what that song is,
and they come to it.

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:52.580 align:middle line:84%
But if we're not actually
tuned in to ourselves--

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:55.300 align:middle line:84%
it's like if we decide we're
going to take on the goth look.

00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:57.910 align:middle line:84%
But that's nothing to
do with our reality.

00:30:57.910 --> 00:31:00.280 align:middle line:84%
But it's come upon
us from the outside.

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:02.470 align:middle line:84%
We just become another
goth look person

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:04.220 align:middle line:84%
rather than being
authentic to who we are.

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:04.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
And our own signal

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:05.808 align:middle line:90%
starts becoming obscured.

00:31:05.808 --> 00:31:06.850 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID FRANCIS: Exactly.

00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And it could go from
goth look to Vogue model

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.840 align:middle line:90%
to whatever the model would be.

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Or in the man's world,
it's got to be--

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:16.650 align:middle line:84%
whether it's following NASCAR
or wearing certain sporty things

00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:19.900 align:middle line:84%
in gentlemen's magazines or
whatever the thing-- there's

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:23.950 align:middle line:84%
a massive influence
comes towards the person.

00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:25.660 align:middle line:84%
And when we adopt
those signals, they

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:28.760 align:middle line:84%
can obscure our
actual core signal.

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:32.650 align:middle line:84%
So when that happens, first of
all, we can't find our partner.

00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And then, if we are
fortunate enough

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:37.410 align:middle line:84%
to engage, if we become
pleasers, so we think,

00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:40.450 align:middle line:84%
oh, what does he
really want me to be?

00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:42.130 align:middle line:84%
What does she really
want me to be?

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:43.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: And women--

00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:46.240 align:middle line:84%
I know women who
are amazing women,

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:49.810 align:middle line:84%
powerful women in their own
right-- talented, beautiful.

00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:52.720 align:middle line:84%
They go into a relationship,
and the first thing that happens

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.360 align:middle line:84%
is you start losing
yourself in fear you're

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:58.985 align:middle line:84%
going to lose the guy and
starting to please and become

00:31:58.985 --> 00:32:01.360 align:middle line:84%
what you think that person
wants, as I mentioned earlier.

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:03.330 align:middle line:90%
This is epidemic.

00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:05.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a science
behind this, Gay, isn't there?

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:06.730 align:middle line:90%
>>HENDRICKS: There is.

00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:08.770 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I mentioned that
my wife and I have written

00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:10.070 align:middle line:90%
a number of relationship books.

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that we found--

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:14.678 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned the
upper limit problem.

00:32:14.678 --> 00:32:16.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you want to see
the upper limit problem,

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:17.485 align:middle line:90%
look into relationships.

00:32:17.485 --> 00:32:17.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:19.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: Because
couples will get along well

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:20.890 align:middle line:90%
for a couple of days.

00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
some old fear will come up.

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:26.560 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is,
a lot of us learn

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:31.150 align:middle line:84%
to conceal rather than
reveal in relationships.

00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And so my wife and
I have worked with,

00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:35.140 align:middle line:84%
I believe, about
4,500 couples now.

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And I would say that the number
one problem that people come in

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:41.980 align:middle line:84%
with is an inability
to communicate

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:43.600 align:middle line:90%
really simple things.

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:45.760 align:middle line:84%
Just make little 10
second communications,

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:49.480 align:middle line:84%
like, I appreciate you, or I
love you, or I'm mad at you,

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:52.180 align:middle line:84%
or I feel scared
right now, or I'm sad.

00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:56.220 align:middle line:84%
Just little moments of
authentic communication

00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:59.980 align:middle line:84%
make such huge, huge
difference in people's lives.

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:02.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does compliments
or building up people--

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:05.020 align:middle line:84%
does that help in a
relationship as opposed

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:08.580 align:middle line:84%
to someone who's abusive
and puts people down?

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:09.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HENDRICKS: Definitely.

00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:15.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, appreciation is one of the
miracle tools of relationship.

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:18.190 align:middle line:84%
I think that John Gottman,
the relationship researcher up

00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:21.160 align:middle line:84%
at the University of Washington
who works on relationships--

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:25.660 align:middle line:84%
and he found that relationships
that have a 5 to 1

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:30.990 align:middle line:84%
appreciation to criticism
ratio are ones that work best.

00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:33.740 align:middle line:84%
So make sure you-- if
you criticize somebody,

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:37.250 align:middle line:84%
make sure you give them at
least five compliments later

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:38.190 align:middle line:90%
to make up for it.

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:38.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To ease them--

00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:39.640 align:middle line:90%
make them feel better.

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:40.723 align:middle line:90%
>>HENDRICKS: To ease them.

00:33:40.723 --> 00:33:42.830 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is that
I know my wife loves

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:43.990 align:middle line:90%
verbal compliments.

00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:47.000 align:middle line:84%
She loves it when
I say, I really

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.020 align:middle line:84%
appreciate the way
you look today,

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:53.570 align:middle line:84%
or, I really appreciate what
you did for me and the girls

00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:55.070 align:middle line:90%
yesterday.

00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:59.180 align:middle line:84%
But she also really
thrives on physical--

00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:00.290 align:middle line:90%
like, physical.

00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:02.820 align:middle line:84%
So we've got to make sure that
we get the verbal balance.

00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:04.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Humans need
both, don't they?

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:05.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HENDRICKS: Humans need both.

00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:07.670 align:middle line:84%
We're-- the skin is
our largest organ.

00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:10.370 align:middle line:90%
We need to be held close.

00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And so my wife and I have a
tradition of 20-second hugs

00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:19.070 align:middle line:84%
because we found that
there's a research

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:21.590 align:middle line:84%
study that a
20-second hug releases

00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:24.900 align:middle line:84%
oxytocin, which is a bonding
chemical in your body.

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:27.199 align:middle line:84%
And so we have
pictures of ourselves

00:34:27.199 --> 00:34:29.505 align:middle line:84%
from all over the world doing
our 20-second hug-- like,

00:34:29.505 --> 00:34:30.630 align:middle line:90%
at the top of Machu Picchu.

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:32.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not 19, but 20, right?

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:33.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HENDRICKS: 20.

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:33.980 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:36.188 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You have a book
out called "Conscious Luck."

00:34:36.188 --> 00:34:37.034 align:middle line:10%
tell us about that.

00:34:37.034 --> 00:34:39.409 align:middle line:10%
>>HENDRICKS: Well, "Conscious
Luck" is my recent passion.

00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:42.560 align:middle line:10%
I started working with
people a while back

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:45.260 align:middle line:10%
on the issue of helping
make them more lucky.

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And I got fascinated
that because I

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:52.760 align:middle line:84%
had an experience once of
actually deciding consciously

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:55.460 align:middle line:84%
that I was going to
be luckier, and then

00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:58.407 align:middle line:84%
having something lucky happened
to me right afterwards.

00:34:58.407 --> 00:34:59.240 align:middle line:90%
And it made a true--

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:00.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, I believe this.

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:00.680 align:middle line:90%
This is true.

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:01.520 align:middle line:90%
>>HENDRICKS: --true believer.

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:02.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:04.750 align:middle line:90%
And then I had this--

00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:07.340 align:middle line:84%
a friend of mine and
I were at a movie.

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And they had a drawing, and
they were 250 people there.

00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And we all put our tickets
in a goldfish bowl,

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:16.400 align:middle line:84%
and they were going to
draw the tickets out.

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.720 align:middle line:90%
And my friend said, watch this.

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:20.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to win.

00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:22.230 align:middle line:84%
And I said, how
do you know that?

00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I always win
lotteries and drawings

00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:25.890 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:28.190 align:middle line:84%
Sure enough, they pulled
his name out number one.

00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:29.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of all these tickets?

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:32.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: Of all 250
tickets, he was the top prize,

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:33.500 align:middle line:90%
and he won a wristwatch.

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:35.630 align:middle line:84%
And afterwards, we
were walking home,

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:37.350 align:middle line:90%
and I said, how did you do that?

00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:39.860 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, he had
just made up his mind one

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:42.170 align:middle line:84%
day that he was going
to be what he said--

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:43.687 align:middle line:90%
one of the lucky ones.

00:35:43.687 --> 00:35:45.020 align:middle line:90%
And I asked him what that meant.

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And he said that in his family,
the people that were lucky seem

00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:50.760 align:middle line:84%
to have good things
happen to them,

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:53.420 align:middle line:84%
and the people that considered
themselves unlucky didn't.

00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:55.910 align:middle line:84%
So he said, I'm going to
be one of the lucky ones.

00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And so from that day on, he'd
had all these good things

00:35:58.810 --> 00:35:59.610 align:middle line:90%
happen.

00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:02.150 align:middle line:84%
So I just decided to kind
of take it on myself.

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And so I got interested in this
thing of consciously changing

00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:06.080 align:middle line:90%
our luck.

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And so I started working
with all sorts of people--

00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:10.055 align:middle line:84%
everybody from Las
Vegas gamblers--

00:36:10.055 --> 00:36:11.263 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh sure, absolutely.

00:36:11.263 --> 00:36:13.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: --to
CEOs because you'd

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:17.090 align:middle line:84%
be surprised at how much luck
plays in the field of even

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:18.080 align:middle line:90%
a corporate CEO.

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:20.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you familiar with
Joseph Gallenberger's work?

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:21.260 align:middle line:90%
>>HENDRICKS: Sure.

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:22.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Liquid luck?

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:22.340 align:middle line:90%
>>HENDRICKS: Yeah.

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:23.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same thing.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.000 align:middle line:90%
>>HENDRICKS: Same thing.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And see, I believe that
unless we are consciously

00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:29.870 align:middle line:84%
working every day on
making ourselves luckier,

00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:32.150 align:middle line:84%
we're not taking
advantage of the odds.

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And in "Conscious Luck,"
my researcher Carol and

00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:39.015 align:middle line:84%
I found eight different paths
that people use to get lucky.

00:36:39.015 --> 00:36:39.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love this.

00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:41.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: And
so we just describe

00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:43.190 align:middle line:84%
all of those very
carefully in the book.

00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:45.743 align:middle line:84%
And some are some things that
you can do in 10 seconds.

00:36:45.743 --> 00:36:46.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're easy, yeah.

00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:47.993 align:middle line:90%
>>HENDRICKS: They're easy.

00:36:47.993 --> 00:36:51.230 align:middle line:84%
Like, the simplest one in
the book in the first chapter

00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:54.827 align:middle line:84%
is simply to make a
commitment to being luckier.

00:36:54.827 --> 00:36:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't cost you
a nickel to do that.

00:36:56.660 --> 00:37:02.270 align:middle line:84%
You can just say, OK, I
commit to being luckier today

00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:03.680 align:middle line:90%
than I was yesterday.

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And I commit to being luckier
tomorrow than I was yesterday.

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:10.933 align:middle line:84%
And so every day, you
get a little bit luckier.

00:37:10.933 --> 00:37:13.100 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like going to
the gym and doing a few--

00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:15.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it
positive thinking?

00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:17.782 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: It's a form
of positive thinking.

00:37:17.782 --> 00:37:20.480 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember William
James, the great--

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:22.700 align:middle line:84%
he was called the father
of American psychology?

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:24.740 align:middle line:90%
He lived in the 19th century.

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And the 19th century had
everything from locomotives

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:29.240 align:middle line:90%
to telegraphs invented.

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:30.240 align:middle line:90%
So it was a big century.

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:31.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:33.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: He said the
greatest discovery of his

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:34.280 align:middle line:90%
time--

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:37.100 align:middle line:84%
the 19th century--
was that human beings

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:40.190 align:middle line:84%
could change the
direction of their lives

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:41.855 align:middle line:90%
by changing their thoughts.

00:37:41.855 --> 00:37:42.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I agree with that.

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:44.110 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: I totally
agree with that.

00:37:44.110 --> 00:37:44.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 100%.

00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:48.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: And I used to
be my own worst customer,

00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:51.800 align:middle line:84%
in a sense, because
I grew up in a family

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:55.260 align:middle line:84%
where people just did not
think positively at all.

00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:58.850 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it was kind of a
family of cynics, you know.

00:37:58.850 --> 00:37:59.910 align:middle line:90%
And to this day--

00:37:59.910 --> 00:37:59.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Malcontents.

00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:00.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HENDRICKS: Yeah.

00:38:00.970 --> 00:38:04.160 align:middle line:84%
My brother-- if I say something
positive to my brother,

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:06.080 align:middle line:84%
he will say the exact
same thing that he

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:07.790 align:middle line:84%
said when he was
15 years old, even

00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:09.140 align:middle line:90%
though he's 83 years old now.

00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:10.490 align:middle line:90%
He will say something like--

00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:13.970 align:middle line:84%
I'll say, well, we're going
to the beach tomorrow.

00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:18.210 align:middle line:84%
And he'll say, well, god,
I hope it doesn't rain.

00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:20.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right, exactly-- rather
than being positive about it.

00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:21.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HENDRICKS: Yeah.

00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:24.500 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things I had
to learn as a grown-up was

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:26.450 align:middle line:84%
how to think more
positively of things

00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:28.192 align:middle line:84%
because I found
myself-- in my 20s,

00:38:28.192 --> 00:38:29.900 align:middle line:84%
I would always look
at the negative side.

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And when my daughter was
born, I kind of made a vow

00:38:34.070 --> 00:38:36.530 align:middle line:84%
that I wasn't going to
teach her negative thinking.

00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:39.140 align:middle line:84%
I was going to teach her how
to think more positively.

00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:41.810 align:middle line:84%
And I think-- even
though she's now 50,

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:44.190 align:middle line:84%
I think it had a
positive effect on her.

00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:46.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a fellow
by the name of Dan Heer who

00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:49.960 align:middle line:84%
talks with our Lisa Garr
on the Gaia "Inspirations"

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:53.900 align:middle line:84%
show about picking up
other people's beliefs,

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:56.767 align:middle line:84%
just like you were talking
about your brother.

00:38:56.767 --> 00:38:59.350 align:middle line:10%
>>DAN HEER: The idea that 98%
of your thoughts, your feelings,

00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:01.723 align:middle line:10%
and your emotions don't
actually belong to you--

00:39:01.723 --> 00:39:03.640 align:middle line:10%
they actually belong to
the people around you.

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:05.673 align:middle line:10%
And you're like a big,
psychic radio receiver,

00:39:05.673 --> 00:39:07.840 align:middle line:10%
and you've been picking it
up your whole life, which

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:09.790 align:middle line:10%
means that 98% of
the unhappiness,

00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:12.300 align:middle line:10%
98% of the sadness,
98% of the anger,

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:15.447 align:middle line:10%
98% of the money struggle,
98% of the feeling

00:39:15.447 --> 00:39:17.530 align:middle line:10%
that you can't do it and
can't create the life you

00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:19.720 align:middle line:10%
want isn't actually yours.

00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:22.630 align:middle line:10%
You're so psychically
aware of those energies

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:25.090 align:middle line:10%
that you pick them up like a
big psychic radio receiver,

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:26.650 align:middle line:10%
and you've been thinking
they're yours your whole life.

00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:27.630 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA GARR: Right, of course.

00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:28.090 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:29.330 align:middle line:10%
>>DAN HEER: And if
that weren't there?

00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:30.780 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA GARR: So
a good question--

00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:31.480 align:middle line:10%
who would I be?

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:31.840 align:middle line:10%
Right?

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:32.830 align:middle line:10%
>>DAN HEER: Yeah, exactly.

00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:33.700 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA GARR: Who would I be?

00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:35.270 align:middle line:10%
So you start off
by asking yourself,

00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:36.290 align:middle line:10%
who does this belong to?

00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:37.090 align:middle line:10%
>>DAN HEER: Yeah.

00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:39.220 align:middle line:10%
And in actuality, if
you'll do that for three

00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:43.060 align:middle line:10%
days to every thought, feeling,
emotion, judgment, heaviness,

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:44.650 align:middle line:10%
or point of view you have--

00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:46.515 align:middle line:10%
for three days,
literally, for everything

00:39:46.515 --> 00:39:47.890 align:middle line:10%
that takes you
out of being space

00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:50.530 align:middle line:10%
into-- eh, every single thing.

00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:52.030 align:middle line:10%
If you ask, who
does this belong to?

00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:54.040 align:middle line:10%
If it lightens up at
all, it's not yours.

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:55.510 align:middle line:10%
Return it to sender.

00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:59.210 align:middle line:10%
And the thing is, you don't even
have to know who the sender is.

00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:00.010 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA GARR: Right.

00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:00.640 align:middle line:10%
>>DAN HEER: You
just want to give it

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:02.473 align:middle line:10%
back to the person who
originally created it

00:40:02.473 --> 00:40:04.960 align:middle line:10%
so they can work
on it so you're not

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:07.420 align:middle line:10%
working on all kinds of
other people's stuff.

00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:09.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Since you've been
doing this all these years,

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:11.950 align:middle line:84%
what has been the
most dramatic story

00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:15.520 align:middle line:90%
you've come across of change?

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:17.890 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: I've had
three similar instances,

00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:23.560 align:middle line:84%
but the first one
that happened really

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:26.260 align:middle line:84%
shocked me in a
very positive way.

00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:28.330 align:middle line:84%
I worked with a woman
who was at the time

00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:30.970 align:middle line:90%
maybe 28, 30 years old.

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:33.940 align:middle line:90%
And her hearing had disappeared.

00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And she had about
50% hearing loss

00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:40.400 align:middle line:84%
for no reason that
could be detected.

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:41.748 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:40:41.748 --> 00:40:42.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing medical?

00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:43.998 align:middle line:90%
>>HENDRICKS: Nothing medical.

00:40:43.998 --> 00:40:47.110 align:middle line:84%
She'd had all the usual tests,
and nobody could figure it out.

00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And she'd even done
some psychiatry

00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:51.580 align:middle line:84%
where they talked
about childhood

00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:52.840 align:middle line:90%
issues and everything.

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:56.020 align:middle line:84%
But in my work with her were
doing body-centered therapy,

00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:58.570 align:middle line:84%
which often kind of
cuts through very fast

00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:00.670 align:middle line:90%
and gets to things very quickly.

00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed, as she was
talking about her hearing

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:08.440 align:middle line:84%
problem, that she really kept
gesturing toward her pelvis.

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:11.230 align:middle line:90%
And so I took a bold leap.

00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:16.480 align:middle line:84%
I said, were you ever
sexually violated or messed

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:20.250 align:middle line:90%
with as a young person?

00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:21.060 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:22.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-oh.

00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:23.100 align:middle line:90%
>>HENDRICKS: Boom.

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:27.450 align:middle line:84%
Out came the story that
she had never told anyone

00:41:27.450 --> 00:41:30.030 align:middle line:84%
about the sexual violation
that had happened when

00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:34.340 align:middle line:90%
she was 12 or 13 years old.

00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:39.023 align:middle line:84%
Now, why did it cause a hearing
problem when she was 28 or 29?

00:41:39.023 --> 00:41:40.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's some
kind of block somewhere.

00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:43.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: What
happened was, she'd

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:46.920 align:middle line:84%
had an interaction with a man
who was very interested in her.

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And as he was kind of
making his play for her,

00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:52.940 align:middle line:90%
it brought up this whole issue.

00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:55.110 align:middle line:84%
But she didn't even
remember it at the time.

00:41:55.110 --> 00:41:57.873 align:middle line:84%
She just knew that
something was wrong,

00:41:57.873 --> 00:41:59.040 align:middle line:90%
and her hearing disappeared.

00:41:59.040 --> 00:41:59.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something's wrong.

00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:00.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:02.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: And so as we
worked together, her hearing

00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:03.750 align:middle line:90%
came back.

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:04.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:05.660 align:middle line:90%
It's almost a miracle.

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:08.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: You only get to
see something like that in life

00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:10.730 align:middle line:84%
if you're very blessed,
I think, one time.

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:13.490 align:middle line:84%
I've gotten to have that happen
three times with the actual--

00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:14.330 align:middle line:90%
once it happened with her--

00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:15.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, that's dramatic.

00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:16.370 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: --next
time I worked

00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:17.995 align:middle line:84%
with a person who
had hearing problems,

00:42:17.995 --> 00:42:20.090 align:middle line:84%
I looked into that
issue with them.

00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:22.100 align:middle line:90%
And the same-- similar issue.

00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:23.330 align:middle line:90%
Not exactly the same.

00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:27.500 align:middle line:84%
But to me, our bodies have
been communicating with us

00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:29.750 align:middle line:84%
for millions and
millions of years.

00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:33.260 align:middle line:84%
But our mouths haven't been
communicating very long at all.

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:37.130 align:middle line:84%
Language is a recent development
compared to our emotions.

00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:40.550 align:middle line:84%
So we've got to make sure we
honor the whole person when

00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:41.827 align:middle line:90%
we look at ourselves.

00:42:41.827 --> 00:42:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And especially if we're a
therapist or a counselor

00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:45.410 align:middle line:84%
or a coach, we've
got to remember

00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:47.870 align:middle line:84%
that this is a whole
person we're dealing with,

00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:49.232 align:middle line:90%
not just a mind.

00:42:49.232 --> 00:42:50.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As we wrap
things up, Gay,

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:53.630 align:middle line:84%
tell us about a breathing
experiment exercise

00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:55.157 align:middle line:90%
that we can all do.

00:42:55.157 --> 00:42:56.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: There is
one I teach everybody.

00:42:56.990 --> 00:42:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And that is to take
three easy breaths

00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:02.040 align:middle line:90%
and change your body position.

00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:03.770 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I
tell everybody to do

00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:06.530 align:middle line:84%
that is because if
you do that, you only

00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:10.100 align:middle line:84%
have to take three easy, big
breaths before your stress

00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:13.200 align:middle line:84%
chemistry begins to shift
in your bloodstream.

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:14.120 align:middle line:90%
So watch me.

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:15.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take
three big breaths,

00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:17.790 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to use
my whole body to do it.

00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:18.590 align:middle line:90%
Watch this.

00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:22.810 align:middle line:90%


00:43:22.810 --> 00:43:24.400 align:middle line:90%
Notice how I'm flexing my spine.

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:26.615 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was one.

00:43:26.615 --> 00:43:27.415 align:middle line:90%
Two.

00:43:27.415 --> 00:43:33.360 align:middle line:90%


00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:34.500 align:middle line:90%
Three.

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:36.570 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: Give
yourself a good stretch.

00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:38.070 align:middle line:90%
So take three easy breaths.

00:43:38.070 --> 00:43:40.140 align:middle line:90%
Now here's the miracle part.

00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:43.120 align:middle line:84%
The breath has got to
be 8 to 10 seconds long.

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:49.602 align:middle line:10%
So make sure you go,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:43:49.602 --> 00:43:51.060 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: In and
out, eight seconds.

00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:52.710 align:middle line:10%
>>HENDRICKS: In
out for 8 seconds--

00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:54.870 align:middle line:10%
8 to 10 seconds--
three of those.

00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:56.100 align:middle line:10%
And then stretch your body.

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:56.910 align:middle line:10%
Move your body.

00:43:56.910 --> 00:43:59.010 align:middle line:84%
Move your joints
around a little bit.

00:43:59.010 --> 00:44:01.380 align:middle line:84%
And that has the
effect of-- beginning

00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:05.110 align:middle line:84%
to shift things actually
chase the stress chemistry out

00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:05.910 align:middle line:90%
of your body.

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:06.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:09.020 align:middle line:90%
Will that make you luckier?

00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:10.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HENDRICKS: If you
read "Conscious Luck."

00:44:10.770 --> 00:44:11.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love it.

00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:11.760 align:middle line:90%
>>HENDRICKS: I love it.

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:13.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gay, Thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:14.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HENDRICKS: Thank you.

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:15.743 align:middle line:84%
You're doing a great
job in the world.

00:44:15.743 --> 00:44:18.290 align:middle line:84%
I appreciate your work
on the radio and on TV.

00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:20.940 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Three deep
breaths, change your body,

00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:22.320 align:middle line:10%
and your world will change.

00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:23.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:26.220 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
