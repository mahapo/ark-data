[Laughter] You know, because I
just loved those guys so much.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.452 align:middle line:84%
And I was the only female
because our producers,

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:01.788 align:middle line:84%
our executive producers
Jim Brooks, Stan Daniels

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:03.823 align:middle line:84%
and Edwin Berger, [inaudible]
Davis; they had just come

00:02:03.823 --> 00:02:06.293 align:middle line:84%
from the Mary Tyler Moore
Show, and Rhoda, and Phyllis

00:02:06.293 --> 00:02:08.994 align:middle line:84%
and all those shows, and they
wanted to write for guys.

00:02:08.994 --> 00:02:10.564 align:middle line:84%
But they knew they had
to have one female.

00:02:10.564 --> 00:02:14.401 align:middle line:84%
So I became the girl and it
was really -- it was just --

00:02:14.401 --> 00:02:17.737 align:middle line:84%
it was the first -- it was such
a poignant time in my life too

00:02:17.737 --> 00:02:20.907 align:middle line:84%
because I was auditioning
for it,

00:02:20.907 --> 00:02:25.879 align:middle line:84%
my mother was actually suffering
from Rheumatoid Arthritis

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.349 align:middle line:84%
and she passed away a few
weeks before I got  Taxi .

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Like just -- and
I always felt...

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:31.985 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: She
would have loved that.

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:33.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: She --
I think she arranged it.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.889 align:middle line:84%
I think she was the reason I
ended -- oh I'm going to cry --

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:37.591 align:middle line:84%
she was the reason
I got that show.

00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:39.992 align:middle line:84%
Because she knew how
important that was to me

00:02:39.992 --> 00:02:42.128 align:middle line:84%
and she kept saying -- because
I was visiting her in Chicago

00:02:42.128 --> 00:02:44.129 align:middle line:84%
and she kept saying, you
know, go back and you're going

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.399 align:middle line:84%
to get this, you're going to
get this and then I got it,

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:49.302 align:middle line:84%
but it was such an
extraordinary experience

00:02:49.302 --> 00:02:50.804 align:middle line:84%
and we're all still
friends today.

00:02:50.804 --> 00:02:53.206 align:middle line:84%
And the -- we did
it for five years

00:02:53.206 --> 00:02:55.141 align:middle line:90%
and the writing was so good.

00:02:55.141 --> 00:02:57.744 align:middle line:84%
They wrote really
rich, vivid characters

00:02:57.744 --> 00:03:01.481 align:middle line:84%
and then they cast actors that
fit those roles perfectly.

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:03.683 align:middle line:84%
So it's still my favorite
theatrical experience

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:04.818 align:middle line:90%
that I've ever done.

00:03:04.818 --> 00:03:06.086 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: We've
got a surprise for you.

00:03:06.086 --> 00:03:08.822 align:middle line:84%
Danny DeVito is standing
right next to you [laughter].

00:03:08.822 --> 00:03:09.623 align:middle line:90%
Danny, how are you?

00:03:09.623 --> 00:03:10.724 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: I thought

00:03:10.724 --> 00:03:11.558 align:middle line:84%
for a second you were
serious [laughter].

00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:12.492 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: He's a riot.

00:03:12.492 --> 00:03:13.526 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
He is so funny.

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:15.328 align:middle line:84%
You know, everybody
always asks me --

00:03:15.328 --> 00:03:19.733 align:middle line:84%
it's funny when I was on  Taxi
and for years it was always,

00:03:19.733 --> 00:03:21.501 align:middle line:90%
"What's Danny DeVito like?"

00:03:21.501 --> 00:03:23.637 align:middle line:84%
Then I did a show
called  Evening Shade

00:03:23.637 --> 00:03:24.738 align:middle line:90%
with Burt Reynolds.

00:03:24.738 --> 00:03:26.740 align:middle line:84%
Then they would say,
"Is Burt a good kisser?"

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:27.974 align:middle line:90%
That was always the question.

00:03:27.974 --> 00:03:31.144 align:middle line:84%
And now I get, "Is that
really Donald Trump's hair?"

00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:32.212 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter] You know?

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:35.448 align:middle line:84%
So the guys in my
life always get the --

00:03:35.448 --> 00:03:37.284 align:middle line:84%
I always get the
questions about them.

00:03:37.284 --> 00:03:39.119 align:middle line:84%
But Danny was kind
of the confidant.

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:44.157 align:middle line:84%
He was sort of the Yoda of the
group, and he was so delicious

00:03:44.157 --> 00:03:47.661 align:middle line:84%
as that character that he
actually was signed up for seven

00:03:47.661 --> 00:03:51.665 align:middle line:84%
out of 13 episodes, but as
soon as he left that cage

00:03:51.665 --> 00:03:54.534 align:middle line:84%
in the very first episode
and you got to see him walk

00:03:54.534 --> 00:03:58.004 align:middle line:84%
down the steps and there
he was, a star was born.

00:03:58.004 --> 00:03:58.772 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
He had to be there.

00:03:58.772 --> 00:03:59.639 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Oh yeah.

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:00.840 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Had to be.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.042 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: He --
and he ended up, you know,

00:04:02.042 --> 00:04:02.742 align:middle line:84%
having ownership in the
show and everything else.

00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:04.144 align:middle line:90%
So he was great.

00:04:04.144 --> 00:04:05.478 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: How
did you get the part?

00:04:05.478 --> 00:04:06.680 align:middle line:90%
How did that all happen for you?

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.081 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: Well
it was really interesting

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:10.917 align:middle line:84%
because I had a contract with
CBS at the time and they -- I --

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:14.120 align:middle line:90%
which was --  Taxi  was on ABC.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.355 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Right.

00:04:15.355 --> 00:04:16.122 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: So CBS
offered me this other series

00:04:16.122 --> 00:04:17.524 align:middle line:90%
and I happened to be away.

00:04:17.524 --> 00:04:20.927 align:middle line:84%
Kind of like those weird -- I
mean there's something bigger

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:23.596 align:middle line:84%
than all of us because
somehow the fates ended

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:26.232 align:middle line:84%
up where I couldn't
honor my contract,

00:04:26.232 --> 00:04:28.335 align:middle line:84%
and then I finally did,
but I did this other show.

00:04:28.335 --> 00:04:30.904 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, it's too long
a story to go into.

00:04:30.904 --> 00:04:33.573 align:middle line:84%
But they wanted a
33-year-old Italian New Yorker.

00:04:33.573 --> 00:04:35.375 align:middle line:90%
At the time I was 25.

00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:37.744 align:middle line:84%
They wanted somebody who could
have a 16-year-old daughter.

00:04:37.744 --> 00:04:39.679 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't have one at 25.

00:04:39.679 --> 00:04:40.680 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Right.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.881 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
But they liked me

00:04:41.881 --> 00:04:43.283 align:middle line:84%
so they kept bringing me
back and bringing me back.

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:45.218 align:middle line:84%
And they said, "Well, she's got
the right qualities and stuff."

00:04:45.218 --> 00:04:46.619 align:middle line:90%
That kind of thing.

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:48.121 align:middle line:84%
And then this other
show wanted me

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:51.224 align:middle line:84%
so I think the competition made
them say, "Okay, she's Elaine."

00:04:51.224 --> 00:04:52.592 align:middle line:90%
So that's how I got the part.

00:04:52.592 --> 00:04:54.361 align:middle line:84%
Through the casting
director, Joel Thurm.

00:04:54.361 --> 00:04:56.029 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Well
it's been a great sitcom.

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:57.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Oh fantastic.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:58.098 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And it
still -- it lives forever.

00:04:58.098 --> 00:04:59.031 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: It does.

00:04:59.031 --> 00:05:00.467 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Just the clips --

00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:02.001 align:middle line:84%
we're going to look at another
one in just a second Marilu.

00:05:02.001 --> 00:05:03.203 align:middle line:90%
It was just refreshing.

00:05:03.203 --> 00:05:04.838 align:middle line:84%
And I remember when I
first met you at one

00:05:04.838 --> 00:05:08.641 align:middle line:84%
of these speaking
engagements that I do so often.

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:11.711 align:middle line:84%
You just have so much
magnetism about you.

00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:13.046 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Thank you.

00:05:13.046 --> 00:05:14.280 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Which is
one of the things we're going

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.015 align:middle line:84%
to talk about, this ability
that you've been able

00:05:16.015 --> 00:05:19.452 align:middle line:84%
to have during your
entire career,

00:05:19.452 --> 00:05:22.155 align:middle line:90%
which truly is remarkable.

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:25.658 align:middle line:84%
But you've made -- you
have led a blessed life.

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:26.493 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: I have.

00:05:26.493 --> 00:05:27.560 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Haven't you?

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.395 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: I
am very, very lucky

00:05:28.395 --> 00:05:29.662 align:middle line:90%
and I came from a great family.

00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:32.165 align:middle line:84%
Two wonderful parents that
I lost very young in life.

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:34.968 align:middle line:84%
But I always felt that they were
out there protecting me and sort

00:05:34.968 --> 00:05:37.170 align:middle line:84%
of making things kind
of happen, you know.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.706 align:middle line:84%
A few weeks after my
father passed away I was 17,

00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:42.575 align:middle line:84%
I was a senior in high school,
and I got four scholarships

00:05:42.575 --> 00:05:43.977 align:middle line:84%
to go to the University
of Chicago.

00:05:43.977 --> 00:05:46.880 align:middle line:84%
So I always felt like that
was what was important to him

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.281 align:middle line:90%
and he made that happen.

00:05:48.281 --> 00:05:52.685 align:middle line:84%
And then my mom kind of made
the whole  Taxi  thing happen.

00:05:52.685 --> 00:05:55.288 align:middle line:84%
So I have always felt
sort of protected

00:05:55.288 --> 00:05:56.623 align:middle line:90%
by something else out there.

00:05:56.623 --> 00:05:57.690 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: She's
watching down on you.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:58.691 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
She's watching.

00:05:58.691 --> 00:05:59.826 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Marilu keep doing it.

00:05:59.826 --> 00:06:00.393 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: Yeah
[laughter] I know.

00:06:00.393 --> 00:06:01.628 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, for sure.

00:06:01.628 --> 00:06:02.429 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: We're
going to look at another one

00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:03.129 align:middle line:90%
of our favorite clips here.

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:04.063 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Okay.

00:06:04.063 --> 00:06:04.597 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Let's take a look.

00:06:04.597 --> 00:06:05.532 align:middle line:90%
>> Sit down.

00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:08.435 align:middle line:84%
Please. And tell
me about yourself.

00:06:08.435 --> 00:06:11.905 align:middle line:84%
>> [Laughter] What
do you want to know?

00:06:11.905 --> 00:06:13.173 align:middle line:90%
>> Anything.

00:06:13.173 --> 00:06:14.441 align:middle line:90%
I never met you before.

00:06:14.441 --> 00:06:15.442 align:middle line:90%
Who are you?

00:06:15.442 --> 00:06:18.111 align:middle line:84%
Tell me a typical
Elaine Nardo day.

00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:19.412 align:middle line:90%
>> Well okay.

00:06:19.412 --> 00:06:22.382 align:middle line:84%
Well, you see I got
this sort of schedule.

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:23.683 align:middle line:90%
I'm very organized.

00:06:23.683 --> 00:06:24.918 align:middle line:90%
Sure sign of mental health.

00:06:24.918 --> 00:06:25.552 align:middle line:90%
Right [laughter]?

00:06:25.552 --> 00:06:26.352 align:middle line:90%
Right [laughter].

00:06:26.352 --> 00:06:27.987 align:middle line:90%
So okay, this is what I do.

00:06:27.987 --> 00:06:32.257 align:middle line:84%
I get up and I get the
kids ready for school.

00:06:32.257 --> 00:06:35.528 align:middle line:84%
Right? And then I drop them off
at school and I run my errands

00:06:35.528 --> 00:06:37.330 align:middle line:84%
or I do laundry, and
I prepare supper.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.166 align:middle line:84%
And then I go to the gallery
and I work for four hours.

00:06:40.166 --> 00:06:42.268 align:middle line:84%
Then I pick up the
kids and then we kind

00:06:42.268 --> 00:06:43.670 align:middle line:90%
of spend some time together.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.505 align:middle line:84%
You know, I help them with their
homework, I give them a bath,

00:06:45.505 --> 00:06:46.773 align:middle line:90%
or whatever, and I make supper.

00:06:46.773 --> 00:06:49.576 align:middle line:84%
And then when the baby sitter
comes I go to the garage

00:06:49.576 --> 00:06:52.912 align:middle line:84%
and I take out a cab
and I drive all night.

00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:54.514 align:middle line:90%
And that's all.

00:06:54.514 --> 00:06:55.348 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow [laughter].

00:06:55.348 --> 00:06:58.218 align:middle line:90%
>> I know it sounds like a lot.

00:06:58.218 --> 00:06:59.185 align:middle line:90%
But you know once you...

00:06:59.185 --> 00:07:01.087 align:middle line:84%
>> How long have
you been doing this?

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:03.122 align:middle line:90%
>> A little over a year.

00:07:03.122 --> 00:07:03.957 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow [laughter].

00:07:03.957 --> 00:07:05.124 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: [Laughter].

00:07:05.124 --> 00:07:06.559 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: I love it.

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:08.061 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: It's like
I watch that show and I go

00:07:08.061 --> 00:07:09.596 align:middle line:84%
when did that -- when
did we shoot that?

00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:13.566 align:middle line:84%
And I think, okay, Friday;
it was August the 24th, 1979.

00:07:13.566 --> 00:07:16.169 align:middle line:84%
That week I was on  The Tonight
Show  with David Letterman,

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:18.271 align:middle line:84%
I met David Letterman for the
first time two days earlier.

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:20.573 align:middle line:84%
You know the whole week kind
of lines itself up for me

00:07:20.573 --> 00:07:21.875 align:middle line:90%
when I see these clips.

00:07:21.875 --> 00:07:23.376 align:middle line:84%
And I remember shooting
that episode

00:07:23.376 --> 00:07:25.378 align:middle line:84%
and Tom Ule [assumed spelling]
was of course so great.

00:07:25.378 --> 00:07:26.713 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Well
you have a great memory.

00:07:26.713 --> 00:07:27.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Yeah.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.048 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: As
a matter of fact one

00:07:29.048 --> 00:07:30.783 align:middle line:84%
of your bestselling books
Total Memory Makeover ,

00:07:30.783 --> 00:07:33.720 align:middle line:84%
based on the things
you do obviously.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.122 align:middle line:84%
Were you born this way or
did you train yourself?

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:38.358 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: Well,
I was definitely born

00:07:38.358 --> 00:07:41.494 align:middle line:84%
with something unusual which
they've now proven through all

00:07:41.494 --> 00:07:42.896 align:middle line:84%
of the testing and
everything else.

00:07:42.896 --> 00:07:45.098 align:middle line:84%
There was something --
there's something very unusual

00:07:45.098 --> 00:07:47.500 align:middle line:84%
about my memory, and
there are 12 of us now

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.636 align:middle line:84%
that have been documented
with H-SAM,

00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:52.372 align:middle line:84%
Highly Superior Autobiographical
Memory.

00:07:52.372 --> 00:07:56.608 align:middle line:84%
And so I -- even as a little
girl I had a crazy memory.

00:07:56.608 --> 00:07:59.279 align:middle line:84%
People would say, "What with
that -- how come she remembers?"

00:07:59.279 --> 00:08:00.713 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I'd
tell people, "Oh yeah,

00:08:00.713 --> 00:08:02.048 align:middle line:84%
remember we saw each
other again."

00:08:02.048 --> 00:08:03.783 align:middle line:84%
And I'd tell them
the date and things.

00:08:03.783 --> 00:08:07.887 align:middle line:84%
So I knew I had the best
memory in my family and then

00:08:07.887 --> 00:08:10.690 align:middle line:84%
as my circle got bigger
I knew among my friends.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:12.859 align:middle line:84%
And then college
among the other people

00:08:12.859 --> 00:08:14.427 align:middle line:90%
that I was going to school with.

00:08:14.427 --> 00:08:17.630 align:middle line:84%
But I really had no idea it was
that unusual or there was a name

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.999 align:middle line:84%
for it until the whole
60 Minutes thing came

00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:21.434 align:middle line:90%
about a few years ago.

00:08:21.434 --> 00:08:22.702 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yes.

00:08:22.702 --> 00:08:24.103 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: So now
they're finding that we've kind

00:08:24.103 --> 00:08:27.206 align:middle line:84%
of changed the medical
books and the textbooks,

00:08:27.206 --> 00:08:28.341 align:middle line:90%
and doctors, and stuff.

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:30.843 align:middle line:84%
It's -- they've written
a paper about it.

00:08:30.843 --> 00:08:31.978 align:middle line:90%
So...

00:08:31.978 --> 00:08:33.346 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Have
you ever been examined?

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:35.882 align:middle line:84%
I mean do you have an enlarged
brain or anything like that?

00:08:35.882 --> 00:08:37.083 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:08:37.083 --> 00:08:39.886 align:middle line:84%
What happened was Leslie
Staub was a friend of mine

00:08:39.886 --> 00:08:42.354 align:middle line:84%
and she was offered
a story about a woman

00:08:42.354 --> 00:08:43.723 align:middle line:90%
who had an unusual memory.

00:08:43.723 --> 00:08:46.326 align:middle line:84%
She said hate to burst your
bubble my friend Marilu Henner

00:08:46.326 --> 00:08:47.660 align:middle line:90%
has the same memory.

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:51.431 align:middle line:84%
So Diane Sawyer picked up
the story and it was on.

00:08:51.431 --> 00:08:53.166 align:middle line:84%
And then three years
later Leslie called me

00:08:53.166 --> 00:08:54.667 align:middle line:90%
and she said, "It is unusual.

00:08:54.667 --> 00:08:56.169 align:middle line:84%
We want you to go
through the testing."

00:08:56.169 --> 00:08:59.305 align:middle line:84%
So now I went through four
days of extensive testing.

00:08:59.305 --> 00:09:04.978 align:middle line:84%
They asked me over 500 questions
from history, from my history.

00:09:04.978 --> 00:09:07.547 align:middle line:84%
You know, because it's
all within my lifetime.

00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:08.848 align:middle line:84%
Things that they
had found about me.

00:09:08.848 --> 00:09:11.851 align:middle line:84%
They tested my -- every
memory test that people know.

00:09:11.851 --> 00:09:14.754 align:middle line:84%
Sequencing of numbers,
looking at something visually,

00:09:14.754 --> 00:09:17.490 align:middle line:84%
repeating a story,
every single thing.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:20.259 align:middle line:84%
So I went through all of
the typical memory testing

00:09:20.259 --> 00:09:21.260 align:middle line:90%
and then all

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.897 align:middle line:84%
of the auto-biographical
memory testing.

00:09:24.897 --> 00:09:27.800 align:middle line:84%
Then what they do is they
wire my brain and they put me

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:31.504 align:middle line:84%
through an MRI and they ask me
questions and they see how...

00:09:31.504 --> 00:09:32.572 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: [Inaudible].

00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:33.406 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
...everything fires up.

00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:35.208 align:middle line:90%
And they took 300 measurements.

00:09:35.208 --> 00:09:39.479 align:middle line:84%
They also took saliva samples,
skin samples, hair samples,

00:09:39.479 --> 00:09:43.549 align:middle line:84%
blood samples, kind
of motor skill testing

00:09:43.549 --> 00:09:46.986 align:middle line:84%
and they found nine areas
of my brain and the brains

00:09:46.986 --> 00:09:49.522 align:middle line:84%
of the other people
that are 10 times larger

00:09:49.522 --> 00:09:50.757 align:middle line:90%
than the normal brain.

00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:51.524 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Amazing.

00:09:51.524 --> 00:09:52.659 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Yeah.

00:09:52.659 --> 00:09:53.826 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: So you
fire on all cylinders.

00:09:53.826 --> 00:09:54.661 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
[Laughter] Yeah, I guess so.

00:09:54.661 --> 00:09:55.595 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: All the time.

00:09:55.595 --> 00:09:56.863 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
[Laughter] I --

00:09:56.863 --> 00:09:58.031 align:middle line:84%
you know I just always
thought I had a lot of energy

00:09:58.031 --> 00:09:59.832 align:middle line:84%
but I guess that's
what [laughter]...

00:09:59.832 --> 00:10:01.167 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: When you
do your lines for  Taxi

00:10:01.167 --> 00:10:03.236 align:middle line:84%
and other programs
that you were on

00:10:03.236 --> 00:10:07.240 align:middle line:84%
and you memorized them did it --
obviously it came easy to you.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.207 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: It did.

00:10:08.207 --> 00:10:10.276 align:middle line:84%
But that's more photographic
which is

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:12.045 align:middle line:90%
like a single page of stuff.

00:10:12.045 --> 00:10:15.882 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like
two-dimensional and just visual.

00:10:15.882 --> 00:10:17.917 align:middle line:90%
I think when you have H-SAM,

00:10:17.917 --> 00:10:20.353 align:middle line:84%
Highly Superior Autobiographical
Memory you're firing

00:10:20.353 --> 00:10:21.754 align:middle line:90%
on all your senses too.

00:10:21.754 --> 00:10:25.725 align:middle line:84%
So it's -- I'll remember when
I read a script the first time,

00:10:25.725 --> 00:10:27.326 align:middle line:84%
where I was sitting,
what I was wearing,

00:10:27.326 --> 00:10:28.728 align:middle line:90%
what the weather was like,

00:10:28.728 --> 00:10:32.398 align:middle line:84%
what the character reminded
me of in my own life.

00:10:32.398 --> 00:10:34.801 align:middle line:84%
Firing back on all
those experiences

00:10:34.801 --> 00:10:35.735 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:10:35.735 --> 00:10:36.869 align:middle line:90%
So...

00:10:36.869 --> 00:10:37.970 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: How far
back can you remember?

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:39.338 align:middle line:84%
You remember when you
were a little baby?

00:10:39.338 --> 00:10:40.707 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: I remember
when I was a little baby.

00:10:40.707 --> 00:10:44.577 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I tell people that I
remember my baptism which is

00:10:44.577 --> 00:10:45.545 align:middle line:90%
when I was just a few weeks old.

00:10:45.545 --> 00:10:46.913 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Whoa.

00:10:46.913 --> 00:10:48.815 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: And I can
remember just the sensory kind

00:10:48.815 --> 00:10:49.682 align:middle line:90%
of images of it.

00:10:49.682 --> 00:10:50.817 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:10:50.817 --> 00:10:51.651 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: You
know, I wasn't going,

00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:52.351 align:middle line:90%
oh today's Sunday [laughter].

00:10:52.351 --> 00:10:53.286 align:middle line:90%
No, nothing like that.

00:10:53.286 --> 00:10:55.288 align:middle line:90%
But I remember the experience.

00:10:55.288 --> 00:10:59.459 align:middle line:84%
And I remember so much of being
a year old, two-years-old,

00:10:59.459 --> 00:11:03.529 align:middle line:84%
three-years-old, four before
most people can remember things.

00:11:03.529 --> 00:11:06.032 align:middle line:84%
You know, before most
people are wired for it.

00:11:06.032 --> 00:11:09.902 align:middle line:84%
But it really comes in like
every day of my life from 12,

00:11:09.902 --> 00:11:10.803 align:middle line:90%
11, you know -- like that.

00:11:10.803 --> 00:11:11.871 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: That's amazing.

00:11:11.871 --> 00:11:12.905 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: Yeah
it's pretty crazy.

00:11:12.905 --> 00:11:13.673 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: I
remember one episode

00:11:13.673 --> 00:11:15.274 align:middle line:90%
when I was 18-months-old.

00:11:15.274 --> 00:11:18.845 align:middle line:84%
It was my mother going
to deliver my sister.

00:11:18.845 --> 00:11:19.912 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Yeah.

00:11:19.912 --> 00:11:20.713 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And
I remember the color

00:11:20.713 --> 00:11:21.848 align:middle line:90%
of the coat she was wearing.

00:11:21.848 --> 00:11:24.150 align:middle line:90%
My uncle was watching me.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And I remember her
fleeing out the front door.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:32.191 align:middle line:84%
And I told her all this years
later and she was just in shock.

00:11:32.191 --> 00:11:33.793 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: Yeah it
was the color of the coat.

00:11:33.793 --> 00:11:35.661 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: But
that's all I can remember.

00:11:35.661 --> 00:11:38.965 align:middle line:84%
And then I remember little
episodes in my life like,

00:11:38.965 --> 00:11:40.366 align:middle line:90%
you know --

00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:43.736 align:middle line:84%
I was seven-years-old and I had
a hamster in a little aquarium

00:11:43.736 --> 00:11:46.572 align:middle line:84%
and I'm holding it, a little
fishbowl and I'm running

00:11:46.572 --> 00:11:49.041 align:middle line:84%
down the street with
him and I tripped.

00:11:49.041 --> 00:11:49.876 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Uh-huh.

00:11:49.876 --> 00:11:50.576 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: And it broke.

00:11:50.576 --> 00:11:51.911 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Right.

00:11:51.911 --> 00:11:53.246 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: You know
and I had a little scar here.

00:11:53.246 --> 00:11:54.447 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Right.

00:11:54.447 --> 00:11:55.448 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Maybe
it's the scar I remember.

00:11:55.448 --> 00:11:56.849 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
No you know what?

00:11:56.849 --> 00:12:00.920 align:middle line:84%
Dr. James McGaw who's the kind
of the main man for all of this,

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:04.557 align:middle line:84%
you know, memory
research from UC Irvine.

00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:07.960 align:middle line:84%
He proved that memory
is tied to adrenaline.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.362 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Okay.

00:12:09.362 --> 00:12:10.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: So we -- all
of us, everybody sitting here.

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:12.999 align:middle line:84%
We all remember the highs
and the lows of our lives.

00:12:12.999 --> 00:12:14.367 align:middle line:84%
You know? Not low
depression lows,

00:12:14.367 --> 00:12:15.968 align:middle line:90%
but I mean those high things...

00:12:15.968 --> 00:12:17.103 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Right.

00:12:17.103 --> 00:12:17.937 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: ...and
then those painful...

00:12:17.937 --> 00:12:18.371 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Tragic things.

00:12:18.371 --> 00:12:19.172 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:19.172 --> 00:12:20.106 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Like whoa,

00:12:20.106 --> 00:12:21.307 align:middle line:84%
what just happened
kind of things.

00:12:21.307 --> 00:12:22.575 align:middle line:84%
So you know the adrenaline
was definitely pumping

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:25.278 align:middle line:84%
in that little seven-year-old
George and the scar,

00:12:25.278 --> 00:12:26.546 align:middle line:90%
and the hamster losing.

00:12:26.546 --> 00:12:28.381 align:middle line:90%
So that was something that ended

00:12:28.381 --> 00:12:30.183 align:middle line:84%
up getting seared
onto your brain.

00:12:30.183 --> 00:12:32.585 align:middle line:84%
Now I don't know, they're
not testing our adrenaline

00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:34.187 align:middle line:84%
so I don't know if we
just have more adrenaline

00:12:34.187 --> 00:12:35.388 align:middle line:90%
than most people.

00:12:35.388 --> 00:12:38.324 align:middle line:84%
But it's definitely, you
know, those highs and lows

00:12:38.324 --> 00:12:40.760 align:middle line:84%
that most people do
remember in their lives.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:44.096 align:middle line:84%
And that's why in my book,
Total Memory Makeover ,

00:12:44.096 --> 00:12:47.099 align:middle line:84%
I'm always giving people
prompting exercises

00:12:47.099 --> 00:12:50.236 align:middle line:84%
because I'm trying to bring
back not only to help them

00:12:50.236 --> 00:12:52.939 align:middle line:84%
with the highs and lows and
how to handle those things.

00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:54.440 align:middle line:90%
But also to bring back some

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:58.611 align:middle line:84%
of those sweeter more mundane
our town kinds of moments

00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:00.947 align:middle line:84%
of a conversation you might
have had with your dad,

00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:03.516 align:middle line:84%
or a dinner with your family,
or your family vacation,

00:13:03.516 --> 00:13:05.585 align:middle line:84%
or something from
your childhood.

00:13:05.585 --> 00:13:07.553 align:middle line:84%
A day in school and
stuff like that.

00:13:07.553 --> 00:13:08.855 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: We're going
to talk more about memory.

00:13:08.855 --> 00:13:11.357 align:middle line:84%
Let's take some questions
for Marilu Henner.

00:13:11.357 --> 00:13:13.526 align:middle line:84%
Just raise your hand and
we'll get right to you.

00:13:13.526 --> 00:13:14.293 align:middle line:90%
Who's got one?

00:13:14.293 --> 00:13:15.495 align:middle line:90%
Yes sir.

00:13:15.495 --> 00:13:16.195 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi Marilu.

00:13:16.195 --> 00:13:17.396 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Hi.

00:13:17.396 --> 00:13:20.333 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you remember anything
from a previous life

00:13:20.333 --> 00:13:22.969 align:middle line:84%
or did everything
start at your birth?

00:13:22.969 --> 00:13:25.705 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: I don't --
I mean I get sort of feelings

00:13:25.705 --> 00:13:28.107 align:middle line:84%
about things like, -- oh have
I been here before or I --

00:13:28.107 --> 00:13:30.443 align:middle line:84%
and I think every girl thinks
she was Marie Antoinette

00:13:30.443 --> 00:13:31.277 align:middle line:90%
when she goes to [inaudible].

00:13:31.277 --> 00:13:32.612 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Or Cleopatra.

00:13:32.612 --> 00:13:34.747 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: Cleopatra
[inaudible] [laughter].

00:13:34.747 --> 00:13:39.418 align:middle line:84%
But I'm -- mainly it's
more since I've been born.

00:13:39.418 --> 00:13:43.089 align:middle line:84%
Since, you know -- so not --
impressions of maybe something

00:13:43.089 --> 00:13:45.791 align:middle line:84%
that maybe came from a
past life but I'm not --

00:13:45.791 --> 00:13:48.227 align:middle line:84%
I have never done a
past life regression

00:13:48.227 --> 00:13:49.028 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:13:49.028 --> 00:13:50.062 align:middle line:90%
But that's a good question.

00:13:50.062 --> 00:13:50.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:51.864 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:13:51.864 --> 00:13:52.798 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: I was your
pool boy in Alexandria.

00:13:52.798 --> 00:13:53.666 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
Yeah [laughter].

00:13:53.666 --> 00:13:55.067 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
A long time ago.

00:13:55.067 --> 00:13:56.168 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: That's the --
everybody wants those big roles.

00:13:56.168 --> 00:13:57.470 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: You
know what's funny

00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:58.838 align:middle line:84%
about reincarnation
[laughter] is

00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:02.341 align:middle line:84%
that everybody always
remembers themselves

00:14:02.341 --> 00:14:03.376 align:middle line:90%
as somebody famous [laughter].

00:14:03.376 --> 00:14:04.143 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Yes.

00:14:04.143 --> 00:14:04.710 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: You know?

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:05.478 align:middle line:90%
I was Napoleon.

00:14:05.478 --> 00:14:06.579 align:middle line:90%
I was this or that.

00:14:06.579 --> 00:14:08.014 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's [laughter]
just an average person.

00:14:08.014 --> 00:14:08.981 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
Yes, that's right.

00:14:08.981 --> 00:14:10.349 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: [Inaudible].

00:14:10.349 --> 00:14:11.484 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: Well and we
don't have enough resources

00:14:11.484 --> 00:14:13.252 align:middle line:84%
to probably know what
that life would be like.

00:14:13.252 --> 00:14:16.188 align:middle line:84%
So when we read something
about somebody famous we go,

00:14:16.188 --> 00:14:17.490 align:middle line:84%
"Oh yeah that sounds
familiar [laughter]."

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:18.858 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:20.126 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And of course
"Beyond Belief" is worldwide

00:14:20.126 --> 00:14:22.328 align:middle line:84%
so we have a question way
out there for you Marilu.

00:14:22.328 --> 00:14:23.195 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Oh great.

00:14:23.195 --> 00:14:24.497 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Let's listen in.

00:14:24.497 --> 00:14:26.532 align:middle line:84%
>> Katelyn: Hey Marilu this
is Katelyn in New Mexico.

00:14:26.532 --> 00:14:28.334 align:middle line:84%
I love that you stand
for health.

00:14:28.334 --> 00:14:30.303 align:middle line:84%
Can you suggest a way
that people can stay away

00:14:30.303 --> 00:14:34.440 align:middle line:84%
from harmful foods such as
the occasional hamburger?

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.274 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: [Laughter].

00:14:35.274 --> 00:14:36.609 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Okay you are --

00:14:36.609 --> 00:14:37.576 align:middle line:84%
you are a health fanatic when
it comes to what you eat.

00:14:37.576 --> 00:14:38.778 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Yeah, I am.

00:14:38.778 --> 00:14:40.112 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: So that's
an interesting question.

00:14:40.112 --> 00:14:41.814 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: You know
my parents died in their 50s.

00:14:41.814 --> 00:14:44.784 align:middle line:84%
My father died of a heart
attack at 52-years-old.

00:14:44.784 --> 00:14:46.419 align:middle line:90%
I was 17 at the time.

00:14:46.419 --> 00:14:49.855 align:middle line:84%
My mother died of arthritis
at 58, the complications.

00:14:49.855 --> 00:14:53.693 align:middle line:84%
I mean she was basically
teaching dancing in December,

00:14:53.693 --> 00:14:57.630 align:middle line:84%
went to bed with the flu in
January, went into the hospital

00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:00.633 align:middle line:84%
in February because it was
a brutal Chicago winter.

00:15:00.633 --> 00:15:02.201 align:middle line:84%
She had her leg amputated
in April.

00:15:02.201 --> 00:15:03.235 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Oh geese.

00:15:03.235 --> 00:15:03.903 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: As
a dancing teacher.

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:05.204 align:middle line:90%
And she died in May.

00:15:05.204 --> 00:15:09.308 align:middle line:84%
And I was watching
the doctors try all

00:15:09.308 --> 00:15:11.177 align:middle line:90%
of these things with her body.

00:15:11.177 --> 00:15:14.213 align:middle line:84%
You know, no matter what
they put into her --

00:15:14.213 --> 00:15:17.717 align:middle line:84%
cut or, you know -- did
whatever her body was trying

00:15:17.717 --> 00:15:19.485 align:middle line:84%
to make sense of it
and I kept thinking --

00:15:19.485 --> 00:15:22.855 align:middle line:84%
I had a real epiphany watching
my mother die, basically.

00:15:22.855 --> 00:15:25.191 align:middle line:84%
I said can you imagine if
you do the right things

00:15:25.191 --> 00:15:27.293 align:middle line:84%
for your body how much
your body will respond

00:15:27.293 --> 00:15:29.862 align:middle line:84%
if your body is still trying
to rally even with everything

00:15:29.862 --> 00:15:31.130 align:middle line:90%
that she was going through.

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:33.966 align:middle line:84%
So I became a real student
of health after she died.

00:15:33.966 --> 00:15:36.635 align:middle line:84%
And I became obsessed
and I think maybe

00:15:36.635 --> 00:15:38.871 align:middle line:84%
because of my memory I was
able to read something...

00:15:38.871 --> 00:15:40.272 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Sure.

00:15:40.272 --> 00:15:41.507 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: ...and cross
connect it with something else

00:15:41.507 --> 00:15:42.875 align:middle line:84%
and put layer, layer, layer
all of this information.

00:15:42.875 --> 00:15:46.812 align:middle line:84%
So I just started practicing
on myself and it took me years

00:15:46.812 --> 00:15:48.214 align:middle line:90%
to put a program together.

00:15:48.214 --> 00:15:52.018 align:middle line:84%
But since that time I've lived a
certain lifestyle, a certain way

00:15:52.018 --> 00:15:53.452 align:middle line:90%
of eating and everything.

00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:58.758 align:middle line:84%
So I -- well first of all I
think every day of your life --

00:15:58.758 --> 00:16:00.092 align:middle line:84%
there's no such thing
as cheating.

00:16:00.092 --> 00:16:01.394 align:middle line:90%
Oh I was bad, I was this.

00:16:01.394 --> 00:16:03.195 align:middle line:84%
Every day you're in the
laboratory of your life.

00:16:03.195 --> 00:16:04.030 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Constantly.

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:04.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Constantly.

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:05.831 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:16:05.831 --> 00:16:06.899 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: This
is all an experiment

00:16:06.899 --> 00:16:08.067 align:middle line:84%
and every day you're
doing the experiment

00:16:08.067 --> 00:16:09.668 align:middle line:84%
and some experiments
work, some of them don't.

00:16:09.668 --> 00:16:12.805 align:middle line:84%
So just be mindful of what's
working for you and what isn't.

00:16:12.805 --> 00:16:15.207 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of the
hamburger, cheeseburger,

00:16:15.207 --> 00:16:16.609 align:middle line:84%
whatever she wants
once in a while.

00:16:16.609 --> 00:16:19.311 align:middle line:84%
Do that with gusto because if
you're punishing yourself while

00:16:19.311 --> 00:16:21.814 align:middle line:84%
you're having a good time
eating something that's going

00:16:21.814 --> 00:16:22.848 align:middle line:90%
to be worse.

00:16:22.848 --> 00:16:25.985 align:middle line:84%
But as a basic thing
I always say learn

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:27.787 align:middle line:90%
to love the food that loves you.

00:16:27.787 --> 00:16:31.724 align:middle line:84%
You know, find a way to
eat a more plant-based diet

00:16:31.724 --> 00:16:33.192 align:middle line:90%
because that food loves you.

00:16:33.192 --> 00:16:34.427 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Right.

00:16:34.427 --> 00:16:35.728 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: It's more
designed for your teeth,

00:16:35.728 --> 00:16:38.130 align:middle line:84%
and your tongue, and your
enzymes, and your hormones,

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:42.601 align:middle line:84%
and your digestive track,
and everything that works.

00:16:42.601 --> 00:16:45.071 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, we're this
beautiful human animal.

00:16:45.071 --> 00:16:46.639 align:middle line:90%
We have to move every day.

00:16:46.639 --> 00:16:49.809 align:middle line:84%
We have to eat the foods that
we're designed to break down.

00:16:49.809 --> 00:16:54.113 align:middle line:90%
So, you know, I say keep trying.

00:16:54.113 --> 00:16:56.382 align:middle line:84%
You know sometimes life
is three steps forward

00:16:56.382 --> 00:16:58.918 align:middle line:84%
and two steps back, six steps
forward eight steps back.

00:16:58.918 --> 00:17:00.019 align:middle line:90%
Whatever it is.

00:17:00.019 --> 00:17:02.888 align:middle line:84%
So to Katelyn from New
Mexico I think enjoy

00:17:02.888 --> 00:17:05.524 align:middle line:84%
that occasional hamburger if
that's what you really want.

00:17:05.524 --> 00:17:09.295 align:middle line:84%
But try to incorporate more
plant based foods into your diet

00:17:09.295 --> 00:17:10.595 align:middle line:84%
and learn to love the
food that loves you.

00:17:10.595 --> 00:17:12.331 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: See I have
found that I feel guilty

00:17:12.331 --> 00:17:13.766 align:middle line:90%
if I do something like that.

00:17:13.766 --> 00:17:17.403 align:middle line:84%
If I'm on this regiment and I'm
doing okay, I'm clicking along

00:17:17.403 --> 00:17:20.038 align:middle line:84%
and then you decide to
do something like that.

00:17:20.038 --> 00:17:22.074 align:middle line:84%
Grab the cheeseburger
or something.

00:17:22.074 --> 00:17:25.377 align:middle line:84%
You're driving past a fast food
place and you're starving...

00:17:25.377 --> 00:17:26.312 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Right.

00:17:26.312 --> 00:17:27.546 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
...so you do that.

00:17:27.546 --> 00:17:30.449 align:middle line:84%
And you then feel guilty
that you did it afterwards.

00:17:30.449 --> 00:17:31.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Yeah.

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:32.251 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: You
kind of kick yourself.

00:17:32.251 --> 00:17:33.652 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Yeah.

00:17:33.652 --> 00:17:35.054 align:middle line:84%
Well I mean if that's what you
need to get back on the horse.

00:17:35.054 --> 00:17:36.889 align:middle line:84%
You know some times people have
to do things with gusto and say,

00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:38.491 align:middle line:84%
"Okay I'm going to
get right back on,

00:17:38.491 --> 00:17:39.658 align:middle line:90%
you know, my good program."

00:17:39.658 --> 00:17:40.626 align:middle line:90%
Now I enjoyed that.

00:17:40.626 --> 00:17:41.760 align:middle line:90%
That's over.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.662 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad that spell is over.

00:17:43.662 --> 00:17:45.397 align:middle line:84%
And then sometimes you
have to say, "Okay.

00:17:45.397 --> 00:17:47.500 align:middle line:84%
I could do this every
day unless I --

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:51.537 align:middle line:84%
you know, introduce that
guilt into my life."

00:17:51.537 --> 00:17:52.538 align:middle line:90%
Then, you know.

00:17:52.538 --> 00:17:54.406 align:middle line:84%
But I totally understand
what you mean.

00:17:54.406 --> 00:17:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And especially, you know,
if you're somebody who has

00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:59.345 align:middle line:84%
to take their little whip
out once in a while...

00:17:59.345 --> 00:18:00.613 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:18:00.613 --> 00:18:01.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: ...that's
what kind of got you

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:02.414 align:middle line:84%
out of the neighborhood
[laughter].

00:18:02.414 --> 00:18:03.783 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: That's right.

00:18:03.783 --> 00:18:04.483 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: Or that's
what got you to be successful.

00:18:04.483 --> 00:18:05.451 align:middle line:90%
So whatever you need.

00:18:05.451 --> 00:18:06.519 align:middle line:84%
You know, understand
the difference

00:18:06.519 --> 00:18:10.055 align:middle line:84%
between self-motivation,
and self-sabotage.

00:18:10.055 --> 00:18:12.124 align:middle line:90%
You know? And I think that a lot

00:18:12.124 --> 00:18:14.426 align:middle line:84%
of times people don't
recognize the differences

00:18:14.426 --> 00:18:15.227 align:middle line:90%
between those two things.

00:18:15.227 --> 00:18:16.562 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: So true.

00:18:16.562 --> 00:18:17.730 align:middle line:84%
So true. Let's take another
question for Marilu Henner.

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:18.998 align:middle line:90%
Yes sir.

00:18:18.998 --> 00:18:21.667 align:middle line:84%
>> Roger: Mary is your memory
at a constant high level

00:18:21.667 --> 00:18:24.737 align:middle line:84%
or are there times when it's
not as good or conditions

00:18:24.737 --> 00:18:26.438 align:middle line:90%
when you can't quite remember,

00:18:26.438 --> 00:18:29.008 align:middle line:84%
as well as you would
normally do?

00:18:29.008 --> 00:18:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
That's a great question.

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:33.078 align:middle line:84%
This is how I always
describe it.

00:18:33.078 --> 00:18:36.182 align:middle line:84%
It's like a pilot light
that's always there.

00:18:36.182 --> 00:18:38.450 align:middle line:84%
And let's say I'm driving in the
car and a [snapping] song comes

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:41.053 align:middle line:84%
on and I'll flip through
like all the times

00:18:41.053 --> 00:18:42.655 align:middle line:84%
that I've heard the
song or the first time,

00:18:42.655 --> 00:18:44.690 align:middle line:84%
or what that song
really means to me.

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:47.726 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I'm on the phone
with my sister so that'll flash

00:18:47.726 --> 00:18:50.396 align:middle line:84%
and I won't flame up
the pilot light of that.

00:18:50.396 --> 00:18:54.834 align:middle line:84%
You know? So it's always
there and it can be as strong

00:18:54.834 --> 00:18:56.535 align:middle line:90%
or as low as I want it to be.

00:18:56.535 --> 00:18:59.672 align:middle line:84%
And then sometimes people will
give me a date and it'll --

00:18:59.672 --> 00:19:01.307 align:middle line:90%
my mind will go right there.

00:19:01.307 --> 00:19:06.212 align:middle line:84%
I'll like scan because of the
way I see my life and it's

00:19:06.212 --> 00:19:11.417 align:middle line:84%
like running through a montage
-- a movie montage or something.

00:19:11.417 --> 00:19:14.954 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it'll be like
whoa, it'll go right there

00:19:14.954 --> 00:19:16.789 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes it
takes a little while.

00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:19.725 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
photograph developing.

00:19:19.725 --> 00:19:21.727 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it comes
out like a Polaroid,

00:19:21.727 --> 00:19:24.763 align:middle line:84%
like a full image right
away and sometimes it's

00:19:24.763 --> 00:19:27.266 align:middle line:84%
like a little bit -- it's in the
tray a little while and then,

00:19:27.266 --> 00:19:29.301 align:middle line:84%
oh yeah, there's this,
and then, da, da, da.

00:19:29.301 --> 00:19:33.405 align:middle line:84%
You know it's interesting
you ask and there --

00:19:33.405 --> 00:19:36.408 align:middle line:84%
to me there are four
types of memory retrieval

00:19:36.408 --> 00:19:39.245 align:middle line:84%
and I'm operating on all four
and sometimes there's one

00:19:39.245 --> 00:19:41.280 align:middle line:90%
that happens over the other.

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:44.750 align:middle line:84%
But it would be interesting
to see

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:47.019 align:middle line:84%
if people understand
what I'm talking about.

00:19:47.019 --> 00:19:48.887 align:middle line:90%
I hope so anyway [laughter].

00:19:48.887 --> 00:19:54.326 align:middle line:84%
Let's say I asked you
about a wedding and --

00:19:54.326 --> 00:19:55.261 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry, what's your name?

00:19:55.261 --> 00:19:55.961 align:middle line:90%
>> Roger: Roger.

00:19:55.961 --> 00:19:56.395 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Roger.

00:19:56.395 --> 00:19:57.463 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

00:19:57.463 --> 00:19:58.297 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Did
you forget his name?

00:19:58.297 --> 00:19:59.665 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: No [laughter].

00:19:59.665 --> 00:20:02.167 align:middle line:84%
So Roger, if I said to you, "Oh
Roger how was that wedding?"

00:20:02.167 --> 00:20:04.370 align:middle line:90%
And you said, "Oh it was great.

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:06.405 align:middle line:84%
We got there Friday; we went
to the rehearsal dinner.

00:20:06.405 --> 00:20:07.840 align:middle line:90%
I got up and did a run.

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:08.974 align:middle line:90%
Then we went to this..."

00:20:08.974 --> 00:20:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And you start telling
me in a very kind of --

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:12.845 align:middle line:90%
I don't' want to say -- surfacy,

00:20:12.845 --> 00:20:14.446 align:middle line:84%
but sort of giving
me the chronology.

00:20:14.446 --> 00:20:17.049 align:middle line:84%
You know in a chronological
order.

00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:18.784 align:middle line:90%
I call that horizontal memory.

00:20:18.784 --> 00:20:20.185 align:middle line:84%
Because it works
sort of in that way.

00:20:20.185 --> 00:20:22.688 align:middle line:84%
Friday to Saturday morning
to Saturday afternoon.

00:20:22.688 --> 00:20:24.156 align:middle line:84%
You know like that
kind of thing.

00:20:24.156 --> 00:20:25.557 align:middle line:84%
If I said, "How was
that wedding?"

00:20:25.557 --> 00:20:28.761 align:middle line:84%
And you said, "Oh my gosh I had
a conversation with my cousin.

00:20:28.761 --> 00:20:29.895 align:middle line:90%
We were standing there."

00:20:29.895 --> 00:20:31.997 align:middle line:84%
And you start describing
this whole conversation.

00:20:31.997 --> 00:20:33.999 align:middle line:84%
What music was playing,
what they were wearing,

00:20:33.999 --> 00:20:35.134 align:middle line:90%
what you were wearing.

00:20:35.134 --> 00:20:35.968 align:middle line:90%
You know whatever.

00:20:35.968 --> 00:20:37.236 align:middle line:90%
What you were drinking.

00:20:37.236 --> 00:20:39.471 align:middle line:84%
And you go deeper, deeper,
deeper into the specifics,

00:20:39.471 --> 00:20:41.373 align:middle line:84%
the themes of what
you're talking about.

00:20:41.373 --> 00:20:43.342 align:middle line:90%
That's like a vertical memory.

00:20:43.342 --> 00:20:44.843 align:middle line:84%
If I said, "Roger,
how was that wedding?"

00:20:44.843 --> 00:20:46.245 align:middle line:90%
And you said, "Oh my gosh.

00:20:46.245 --> 00:20:47.546 align:middle line:90%
There was a guy I met there.

00:20:47.546 --> 00:20:49.682 align:middle line:84%
We were having lunch -- I
mean we had two weeks later.

00:20:49.682 --> 00:20:50.716 align:middle line:90%
It was great.

00:20:50.716 --> 00:20:52.318 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do
business together."

00:20:52.318 --> 00:20:54.520 align:middle line:84%
That's what I call a
mushrooming memory.

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.288 align:middle line:84%
Because I asked you about
something specific...

00:20:56.288 --> 00:20:57.589 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Right.

00:20:57.589 --> 00:20:58.791 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: ...but all
of a sudden it mushroomed.

00:20:58.791 --> 00:21:00.826 align:middle line:84%
Something that grew from
that experience mushroomed

00:21:00.826 --> 00:21:01.694 align:middle line:90%
to something else.

00:21:01.694 --> 00:21:02.895 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I
call a mushroom.

00:21:02.895 --> 00:21:05.297 align:middle line:84%
So we have horizontal,
vertical, and mushrooming.

00:21:05.297 --> 00:21:09.501 align:middle line:84%
And then the fourth time --
fourth type I call sporadic.

00:21:09.501 --> 00:21:11.503 align:middle line:84%
And if I said, "Roger
how was that wedding?"

00:21:11.503 --> 00:21:14.073 align:middle line:84%
And you said, "Oh my gosh there
was a guy there who looked just

00:21:14.073 --> 00:21:17.710 align:middle line:84%
like my boss and instantly I
was back in that office thinking

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:19.111 align:middle line:90%
about what a jerk that guy was,

00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:20.346 align:middle line:84%
how he took credit
for all my work."

00:21:20.346 --> 00:21:22.748 align:middle line:84%
So now it's had nothing
to do with the wedding.

00:21:22.748 --> 00:21:24.450 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you met
somebody at the wedding.

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:26.318 align:middle line:84%
You've now [inaudible]
out somewhere else

00:21:26.318 --> 00:21:27.720 align:middle line:90%
because something reminded you.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:31.123 align:middle line:84%
So those kinds of memories come
in all the time for everybody.

00:21:31.123 --> 00:21:33.659 align:middle line:84%
What usually happens when
I work with people and try

00:21:33.659 --> 00:21:36.795 align:middle line:84%
to do memory retrieval is they
feel like, oh I feel like I have

00:21:36.795 --> 00:21:39.398 align:middle line:84%
to do it in chronological order
but I want to go somewhere else.

00:21:39.398 --> 00:21:40.933 align:middle line:90%
It's like take the ride.

00:21:40.933 --> 00:21:42.067 align:middle line:90%
Your mind is so amazing.

00:21:42.067 --> 00:21:43.268 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And let
it take you somewhere.

00:21:43.268 --> 00:21:44.636 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: Yeah let
it take you some place.

00:21:44.636 --> 00:21:46.739 align:middle line:84%
So anyway I hope that answered
your question [laughter].

00:21:46.739 --> 00:21:49.274 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And let's take
one more question for Marilu.

00:21:49.274 --> 00:21:49.842 align:middle line:90%
Who's got it?

00:21:49.842 --> 00:21:50.376 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. Yes sir.

00:21:50.376 --> 00:21:51.777 align:middle line:90%
Right here.

00:21:51.777 --> 00:21:54.313 align:middle line:84%
>> Okay first off I just want to
say you were great in Perfect.

00:21:54.313 --> 00:21:55.447 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
[Laughter] Oh, thank you.

00:21:55.447 --> 00:21:56.949 align:middle line:84%
>> I know a lot of
people probably forgot

00:21:56.949 --> 00:21:58.150 align:middle line:90%
about that movie but...

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:00.085 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: Yeah
the critiques especially.

00:22:00.085 --> 00:22:01.320 align:middle line:90%
>> [Laughter].

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.287 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
[Laughter] and John Travolta

00:22:02.287 --> 00:22:03.689 align:middle line:84%
and Jamie Lee Curtis
probably too.

00:22:03.689 --> 00:22:04.857 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh yeah.

00:22:04.857 --> 00:22:08.794 align:middle line:84%
I was wondering, did you
serve as a consultant

00:22:08.794 --> 00:22:12.965 align:middle line:84%
or do script corrections for
Unforgettable  the show?

00:22:12.965 --> 00:22:13.732 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Oh yes I do.

00:22:13.732 --> 00:22:14.967 align:middle line:90%
Well thank you for asking.

00:22:14.967 --> 00:22:16.035 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: How about that?

00:22:16.035 --> 00:22:17.069 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
It's going back again.

00:22:17.069 --> 00:22:18.137 align:middle line:84%
It's coming back at
the end of July...

00:22:18.137 --> 00:22:19.138 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Oh
that's really cool.

00:22:19.138 --> 00:22:19.838 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
...which is great.

00:22:19.838 --> 00:22:21.673 align:middle line:90%
Yeah [applause], yeah.

00:22:21.673 --> 00:22:22.508 align:middle line:90%
Yay.

00:22:22.508 --> 00:22:23.575 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Good for you.

00:22:23.575 --> 00:22:24.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
Well you know we were

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:27.112 align:middle line:84%
like the highest rated show
ever canceled or something.

00:22:27.112 --> 00:22:29.515 align:middle line:84%
And so they thought they'd try
something else in the time slot

00:22:29.515 --> 00:22:31.116 align:middle line:84%
and so they didn't
-- it didn't work

00:22:31.116 --> 00:22:32.584 align:middle line:90%
so that show was cancelled too.

00:22:32.584 --> 00:22:33.919 align:middle line:84%
But they brought us
back for the summer.

00:22:33.919 --> 00:22:35.287 align:middle line:90%
We're going to see how it is.

00:22:35.287 --> 00:22:37.656 align:middle line:84%
But yeah Poppy Montgomery's
character,

00:22:37.656 --> 00:22:41.126 align:middle line:84%
she plays Carrie Wells a
detective, a cop who has my kind

00:22:41.126 --> 00:22:42.528 align:middle line:90%
of memory, who has H-SAM.

00:22:42.528 --> 00:22:47.833 align:middle line:84%
So I've been a consultant on the
show and it's fun to sort of,

00:22:47.833 --> 00:22:49.902 align:middle line:84%
you know, find things
in the script

00:22:49.902 --> 00:22:52.805 align:middle line:84%
that they wouldn't normally
think of that I'm telling them.

00:22:52.805 --> 00:22:55.574 align:middle line:84%
Like for example they
had this one episode

00:22:55.574 --> 00:22:59.111 align:middle line:84%
where Carrie was talking
about -- she was --

00:22:59.111 --> 00:23:03.115 align:middle line:84%
the other cop has had a
past relationship with her

00:23:03.115 --> 00:23:08.253 align:middle line:84%
so she's talking about a party
that they went to July 17, 1999.

00:23:08.253 --> 00:23:12.591 align:middle line:84%
So I read that in the script
and I said, "Oh, if she's going

00:23:12.591 --> 00:23:15.961 align:middle line:84%
to talk about July 17, 1999 she
has to talk about what was going

00:23:15.961 --> 00:23:17.329 align:middle line:90%
on in the world that day."

00:23:17.329 --> 00:23:18.564 align:middle line:90%
Does anybody here know?

00:23:18.564 --> 00:23:20.199 align:middle line:90%
What -- like July 17th?

00:23:20.199 --> 00:23:21.133 align:middle line:90%
It was a Saturday [laughter].

00:23:21.133 --> 00:23:21.967 align:middle line:90%
July 17th.

00:23:21.967 --> 00:23:23.936 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Saturday, 1999?

00:23:23.936 --> 00:23:24.603 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Yeah.

00:23:24.603 --> 00:23:25.771 align:middle line:90%
What was happening?

00:23:25.771 --> 00:23:26.338 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: I have no idea.

00:23:26.338 --> 00:23:27.339 align:middle line:90%
Anybody know?

00:23:27.339 --> 00:23:28.307 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
Does anybody know?

00:23:28.307 --> 00:23:29.541 align:middle line:84%
Okay so when I read
this is said,

00:23:29.541 --> 00:23:32.611 align:middle line:84%
"Somebody with Carrie's
memory would definitely say

00:23:32.611 --> 00:23:35.147 align:middle line:84%
that that was the weekend
that the news was flooded

00:23:35.147 --> 00:23:38.217 align:middle line:84%
with John F. Kennedy Jr.'s
having gone down in the plane.

00:23:38.217 --> 00:23:40.419 align:middle line:84%
That you couldn't --
everybody was talking about it.

00:23:40.419 --> 00:23:41.620 align:middle line:90%
It was all over the news.

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:43.655 align:middle line:84%
The plane went down the
night before on the 16th.

00:23:43.655 --> 00:23:45.190 align:middle line:90%
So Carrie if she's talking

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:47.659 align:middle line:84%
about that weekend she
would mention that.

00:23:47.659 --> 00:23:50.128 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "So you can do
that and put a mention in

00:23:50.128 --> 00:23:51.497 align:middle line:90%
or you can pick another day."

00:23:51.497 --> 00:23:52.998 align:middle line:84%
And they said, "Okay we'll
pick another day [laughter]

00:23:52.998 --> 00:23:54.366 align:middle line:90%
because we don't want to have."

00:23:54.366 --> 00:23:56.602 align:middle line:84%
So I have found just little
things like that in the script

00:23:56.602 --> 00:23:58.704 align:middle line:84%
that other people
might not notice.

00:23:58.704 --> 00:24:01.573 align:middle line:84%
And there have been some really
funny gaffs that they've made

00:24:01.573 --> 00:24:02.708 align:middle line:90%
and they've had to reshoot

00:24:02.708 --> 00:24:04.877 align:middle line:84%
because after reading it
they had the wrong date

00:24:04.877 --> 00:24:06.245 align:middle line:90%
or the -- you know, whatever.

00:24:06.245 --> 00:24:07.646 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:24:07.646 --> 00:24:10.983 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Does the brain
selectively remove information

00:24:10.983 --> 00:24:13.785 align:middle line:84%
because it just doesn't
need it in your head?

00:24:13.785 --> 00:24:14.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: In my head?

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:15.721 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Or anybody's.

00:24:15.721 --> 00:24:16.922 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: I
think that people think

00:24:16.922 --> 00:24:19.291 align:middle line:84%
that there's this constant
pruning that goes on.

00:24:19.291 --> 00:24:21.593 align:middle line:90%
But I guess I don't prune.

00:24:21.593 --> 00:24:22.361 align:middle line:90%
I guess I...

00:24:22.361 --> 00:24:23.695 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: You keep.

00:24:23.695 --> 00:24:26.498 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: I keep and
I -- it gets very organized.

00:24:26.498 --> 00:24:31.336 align:middle line:84%
So that -- and its -- and,
you know, it's very connect --

00:24:31.336 --> 00:24:34.640 align:middle line:84%
it's barcoded against
a time line which seems

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.875 align:middle line:84%
to me the ultimate
organizing tool.

00:24:36.875 --> 00:24:37.976 align:middle line:90%
You know, a calendar.

00:24:37.976 --> 00:24:39.645 align:middle line:84%
And you want to hear
something really crazy?

00:24:39.645 --> 00:24:42.281 align:middle line:84%
Okay. I'm married
to my third husband.

00:24:42.281 --> 00:24:44.016 align:middle line:90%
He's the love of my life.

00:24:44.016 --> 00:24:45.117 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: I
think the world of him.

00:24:45.117 --> 00:24:46.018 align:middle line:90%
Michael, by the way.

00:24:46.018 --> 00:24:46.718 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: He's great.

00:24:46.718 --> 00:24:47.786 align:middle line:90%
Michael yeah.

00:24:47.786 --> 00:24:49.288 align:middle line:84%
My stepson is here
today, Michael Brown.

00:24:49.288 --> 00:24:50.822 align:middle line:90%
Like younger Michael Brown.

00:24:50.822 --> 00:24:55.227 align:middle line:84%
And he is -- Michael is -- we
knew each other in college.

00:24:55.227 --> 00:24:58.130 align:middle line:84%
18-year-old he was my
college roommate's boyfriend

00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:01.466 align:middle line:84%
and we lost contact and now
we reconnected 10 years ago.

00:25:01.466 --> 00:25:05.737 align:middle line:84%
But we [inaudible] roots to
our lives and everything else.

00:25:05.737 --> 00:25:07.272 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, long story short,

00:25:07.272 --> 00:25:09.174 align:middle line:84%
he's the number one
calendar publisher [laughter]

00:25:09.174 --> 00:25:10.375 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:25:10.375 --> 00:25:12.911 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of crazy that
I [laughter] am married

00:25:12.911 --> 00:25:14.780 align:middle line:84%
to like the number
one calendar guy.

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:15.814 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
There's the date.

00:25:15.814 --> 00:25:16.548 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
It's kind of funny.

00:25:16.548 --> 00:25:17.382 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter] Yeah.

00:25:17.382 --> 00:25:18.584 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: That's great.

00:25:18.584 --> 00:25:19.718 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: It's not
-- it's kind of ironic.

00:25:19.718 --> 00:25:21.119 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: It's
an interesting story too

00:25:21.119 --> 00:25:25.090 align:middle line:84%
because you helped him through a
very dangerous medical situation

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:25.791 align:middle line:90%
didn't you.

00:25:25.791 --> 00:25:27.059 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Yes.

00:25:27.059 --> 00:25:29.561 align:middle line:84%
We reconnected as I said a
little over 10 years ago.

00:25:29.561 --> 00:25:33.432 align:middle line:84%
And love of my life, we
knew that we were going

00:25:33.432 --> 00:25:36.935 align:middle line:84%
to spend the rest of our lives
together after the first date.

00:25:36.935 --> 00:25:39.471 align:middle line:84%
And two months into our
relationship he was diagnosed

00:25:39.471 --> 00:25:40.439 align:middle line:90%
with two cancers.

00:25:40.439 --> 00:25:41.640 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:43.008 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: Bladder
cancer and lung cancer.

00:25:43.008 --> 00:25:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And I had been such
a student of health

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:48.714 align:middle line:84%
and had this whole network of
doctors and things and I said,

00:25:48.714 --> 00:25:50.449 align:middle line:90%
"Okay, failure's not an option.

00:25:50.449 --> 00:25:52.718 align:middle line:84%
I'm not meeting the
love of my life."

00:25:52.718 --> 00:25:56.855 align:middle line:84%
So we went to a lot of different
doctors all over the country.

00:25:56.855 --> 00:25:57.656 align:middle line:90%
Great ones.

00:25:57.656 --> 00:25:59.057 align:middle line:90%
Not so great ones.

00:25:59.057 --> 00:26:02.561 align:middle line:84%
Because I wanted him to see you
know the typical doctors to sort

00:26:02.561 --> 00:26:05.097 align:middle line:84%
of say, okay, that's not
the route we're going to go.

00:26:05.097 --> 00:26:06.898 align:middle line:84%
And through a series
of, you know,

00:26:06.898 --> 00:26:10.469 align:middle line:84%
putting together a great
protocol for him no chemo,

00:26:10.469 --> 00:26:13.905 align:middle line:84%
no radiation, he's been in
remission 10 years this October.

00:26:13.905 --> 00:26:14.673 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: How
about that [applause].

00:26:14.673 --> 00:26:15.641 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Amazing.

00:26:15.641 --> 00:26:16.141 align:middle line:90%
Seriously.

00:26:16.141 --> 00:26:17.776 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:26:17.776 --> 00:26:20.145 align:middle line:84%
so that's the book I'm
working on now called --

00:26:20.145 --> 00:26:22.214 align:middle line:84%
I wanted a really
provocative title because I

00:26:22.214 --> 00:26:24.082 align:middle line:84%
like to be real spicy
with people --

00:26:24.082 --> 00:26:26.918 align:middle line:84%
it's called  How I Cured
My Husands Cancer .

00:26:26.918 --> 00:26:28.854 align:middle line:84%
And I'm writing not
like a how to book

00:26:28.854 --> 00:26:30.355 align:middle line:90%
like all my other books are.

00:26:30.355 --> 00:26:34.426 align:middle line:84%
I'm writing it like a love
story memoir but it's got lots

00:26:34.426 --> 00:26:36.028 align:middle line:90%
of great information in there.

00:26:36.028 --> 00:26:36.895 align:middle line:90%
It's our journey.

00:26:36.895 --> 00:26:37.996 align:middle line:90%
So nobody can say...

00:26:37.996 --> 00:26:39.698 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: How
important is attitude?

00:26:39.698 --> 00:26:40.732 align:middle line:90%
With Michael?

00:26:40.732 --> 00:26:43.101 align:middle line:90%
With you? To fight that.

00:26:43.101 --> 00:26:44.169 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: So --

00:26:44.169 --> 00:26:45.904 align:middle line:84%
well first of all
attitude is everything.

00:26:45.904 --> 00:26:47.105 align:middle line:90%
Attitude is the most...

00:26:47.105 --> 00:26:47.939 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: In anything.

00:26:47.939 --> 00:26:48.473 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: In anything.

00:26:48.473 --> 00:26:49.474 align:middle line:90%
In anything.

00:26:49.474 --> 00:26:50.876 align:middle line:84%
I go around the country
giving lectures

00:26:50.876 --> 00:26:55.213 align:middle line:84%
and I've tailor made a -- kind
of an A to Z of health speech

00:26:55.213 --> 00:26:58.283 align:middle line:84%
that I've done for seventh
grade girls, and I've done

00:26:58.283 --> 00:27:00.385 align:middle line:84%
at the motion picture
home in Los Angeles

00:27:00.385 --> 00:27:02.554 align:middle line:90%
for people in their 80s and 90s.

00:27:02.554 --> 00:27:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And I always say
A is for attitude.

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:07.359 align:middle line:84%
Because it is the
cornerstone of everything.

00:27:07.359 --> 00:27:09.461 align:middle line:90%
It's the gusto of your life.

00:27:09.461 --> 00:27:14.399 align:middle line:84%
It's being able to adjust to
plan B because let's face it,

00:27:14.399 --> 00:27:16.201 align:middle line:84%
you know, the key to your
life is how well you deal

00:27:16.201 --> 00:27:19.071 align:middle line:84%
with plan B. If you have to be
dragged kicking and screaming

00:27:19.071 --> 00:27:21.406 align:middle line:84%
to what actually happens to
you and you don't look at it

00:27:21.406 --> 00:27:24.543 align:middle line:84%
as an opportunity to improve
then, you know, you're going

00:27:24.543 --> 00:27:25.744 align:middle line:90%
to be a miserable person.

00:27:25.744 --> 00:27:28.647 align:middle line:84%
So it's really that whole
glass half full rather

00:27:28.647 --> 00:27:29.448 align:middle line:90%
than half empty.

00:27:29.448 --> 00:27:30.449 align:middle line:90%
Your attitude is everything.

00:27:30.449 --> 00:27:32.651 align:middle line:90%
It makes or breaks your life.

00:27:32.651 --> 00:27:34.319 align:middle line:84%
So you constantly
have to keep moving.

00:27:34.319 --> 00:27:37.155 align:middle line:84%
You have to constantly
evaluate and move on.

00:27:37.155 --> 00:27:38.790 align:middle line:90%
You know? Sit Shiva.

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:41.026 align:middle line:84%
You know, do whatever
you have to do.

00:27:41.026 --> 00:27:42.894 align:middle line:84%
Something doesn't work
out, you don't get a job,

00:27:42.894 --> 00:27:45.964 align:middle line:84%
you don't get a person, you
don't get some opportunity

00:27:45.964 --> 00:27:47.365 align:middle line:84%
but then learn from
the experience.

00:27:47.365 --> 00:27:51.136 align:middle line:84%
But see this is why -- this is
why an auto-biographical memory

00:27:51.136 --> 00:27:52.504 align:middle line:90%
is so important.

00:27:52.504 --> 00:27:56.408 align:middle line:84%
Because if every day you just
wake up, you live your life,

00:27:56.408 --> 00:27:58.543 align:middle line:84%
your turn off the
light, you go to sleep.

00:27:58.543 --> 00:28:00.412 align:middle line:90%
You wake up, you live your life,

00:28:00.412 --> 00:28:02.614 align:middle line:84%
you turn off the
light, you go to sleep.

00:28:02.614 --> 00:28:04.716 align:middle line:84%
And nothing has moved
forward with you.

00:28:04.716 --> 00:28:06.118 align:middle line:90%
No good information.

00:28:06.118 --> 00:28:08.053 align:middle line:90%
No understanding the red flags.

00:28:08.053 --> 00:28:10.455 align:middle line:90%
No really analyzing experiences.

00:28:10.455 --> 00:28:11.757 align:middle line:90%
If nothing's moved forward

00:28:11.757 --> 00:28:14.226 align:middle line:84%
with you well then
what does it all mean?

00:28:14.226 --> 00:28:19.464 align:middle line:84%
So to me really developing a
strong auto-biographical memory,

00:28:19.464 --> 00:28:21.266 align:middle line:84%
it's the strongest
line of defense

00:28:21.266 --> 00:28:23.935 align:middle line:84%
against meaninglessness
that we have.

00:28:23.935 --> 00:28:26.304 align:middle line:84%
Because we have to
be able to do that.

00:28:26.304 --> 00:28:27.272 align:middle line:90%
You know? So yeah.

00:28:27.272 --> 00:28:28.573 align:middle line:84%
See and it's all
about your attitude.

00:28:28.573 --> 00:28:29.941 align:middle line:90%
It's your attitude.

00:28:29.941 --> 00:28:32.944 align:middle line:84%
I met Marilu at a health expo
in Los Angeles some time ago

00:28:32.944 --> 00:28:35.013 align:middle line:84%
and she subsequently has
been on Coast to Coast

00:28:35.013 --> 00:28:41.119 align:middle line:84%
but I will distinctly remember
the energy that was around you.

00:28:41.119 --> 00:28:42.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Thank you.

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:42.954 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
There are some people

00:28:42.954 --> 00:28:44.456 align:middle line:90%
that we call psychic vampires.

00:28:44.456 --> 00:28:45.791 align:middle line:90%
They just exhaust you.

00:28:45.791 --> 00:28:46.992 align:middle line:90%
Right? [Laughter] You're next

00:28:46.992 --> 00:28:48.560 align:middle line:84%
to them [banging] you
go, "Oh I can't take it."

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:49.561 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
You're lying on the floor

00:28:49.561 --> 00:28:50.595 align:middle line:84%
with drool coming
out of your mouth.

00:28:50.595 --> 00:28:51.730 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: I know.

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:52.831 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
Because you've been hooked

00:28:52.831 --> 00:28:53.598 align:middle line:84%
up to the human vacuum
cleaner [laughter].

00:28:53.598 --> 00:28:54.800 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Exactly.

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:56.201 align:middle line:84%
And then there are other
people like Marilu Henner

00:28:56.201 --> 00:29:00.172 align:middle line:84%
where it just glows and you need
to be around a person like that.

00:29:00.172 --> 00:29:01.072 align:middle line:90%
You have that.

00:29:01.072 --> 00:29:01.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: I love you.

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:02.607 align:middle line:90%
You're so great.

00:29:02.607 --> 00:29:03.375 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
It's all about you.

00:29:03.375 --> 00:29:03.809 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: You too.

00:29:03.809 --> 00:29:04.876 align:middle line:90%
You too.

00:29:04.876 --> 00:29:05.944 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Well
but you can tell.

00:29:05.944 --> 00:29:07.279 align:middle line:84%
You can tell when
you're on television.

00:29:07.279 --> 00:29:08.280 align:middle line:84%
You can tell -- you've got
your own radio show going on.

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:08.847 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Yes.

00:29:08.847 --> 00:29:09.781 align:middle line:90%
I'm so excited.

00:29:09.781 --> 00:29:11.049 align:middle line:90%
I'm so excited.

00:29:11.049 --> 00:29:14.019 align:middle line:84%
Every morning between 5:00
and 8:00 -- I'm up early.

00:29:14.019 --> 00:29:16.488 align:middle line:84%
It's on -- it's in
different cities so far

00:29:16.488 --> 00:29:18.256 align:middle line:84%
but it's also streamlining
on the Internet.

00:29:18.256 --> 00:29:20.625 align:middle line:84%
It's called the Marilu
show and it's on, you know,

00:29:20.625 --> 00:29:22.160 align:middle line:84%
8:00 to 11:00 I guess
East Coast.

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:23.395 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Can they
find that on your website?

00:29:23.395 --> 00:29:24.095 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Yes.

00:29:24.095 --> 00:29:25.497 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Okay.

00:29:25.497 --> 00:29:26.865 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: They can find
it on my website at marilu.com

00:29:26.865 --> 00:29:29.434 align:middle line:84%
or marilushow.com will connect
you with your closest thing.

00:29:29.434 --> 00:29:31.169 align:middle line:84%
And I'm having so much fun
because I'm having people

00:29:31.169 --> 00:29:32.671 align:middle line:90%
like Dr. Neil Barnard on.

00:29:32.671 --> 00:29:34.072 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: [Inaudible].

00:29:34.072 --> 00:29:35.841 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: But I'm also
having people like Gary Busey.

00:29:35.841 --> 00:29:36.775 align:middle line:90%
He's been on.

00:29:36.775 --> 00:29:37.442 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
He's a character.

00:29:37.442 --> 00:29:38.510 align:middle line:90%
Isn't he [laughter]?

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:39.477 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: Oh
my gosh [laughter].

00:29:39.477 --> 00:29:39.978 align:middle line:84%
I've been [inaudible]
[laughter].

00:29:39.978 --> 00:29:41.112 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:29:41.112 --> 00:29:43.782 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: He was
on Coast to Coast once.

00:29:43.782 --> 00:29:46.751 align:middle line:84%
I asked him one question
and I left for 20 minutes

00:29:46.751 --> 00:29:47.752 align:middle line:90%
and came back [laughter].

00:29:47.752 --> 00:29:49.020 align:middle line:90%
I mean he just kept going.

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:50.055 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: I know.

00:29:50.055 --> 00:29:51.189 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And
going, and going.

00:29:51.189 --> 00:29:51.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: And he
was probably levitating

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:52.858 align:middle line:90%
by the time he finished.

00:29:52.858 --> 00:29:54.593 align:middle line:84%
He's like a -- he's
pretty crazy.

00:29:54.593 --> 00:29:57.162 align:middle line:84%
But he's got a big
heart and very sweet.

00:29:57.162 --> 00:29:59.731 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
[Inaudible] just don't air it

00:29:59.731 --> 00:30:01.366 align:middle line:90%
in the wee hours that's all.

00:30:01.366 --> 00:30:02.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: No, no.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.202 align:middle line:90%
In fact they said to me just --

00:30:04.202 --> 00:30:06.705 align:middle line:84%
he said, "You are
such a morning show."

00:30:06.705 --> 00:30:10.141 align:middle line:84%
He said you are the exact
opposite of George Noory.

00:30:10.141 --> 00:30:12.844 align:middle line:84%
He said, "George Noory
is definitely late night,

00:30:12.844 --> 00:30:14.145 align:middle line:90%
driving dark."

00:30:14.145 --> 00:30:16.047 align:middle line:90%
You know, like, that's spooky.

00:30:16.047 --> 00:30:17.315 align:middle line:90%
But you know what I'm saying.

00:30:17.315 --> 00:30:18.149 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: It
is spooky sometimes.

00:30:18.149 --> 00:30:18.783 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: It is spooky.

00:30:18.783 --> 00:30:19.351 align:middle line:90%
I think it's cool.

00:30:19.351 --> 00:30:20.552 align:middle line:90%
Its cool spooky.

00:30:20.552 --> 00:30:22.153 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so I'm doing it
first thing in the morning

00:30:22.153 --> 00:30:26.024 align:middle line:84%
and just have a whole range of
guests and topics and I'm having

00:30:26.024 --> 00:30:26.858 align:middle line:90%
such a good time in my...

00:30:26.858 --> 00:30:28.126 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Good for you.

00:30:28.126 --> 00:30:29.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: And my
co-host is my brother Lauren.

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:30.428 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:30:30.428 --> 00:30:32.464 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: So I -- we
get the guys viewpoint and...

00:30:32.464 --> 00:30:34.299 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: You
don't stop do you?

00:30:34.299 --> 00:30:35.166 align:middle line:90%
You don't stop.

00:30:35.166 --> 00:30:36.801 align:middle line:90%
I mean you do that.

00:30:36.801 --> 00:30:39.237 align:middle line:84%
You're doing auditions,
you're doing shows.

00:30:39.237 --> 00:30:40.805 align:middle line:84%
You were on  Celebrity
Apprentice .

00:30:40.805 --> 00:30:41.907 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: I was
on  Celebrity Apprentice

00:30:41.907 --> 00:30:42.908 align:middle line:90%
which was a great experience.

00:30:42.908 --> 00:30:44.242 align:middle line:90%
It was a lot of fun.

00:30:44.242 --> 00:30:46.144 align:middle line:84%
I got to make $100,000 for
the Alzheimer's Association...

00:30:46.144 --> 00:30:47.145 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Good for you.

00:30:47.145 --> 00:30:48.246 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
...which was nice.

00:30:48.246 --> 00:30:50.315 align:middle line:84%
And I'm doing a show
in New York starting --

00:30:50.315 --> 00:30:51.883 align:middle line:90%
well I go to New York July --

00:30:51.883 --> 00:30:53.919 align:middle line:84%
the end of July and then
rehearse for two weeks

00:30:53.919 --> 00:30:55.320 align:middle line:84%
and then perform
at Bucks County.

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.856 align:middle line:84%
It's connected to Lincoln
center which is really cool.

00:30:57.856 --> 00:31:00.058 align:middle line:84%
And I was just on two
episodes of  The Glades ,

00:31:00.058 --> 00:31:01.593 align:middle line:84%
which will be airing
later this -- in July.

00:31:01.593 --> 00:31:05.297 align:middle line:84%
And I was on  Two
and a Half Men ,

00:31:05.297 --> 00:31:07.365 align:middle line:84%
playing Ashton Kutcher's
love interest [laughter]

00:31:07.365 --> 00:31:08.366 align:middle line:90%
for the finale.

00:31:08.366 --> 00:31:09.467 align:middle line:84%
So I'm probably going
to come back.

00:31:09.467 --> 00:31:11.403 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that deserves
a hand [laughter].

00:31:11.403 --> 00:31:12.337 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: It does.

00:31:12.337 --> 00:31:13.538 align:middle line:90%
It does [applause].

00:31:13.538 --> 00:31:14.639 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
[Laughter] Yeah.

00:31:14.639 --> 00:31:15.407 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: What
drives you, Marilu?

00:31:15.407 --> 00:31:17.075 align:middle line:90%
What keeps pushing you?

00:31:17.075 --> 00:31:18.176 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
You know, I think --

00:31:18.176 --> 00:31:21.379 align:middle line:84%
I come from a big
family that always --

00:31:21.379 --> 00:31:25.116 align:middle line:90%
has always had a lot of spirit.

00:31:25.116 --> 00:31:26.851 align:middle line:84%
Parents who were
just extraordinary.

00:31:26.851 --> 00:31:29.120 align:middle line:84%
My mother was extremely
creative.

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:32.857 align:middle line:84%
My father was always,
you know, very smart.

00:31:32.857 --> 00:31:37.729 align:middle line:84%
And I think that having
those two role models;

00:31:37.729 --> 00:31:39.731 align:middle line:84%
real entrepreneurial
both of them.

00:31:39.731 --> 00:31:42.300 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm always trying
to make life better.

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:44.436 align:middle line:84%
You know? I love people
to come to my house.

00:31:44.436 --> 00:31:46.338 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I think there's
something about growing

00:31:46.338 --> 00:31:49.040 align:middle line:84%
up in the midwest or
the Great Lakes people.

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:50.408 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Absolutely.

00:31:50.408 --> 00:31:52.477 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: We have little
resistance to something new.

00:31:52.477 --> 00:31:55.347 align:middle line:84%
As strange as that sounds
I think that -- I --

00:31:55.347 --> 00:31:57.882 align:middle line:84%
this has been my
experience anyway.

00:31:57.882 --> 00:31:59.985 align:middle line:84%
There's New York and they
have their New York attitude.

00:31:59.985 --> 00:32:02.554 align:middle line:84%
And then there's L.A. and
they have their L.A. attitude.

00:32:02.554 --> 00:32:06.491 align:middle line:84%
But you grow up in Chicago,
or in Michigan, and you hear

00:32:06.491 --> 00:32:09.160 align:middle line:84%
about these two extremes and you
say, "What's the phone number?"

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:10.428 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter] You know?

00:32:10.428 --> 00:32:12.330 align:middle line:84%
You're curious and you're
interested and if you get

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:15.533 align:middle line:84%
out of sort of --
I always say it's

00:32:15.533 --> 00:32:17.035 align:middle line:84%
like the brown rice
of the country.

00:32:17.035 --> 00:32:19.037 align:middle line:84%
Because you kind of
go with everything.

00:32:19.037 --> 00:32:19.971 align:middle line:90%
You're kind of balanced.

00:32:19.971 --> 00:32:21.106 align:middle line:90%
A good pH you know.

00:32:21.106 --> 00:32:22.107 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yes.

00:32:22.107 --> 00:32:23.441 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
And I just feel --

00:32:23.441 --> 00:32:25.043 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, I think what
drives me is I just want things

00:32:25.043 --> 00:32:27.212 align:middle line:84%
to be better for
people and better --

00:32:27.212 --> 00:32:29.147 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm always
a student.

00:32:29.147 --> 00:32:31.282 align:middle line:84%
I'm always learning
something and I think

00:32:31.282 --> 00:32:32.984 align:middle line:90%
that that's what drives me.

00:32:32.984 --> 00:32:34.552 align:middle line:84%
Learning. There's
so much to learn.

00:32:34.552 --> 00:32:35.487 align:middle line:90%
So much to experience.

00:32:35.487 --> 00:32:36.921 align:middle line:84%
Let me ask; Danny
-- Danny DeVito.

00:32:36.921 --> 00:32:38.289 align:middle line:84%
[Laughter] Is he
easy to work with?

00:32:38.289 --> 00:32:40.091 align:middle line:90%
Yes, he's nodding his head.

00:32:40.091 --> 00:32:41.326 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
[Laughter] It's funny.

00:32:41.326 --> 00:32:42.927 align:middle line:84%
When my boys first met
Danny they were very little.

00:32:42.927 --> 00:32:43.762 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: How tall is he?

00:32:43.762 --> 00:32:44.996 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: He's 4'10".

00:32:44.996 --> 00:32:46.264 align:middle line:84%
People always thought I
was going to be much taller

00:32:46.264 --> 00:32:48.900 align:middle line:84%
because they put him at
5'2" but he's really 4'10".

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:50.802 align:middle line:84%
But when my kids met him
when they were little we --

00:32:50.802 --> 00:32:53.171 align:middle line:84%
they had met him when
they were very little

00:32:53.171 --> 00:32:54.572 align:middle line:84%
and then they hadn't
seen him for a few years

00:32:54.572 --> 00:32:57.108 align:middle line:84%
and when we saw each other
we were in an elevator

00:32:57.108 --> 00:32:59.411 align:middle line:84%
because the -- he and Ria were
staying in the same hotel.

00:32:59.411 --> 00:33:03.415 align:middle line:84%
And he -- they left the
elevator and they went, "Mom.

00:33:03.415 --> 00:33:04.582 align:middle line:90%
He's our height."

00:33:04.582 --> 00:33:05.950 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: [Laughter].

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:06.651 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: [Laughter]
He's -- they were so excited.

00:33:06.651 --> 00:33:07.719 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: He is.

00:33:07.719 --> 00:33:08.553 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
He's fantastic though.

00:33:08.553 --> 00:33:09.587 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: [Inaudible].

00:33:09.587 --> 00:33:10.755 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: A
whole new audience

00:33:10.755 --> 00:33:11.423 align:middle line:84%
with  It's Always
Sunny in Philadelphia .

00:33:11.423 --> 00:33:12.257 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he's great.

00:33:12.257 --> 00:33:13.425 align:middle line:90%
He's really a great guy.

00:33:13.425 --> 00:33:14.492 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I love those guys.

00:33:14.492 --> 00:33:15.693 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Do
you take supplements

00:33:15.693 --> 00:33:17.729 align:middle line:90%
for your memory at all?

00:33:17.729 --> 00:33:19.130 align:middle line:90%
>> [Multiple speakers].

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:19.664 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: Not so much
for my -- I take supplements.

00:33:19.664 --> 00:33:20.365 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I...

00:33:20.365 --> 00:33:21.299 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: You do.

00:33:21.299 --> 00:33:22.434 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
So I take a lot

00:33:22.434 --> 00:33:23.868 align:middle line:90%
of the longevity supplements.

00:33:23.868 --> 00:33:24.969 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:33:24.969 --> 00:33:25.937 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: I
love their osteo affects

00:33:25.937 --> 00:33:28.640 align:middle line:84%
and I love their
ultimate classic.

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:30.375 align:middle line:90%
I also take a vegan fish oil

00:33:30.375 --> 00:33:31.342 align:middle line:84%
because they don't
do a vegan one.

00:33:31.342 --> 00:33:32.710 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Right.

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:33.411 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: But I take
a vegan fish oil from Ascenta

00:33:33.411 --> 00:33:34.646 align:middle line:90%
which I really love too.

00:33:34.646 --> 00:33:36.981 align:middle line:84%
So I take, you know, I
take supplements like that.

00:33:36.981 --> 00:33:38.149 align:middle line:90%
But I eat well.

00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:39.250 align:middle line:90%
I exercise.

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:41.319 align:middle line:84%
I do something every
day to break a sweat.

00:33:41.319 --> 00:33:44.055 align:middle line:84%
Because it's -- you know I
always say, "You walk your dog.

00:33:44.055 --> 00:33:45.223 align:middle line:90%
You get a hamster wheel.

00:33:45.223 --> 00:33:46.391 align:middle line:90%
You cat stretches.

00:33:46.391 --> 00:33:47.992 align:middle line:84%
You're this beautiful
human animal.

00:33:47.992 --> 00:33:49.294 align:middle line:90%
Get out there and move."

00:33:49.294 --> 00:33:51.563 align:middle line:84%
So I do something like
that every day -- but yeah.

00:33:51.563 --> 00:33:52.864 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: What
is it about memory

00:33:52.864 --> 00:33:56.768 align:middle line:84%
where one day you feel as if
you're as sharp as a tack.

00:33:56.768 --> 00:34:01.372 align:middle line:84%
And then the next day you forget
where you put your car keys.

00:34:01.372 --> 00:34:03.842 align:middle line:90%
As simple as that may seem.

00:34:03.842 --> 00:34:05.276 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: Well
I think that people --

00:34:05.276 --> 00:34:07.311 align:middle line:84%
first of all people
have gotten lazy.

00:34:07.311 --> 00:34:08.279 align:middle line:90%
We've all gotten lazy.

00:34:08.279 --> 00:34:09.347 align:middle line:90%
All of us.

00:34:09.347 --> 00:34:11.081 align:middle line:84%
We are not -- you know,
you get in trouble

00:34:11.081 --> 00:34:12.550 align:middle line:90%
for actually dialing your phone

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:13.918 align:middle line:84%
because you're spending
too much time looking

00:34:13.918 --> 00:34:14.652 align:middle line:90%
at it when you're driving.

00:34:14.652 --> 00:34:16.020 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:17.088 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: I mean it's
-- you probably shouldn't --

00:34:17.088 --> 00:34:18.623 align:middle line:84%
we probably shouldn't
be driving and...

00:34:18.623 --> 00:34:19.924 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
And texting and...

00:34:19.924 --> 00:34:20.992 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: Well
definitely not texting

00:34:20.992 --> 00:34:22.393 align:middle line:84%
but even trying to
get a phone number.

00:34:22.393 --> 00:34:23.561 align:middle line:90%
So we've gotten lazy.

00:34:23.561 --> 00:34:24.929 align:middle line:90%
We have speed dial.

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:27.165 align:middle line:84%
We have the Internet to
go through so we're not --

00:34:27.165 --> 00:34:29.067 align:middle line:84%
you know, everything
is so at our fingertips

00:34:29.067 --> 00:34:32.837 align:middle line:84%
that we've lost some kind
of discipline when it comes

00:34:32.837 --> 00:34:34.873 align:middle line:90%
to really working our brains.

00:34:34.873 --> 00:34:38.710 align:middle line:84%
You know? So I think that some
days -- and sometimes you're --

00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:41.479 align:middle line:84%
you know, what's good for your
body is good for your brain.

00:34:41.479 --> 00:34:43.748 align:middle line:84%
So if your brain isn't working
chances are you didn't do

00:34:43.748 --> 00:34:45.650 align:middle line:84%
something good for
your body that day.

00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:47.252 align:middle line:84%
Whether you're not
hydrated enough

00:34:47.252 --> 00:34:50.387 align:middle line:84%
or you haven't gotten enough
oxygen from enough exercise,

00:34:50.387 --> 00:34:52.123 align:middle line:84%
or you've maybe eaten
food that's sort

00:34:52.123 --> 00:34:53.391 align:middle line:90%
of clogging your brain.

00:34:53.391 --> 00:34:55.894 align:middle line:84%
Because you can definitely
feel like that brain fog.

00:34:55.894 --> 00:34:57.028 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Right.

00:34:57.028 --> 00:34:57.729 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: From
-- and lack of sleep.

00:34:57.729 --> 00:34:58.797 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Sure.

00:34:58.797 --> 00:34:59.631 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
That's a huge one too.

00:34:59.631 --> 00:35:00.999 align:middle line:90%
People who don't sleep enough.

00:35:00.999 --> 00:35:03.201 align:middle line:84%
Yeah it's -- that's the thing
I have to work on the most.

00:35:03.201 --> 00:35:04.269 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
I always thought

00:35:04.269 --> 00:35:05.403 align:middle line:84%
that the keys just
feel into some portal.

00:35:05.403 --> 00:35:05.837 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: [Laughter].

00:35:05.837 --> 00:35:07.105 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:07.105 --> 00:35:07.939 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And then
somebody brought them back

00:35:07.939 --> 00:35:09.240 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.642 align:middle line:84%
[Laughter] But its -- but
sometimes it's frustrating.

00:35:10.642 --> 00:35:11.342 align:middle line:90%
I mean...

00:35:11.342 --> 00:35:12.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Sure.

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:14.045 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: ...I'll be on
the Internet sometimes ready

00:35:14.045 --> 00:35:16.481 align:middle line:84%
to go to a website and forget
the website I'm going to.

00:35:16.481 --> 00:35:17.815 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: Because
you're 10 beats ahead.

00:35:17.815 --> 00:35:19.851 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And then it
comes back to you later on.

00:35:19.851 --> 00:35:21.085 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Yeah.

00:35:21.085 --> 00:35:22.053 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: But it
gets frustrating sometimes.

00:35:22.053 --> 00:35:22.887 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Sure.

00:35:22.887 --> 00:35:24.756 align:middle line:90%
Like people always ask my kids,

00:35:24.756 --> 00:35:26.424 align:middle line:84%
"Well does mom ever
lose her keys?

00:35:26.424 --> 00:35:27.192 align:middle line:90%
Does she ever lose..."

00:35:27.192 --> 00:35:27.959 align:middle line:90%
And they say, "Oh my gosh.

00:35:27.959 --> 00:35:28.760 align:middle line:90%
She loses her keys.

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.094 align:middle line:90%
She loses her sunglasses."

00:35:30.094 --> 00:35:31.496 align:middle line:84%
They say, "Well what
does she do?"

00:35:31.496 --> 00:35:33.064 align:middle line:84%
And they said, "Well
this is what she does.

00:35:33.064 --> 00:35:34.465 align:middle line:90%
She's like where are my keys?

00:35:34.465 --> 00:35:35.667 align:middle line:84%
Where are my sun -- and then all
of a sudden she'll stand there

00:35:35.667 --> 00:35:37.468 align:middle line:84%
and you can see her
like scrolling back

00:35:37.468 --> 00:35:38.703 align:middle line:90%
through the montage of --

00:35:38.703 --> 00:35:40.171 align:middle line:84%
oh yeah, I walked in
yesterday, turned to the right.

00:35:40.171 --> 00:35:41.940 align:middle line:84%
I went to the bathroom; I
did this -- blah, blah, blah.

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:43.174 align:middle line:90%
That's where my keys are."

00:35:43.174 --> 00:35:45.577 align:middle line:84%
You know so maybe
scroll through your day.

00:35:45.577 --> 00:35:47.345 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I always
tell people when they say,

00:35:47.345 --> 00:35:50.582 align:middle line:84%
"Well how do I improve
my memory?"

00:35:50.582 --> 00:35:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Well there's two big
things you can do.

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:56.321 align:middle line:84%
You can identify what
is your primary track.

00:35:56.321 --> 00:35:58.423 align:middle line:90%
Because everyone has one.

00:35:58.423 --> 00:36:02.227 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has something that
they remember especially well.

00:36:02.227 --> 00:36:05.063 align:middle line:84%
Whether its travel,
relationships,

00:36:05.063 --> 00:36:06.231 align:middle line:90%
jobs that they've done.

00:36:06.231 --> 00:36:08.566 align:middle line:90%
Sports is a huge track for guys.

00:36:08.566 --> 00:36:10.768 align:middle line:90%
Hairdos, clothes, food.

00:36:10.768 --> 00:36:13.871 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe how many people
have a primarily track of food.

00:36:13.871 --> 00:36:17.709 align:middle line:84%
But in the jigsaw puzzle of your
life identifying your track is

00:36:17.709 --> 00:36:19.811 align:middle line:84%
kind of finding those
hard edged pieces

00:36:19.811 --> 00:36:22.146 align:middle line:84%
that will help you interconnect
the other pieces and sort

00:36:22.146 --> 00:36:23.548 align:middle line:90%
of make the whole picture.

00:36:23.548 --> 00:36:26.851 align:middle line:84%
So you think about your primary
track and then you also figure

00:36:26.851 --> 00:36:29.254 align:middle line:90%
out what is your dominant sense.

00:36:29.254 --> 00:36:32.056 align:middle line:84%
And in my book I have a
little dominant sense quiz.

00:36:32.056 --> 00:36:34.626 align:middle line:84%
Just 10 questions that will
help you identify what's your

00:36:34.626 --> 00:36:35.827 align:middle line:90%
dominant sense.

00:36:35.827 --> 00:36:38.663 align:middle line:84%
Because that's how
you receive, retain,

00:36:38.663 --> 00:36:39.964 align:middle line:90%
and then retrieve memories.

00:36:39.964 --> 00:36:42.000 align:middle line:90%
So if you're a visual person,

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.270 align:middle line:84%
you figure out you're a visual
person maybe once a day take a

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:47.405 align:middle line:84%
picture of something
that's iconic for the day.

00:36:47.405 --> 00:36:50.208 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh yeah, this is going
to make today's experience.

00:36:50.208 --> 00:36:51.843 align:middle line:84%
So you identify with
the picture.

00:36:51.843 --> 00:36:54.679 align:middle line:84%
Or even just take it in
your head and say okay,

00:36:54.679 --> 00:36:56.514 align:middle line:84%
this is how I'm going
to remember this day.

00:36:56.514 --> 00:36:58.750 align:middle line:84%
Or if you're a sound
person do kind

00:36:58.750 --> 00:37:00.084 align:middle line:84%
of like a sound check
once in a while.

00:37:00.084 --> 00:37:01.052 align:middle line:90%
Close your eyes.

00:37:01.052 --> 00:37:02.687 align:middle line:84%
Really take in what
am listening to?

00:37:02.687 --> 00:37:05.256 align:middle line:90%
What does this day mean to me?

00:37:05.256 --> 00:37:06.924 align:middle line:90%
Because having those two

00:37:06.924 --> 00:37:09.594 align:middle line:84%
and then cross connecting
them will help you remember a

00:37:09.594 --> 00:37:10.862 align:middle line:90%
lot more.

00:37:10.862 --> 00:37:12.797 align:middle line:84%
And then at night when
you're brushing your teeth --

00:37:12.797 --> 00:37:15.433 align:middle line:84%
you're supposed to do it for two
minutes but most people don't --

00:37:15.433 --> 00:37:17.835 align:middle line:84%
scroll through the movie
montage of your day.

00:37:17.835 --> 00:37:19.837 align:middle line:84%
Because that second
time through is going

00:37:19.837 --> 00:37:20.672 align:middle line:90%
to make a big difference.

00:37:20.672 --> 00:37:21.606 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: It locks it in.

00:37:21.606 --> 00:37:22.373 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
It locks it in.

00:37:22.373 --> 00:37:23.308 align:middle line:90%
It sears it a little more.

00:37:23.308 --> 00:37:24.008 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:37:24.008 --> 00:37:25.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Yeah.

00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:26.744 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: I'm convinced
that the brain is like a camera.

00:37:26.744 --> 00:37:30.148 align:middle line:84%
And so if we look at this entire
audience you will have the

00:37:30.148 --> 00:37:32.083 align:middle line:90%
imprint of everybody in here.

00:37:32.083 --> 00:37:33.284 align:middle line:90%
Every face.

00:37:33.284 --> 00:37:34.652 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Right.

00:37:34.652 --> 00:37:35.987 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: You might not
remember them all 10 minutes

00:37:35.987 --> 00:37:39.457 align:middle line:84%
later but somehow if you can
pull that out it's in there.

00:37:39.457 --> 00:37:40.458 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: It's in there.

00:37:40.458 --> 00:37:41.893 align:middle line:84%
Oh I don't think
anything is ever lost.

00:37:41.893 --> 00:37:44.629 align:middle line:84%
I think everything is on
your emotional hard drive

00:37:44.629 --> 00:37:46.664 align:middle line:84%
and it's making you
do things whether

00:37:46.664 --> 00:37:48.466 align:middle line:90%
or not you acknowledge them.

00:37:48.466 --> 00:37:50.768 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's making you
behave so why not bring

00:37:50.768 --> 00:37:52.603 align:middle line:84%
that information
to the foreground

00:37:52.603 --> 00:37:54.639 align:middle line:84%
and let it inform
a better future.

00:37:54.639 --> 00:37:57.475 align:middle line:84%
Let it help you make
decisions etcetera.

00:37:57.475 --> 00:37:58.676 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: A
friend of mine, adorable,

00:37:58.676 --> 00:38:02.046 align:middle line:84%
had the worst memory
of anybody I knew

00:38:02.046 --> 00:38:05.817 align:middle line:84%
and she was constantly
looking for ways to improve it.

00:38:05.817 --> 00:38:08.186 align:middle line:84%
And she was watching
television one day

00:38:08.186 --> 00:38:12.924 align:middle line:84%
and she saw this video
pop up for memory tapes.

00:38:12.924 --> 00:38:15.993 align:middle line:84%
And she got all excited because
she was convinced this was going

00:38:15.993 --> 00:38:16.761 align:middle line:90%
to change her life.

00:38:16.761 --> 00:38:18.696 align:middle line:90%
It was going to save her.

00:38:18.696 --> 00:38:20.331 align:middle line:90%
She forgot the toll free number.

00:38:20.331 --> 00:38:21.132 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: [Laughter].

00:38:21.132 --> 00:38:22.100 align:middle line:90%
And it never came on again?

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:23.000 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
It never came on.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.202 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Oh.

00:38:24.202 --> 00:38:25.470 align:middle line:84%
That must have been
pre-Internet because you go

00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:26.671 align:middle line:90%
like go in there and...

00:38:26.671 --> 00:38:27.505 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Exactly.

00:38:27.505 --> 00:38:28.606 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: ...find it.

00:38:28.606 --> 00:38:29.307 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: That
was a long time ago.

00:38:29.307 --> 00:38:30.675 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Yeah.

00:38:30.675 --> 00:38:33.444 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Is it energy
or is it biological memory?

00:38:33.444 --> 00:38:34.345 align:middle line:90%
I mean are you tapping...

00:38:34.345 --> 00:38:35.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: It's both.

00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:36.581 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: ...into
something that's out there?

00:38:36.581 --> 00:38:37.648 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
I think it's both.

00:38:37.648 --> 00:38:38.916 align:middle line:84%
I definitely think
feel like I'm tapping

00:38:38.916 --> 00:38:40.585 align:middle line:90%
into something that's out there.

00:38:40.585 --> 00:38:43.554 align:middle line:84%
But I definitely -- and it's
-- you know, I loved this.

00:38:43.554 --> 00:38:47.258 align:middle line:84%
First of all being one of six
kids you look for anything

00:38:47.258 --> 00:38:49.160 align:middle line:84%
that distinguishes you from
your brothers and sisters.

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:49.994 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Right.

00:38:49.994 --> 00:38:51.129 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: So I was --

00:38:51.129 --> 00:38:52.497 align:middle line:84%
because you know you're
like part of a litter.

00:38:52.497 --> 00:38:54.766 align:middle line:84%
You're like cats in a bag, you
know, when you're six kids.

00:38:54.766 --> 00:38:57.769 align:middle line:84%
So I always appreciated
the fact that I had this

00:38:57.769 --> 00:39:00.304 align:middle line:84%
and it was definitely
something I played up a lot.

00:39:00.304 --> 00:39:01.672 align:middle line:84%
And I would literally
fall asleep

00:39:01.672 --> 00:39:04.242 align:middle line:84%
as a little girl going okay,
what did I do a week ago,

00:39:04.242 --> 00:39:05.710 align:middle line:90%
two weeks ago, three weeks ago?

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:07.445 align:middle line:90%
This day in school a year ago.

00:39:07.445 --> 00:39:10.381 align:middle line:84%
Now I lie in bed when I'm having
trouble sleeping and I say,

00:39:10.381 --> 00:39:13.785 align:middle line:84%
okay what was I doing when I
was exactly to the day as old

00:39:13.785 --> 00:39:16.387 align:middle line:84%
as my son, and then
my other son.

00:39:16.387 --> 00:39:18.056 align:middle line:84%
Or my nieces, or you
know people like --

00:39:18.056 --> 00:39:19.624 align:middle line:90%
and I try to like remember.

00:39:19.624 --> 00:39:21.659 align:middle line:84%
And I do it not only
because it's kind

00:39:21.659 --> 00:39:24.662 align:middle line:84%
of a fun time travel exercise,
but it's also good for people

00:39:24.662 --> 00:39:27.065 align:middle line:84%
to do that because
you can say, okay I --

00:39:27.065 --> 00:39:28.199 align:middle line:90%
this has changed about me.

00:39:28.199 --> 00:39:29.033 align:middle line:90%
Oh this hasn't.

00:39:29.033 --> 00:39:30.635 align:middle line:90%
Oh that person from that time.

00:39:30.635 --> 00:39:32.236 align:middle line:84%
Oh I got to watch
out for -- you know.

00:39:32.236 --> 00:39:33.638 align:middle line:90%
So it's information.

00:39:33.638 --> 00:39:34.772 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Sure.

00:39:34.772 --> 00:39:35.807 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: And
you use it at some time.

00:39:35.807 --> 00:39:37.642 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: I
remember distinctly

00:39:37.642 --> 00:39:39.744 align:middle line:84%
when John F. Kennedy
was assassinated.

00:39:39.744 --> 00:39:40.845 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Yeah.

00:39:40.845 --> 00:39:42.280 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: You
know November 22, 1963.

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:43.214 align:middle line:90%
I was in school.

00:39:43.214 --> 00:39:45.016 align:middle line:90%
I remember my teacher coming in.

00:39:45.016 --> 00:39:46.617 align:middle line:90%
She was crying.

00:39:46.617 --> 00:39:48.486 align:middle line:84%
That episode I will
never forget.

00:39:48.486 --> 00:39:49.821 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: A gentleman.

00:39:49.821 --> 00:39:51.656 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: But I don't
remember anything before it

00:39:51.656 --> 00:39:52.657 align:middle line:90%
and after it.

00:39:52.657 --> 00:39:53.758 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Yeah.

00:39:53.758 --> 00:39:55.159 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: You
know it is an episode --

00:39:55.159 --> 00:39:57.929 align:middle line:84%
so is it the episode that you
remember that locks you into...

00:39:57.929 --> 00:39:58.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: A timeline.

00:39:58.930 --> 00:39:59.497 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
...what you were doing?

00:39:59.497 --> 00:40:00.798 align:middle line:90%
The timeline.

00:40:00.798 --> 00:40:01.566 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: Yeah, well
it's that adrenaline thing

00:40:01.566 --> 00:40:02.266 align:middle line:90%
that I was talking about.

00:40:02.266 --> 00:40:03.568 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Okay.

00:40:03.568 --> 00:40:04.135 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: I mean the
whole world was mobilized

00:40:04.135 --> 00:40:04.836 align:middle line:90%
at that point.

00:40:04.836 --> 00:40:06.337 align:middle line:90%
And I remember that day.

00:40:06.337 --> 00:40:10.641 align:middle line:84%
I remember that day
because I was in Chicago.

00:40:10.641 --> 00:40:12.076 align:middle line:90%
Raymond Flores came in.

00:40:12.076 --> 00:40:13.678 align:middle line:84%
He was kind of one
of the bad kids.

00:40:13.678 --> 00:40:14.612 align:middle line:90%
Maybe [inaudible].

00:40:14.612 --> 00:40:15.746 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
He's watching now.

00:40:15.746 --> 00:40:16.881 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: He's
probably watching now.

00:40:16.881 --> 00:40:19.817 align:middle line:84%
But he was like, one of
sort of the bad boys.

00:40:19.817 --> 00:40:22.620 align:middle line:84%
You know? And I remember
Sister Florence --

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:24.088 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure she's not still around.

00:40:24.088 --> 00:40:27.058 align:middle line:84%
Sister Florence -- he
came in late and he said

00:40:27.058 --> 00:40:29.594 align:middle line:84%
that he was late
because he found

00:40:29.594 --> 00:40:30.895 align:middle line:90%
out that the president was shot.

00:40:30.895 --> 00:40:32.363 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And nobody
else knew at the time?

00:40:32.363 --> 00:40:33.731 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: No,
nobody knew at the time.

00:40:33.731 --> 00:40:36.501 align:middle line:84%
And she started beating him
up for like, that bad excuse.

00:40:36.501 --> 00:40:37.702 align:middle line:90%
>> [Multiple speakers].

00:40:37.702 --> 00:40:38.536 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: She
said "Of all the excuses."

00:40:38.536 --> 00:40:39.604 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, she thought he was lying

00:40:39.604 --> 00:40:41.005 align:middle line:84%
and started hitting
him and hitting him.

00:40:41.005 --> 00:40:41.839 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Oh my God.

00:40:41.839 --> 00:40:42.673 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: And then...

00:40:42.673 --> 00:40:43.808 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: With a ruler.

00:40:43.808 --> 00:40:45.209 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: ...all
of a sudden they came

00:40:45.209 --> 00:40:46.677 align:middle line:84%
over the loudspeaker please pray
for -- you know and told us...

00:40:46.677 --> 00:40:48.045 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:40:48.045 --> 00:40:48.713 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: And she's
like, "Get back to your seat."

00:40:48.713 --> 00:40:49.480 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter] You know?

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:50.414 align:middle line:90%
And I thought oh my Gosh.

00:40:50.414 --> 00:40:51.649 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Yeah, what a time.

00:40:51.649 --> 00:40:52.783 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: Yeah, but
it's Catholic school so.

00:40:52.783 --> 00:40:53.417 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Let's
take some more questions

00:40:53.417 --> 00:40:55.419 align:middle line:90%
for Marilu Henner.

00:40:55.419 --> 00:40:57.054 align:middle line:90%
Yes sir. Right here.

00:40:57.054 --> 00:40:59.156 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu I'm wondering,

00:40:59.156 --> 00:41:05.196 align:middle line:84%
most people from a young age
have a fear of public speaking

00:41:05.196 --> 00:41:07.532 align:middle line:90%
which relates to memory.

00:41:07.532 --> 00:41:09.300 align:middle line:90%
Excuse me.

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:12.637 align:middle line:84%
And I'm wondering with your
memory does that give you

00:41:12.637 --> 00:41:15.106 align:middle line:84%
like extra confidence
as you were growing up?

00:41:15.106 --> 00:41:20.278 align:middle line:84%
You know going from the pilgrim
place up to TV and so on.

00:41:20.278 --> 00:41:23.614 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: You know,
my family had a dancing school

00:41:23.614 --> 00:41:25.516 align:middle line:90%
in Chicago in our backyard.

00:41:25.516 --> 00:41:28.553 align:middle line:84%
We had 200 students between
the age of two and 80.

00:41:28.553 --> 00:41:31.856 align:middle line:84%
Including, the nuns that came
over for stretch classes.

00:41:31.856 --> 00:41:34.325 align:middle line:84%
And my mother also ran a
beauty shop in our kitchen.

00:41:34.325 --> 00:41:36.861 align:middle line:84%
It was decorated like
a salon and 25 women

00:41:36.861 --> 00:41:37.929 align:middle line:90%
from the neighborhood would come

00:41:37.929 --> 00:41:39.330 align:middle line:84%
and get their hair
done [laughter].

00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:42.366 align:middle line:84%
And then my uncle lived upstairs
from us with 10 cats, two dogs,

00:41:42.366 --> 00:41:46.037 align:middle line:84%
two birds, a skunk, 150 fish
and his boyfriend Charles

00:41:46.037 --> 00:41:47.204 align:middle line:90%
and he taught art

00:41:47.204 --> 00:41:48.739 align:middle line:84%
at the Catholic grammar
school next door

00:41:48.739 --> 00:41:50.775 align:middle line:90%
and ran art classes upstairs.

00:41:50.775 --> 00:41:53.477 align:middle line:84%
And he was also the
neighborhood astrologist

00:41:53.477 --> 00:41:55.947 align:middle line:84%
and had a cat hospital
on the roof.

00:41:55.947 --> 00:41:58.449 align:middle line:84%
So that was a real
confidence builder.

00:41:58.449 --> 00:41:59.483 align:middle line:90%
Okay [laughter]?

00:41:59.483 --> 00:42:01.586 align:middle line:84%
I mean being kind
of the social center

00:42:01.586 --> 00:42:04.655 align:middle line:84%
of the neighborhood everybody
hung out at our house.

00:42:04.655 --> 00:42:07.091 align:middle line:84%
Everybody had their first
kiss probably some place

00:42:07.091 --> 00:42:08.459 align:middle line:90%
on our property.

00:42:08.459 --> 00:42:11.862 align:middle line:84%
And because we were like the
Kennedy's of Logan Square we --

00:42:11.862 --> 00:42:13.397 align:middle line:90%
that was the confidence builder.

00:42:13.397 --> 00:42:16.400 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, being a
little kid and performing.

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.669 align:middle line:84%
You get kids up there early
and they don't even know

00:42:18.669 --> 00:42:20.805 align:middle line:90%
to be feared -- to be fearful.

00:42:20.805 --> 00:42:23.841 align:middle line:84%
You know, I got my kids up in
front of people in little plays

00:42:23.841 --> 00:42:25.643 align:middle line:84%
and things like that
when they were four,

00:42:25.643 --> 00:42:27.745 align:middle line:84%
and they're both very
confident speakers.

00:42:27.745 --> 00:42:28.913 align:middle line:90%
So I think it had more to do

00:42:28.913 --> 00:42:32.216 align:middle line:84%
with the way I was raised
than even my memory.

00:42:32.216 --> 00:42:35.219 align:middle line:84%
I mean my memory saved me from
totally embarrassing myself.

00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:36.887 align:middle line:84%
Or I don't mind embarrassing
myself.

00:42:36.887 --> 00:42:37.922 align:middle line:90%
I've done it a lot.

00:42:37.922 --> 00:42:39.290 align:middle line:84%
I may be doing it
today I don't know.

00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:41.659 align:middle line:84%
But I just, you know -- but
I think it had more to do

00:42:41.659 --> 00:42:45.663 align:middle line:84%
with being part of that
kind of Henner world,

00:42:45.663 --> 00:42:47.765 align:middle line:90%
that crazy way of growing up.

00:42:47.765 --> 00:42:49.000 align:middle line:90%
That's a great question.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:49.800 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:50.768 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: All right.

00:42:50.768 --> 00:42:51.802 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to our "Beyond
Belief" cam

00:42:51.802 --> 00:42:55.773 align:middle line:84%
for another question
for Marilu Henner.

00:42:55.773 --> 00:42:56.574 align:middle line:90%
>> Michael: Hi Marilu.

00:42:56.574 --> 00:42:57.975 align:middle line:90%
It's Michael from Portland.

00:42:57.975 --> 00:43:00.711 align:middle line:84%
I was wondering if you believe
everyone has the capabilities

00:43:00.711 --> 00:43:04.248 align:middle line:90%
of having a memory like you.

00:43:04.248 --> 00:43:05.416 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: He's
so handsome [laughter].

00:43:05.416 --> 00:43:09.553 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that I
could turn anybody

00:43:09.553 --> 00:43:12.490 align:middle line:90%
into a person with H-SAM.

00:43:12.490 --> 00:43:14.558 align:middle line:84%
I think that there are people
who could be borderline.

00:43:14.558 --> 00:43:15.826 align:middle line:84%
They could improve
their memories

00:43:15.826 --> 00:43:17.595 align:middle line:90%
and then definitely would be.

00:43:17.595 --> 00:43:18.963 align:middle line:90%
They just don't know.

00:43:18.963 --> 00:43:22.133 align:middle line:84%
Because I did a speech at the
college of doctors at the --

00:43:22.133 --> 00:43:28.072 align:middle line:84%
at Cedar Sinai and there
was a doctor who specializes

00:43:28.072 --> 00:43:31.709 align:middle line:84%
in Parkinson's disease
and he said,

00:43:31.709 --> 00:43:34.879 align:middle line:84%
"I've never heard memory
described the way you

00:43:34.879 --> 00:43:36.213 align:middle line:90%
described it."

00:43:36.213 --> 00:43:38.816 align:middle line:84%
And now it's making me
realize that some of the people

00:43:38.816 --> 00:43:40.451 align:middle line:84%
that I'm working with
I have to talk to them

00:43:40.451 --> 00:43:42.887 align:middle line:84%
about this way of
looking at memory.

00:43:42.887 --> 00:43:45.790 align:middle line:84%
So I think that a lot of people
typically think of memory

00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:50.261 align:middle line:84%
as remembering people's faces
or memorizing a list of numbers.

00:43:50.261 --> 00:43:52.763 align:middle line:84%
You know, and I think
that because memory sits

00:43:52.763 --> 00:43:54.965 align:middle line:84%
on so many different parts
of the brain, various types

00:43:54.965 --> 00:43:56.901 align:middle line:84%
of memories sit on
different parts

00:43:56.901 --> 00:44:00.838 align:middle line:84%
of the brain developing your
autobiographical memory could be

00:44:00.838 --> 00:44:05.276 align:middle line:84%
very powerful in ways that
you never exercised before.

00:44:05.276 --> 00:44:07.311 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's
some borderline people

00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:10.181 align:middle line:84%
that could turn into H-SAMers
and then there are people --

00:44:10.181 --> 00:44:12.183 align:middle line:84%
I think everyone can
improve their memory.

00:44:12.183 --> 00:44:14.118 align:middle line:84%
I think you can remember
so much more.

00:44:14.118 --> 00:44:18.923 align:middle line:84%
I did a seminar a few years
ago, and I had 300 people

00:44:18.923 --> 00:44:20.891 align:middle line:90%
in the audience and I said,

00:44:20.891 --> 00:44:22.893 align:middle line:84%
"How many people here
remember their freshman

00:44:22.893 --> 00:44:24.428 align:middle line:90%
in high school schedule?"

00:44:24.428 --> 00:44:26.597 align:middle line:84%
And people were like,
oh come on.

00:44:26.597 --> 00:44:28.766 align:middle line:84%
And one girl raised her hand
and I said, "How old are you?"

00:44:28.766 --> 00:44:30.000 align:middle line:90%
And she said, "15."

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.736 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Honey you
better remember [laughter]."

00:44:31.736 --> 00:44:32.770 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: That's right.

00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:33.537 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
That was last year.

00:44:33.537 --> 00:44:34.939 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Exactly.

00:44:34.939 --> 00:44:36.707 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: But within 15
minutes all but three people --

00:44:36.707 --> 00:44:38.409 align:middle line:84%
and I think they
were just resistant.

00:44:38.409 --> 00:44:40.811 align:middle line:84%
All but three people
had their schedule.

00:44:40.811 --> 00:44:43.581 align:middle line:84%
Because you start -- oh, you
start bringing things back.

00:44:43.581 --> 00:44:45.049 align:middle line:84%
I mean I'm sure all of you
could start thinking --

00:44:45.049 --> 00:44:47.284 align:middle line:84%
you start thinking okay,
who was at my lunch table.

00:44:47.284 --> 00:44:48.719 align:middle line:90%
There's different ways in.

00:44:48.719 --> 00:44:49.887 align:middle line:90%
Different ways in.

00:44:49.887 --> 00:44:51.956 align:middle line:84%
You think oh, I was
always late for chemistry.

00:44:51.956 --> 00:44:56.727 align:middle line:84%
Or I had a -- you know my last
thing of the day was gym or --

00:44:56.727 --> 00:45:00.097 align:middle line:84%
and you start pulling things
in however you pull them in.

00:45:00.097 --> 00:45:02.800 align:middle line:84%
And you might be starting
with your dominant sense

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:06.604 align:middle line:84%
or your primary track and you
start filling in the blanks.

00:45:06.604 --> 00:45:08.539 align:middle line:84%
And within 15 minutes
I bet you most

00:45:08.539 --> 00:45:10.441 align:middle line:84%
of this room could
have their freshman

00:45:10.441 --> 00:45:11.809 align:middle line:90%
in high school schedule.

00:45:11.809 --> 00:45:12.510 align:middle line:90%
Where they were.

00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:13.778 align:middle line:90%
So it's just in there.

00:45:13.778 --> 00:45:14.945 align:middle line:90%
You know it's really in there.

00:45:14.945 --> 00:45:16.347 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Truly amazing.

00:45:16.347 --> 00:45:17.681 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: So I know that
you can definitely improve it.

00:45:17.681 --> 00:45:18.749 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Truly.

00:45:18.749 --> 00:45:20.050 align:middle line:84%
Let's take one more
question for Marilu.

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:22.119 align:middle line:84%
Yes sir. All the
way in the back.

00:45:22.119 --> 00:45:25.256 align:middle line:84%
>> In your research, what you've
done have you found anything

00:45:25.256 --> 00:45:26.924 align:middle line:90%
that helps both with the memory

00:45:26.924 --> 00:45:29.560 align:middle line:84%
and with the different
conditions

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:31.195 align:middle line:84%
with the eating right
for the blood type?

00:45:31.195 --> 00:45:34.031 align:middle line:84%
Have you found that to
be any success, also.

00:45:34.031 --> 00:45:35.099 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
Well it's not --

00:45:35.099 --> 00:45:36.801 align:middle line:90%
eating right for the blood type,

00:45:36.801 --> 00:45:41.138 align:middle line:84%
unfortunately my father was a
Type O and at that diet and died

00:45:41.138 --> 00:45:42.306 align:middle line:90%
of a heart attack at 52.

00:45:42.306 --> 00:45:43.808 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know about that.

00:45:43.808 --> 00:45:44.842 align:middle line:90%
But whatever.

00:45:44.842 --> 00:45:47.411 align:middle line:84%
But I think what's
good for your body

00:45:47.411 --> 00:45:48.979 align:middle line:84%
as I always say is
good for your brain.

00:45:48.979 --> 00:45:52.316 align:middle line:84%
And when I went into
-- after my mother died

00:45:52.316 --> 00:45:53.784 align:middle line:84%
and it was a real
turning point for me.

00:45:53.784 --> 00:45:55.820 align:middle line:90%
That was my health epiphany.

00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:58.222 align:middle line:84%
I started studying
about heart --

00:45:58.222 --> 00:45:59.924 align:middle line:84%
about arthritis because
she had been

00:45:59.924 --> 00:46:02.593 align:middle line:84%
on what she called her arthritis
diet a few months before --

00:46:02.593 --> 00:46:04.161 align:middle line:90%
a few years before she died.

00:46:04.161 --> 00:46:06.964 align:middle line:84%
And it was things -- and I
never made that connection

00:46:06.964 --> 00:46:08.432 align:middle line:90%
between and health before.

00:46:08.432 --> 00:46:10.601 align:middle line:84%
So I started there with
the arthritis diet.

00:46:10.601 --> 00:46:12.002 align:middle line:90%
And then I started reading

00:46:12.002 --> 00:46:13.737 align:middle line:84%
about for heart attacks
what you should...

00:46:13.737 --> 00:46:14.572 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Started studying.

00:46:14.572 --> 00:46:15.539 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: And there were

00:46:15.539 --> 00:46:16.974 align:middle line:84%
so many things that
were similar.

00:46:16.974 --> 00:46:20.244 align:middle line:84%
You know, so many things and
now studying the brain as much

00:46:20.244 --> 00:46:22.079 align:middle line:90%
as I have a lot of --

00:46:22.079 --> 00:46:24.882 align:middle line:84%
there might be some specific
things like for arthritis.

00:46:24.882 --> 00:46:27.051 align:middle line:84%
Let's say the nightshade
family, you know,

00:46:27.051 --> 00:46:30.087 align:middle line:84%
peppers potatoes,
eggplant, tomatoes.

00:46:30.087 --> 00:46:31.722 align:middle line:84%
Things that have too
much arginine in them.

00:46:31.722 --> 00:46:33.057 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes peanuts.

00:46:33.057 --> 00:46:33.858 align:middle line:90%
Too much sun.

00:46:33.858 --> 00:46:36.360 align:middle line:90%
Things like that.

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:38.596 align:middle line:90%
But, you know, I really think

00:46:38.596 --> 00:46:41.932 align:middle line:84%
that everything is cardio
vascular and connected

00:46:41.932 --> 00:46:48.005 align:middle line:84%
to elimination and just getting
all the nutrients to your brain

00:46:48.005 --> 00:46:51.842 align:middle line:84%
so that your brain works better
and it's good for your heart

00:46:51.842 --> 00:46:53.410 align:middle line:90%
and your bones as well.

00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:59.483 align:middle line:84%
So I think there are some
little specific foods for each

00:46:59.483 --> 00:47:01.452 align:middle line:84%
of the diseases but
they're def- --

00:47:01.452 --> 00:47:03.454 align:middle line:84%
it's definitely an
overall health thing.

00:47:03.454 --> 00:47:05.756 align:middle line:84%
And it's more of a
plant based diet.

00:47:05.756 --> 00:47:07.992 align:middle line:90%
Whole foods -- plant based diet.

00:47:07.992 --> 00:47:08.959 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: We
are going to come back

00:47:08.959 --> 00:47:11.262 align:middle line:84%
in just a moment
with Marilu Henner.

00:47:11.262 --> 00:47:13.531 align:middle line:84%
Don't wait because it's
coming up next [laughter].

00:47:13.531 --> 00:47:17.167 align:middle line:90%
[Applause]

00:47:17.167 --> 00:47:19.136 align:middle line:84%
And welcome back to "Beyond
Belief" we're with actress

00:47:19.136 --> 00:47:21.105 align:middle line:90%
and memory expert Marilu Henner.

00:47:21.105 --> 00:47:22.106 align:middle line:90%
This is exciting.

00:47:22.106 --> 00:47:23.474 align:middle line:90%
I always like seeing you.

00:47:23.474 --> 00:47:24.475 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: I
always like seeing you too.

00:47:24.475 --> 00:47:25.175 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
It's refreshing.

00:47:25.175 --> 00:47:26.443 align:middle line:90%
>> [Multiple speakers].

00:47:26.443 --> 00:47:27.645 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: So we're
going to do an experiment.

00:47:27.645 --> 00:47:29.146 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do a memory
test with Anita and...

00:47:29.146 --> 00:47:30.214 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Okay.

00:47:30.214 --> 00:47:31.448 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
...Anita come on up here.

00:47:31.448 --> 00:47:32.616 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to -- we're
going to [applause] --

00:47:32.616 --> 00:47:34.318 align:middle line:90%
we're going to test you.

00:47:34.318 --> 00:47:35.786 align:middle line:90%
>> Anita: Okay.

00:47:35.786 --> 00:47:37.588 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: Well this is
some -- it's funny I was in --

00:47:37.588 --> 00:47:39.690 align:middle line:84%
you know, I told you this
was my first time in Boulder

00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:42.026 align:middle line:84%
and I found this great
vegan restaurant last night

00:47:42.026 --> 00:47:42.793 align:middle line:90%
called Leaf.

00:47:42.793 --> 00:47:44.094 align:middle line:90%
It was fabulous.

00:47:44.094 --> 00:47:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And I was sitting there with
my step-son having dinner

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:48.699 align:middle line:84%
and there was a birthday party
thing going on next to us

00:47:48.699 --> 00:47:50.301 align:middle line:84%
and when we left they
said, "Oh we saw you

00:47:50.301 --> 00:47:51.101 align:middle line:90%
on  Celebrity Apprentice .

00:47:51.101 --> 00:47:52.102 align:middle line:90%
Blah, blah, blah."

00:47:52.102 --> 00:47:53.103 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Oh today's
your birthday?

00:47:53.103 --> 00:47:54.004 align:middle line:90%
What year were you born?"

00:47:54.004 --> 00:47:55.506 align:middle line:90%
And she said, "1976".

00:47:55.506 --> 00:47:57.141 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Oh,
that was a Tuesday."

00:47:57.141 --> 00:48:00.511 align:middle line:84%
And then I said, "Oh do you
remember your 21st birthday?

00:48:00.511 --> 00:48:03.647 align:middle line:90%
June 15, 1997 was a Sunday."

00:48:03.647 --> 00:48:04.581 align:middle line:90%
You know so we just started...

00:48:04.581 --> 00:48:05.716 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Amazing.

00:48:05.716 --> 00:48:07.051 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
...doing things like that.

00:48:07.051 --> 00:48:08.419 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of my favorite
things to do with people is

00:48:08.419 --> 00:48:11.188 align:middle line:84%
to -- because everybody
always asks me --

00:48:11.188 --> 00:48:13.590 align:middle line:84%
gives me the date
of their birthday.

00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:16.026 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, you know, it's
before I'm born or its --

00:48:16.026 --> 00:48:17.895 align:middle line:90%
I was very tiny or something.

00:48:17.895 --> 00:48:19.797 align:middle line:84%
But -- and they certainly
were tiny.

00:48:19.797 --> 00:48:21.165 align:middle line:90%
You know [laughter]?

00:48:21.165 --> 00:48:22.666 align:middle line:84%
They really don't remember what
they were doing on that day.

00:48:22.666 --> 00:48:24.134 align:middle line:90%
But then I always turn it around

00:48:24.134 --> 00:48:25.536 align:middle line:84%
and ask them their
21st birthday.

00:48:25.536 --> 00:48:28.906 align:middle line:84%
So you said that you volunteered
to tell us your birthday.

00:48:28.906 --> 00:48:29.974 align:middle line:90%
>> Anita: Sure.

00:48:29.974 --> 00:48:30.774 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
What's your birthday?

00:48:30.774 --> 00:48:33.077 align:middle line:90%
>> Anita: November 11, 1957.

00:48:33.077 --> 00:48:36.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: Okay
so November 11, 1957.

00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:38.849 align:middle line:84%
Okay so that's like a
little early in my life...

00:48:38.849 --> 00:48:39.883 align:middle line:90%
>> Anita: Yeah.

00:48:39.883 --> 00:48:40.584 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
...but that's okay.

00:48:40.584 --> 00:48:42.419 align:middle line:90%
But November 11, 1957.

00:48:42.419 --> 00:48:43.487 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Were
you even around then?

00:48:43.487 --> 00:48:44.288 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Yeah.

00:48:44.288 --> 00:48:44.989 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: All right.

00:48:44.989 --> 00:48:45.622 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: I was.

00:48:45.622 --> 00:48:47.758 align:middle line:90%
That was a Monday.

00:48:47.758 --> 00:48:52.229 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, November 11,
1957 was a Monday.

00:48:52.229 --> 00:48:53.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Anita: Wow.

00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:56.734 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: And so --
but November 11th, so '57.

00:48:56.734 --> 00:48:58.502 align:middle line:90%
So that would be '78.

00:48:58.502 --> 00:48:59.269 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:48:59.269 --> 00:48:59.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Anita: For my 21st?

00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:00.504 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Yeah.

00:49:00.504 --> 00:49:01.739 align:middle line:90%
1978. Okay.

00:49:01.739 --> 00:49:05.275 align:middle line:84%
November 11, 1978 I remember
exactly what I was doing

00:49:05.275 --> 00:49:06.677 align:middle line:90%
on that day.

00:49:06.677 --> 00:49:11.181 align:middle line:84%
November 11, 1978 I know exactly
what I was doing on that day.

00:49:11.181 --> 00:49:13.484 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember your
21st birthday?

00:49:13.484 --> 00:49:14.985 align:middle line:90%
>> Anita: Not at all.

00:49:14.985 --> 00:49:17.454 align:middle line:90%
>> November 11, 1978.

00:49:17.454 --> 00:49:19.256 align:middle line:84%
>> Anita: I remember
nothing about it.

00:49:19.256 --> 00:49:20.791 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: Nothing
about your 21st birthday?

00:49:20.791 --> 00:49:21.492 align:middle line:90%
>> Anita: Nothing.

00:49:21.492 --> 00:49:22.059 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Zero?

00:49:22.059 --> 00:49:22.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Anita: Zero.

00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:23.894 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Should she?

00:49:23.894 --> 00:49:24.428 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
You don't remember.

00:49:24.428 --> 00:49:24.995 align:middle line:90%
She should.

00:49:24.995 --> 00:49:25.829 align:middle line:90%
It's in there.

00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:28.432 align:middle line:90%
It's definitely in there.

00:49:28.432 --> 00:49:30.634 align:middle line:84%
>> Anita: My mind works
nothing like yours [laughter].

00:49:30.634 --> 00:49:32.403 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
No but it does.

00:49:32.403 --> 00:49:38.042 align:middle line:84%
Well what do you -- okay, first
of all, November 11, 1978.

00:49:38.042 --> 00:49:39.510 align:middle line:84%
You don't remember what
day of the week it was?

00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:40.144 align:middle line:90%
Nothing?

00:49:40.144 --> 00:49:40.978 align:middle line:90%
>> Anita: Nothing.

00:49:40.978 --> 00:49:41.612 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: [Inaudible].

00:49:41.612 --> 00:49:42.312 align:middle line:90%
>> Anita: Hmm-mm.

00:49:42.312 --> 00:49:43.013 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Okay.

00:49:43.013 --> 00:49:44.248 align:middle line:90%
>> [Multiple speakers].

00:49:44.248 --> 00:49:44.815 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: I'm
trying to get you prompted.

00:49:44.815 --> 00:49:45.516 align:middle line:90%
>> Anita: Okay.

00:49:45.516 --> 00:49:46.583 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Okay.

00:49:46.583 --> 00:49:48.252 align:middle line:84%
So do you remember
any of your birthdays?

00:49:48.252 --> 00:49:49.987 align:middle line:84%
>> Anita: Last birthday
I went gambling.

00:49:49.987 --> 00:49:51.155 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Okay.

00:49:51.155 --> 00:49:54.925 align:middle line:84%
So name -- but some other
like more years ago.

00:49:54.925 --> 00:49:56.026 align:middle line:90%
>> Anita: '78.

00:49:56.026 --> 00:49:56.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: Do
you remember what day

00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:57.661 align:middle line:90%
of the week you went gambling?

00:49:57.661 --> 00:49:58.929 align:middle line:90%
You're saying last birthday?

00:49:58.929 --> 00:50:00.064 align:middle line:90%
Of last year?

00:50:00.064 --> 00:50:02.066 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember what day
of the week that was?

00:50:02.066 --> 00:50:02.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Anita: No.

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:04.735 align:middle line:90%
I want to say it was a Thursday.

00:50:04.735 --> 00:50:09.173 align:middle line:90%
>> November 11, 2012?

00:50:09.173 --> 00:50:10.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Anita: No.

00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:11.708 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
[Laughter] Sorry [laughter].

00:50:11.708 --> 00:50:12.676 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Well I just
had a birthday a few weeks ago.

00:50:12.676 --> 00:50:14.278 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember
what day that was.

00:50:14.278 --> 00:50:14.978 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Really?

00:50:14.978 --> 00:50:15.746 align:middle line:90%
>> [Multiple speakers].

00:50:15.746 --> 00:50:16.447 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: No I do.

00:50:16.447 --> 00:50:17.414 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Okay.

00:50:17.414 --> 00:50:18.115 align:middle line:84%
But do you remember
any birthday,

00:50:18.115 --> 00:50:19.783 align:middle line:90%
any dates, any birthday?

00:50:19.783 --> 00:50:21.251 align:middle line:90%
>> Anita: None.

00:50:21.251 --> 00:50:22.653 align:middle line:90%
Not a one.

00:50:22.653 --> 00:50:23.654 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
Okay but you --

00:50:23.654 --> 00:50:24.588 align:middle line:84%
it's definitely in
there so I'm going

00:50:24.588 --> 00:50:25.556 align:middle line:90%
to have to help you one back.

00:50:25.556 --> 00:50:26.957 align:middle line:90%
>> Anita: Okay.

00:50:26.957 --> 00:50:28.025 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: So which one
would you like to bring back?

00:50:28.025 --> 00:50:29.226 align:middle line:84%
>> Anita: Let's bring
back the last one

00:50:29.226 --> 00:50:31.695 align:middle line:84%
since it was the
closest [laughter].

00:50:31.695 --> 00:50:32.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
[Inaudible] the easiest.

00:50:32.830 --> 00:50:33.630 align:middle line:90%
>> [Multiple speakers].

00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:34.264 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: All right.

00:50:34.264 --> 00:50:35.099 align:middle line:90%
Here's something.

00:50:35.099 --> 00:50:36.366 align:middle line:90%
Here's an experiment for you.

00:50:36.366 --> 00:50:37.968 align:middle line:84%
When you think about what
you did yesterday morning,

00:50:37.968 --> 00:50:41.271 align:middle line:84%
you get this image of waking
up and doing something.

00:50:41.271 --> 00:50:41.905 align:middle line:90%
>> Anita: Hmm-mm.

00:50:41.905 --> 00:50:42.606 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:42.606 --> 00:50:43.807 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Okay.

00:50:43.807 --> 00:50:44.875 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember -- scroll
through your morning.

00:50:44.875 --> 00:50:45.642 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember?

00:50:45.642 --> 00:50:46.844 align:middle line:90%
Do you have a sense of it?

00:50:46.844 --> 00:50:48.445 align:middle line:84%
Everybody in the audience
should try this as well.

00:50:48.445 --> 00:50:49.813 align:middle line:84%
Some people have to
close their eyes.

00:50:49.813 --> 00:50:51.181 align:middle line:90%
Some people have to stare thick.

00:50:51.181 --> 00:50:52.516 align:middle line:90%
Some people look up.

00:50:52.516 --> 00:50:55.586 align:middle line:84%
You try to remember what you
were doing yesterday morning

00:50:55.586 --> 00:50:57.221 align:middle line:90%
from the time you woke up.

00:50:57.221 --> 00:50:59.456 align:middle line:84%
Okay? And then you
try to remember --

00:50:59.456 --> 00:51:03.327 align:middle line:84%
how many people are in first
person when they're doing that?

00:51:03.327 --> 00:51:05.429 align:middle line:84%
Like, when you scroll through
are you back in your body

00:51:05.429 --> 00:51:07.097 align:middle line:84%
and kind of walking
through your day?

00:51:07.097 --> 00:51:10.033 align:middle line:84%
Seeing your alarm clock, waking
up, you know whatever you did.

00:51:10.033 --> 00:51:11.101 align:middle line:90%
>> Anita: Yeah.

00:51:11.101 --> 00:51:12.035 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
Having your breakfast.

00:51:12.035 --> 00:51:13.003 align:middle line:84%
Most -- okay, how
many people are

00:51:13.003 --> 00:51:14.605 align:middle line:84%
in first person when
they do that?

00:51:14.605 --> 00:51:16.807 align:middle line:84%
Okay. Now -- and if
you can remember.

00:51:16.807 --> 00:51:18.142 align:middle line:90%
Now if you try to think back

00:51:18.142 --> 00:51:22.446 align:middle line:84%
to what you did last
New Year's Eve.

00:51:22.446 --> 00:51:23.380 align:middle line:90%
Last New Year's Eve.

00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:24.581 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Gosh that's tough.

00:51:24.581 --> 00:51:25.849 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: What you
did last New Year's Eve.

00:51:25.849 --> 00:51:28.218 align:middle line:90%
I mean it's only six month ago.

00:51:28.218 --> 00:51:29.319 align:middle line:90%
But what -- do you kind

00:51:29.319 --> 00:51:32.689 align:middle line:84%
of remember what you
did last New Year's Eve?

00:51:32.689 --> 00:51:34.725 align:middle line:84%
When you have it
raise your hand.

00:51:34.725 --> 00:51:37.027 align:middle line:84%
When you have like what you
did last New Year's Eve.

00:51:37.027 --> 00:51:38.262 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Anita
you were with me.

00:51:38.262 --> 00:51:39.463 align:middle line:84%
[Laughter] You forgot
[laughter].

00:51:39.463 --> 00:51:41.665 align:middle line:84%
>> Anita: I was just
looking for my husband here.

00:51:41.665 --> 00:51:44.868 align:middle line:84%
I was like I think we
watched Dick Clark on TV.

00:51:44.868 --> 00:51:45.903 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: [Inaudible].

00:51:45.903 --> 00:51:46.603 align:middle line:84%
>> Anita: Except it
wasn't Dick Clark.

00:51:46.603 --> 00:51:47.437 align:middle line:90%
>> [Multiple speakers].

00:51:47.437 --> 00:51:48.272 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Ryan Seacrest.

00:51:48.272 --> 00:51:48.839 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Ryan Seacrest.

00:51:48.839 --> 00:51:49.673 align:middle line:90%
>> Anita: Yeah.

00:51:49.673 --> 00:51:50.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Ryan Seacrest.

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:51.375 align:middle line:90%
>> Anita: Yeah.

00:51:51.375 --> 00:51:52.142 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: Okay
so you were probably --

00:51:52.142 --> 00:51:53.343 align:middle line:90%
so when you think back --

00:51:53.343 --> 00:51:54.478 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to think
about the day of the week

00:51:54.478 --> 00:51:56.346 align:middle line:84%
but when you think back
are you in first person

00:51:56.346 --> 00:51:58.315 align:middle line:90%
or are you in third person?

00:51:58.315 --> 00:52:01.118 align:middle line:84%
Are you now not in
your body looking out?

00:52:01.118 --> 00:52:02.686 align:middle line:84%
You are more like
watching yourself.

00:52:02.686 --> 00:52:03.420 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Watching your body.

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:04.555 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Okay.

00:52:04.555 --> 00:52:05.756 align:middle line:84%
This is a very interesting
thing that happens

00:52:05.756 --> 00:52:06.857 align:middle line:90%
with people and memories.

00:52:06.857 --> 00:52:08.158 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
It's like a dream.

00:52:08.158 --> 00:52:09.226 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: Because
people -- it's like Scrooge.

00:52:09.226 --> 00:52:10.194 align:middle line:90%
Remember Scrooge would look

00:52:10.194 --> 00:52:12.162 align:middle line:84%
through the door
and watch himself?

00:52:12.162 --> 00:52:17.067 align:middle line:84%
Okay, people with H-SAM always
go back into first person.

00:52:17.067 --> 00:52:19.069 align:middle line:84%
Through their eyes
and looking out.

00:52:19.069 --> 00:52:22.673 align:middle line:84%
And it really has a much
stronger impression of memory.

00:52:22.673 --> 00:52:26.376 align:middle line:84%
And only 30% of most
people do that.

00:52:26.376 --> 00:52:30.247 align:middle line:84%
You'll do it in first person
the day before or this morning

00:52:30.247 --> 00:52:33.750 align:middle line:84%
but all of a sudden it shifts
and it becomes third person.

00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:36.119 align:middle line:84%
So it becomes something
that's kind of out there

00:52:36.119 --> 00:52:38.422 align:middle line:84%
and it takes a long
time to remember.

00:52:38.422 --> 00:52:40.357 align:middle line:90%
You know? So it's very...

00:52:40.357 --> 00:52:41.692 align:middle line:90%
>> Anita: [Inaudible].

00:52:41.692 --> 00:52:43.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: It's very
like, strong and different.

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:46.230 align:middle line:84%
Okay so your birthday
last year was on a Sunday.

00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:47.231 align:middle line:90%
>> Anita: Oh.

00:52:47.231 --> 00:52:47.931 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
You were in Vegas.

00:52:47.931 --> 00:52:48.765 align:middle line:90%
So you remember that?

00:52:48.765 --> 00:52:49.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Anita: Blackhawk, actually.

00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:50.167 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Oh, Blackhawk.

00:52:50.167 --> 00:52:51.268 align:middle line:90%
Okay [laughter].

00:52:51.268 --> 00:52:53.337 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I always think
of gambling as Vegas.

00:52:53.337 --> 00:52:54.371 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: [Laughter].

00:52:54.371 --> 00:52:55.505 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: So
you were gambling.

00:52:55.505 --> 00:52:57.007 align:middle line:84%
And so do -- now that
I've told you what day

00:52:57.007 --> 00:52:59.877 align:middle line:84%
of the week it was do you
remember anything else

00:52:59.877 --> 00:53:01.612 align:middle line:90%
about that day?

00:53:01.612 --> 00:53:05.916 align:middle line:84%
>> Anita: You might
just be a bad volunteer

00:53:05.916 --> 00:53:06.617 align:middle line:90%
[inaudible] [laughter].

00:53:06.617 --> 00:53:07.818 align:middle line:90%
>> [Multiple speakers].

00:53:07.818 --> 00:53:08.518 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Maybe a
little too much champagne.

00:53:08.518 --> 00:53:09.653 align:middle line:90%
>> [Multiple speakers].

00:53:09.653 --> 00:53:10.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Anita: I was going to
say I remember we drank

00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:11.822 align:middle line:90%
like two bottles of wine.

00:53:11.822 --> 00:53:12.656 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Uh-huh.

00:53:12.656 --> 00:53:13.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Anita: My girlfriend and I.

00:53:13.690 --> 00:53:14.758 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: See
it's coming back.

00:53:14.758 --> 00:53:15.325 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
See it's coming back.

00:53:15.325 --> 00:53:16.159 align:middle line:90%
It comes back.

00:53:16.159 --> 00:53:17.394 align:middle line:90%
So it was two bottles of wine.

00:53:17.394 --> 00:53:18.862 align:middle line:84%
>> Anita: Yeah and
I shouldn't say,

00:53:18.862 --> 00:53:21.265 align:middle line:84%
we smoked a lot of
cigarettes too.

00:53:21.265 --> 00:53:22.399 align:middle line:90%
>> [Multiple speakers].

00:53:22.399 --> 00:53:25.569 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: This
is all an intervention

00:53:25.569 --> 00:53:26.470 align:middle line:90%
for you actually [laughter].

00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:27.471 align:middle line:90%
>> Anita: Yeah, yeah.

00:53:27.471 --> 00:53:28.171 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:53:28.171 --> 00:53:28.939 align:middle line:90%
I've changed all that.

00:53:28.939 --> 00:53:29.973 align:middle line:90%
>> [Multiple speakers].

00:53:29.973 --> 00:53:31.408 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: How
much did you win?

00:53:31.408 --> 00:53:34.244 align:middle line:84%
>> Anita: I think I --
I can't remember that.

00:53:34.244 --> 00:53:37.748 align:middle line:84%
I didn't -- I came home like
a little bit up overall.

00:53:37.748 --> 00:53:39.149 align:middle line:90%
For being there over night.

00:53:39.149 --> 00:53:40.484 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Don't want to
say because the husbands here.

00:53:40.484 --> 00:53:41.051 align:middle line:90%
>> Anita: [Laughter] No, no.

00:53:41.051 --> 00:53:41.852 align:middle line:90%
I don't care.

00:53:41.852 --> 00:53:43.186 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't care [laughter].

00:53:43.186 --> 00:53:46.189 align:middle line:84%
I think I pretty well broke
even by the end of the day.

00:53:46.189 --> 00:53:48.492 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. But my girlfriend
I remember,

00:53:48.492 --> 00:53:50.827 align:middle line:84%
she hit like a couple hundred
bucks right before we left.

00:53:50.827 --> 00:53:51.928 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: See how
all this is coming out?

00:53:51.928 --> 00:53:52.729 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: It comes out.

00:53:52.729 --> 00:53:53.297 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:53:53.297 --> 00:53:54.398 align:middle line:90%
>> Anita: Yes.

00:53:54.398 --> 00:53:55.499 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: And
you start to think.

00:53:55.499 --> 00:53:56.266 align:middle line:84%
So now the next time
you go to Vegas or go

00:53:56.266 --> 00:53:57.134 align:middle line:90%
to Blackhawk it's called?

00:53:57.134 --> 00:53:57.935 align:middle line:90%
>> Anita: Yes.

00:53:57.935 --> 00:53:58.769 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: All right.

00:53:58.769 --> 00:53:59.903 align:middle line:90%
Next time you go to Blackhawk

00:53:59.903 --> 00:54:01.104 align:middle line:84%
which of those things
will you do or not do?

00:54:01.104 --> 00:54:03.273 align:middle line:84%
>> Anita: Oh I'll
do them all again.

00:54:03.273 --> 00:54:04.107 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
You'll do them all again.

00:54:04.107 --> 00:54:04.941 align:middle line:90%
>> Anita: Oh yeah, I'll be back.

00:54:04.941 --> 00:54:05.509 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: That's okay.

00:54:05.509 --> 00:54:06.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Anita: Yeah.

00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:07.644 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
That's all right.

00:54:07.644 --> 00:54:08.445 align:middle line:84%
You had a great time,
you did it with gusto.

00:54:08.445 --> 00:54:09.513 align:middle line:90%
It was something that seared

00:54:09.513 --> 00:54:11.648 align:middle line:84%
into your brain as
a good experience.

00:54:11.648 --> 00:54:13.884 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, it's
something like, yeah remember

00:54:13.884 --> 00:54:15.819 align:middle line:84%
that good time we had
and everything and now,

00:54:15.819 --> 00:54:18.288 align:middle line:90%
you know, it was on a Sunday.

00:54:18.288 --> 00:54:19.389 align:middle line:84%
>> Anita: [Laughter]
[inaudible].

00:54:19.389 --> 00:54:20.557 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: Does
that make sense now?

00:54:20.557 --> 00:54:22.693 align:middle line:90%
>> Anita: Well yeah actually.

00:54:22.693 --> 00:54:23.794 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:54:23.794 --> 00:54:25.162 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Now
how does she do this?

00:54:25.162 --> 00:54:27.864 align:middle line:84%
Because you obviously
can't be with here 24/7.

00:54:27.864 --> 00:54:29.266 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Right.

00:54:29.266 --> 00:54:31.168 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: How does she
do this to pull it out herself?

00:54:31.168 --> 00:54:32.235 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
Well what you do it --

00:54:32.235 --> 00:54:34.805 align:middle line:84%
what do you think
your primary track is?

00:54:34.805 --> 00:54:35.505 align:middle line:90%
>> Anita: Food.

00:54:35.505 --> 00:54:36.173 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Food.

00:54:36.173 --> 00:54:37.941 align:middle line:90%
Smell, food, taste.

00:54:37.941 --> 00:54:39.242 align:middle line:90%
Okay. So you're a taste person.

00:54:39.242 --> 00:54:40.444 align:middle line:90%
You'd probably take the test --

00:54:40.444 --> 00:54:42.879 align:middle line:84%
and we could put it on
your website or something.

00:54:42.879 --> 00:54:44.014 align:middle line:90%
You're a taste person.

00:54:44.014 --> 00:54:46.016 align:middle line:90%
So you could probably barcode --

00:54:46.016 --> 00:54:47.317 align:middle line:84%
I always use that
expression sort

00:54:47.317 --> 00:54:50.854 align:middle line:84%
of like cross connect
your greatest meals.

00:54:50.854 --> 00:54:52.889 align:middle line:84%
Like tell me about
a meal that you had

00:54:52.889 --> 00:54:54.825 align:middle line:84%
that you loved that
you remember.

00:54:54.825 --> 00:54:57.327 align:middle line:90%
>> Anita: Oh let's see.

00:54:57.327 --> 00:55:00.664 align:middle line:90%
Gosh. Can I say the restaurant?

00:55:00.664 --> 00:55:01.798 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Oh sure.

00:55:01.798 --> 00:55:03.133 align:middle line:84%
>> Anita: We were at a
restaurant, Papadeux...

00:55:03.133 --> 00:55:04.534 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Uh-huh.

00:55:04.534 --> 00:55:08.205 align:middle line:84%
>> Anita: Down in south Denver
and gosh we started with oysters

00:55:08.205 --> 00:55:13.110 align:middle line:84%
and everybody had something
different and I had redfish

00:55:13.110 --> 00:55:14.845 align:middle line:90%
which I had never had before.

00:55:14.845 --> 00:55:15.412 align:middle line:90%
>> [Multiple speakers].

00:55:15.412 --> 00:55:16.713 align:middle line:90%
>> Anita: Yes.

00:55:16.713 --> 00:55:18.715 align:middle line:84%
And it was on dirty rice and
it was -- [laughter] yeah,

00:55:18.715 --> 00:55:19.850 align:middle line:90%
with wine sauce [laughter].

00:55:19.850 --> 00:55:22.619 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
Everybody has this track.

00:55:22.619 --> 00:55:23.920 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: [Laughter]
And the bill was this.

00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:25.055 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Yeah.

00:55:25.055 --> 00:55:26.556 align:middle line:84%
[Laughter] No, food is
a huge track for people.

00:55:26.556 --> 00:55:29.926 align:middle line:84%
Because it is connected
to a strong sense.

00:55:29.926 --> 00:55:31.128 align:middle line:90%
>> Anita: Yeah.

00:55:31.128 --> 00:55:32.095 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: So
there's like a taste thing.

00:55:32.095 --> 00:55:34.564 align:middle line:84%
So you have to like
taste your day.

00:55:34.564 --> 00:55:38.969 align:middle line:84%
You have to do something every
day to really taste something.

00:55:38.969 --> 00:55:40.070 align:middle line:90%
You know lick your life.

00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:40.804 align:middle line:90%
You know what I'm saying?

00:55:40.804 --> 00:55:42.105 align:middle line:90%
>> Anita: Yes.

00:55:42.105 --> 00:55:43.306 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: You have
to taste something every day

00:55:43.306 --> 00:55:47.043 align:middle line:84%
that will make -- imprint
that day with a memory.

00:55:47.043 --> 00:55:49.713 align:middle line:84%
You know? And that'll be --
what did you eat when you were

00:55:49.713 --> 00:55:52.883 align:middle line:84%
on your birthday -- have on
your birthday with your friends?

00:55:52.883 --> 00:55:54.151 align:middle line:84%
>> Anita: Let's see,
we went to the buffet

00:55:54.151 --> 00:55:57.621 align:middle line:84%
and of course I had this
massive salad I remember.

00:55:57.621 --> 00:56:00.457 align:middle line:90%
And they had shrimp cocktail.

00:56:00.457 --> 00:56:03.860 align:middle line:84%
You know, all sort of
seafood things they had.

00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:04.895 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Yeah.

00:56:04.895 --> 00:56:05.962 align:middle line:84%
>> Anita: I -- yeah
I remember those.

00:56:05.962 --> 00:56:07.097 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
You could probably...

00:56:07.097 --> 00:56:08.331 align:middle line:84%
>> Anita: And cookies on
the way out [laughter].

00:56:08.331 --> 00:56:10.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: You could
probably take a calendar

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:13.003 align:middle line:84%
of your life and remember
meals and that your --

00:56:13.003 --> 00:56:16.006 align:middle line:84%
those are your hard-edged
pieces in the jigsaw puzzle.

00:56:16.006 --> 00:56:17.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Anita: Isn't that wild?

00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:18.341 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Yeah.

00:56:18.341 --> 00:56:19.776 align:middle line:84%
And you could start
bringing back birthdays

00:56:19.776 --> 00:56:21.011 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:56:21.011 --> 00:56:23.747 align:middle line:84%
And just those little
triggers will make you say,

00:56:23.747 --> 00:56:25.682 align:middle line:90%
"Wow, boy have I changed."

00:56:25.682 --> 00:56:27.117 align:middle line:84%
Or "Wow I'm still
that same girl."

00:56:27.117 --> 00:56:31.655 align:middle line:84%
And it's inspiring to say that
was a great experience I want

00:56:31.655 --> 00:56:34.691 align:middle line:84%
to remember that one so
that I kind of recreate it.

00:56:34.691 --> 00:56:37.727 align:middle line:84%
Or you say, "Oh that job
interview went so well

00:56:37.727 --> 00:56:39.296 align:middle line:90%
because I was on my game.

00:56:39.296 --> 00:56:42.399 align:middle line:84%
I ate this for breakfast, you
know, whatever it is for you.

00:56:42.399 --> 00:56:45.202 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like why not
use the tools of your life?

00:56:45.202 --> 00:56:46.436 align:middle line:90%
It's your story.

00:56:46.436 --> 00:56:48.238 align:middle line:84%
And people always say, "What
about the bad memories?

00:56:48.238 --> 00:56:49.439 align:middle line:90%
What about that bad breakup?"

00:56:49.439 --> 00:56:51.141 align:middle line:84%
Well you're going to
remember those things anyway

00:56:51.141 --> 00:56:52.676 align:middle line:84%
because they are
tied to adrenaline.

00:56:52.676 --> 00:56:56.046 align:middle line:84%
But the more you examine them
-- it's like a scary movie.

00:56:56.046 --> 00:56:58.215 align:middle line:84%
You know, it loses its
impact after a while.

00:56:58.215 --> 00:57:00.884 align:middle line:84%
So the more you confront those
things instead of treating them

00:57:00.884 --> 00:57:03.453 align:middle line:84%
like they're the emotional
boogie men in the room,

00:57:03.453 --> 00:57:06.122 align:middle line:84%
the more you really examine
them and explore them.

00:57:06.122 --> 00:57:08.959 align:middle line:84%
The more power you have over
them rather than they are --

00:57:08.959 --> 00:57:11.962 align:middle line:84%
you know, taking your power
away and they are, you know,

00:57:11.962 --> 00:57:14.431 align:middle line:84%
they're like sucking
the life out of you.

00:57:14.431 --> 00:57:15.765 align:middle line:90%
You know making you feel bad.

00:57:15.765 --> 00:57:17.133 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Let's
hear it for Anita.

00:57:17.133 --> 00:57:18.235 align:middle line:90%
[Applause] Thanks, Anita.

00:57:18.235 --> 00:57:19.636 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: I
hope that was helpful.

00:57:19.636 --> 00:57:20.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Anita: [Inaudible].

00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:21.037 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Oh yeah, yeah.

00:57:21.037 --> 00:57:22.606 align:middle line:90%
But you'll see.

00:57:22.606 --> 00:57:24.608 align:middle line:84%
That 21st birthday's
coming back [laughter].

00:57:24.608 --> 00:57:26.843 align:middle line:90%
It definitely will.

00:57:26.843 --> 00:57:28.245 align:middle line:84%
>> Anita: [Inaudible]
[laughter].

00:57:28.245 --> 00:57:30.413 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: You know it's
amazing how you can draw this

00:57:30.413 --> 00:57:31.381 align:middle line:90%
out of people.

00:57:31.381 --> 00:57:32.516 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Yeah.

00:57:32.516 --> 00:57:33.350 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: When
initially she comes on,

00:57:33.350 --> 00:57:34.518 align:middle line:90%
she doesn't remember anything.

00:57:34.518 --> 00:57:35.886 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Right.

00:57:35.886 --> 00:57:36.987 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Then she's
telling us what she had and...

00:57:36.987 --> 00:57:38.355 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: To eat.

00:57:38.355 --> 00:57:39.122 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: ...what her
friend had and everything else.

00:57:39.122 --> 00:57:39.956 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:57:39.956 --> 00:57:41.091 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: It's there.

00:57:41.091 --> 00:57:42.526 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: It's a
tape recorder isn't it?

00:57:42.526 --> 00:57:43.827 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: It is.

00:57:43.827 --> 00:57:45.929 align:middle line:84%
It's recorded and it's there
and that's why I'm saying

00:57:45.929 --> 00:57:47.864 align:middle line:90%
with the figuring out your track

00:57:47.864 --> 00:57:51.701 align:middle line:84%
and your dominant sense it's
really understanding how you

00:57:51.701 --> 00:57:55.539 align:middle line:84%
receive them, how you retain
them, and how to retrieve them.

00:57:55.539 --> 00:57:59.009 align:middle line:84%
Because they are available to
you at any moment's notice.

00:57:59.009 --> 00:58:02.812 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: What is the
single biggest little trick

00:58:02.812 --> 00:58:04.948 align:middle line:84%
that we can do to
remember things?

00:58:04.948 --> 00:58:06.349 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: I
think pay attention.

00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:09.586 align:middle line:84%
Pay attention to -- first of all
understand what works for you.

00:58:09.586 --> 00:58:11.621 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's -- it might
not be crossword puzzles

00:58:11.621 --> 00:58:13.857 align:middle line:90%
and Sudoku to record your life.

00:58:13.857 --> 00:58:17.327 align:middle line:84%
It might be a smell,
a taste, a sound.

00:58:17.327 --> 00:58:20.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean certainly music is
a huge trigger for people.

00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:23.300 align:middle line:84%
You know so somehow
play to your strength.

00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:24.701 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Sure.

00:58:24.701 --> 00:58:26.036 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: Play to your
dominant sense every single day.

00:58:26.036 --> 00:58:28.071 align:middle line:84%
Know that -- you know, that's
why I was saying to Anita;

00:58:28.071 --> 00:58:31.374 align:middle line:84%
do something -- identify
a taste every single day

00:58:31.374 --> 00:58:33.143 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
remember that day better.

00:58:33.143 --> 00:58:34.778 align:middle line:84%
You know cross connect
that with something

00:58:34.778 --> 00:58:36.112 align:middle line:90%
that you're going through.

00:58:36.112 --> 00:58:38.615 align:middle line:90%
Just taste that experience.

00:58:38.615 --> 00:58:41.017 align:middle line:84%
I mean whether --
literally or figuratively.

00:58:41.017 --> 00:58:44.688 align:middle line:84%
So that's why you have
to do -- now you --

00:58:44.688 --> 00:58:46.256 align:middle line:84%
I mean I know you
have a great memory

00:58:46.256 --> 00:58:49.559 align:middle line:84%
and you see people all the
time and you're talking to --

00:58:49.559 --> 00:58:51.061 align:middle line:90%
but you're very plugged in.

00:58:51.061 --> 00:58:51.928 align:middle line:90%
You're always plugged in.

00:58:51.928 --> 00:58:53.063 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: You have to be.

00:58:53.063 --> 00:58:54.264 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: Every
time I see you I feel

00:58:54.264 --> 00:58:56.499 align:middle line:84%
like we're picking up
exactly where we left off.

00:58:56.499 --> 00:58:57.434 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Yeah, you have to be.

00:58:57.434 --> 00:58:58.368 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
You have to be.

00:58:58.368 --> 00:58:59.736 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
And I also learned

00:58:59.736 --> 00:59:01.871 align:middle line:84%
that when you meet people --
how many people meet someone,

00:59:01.871 --> 00:59:04.741 align:middle line:84%
they walk away and don't
remember their name?

00:59:04.741 --> 00:59:05.675 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Yeah.

00:59:05.675 --> 00:59:06.509 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
And they me them.

00:59:06.509 --> 00:59:07.344 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Or nothing.

00:59:07.344 --> 00:59:08.411 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Who was that?

00:59:08.411 --> 00:59:09.212 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: Or
nothing about them.

00:59:09.212 --> 00:59:10.447 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Or nothing.

00:59:10.447 --> 00:59:11.581 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: it's
like they skim the surface.

00:59:11.581 --> 00:59:13.416 align:middle line:84%
The other day I was at
an opening of a hotel

00:59:13.416 --> 00:59:15.485 align:middle line:84%
and I saw a woman, I
said, "We've meet before."

00:59:15.485 --> 00:59:17.554 align:middle line:84%
And she said -- she mentioned
the place and I said,

00:59:17.554 --> 00:59:18.888 align:middle line:84%
"Oh my gosh that
was -- it was --

00:59:18.888 --> 00:59:21.458 align:middle line:90%
you know April the 6th of 2006.

00:59:21.458 --> 00:59:22.592 align:middle line:90%
It was a Thursday.

00:59:22.592 --> 00:59:24.127 align:middle line:84%
It was at -- you know,
shutters on the beach.

00:59:24.127 --> 00:59:26.062 align:middle line:84%
You know and we always like
naming all these things.

00:59:26.062 --> 00:59:28.932 align:middle line:84%
So now I could have just
walked past her at the party

00:59:28.932 --> 00:59:30.967 align:middle line:84%
and not had anything
to do with her.

00:59:30.967 --> 00:59:35.205 align:middle line:84%
And then what happened was now
we have a point of reference.

00:59:35.205 --> 00:59:37.107 align:middle line:84%
Now we have an experience
together.

00:59:37.107 --> 00:59:40.577 align:middle line:84%
Now next time I'll see here we
will have last week's experience

00:59:40.577 --> 00:59:41.645 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:59:41.645 --> 00:59:43.213 align:middle line:84%
So you're constantly
layering information

00:59:43.213 --> 00:59:45.915 align:middle line:84%
which is what really separates
us from all other animals.

00:59:45.915 --> 00:59:46.850 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Sure does, sure does.

00:59:46.850 --> 00:59:48.385 align:middle line:84%
You have been an
absolute delight.

00:59:48.385 --> 00:59:49.419 align:middle line:90%
>> Marilu Henner: Oh thank you.

00:59:49.419 --> 00:59:50.353 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: You
always have been.

00:59:50.353 --> 00:59:51.588 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
Thanks so much.

00:59:51.588 --> 00:59:52.222 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: [Background
applause] Let's hear it

00:59:52.222 --> 00:59:53.556 align:middle line:90%
for Marilu Henner.

00:59:53.556 --> 00:59:54.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner:
[Applause] Whoa [laughter].

00:59:54.190 --> 00:59:54.891 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:59:54.891 --> 00:59:55.792 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Super.

00:59:55.792 --> 00:59:56.893 align:middle line:90%
[ Applause ]

00:59:56.893 --> 00:59:57.994 align:middle line:84%
>> Marilu Henner: So
great to see you guys.

00:59:57.994 --> 00:59:58.795 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And
thank you for watching

00:59:58.795 --> 01:00:00.363 align:middle line:90%
"Beyond Belief" [applause].

01:00:00.363 --> 01:00:01.297 align:middle line:90%
