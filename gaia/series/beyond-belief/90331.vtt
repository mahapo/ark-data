>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.362 --> 00:00:08.820 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.572 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.572 --> 00:00:13.220 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>>It felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.480 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.255 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:26.482 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.482 --> 00:00:28.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.520 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.619 align:middle line:10%
Time and time again, I'll get
emails at "Coast to Coast"

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.070 align:middle line:10%
with people saying, George,
one of my favorite guests

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.950 align:middle line:10%
is that David Wilcock guy.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, perhaps you didn't
know it, maybe you did,

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.750 align:middle line:84%
but David is an
accomplished author.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.700 align:middle line:84%
He's been on the History
Channel's "Ancient Aliens."

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And of course, he is a
star in his own right

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.210 align:middle line:84%
on Gaiam Television
with his own program.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.590 align:middle line:10%
Back by popular
demand, David Wilcock.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.790 align:middle line:10%
Always a pleasure, David.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:57.770 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID WILCOCK: Well,
thank you for inviting me

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.230 align:middle line:10%
to your cosmic nightclub here.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.149 align:middle line:10%
It's very colorful
and looks like we

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:03.690 align:middle line:10%
ought to be drinking
more than water.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is one heck
of a place, isn't it?

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.080 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: What happened
to your mustache, bro?

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, as I
explained a few weeks ago,

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.550 align:middle line:84%
I was about ready
to trim my mustache.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.180 align:middle line:84%
The trimmer has what is
called a trimmer guide.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And you attach them
based on the length

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.790 align:middle line:90%
you want your mustache to be.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, apparently, it
fell off the trimmer.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.980 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know that.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And so I had, literally,
the trimmer blade.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.830 align:middle line:90%
And I went to trim it down.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.470 align:middle line:90%
And I went bzzzt.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.590 align:middle line:90%
And I looked like Adolf Hitler.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.110 align:middle line:90%
And I said--

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.500 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: I would say,
Sylvester Stallone.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --I've
got to change this.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Oh, with the little
moustache strip in the middle?

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:46.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah,
half was like that.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.218 align:middle line:84%
So the only way I
could do it was I

00:01:48.218 --> 00:01:51.030 align:middle line:84%
had to shave the
whole thing off.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.750 align:middle line:90%
But it'll grow.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.140 align:middle line:90%
It grows pretty fast.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.470 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Well, I forgive you.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.580 align:middle line:84%
I forgive you for not being
your absolute best for my show.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for bringing
that forward to everybody.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.536 align:middle line:84%
As if they didn't
already notice.

00:02:01.536 --> 00:02:02.410 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: [CHUCKLES]

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.790 align:middle line:90%


00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How are you?

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:04.690 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: I'm doing great, man.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:05.640 align:middle line:90%
It's good to be on your show.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.848 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What's new with you?

00:02:06.848 --> 00:02:09.270 align:middle line:10%
>>WILCOCK: I'm feeling
pretty amazing.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.042 align:middle line:84%
We have so much going on
in the world right now.

00:02:12.042 --> 00:02:13.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, too much, David.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.320 align:middle line:10%
>>WILCOCK: And the
amazing thing is,

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.742 align:middle line:10%
I have all these
insiders telling me

00:02:18.742 --> 00:02:19.950 align:middle line:10%
things are about to collapse.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.120 align:middle line:10%
And these are very
high-ranking military personnel

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.430 align:middle line:10%
reporting to me that
the bad guys, the cabal,

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.280 align:middle line:10%
are trying to create
an Ebola plague.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And I was on your show, on
"Coast to Coast AM," the night

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.710 align:middle line:90%
that that all started.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:35.010 align:middle line:90%
Remember that?

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yep, you sure were.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.096 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: You announced it.

00:02:37.096 --> 00:02:39.270 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even-- I hadn't
heard about it yet.

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.410 align:middle line:90%
It had just gotten started.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And it appears to
most people who

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.480 align:middle line:84%
are bothering to not
have their head buried

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.090 align:middle line:84%
in the sand like an ostrich
that things are getting more

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.790 align:middle line:84%
and more frightening, more
and more upsetting, more

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:51.581 align:middle line:90%
and more difficult.

00:02:51.581 --> 00:02:52.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can feel it.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: It definitely
feels that way.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I wanted to
talk to you today about stress.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.800 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk
about the idea

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.370 align:middle line:84%
that stress is actually
a beneficial thing

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.160 align:middle line:84%
and may, in fact, be one of
the keys to human evolution.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's possible that the
things that are happening

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.490 align:middle line:90%
are actually not negative.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.530 align:middle line:84%
That this is all part
of a perfect plan,

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.950 align:middle line:84%
divinely orchestrated,
whose purpose

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.830 align:middle line:84%
ultimately is to
guide and shepherd us

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.170 align:middle line:84%
into a cracking of
the shell that we

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.240 align:middle line:90%
built around our hearts.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.350 align:middle line:84%
An opening of the mind and the
body to a greater awareness.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Stress really
does kill, doesn't it?

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: It can
kill, but it also

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.110 align:middle line:84%
creates an impetus
for evolution.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.040 align:middle line:84%
It creates motivation that
we might not otherwise have.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.580 align:middle line:84%
So that's the basic assertion
that I wanted to bring forward.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And our show on the rainbow
body was so well received,

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.610 align:middle line:84%
it seemed appropriate to talk
about ascension more and get

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.530 align:middle line:90%
into a deeper level of it.

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.200 align:middle line:84%
Since the last time we spoke
about Tibetan rainbow body

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.130 align:middle line:84%
practice, I've read a lot more
of what they do in terms of,

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:09.910 align:middle line:84%
how do these Tibetan monks and
yogis achieve this fantastic

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.330 align:middle line:84%
transmutation of their
physical body into light?

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.290 align:middle line:90%
That's what the rainbow body is.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.190 align:middle line:84%
It's idea that you meditate in
the cave for 20 to 40 years.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.860 align:middle line:84%
You spend most of your time,
if not all of your time,

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.320 align:middle line:84%
dedicated
single-mindedly on trying

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.640 align:middle line:84%
to keep every thought in
your mind a loving thought.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's when you achieve
that, which I would consider

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.440 align:middle line:84%
like the Olympic athlete
version of spirituality,

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.897 align:middle line:84%
if you can achieve that, which
seems almost impossible-- I

00:04:37.897 --> 00:04:40.480 align:middle line:84%
mean, you're certainly not going
to have a loving thought when

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.870 align:middle line:90%
you buzz off half your mustache.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:42.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.690 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: I imagine there were
some very colorful language.

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:45.314 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe.

00:04:45.314 --> 00:04:46.060 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.262 align:middle line:90%


00:04:46.262 --> 00:04:46.970 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Maybe.

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The only good part
about it is it grows quickly.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:51.840 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: That's true.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.060 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.270 align:middle line:84%
So why is it that
stress would be

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.830 align:middle line:84%
part of a benevolent
universe's design?

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.590 align:middle line:90%
What would that offer us?

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And my answer would be that if
we don't have enough motivation

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.860 align:middle line:84%
to change, then we stay
stuck where we are.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.270 align:middle line:84%
There's a very interesting
thing in the Tibetan teachings

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.250 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't know when we
did our show two years ago.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And that is that
the monks actually

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:26.690 align:middle line:84%
say that if you do not have
enough stress in your life

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.030 align:middle line:84%
when you are meditating and
trying to reach rainbow body,

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.130 align:middle line:84%
if you're too happy, if
all you are is in a cave

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.916 align:middle line:84%
and all your food
needs are supplied--

00:05:34.916 --> 00:05:35.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All is well.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: --you're
blissed out, you

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.860 align:middle line:84%
go into this very
unpleasant place called

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.530 align:middle line:84%
the Realm of
Conceptionless Gods.

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And that realm
appears to be Nirvana.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.166 align:middle line:84%
It appears to be like
the Garden of Eden.

00:05:51.166 --> 00:05:51.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.150 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: But it's a trap.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.420 align:middle line:84%
It's a trap that you're lured
into because all you want

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.900 align:middle line:84%
is bliss and
happiness and peace.

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And these conceptionless gods,
as you begin to meditate more,

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.950 align:middle line:84%
you start having
interactions, telepathically,

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.667 align:middle line:84%
with these alternate
planes of existence.

00:06:09.667 --> 00:06:12.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they're saying, have
a little stress in your life.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:13.390 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: That's right.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:18.370 align:middle line:84%
Because the conceptionless gods
pose as these beautiful women

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.030 align:middle line:84%
that are luring you into
this garden filled with food

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.260 align:middle line:84%
and they're feeding you
grapes and all this stuff,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.650 align:middle line:90%
but it's actually a trap.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.170 align:middle line:90%
And they become shapeshifters.

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.300 align:middle line:84%
And you're in this
terrible perdition.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you can't
get out once you're in.

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:32.770 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: That's right.

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:37.390 align:middle line:90%
So you want to have difficulty.

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And the Tibetans have
said-- some of them

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.830 align:middle line:84%
have said that one of the
greatest things that ever

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.212 align:middle line:84%
happened was being
invaded by China.

00:06:45.212 --> 00:06:46.920 align:middle line:84%
Because if they hadn't
have been invaded,

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.200 align:middle line:84%
those teachings would
have never broken out so

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.290 align:middle line:84%
that you and I could be
talking about them now.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:52.498 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a good point.

00:06:52.498 --> 00:06:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you talk about
this internal stress,

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.540 align:middle line:90%
what does that mean?

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.660 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: I'm
actually saying that we

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.590 align:middle line:84%
are part of an intelligent
cosmos that is biological.

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:07.800 align:middle line:90%
The universe is alive.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.830 align:middle line:84%
The cosmos itself is
a conscious being.

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's very different
than most people's idea, where

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.670 align:middle line:84%
life is sort of a
random happenstance that

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:20.960 align:middle line:90%
happened by Darwinian mutation.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we both
know that's not true.

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:23.880 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Clearly.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And the point is there are
two major things that are both

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:34.320 align:middle line:84%
working against us when
we try to adapt to more

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.760 align:middle line:84%
of a cosmic concept
of our existence.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:42.730 align:middle line:84%
Number 1 is that there is an
intrinsic resistance to it

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:44.320 align:middle line:90%
in the human mind.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:49.610 align:middle line:84%
People don't like the idea that
there is a God-- some people--

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:53.650 align:middle line:84%
because that implies that
the things that happened

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:55.130 align:middle line:90%
were allowed to happen.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:55.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm-hm.

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:57.610 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Many
people have pain that

00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:59.750 align:middle line:90%
is irreconcilable for them.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:02.880 align:middle line:84%
Something happened to them that
is beyond the ability for them

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.920 align:middle line:84%
to see that it could
be a positive event.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And yet 92% of Americans,
based on a poll taken in 2011

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.595 align:middle line:84%
by Reuters, said that
they believe in God.

00:08:14.595 --> 00:08:15.970 align:middle line:84%
When they are
asked the question,

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:16.930 align:middle line:90%
do you believe in God?

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:18.772 align:middle line:90%
92% of Americans said yes.

00:08:18.772 --> 00:08:19.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which is huge.

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:20.090 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Yeah.

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:21.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yet a lot
of people, David,

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:25.460 align:middle line:84%
will say, how can God
be so cruel to take

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:30.140 align:middle line:84%
a little two-year-old with
cancer or some other tragedy?

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:31.820 align:middle line:90%
And how do you answer that?

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:34.900 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Well, that
is a very difficult--

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:37.130 align:middle line:84%
that's essentially the
kill shot or the nuke

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:40.140 align:middle line:84%
that most skeptics try to fire
against people who believe

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:44.250 align:middle line:84%
in God or in a divine
being of some kind.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:48.500 align:middle line:84%
My answer to that
would be, that there

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.500 align:middle line:84%
is more to life than
just a physical body.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:55.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the case of a child
who dies very young, what

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:57.590 align:middle line:84%
we find out is
that, in many cases,

00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:00.940 align:middle line:84%
people are planning
out their incarnations

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:03.110 align:middle line:90%
in between lifetimes.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And there are people who
are regressed by hypnosis

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:10.490 align:middle line:84%
through the classic
pioneering work of Dr. Michael

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:12.240 align:middle line:90%
Newton and others like him.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And what we find out is that
everybody, after you die,

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:20.270 align:middle line:84%
goes back to a heavenly
alternate reality that

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:21.890 align:middle line:90%
seems to coexist with our own.

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:23.910 align:middle line:84%
It's not like it's
up in the sky,

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:25.470 align:middle line:84%
and if you fly up
far enough, you're

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:27.140 align:middle line:90%
going to find all these people.

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:29.474 align:middle line:84%
It's an energetic dimension
in some alternate existence.

00:09:29.474 --> 00:09:30.931 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You mean,
they're not even

00:09:30.931 --> 00:09:32.360 align:middle line:90%
in clouds with harps. [CHUCKLES]

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.570 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: I haven't
seen them yet.

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:35.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to find them,
but they're not there.

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:37.060 align:middle line:84%
That might be the
conceptionless gods, though.

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:38.433 align:middle line:84%
You gotta watch
out for those guys.

00:09:38.433 --> 00:09:39.349 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:09:39.349 --> 00:09:41.690 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: So what
we're saying is

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:43.419 align:middle line:84%
there's different
layers of reality.

00:09:43.419 --> 00:09:44.585 align:middle line:90%
There's different membranes.

00:09:44.585 --> 00:09:48.120 align:middle line:84%
There are different realms
or planes of existence.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.430 align:middle line:84%
And when you go into
the afterlife, when

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:53.440 align:middle line:84%
you drop a physical
body, you still exist.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.430 align:middle line:90%
But there are key differences.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:59.780 align:middle line:84%
Everybody, regardless of whether
they're an atheist or a Hindu

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:03.110 align:middle line:84%
or a Buddhist or a Christian
or a Muslim or a Jew,

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:04.820 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter
where you come from.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.774 align:middle line:84%
When you go into the
afterlife, we all

00:10:06.774 --> 00:10:07.815 align:middle line:90%
have the same experience.

00:10:07.815 --> 00:10:09.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're in
the same kettle.

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:12.030 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: And you're
a spiritual person.

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:13.210 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:15.279 align:middle line:84%
You are a highly
spiritual person

00:10:15.279 --> 00:10:16.570 align:middle line:90%
when you go into the afterlife.

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:18.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you not
before you get in there?

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.410 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Many of them or not.

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:24.150 align:middle line:84%
Many, many people who have
had these studies done

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.720 align:middle line:84%
were just ordinary folks
from ordinary walks of life.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.375 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were
even people who

00:10:28.375 --> 00:10:30.501 align:middle line:84%
had been criminals
and delinquents.

00:10:30.501 --> 00:10:31.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Killers, you name it.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:34.000 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: It doesn't matter
who you are in this life.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.230 align:middle line:84%
You go up there, and
you are a blissed out

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:41.810 align:middle line:84%
angelic being who is
programming lifetimes on Earth

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:44.180 align:middle line:84%
for an agenda, which is
to become more loving.

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:47.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But isn't there--
there's got to be a penalty

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:52.930 align:middle line:84%
for some serial killer on this
planet, that once they pass,

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:56.990 align:middle line:84%
that that soul can't be mixed
in with the enlightened David

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.190 align:middle line:90%
Wilcock or somebody else's?

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:01.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: That is
absolutely correct.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:04.520 align:middle line:84%
The Michael Newton
books describe cases

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.720 align:middle line:84%
where that happened,
where you have someone

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:11.820 align:middle line:84%
who he's interviewing and that
person is in the afterlife.

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And when you talk to
somebody under hypnosis

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:17.270 align:middle line:84%
who's having this regression,
they're talking in real time.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:20.480 align:middle line:84%
They're having a virtual
reality experience

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.190 align:middle line:84%
that is absolutely
present-centered for them.

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:25.110 align:middle line:84%
It's not like they're
remembering something.

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:26.500 align:middle line:90%
They're in it.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.800 align:middle line:84%
So some of the people that
Michael Newton interviewed

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:33.560 align:middle line:84%
described serial killers
coming into the afterlife.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:37.190 align:middle line:84%
And what actually happens
in that particular scenario

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:41.320 align:middle line:84%
is that you are brought off
into a separate area, alone.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.000 align:middle line:90%
You are isolated.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And there is a guide
who is with you.

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And you go into a deep
counseling type of modality,

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:52.090 align:middle line:84%
where you, basically,
are going to have

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:53.700 align:middle line:84%
to relive the
things that you did

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:57.115 align:middle line:84%
to others in a sort
of "Groundhog Day"--

00:11:57.115 --> 00:11:57.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Over--

00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:58.698 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: --time loop.

00:11:58.698 --> 00:12:00.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --and over and over.

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:01.450 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: And the movie,
"Edge of Tomorrow,"

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:03.340 align:middle line:84%
I just saw recently--
yet another example.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.930 align:middle line:84%
They changed the title
to "Live, Die, Repeat."

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:10.100 align:middle line:84%
He keeps dying over and
over again in the movie.

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:13.710 align:middle line:84%
So the reason why there's
so many movies like this

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:15.770 align:middle line:84%
is that some part
of us subconsciously

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:19.170 align:middle line:84%
remembers that in
the afterlife, we

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:22.390 align:middle line:84%
are given the task
of having to relive

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:23.940 align:middle line:84%
what we've done
that hurt people.

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:24.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That could
be pretty painful.

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:26.370 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: And we relive
it over and over again.

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:27.703 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's got to be painful.

00:12:27.703 --> 00:12:30.840 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Especially
because part of the design

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.770 align:middle line:84%
is that you not only relive
it, but you experience it

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:35.820 align:middle line:84%
from the other person's
perspective of how

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:37.570 align:middle line:90%
you made them feel.

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:39.560 align:middle line:84%
So think about how
poignant that would

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.920 align:middle line:90%
be if you've been out there.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.190 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not saying you as you.

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:43.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I understand.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:44.580 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: I'm talking
about somebody else.

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:45.496 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I understand.

00:12:45.496 --> 00:12:50.320 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: But if you have, if
one has-- let's rephrase it.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:55.550 align:middle line:84%
If one has this arrogance
and this conceit

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:57.700 align:middle line:84%
and this feeling
of invulnerability

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.170 align:middle line:84%
and a desire for
power over others,

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:04.250 align:middle line:84%
a desire to cause harm, a
sarcastic satisfaction--

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:07.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sounds like a
few of our politicians.

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:09.720 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: "Schadenfreude"
is the German word for it.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.680 align:middle line:90%
The joy of others' misery.

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.470 align:middle line:84%
Laughing when
people are in pain.

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:17.750 align:middle line:84%
In that alternate
reality of the afterlife,

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:20.110 align:middle line:84%
the soul review
involves you having

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:23.770 align:middle line:84%
to see not the part that
got your jollies off,

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:26.980 align:middle line:84%
but how those other people
that you were hurting felt.

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And you experience
every little bit of it.

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Their
pain, their anguish.

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Now, you
can work that stuff off

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:34.910 align:middle line:84%
while you're in a
physical incarnation.

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:38.730 align:middle line:84%
You're not doomed to have to
do all this in the afterlife.

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:41.670 align:middle line:84%
But the trick is that
you have to experience

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:45.870 align:middle line:84%
in your physical body a
similar experience to what you

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:47.050 align:middle line:90%
caused other people.

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:49.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When they
come back, when

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:54.050 align:middle line:84%
they're reincarnated again,
are they better individuals

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:55.750 align:middle line:90%
than when they left?

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:57.020 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: That is their hope.

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:58.620 align:middle line:90%
That is their goal.

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:01.340 align:middle line:84%
We see a 10-part process
that people go through

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:02.760 align:middle line:90%
in the afterlife.

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And what ends up happening
is that you choose.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:09.420 align:middle line:84%
You get a series of about maybe
four choices of which lifetime

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:10.520 align:middle line:90%
you're going to have.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.072 align:middle line:90%
You choose your physical body.

00:14:12.072 --> 00:14:14.030 align:middle line:84%
You choose what your
body's going to look like.

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:16.310 align:middle line:84%
You choose the weaknesses
that it will have.

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:18.195 align:middle line:84%
You choose who your
parents are going to be.

00:14:18.195 --> 00:14:22.155 align:middle line:84%
You choose, actually,
what major events

00:14:22.155 --> 00:14:23.530 align:middle line:84%
are going to happen
in your life.

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:25.740 align:middle line:84%
So if you have four
choices here and it's

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:28.480 align:middle line:84%
like a shell game-- oh no,
which one am I going to pick?

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.639 align:middle line:84%
This guy is going to get
hit by a car when he's

00:14:30.639 --> 00:14:32.930 align:middle line:84%
seven years old, and his legs
are going to be crippled.

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:35.900 align:middle line:84%
He's not going to
be able to walk.

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And each one of
them has a story.

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And none of the
stories are that good.

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:40.639 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you've
got to pick one?

00:14:40.639 --> 00:14:42.550 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Yeah,
if you have karma

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:44.470 align:middle line:90%
that has to be worked off.

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:46.430 align:middle line:10%
So there's a case I
described in my book

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:50.240 align:middle line:10%
"Synchronicity Key" about
a woman who remembered

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:55.390 align:middle line:10%
being a character
called Leth the Viking.

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:59.760 align:middle line:84%
And this Viking,
essentially, her goal

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.950 align:middle line:84%
before incarnating
in that lifetime

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:04.530 align:middle line:84%
was that she wanted to
have as much food and drink

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:07.370 align:middle line:84%
and violence and
sex as possible.

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:10.128 align:middle line:84%
Now, this would represent
a lower level soul.

00:15:10.128 --> 00:15:11.586 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One heck
of a life, David.

00:15:11.586 --> 00:15:12.455 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:15:12.455 --> 00:15:12.954 align:middle line:90%


00:15:12.954 --> 00:15:15.194 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: [LAUGHS]
Everybody in the afterlife,

00:15:15.194 --> 00:15:16.860 align:middle line:84%
according to Michael
Newton's research--

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:18.600 align:middle line:84%
and he's interviewed
thousands of people,

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.762 align:middle line:84%
and they all say the same
things independently.

00:15:20.762 --> 00:15:22.470 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't tip them
off with other people

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:24.110 align:middle line:90%
who have been saying this stuff.

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:26.160 align:middle line:90%
Everybody has a color.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.460 align:middle line:84%
Your soul has this
luminosity to it.

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:31.540 align:middle line:84%
So the lowest level
is actually sort

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:34.080 align:middle line:84%
of a white but with
a reddish tinge.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.232 align:middle line:84%
And then you have a soul
that's got an orange hue.

00:15:36.232 --> 00:15:37.440 align:middle line:90%
That would be the next level.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.910 align:middle line:90%
Then you have a yellow.

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:40.450 align:middle line:84%
And that encompasses
the majority

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:42.430 align:middle line:90%
of people who are here on Earth.

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:45.150 align:middle line:84%
Then, for some reason,
green doesn't exist.

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:48.220 align:middle line:84%
And we could talk about that,
why that happens, later.

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:52.310 align:middle line:84%
Then you skip to light blue,
dark blue, and very rare,

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:54.520 align:middle line:84%
once in a great, great while,
if you're really lucky,

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:57.152 align:middle line:84%
you'll get to see one
of these violet beings.

00:15:57.152 --> 00:15:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
real high level--

00:15:58.610 --> 00:15:59.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's way up.

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.410 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: --beings that
oversee the whole process.

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:02.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Those are
the archangels.

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:03.910 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: That's correct.

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:07.740 align:middle line:84%
So if you are light
blue or higher,

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:10.600 align:middle line:84%
you're actually now an
angelic soul-- somebody

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:14.340 align:middle line:84%
who doesn't normally incarnate
on a planet like this.

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And he did interview
some people like that.

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:18.227 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they
were at one time--

00:16:18.227 --> 00:16:19.060 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Oh, yeah.

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:19.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --as they climb.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.818 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: But
then, they volunteer

00:16:20.818 --> 00:16:23.510 align:middle line:84%
to come back and
do it all again.

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:27.570 align:middle line:84%
So most people on Earth-- and
I think he said 75% to 80%--

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:32.000 align:middle line:84%
fall somewhere in the range
of the sort of whitish red,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.240 align:middle line:90%
the orange, or the yellow.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And then in those cases, in the
early-- like if you're a red,

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:41.705 align:middle line:90%
let's say.

00:16:41.705 --> 00:16:43.080 align:middle line:84%
I'll just use the
term "red" even

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.160 align:middle line:84%
though it's sort
of a whitish red.

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.780 align:middle line:84%
If you're a red, that would
represent first density

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:52.170 align:middle line:84%
or first-level understanding
in the Law of One system, which

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:53.960 align:middle line:84%
I've talked about on
my show extensively.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.270 align:middle line:84%
So people can watch
more for that.

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:59.520 align:middle line:84%
If you're a red soul, then that
means that you don't really

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.250 align:middle line:84%
understand too much
about what's going on.

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:04.250 align:middle line:84%
You're bright-eyed
and bushy tailed.

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:05.230 align:middle line:90%
You're open-minded.

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:06.820 align:middle line:84%
You're welcoming
new experiences.

00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:08.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you're
an entry-level person?

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:08.329 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Yeah.

00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And the experiences
you might welcome

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:13.766 align:middle line:84%
could include drinking,
drugging, sex, violence.

00:17:13.766 --> 00:17:16.140 align:middle line:84%
You want to go down there,
and you want to kick some ass.

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:17.181 align:middle line:90%
You want to be a soldier.

00:17:17.181 --> 00:17:20.420 align:middle line:84%
You want to kill
a bunch of people.

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:22.410 align:middle line:90%
That is a level of the soul.

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And at that level,
you don't really

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:26.349 align:middle line:90%
understand what's going on.

00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:29.650 align:middle line:84%
So this particular woman,
who he was interviewing,

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:32.050 align:middle line:90%
had come in as this Viking.

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And she picked one of the two
strongest, meanest, nastiest

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:38.410 align:middle line:90%
bodies on Earth at the time.

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:39.790 align:middle line:90%
So she comes in as a man.

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:41.740 align:middle line:90%
She's extremely strong.

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:46.400 align:middle line:84%
She-- as this Leth the Viking,
he's having lots of sex.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:50.000 align:middle line:84%
He's doing all
kinds of atrocities.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:56.600 align:middle line:84%
And of course, what happens
is, when you do that,

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.180 align:middle line:84%
you will have to come back
in a future lifetime--

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:00.880 align:middle line:84%
if you don't get it
all in one lifetime,

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:03.540 align:middle line:84%
and most of us don't-- you
have to come back in a future

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:07.140 align:middle line:84%
lifetime and redo the pain
that you caused others.

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:09.210 align:middle line:84%
You have to experience
it yourself.

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:10.599 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As a victim?

00:18:10.599 --> 00:18:12.140 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: If you
could call it that.

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:14.460 align:middle line:84%
But you're really only a
victim of your own free will.

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:18.530 align:middle line:84%
You created the cause, and
then the effect returns to you.

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:20.350 align:middle line:84%
So let's think about
this for second.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:24.960 align:middle line:84%
What happens is, you don't get
your karma in the next lifetime

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.650 align:middle line:84%
because you're not
evolved enough.

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And the Cayce reading
said the same thing.

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:30.570 align:middle line:90%
It takes multiple lifetimes.

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:32.044 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes like a
thousand years--

00:18:32.044 --> 00:18:32.835 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To evolve?

00:18:32.835 --> 00:18:35.010 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: --of
reincarnation before you

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:40.150 align:middle line:84%
will be spiritually strong
enough to have your experiences

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:44.390 align:middle line:84%
dealt back to you in a way that
doesn't make you more negative.

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:46.760 align:middle line:84%
So what happened in
her case is that well

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.185 align:middle line:84%
over 1,000 years
later, she reincarnates

00:18:49.185 --> 00:18:55.060 align:middle line:84%
in the 1800s as a little girl
who has her legs essentially

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:58.840 align:middle line:84%
crippled beyond the ability to
ever walk again by falling off

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:00.690 align:middle line:90%
of a horse-drawn carriage.

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And the carriage
wheels go over her legs

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:05.730 align:middle line:84%
and smash them beyond all
recognition and ability

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:07.060 align:middle line:90%
to be healed.

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And in the afterlife,
she didn't understand

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:14.030 align:middle line:90%
why that had to happen to her.

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:16.890 align:middle line:84%
All she knew is that she's
given a choice of these three

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:18.890 align:middle line:84%
different bodies
that she could pick.

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And each one of them has
this big dramatic crisis

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.650 align:middle line:90%
that's going to happen.

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:27.510 align:middle line:84%
So you have to understand
here that when a child dies

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:31.650 align:middle line:84%
at two years old, that might
be a relief for that soul

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:35.380 align:middle line:84%
because maybe they come in and
they get this big karma out

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:37.120 align:middle line:90%
of the way quickly.

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.152 align:middle line:84%
And then they get to
die early and go back.

00:19:39.152 --> 00:19:40.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And go
back and try again.

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:41.380 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: And
now, they're clean.

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And they have a nice
lifetime because they've

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:45.580 align:middle line:90%
dealt with their karma.

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And what you also find is
that people have soul groups.

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:53.390 align:middle line:84%
The typical soul group is
between 15 and 25 people.

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And these are people that we
reincarnate with over and over

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.050 align:middle line:90%
again, lifetime after lifetime.

00:19:58.050 --> 00:19:58.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In your lifetime?

00:19:58.850 --> 00:19:59.210 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Yeah.

00:19:59.210 --> 00:19:59.970 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:01.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I believe that.

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:02.400 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: --the Edgar
Cayce readings, of course--

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your mother,
your sister, your friends?

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.828 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Yeah, the
Edgar Cayce readings

00:20:05.828 --> 00:20:08.080 align:middle line:84%
showed that there
was over 200 people

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:10.950 align:middle line:84%
that he was doing
readings for who

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:12.870 align:middle line:90%
had all been with him before.

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And then his closest core team
had been extensively involved

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:18.540 align:middle line:90%
with him in other lifetimes.

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And of course, as you and I have
discussed on our preview show,

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:24.740 align:middle line:84%
there is a strong and
undeniable resemblance

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:26.120 align:middle line:90%
that I have to Edgar Cayce--

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:26.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.290 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: --that appears
to be a reincarnation.

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:29.860 align:middle line:90%
The face is remarkably similar.

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:31.568 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Give me that
profile look again.

00:20:31.568 --> 00:20:33.340 align:middle line:90%
Yup, absolutely.

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: So in addition
to the facial similarity,

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:40.630 align:middle line:84%
we have a highly bizarre
astronomical alignment,

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:43.810 align:middle line:84%
where the positions of the
planets when he was born

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:46.287 align:middle line:84%
matched so closely with
mine, that I was born in--

00:20:46.287 --> 00:20:47.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, I know.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:47.490 align:middle line:90%
It's uncanny.

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:48.864 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: --the
only time vortex

00:20:48.864 --> 00:20:51.750 align:middle line:84%
in 127 years after he died
where it lines up that way.

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:55.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you would think
that Edgar Cayce's soul would

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.550 align:middle line:90%
not have to come back.

00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:59.890 align:middle line:84%
That he would be at
that perfected level.

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:02.619 align:middle line:90%
So why did he?

00:21:02.619 --> 00:21:04.160 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: There is
some difference--

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were there
some things Edgar

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:06.810 align:middle line:90%
did that we didn't know about?

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:08.590 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Well, we did know.

00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:11.680 align:middle line:84%
You have to remember
everybody loves

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.720 align:middle line:90%
to romanticize their heroes.

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:15.850 align:middle line:84%
Everybody loves to
romanticize the Beatles.

00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:17.440 align:middle line:90%
But John Lennon was a junkie.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.260 align:middle line:84%
And he was really,
really mean to people--

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:19.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, he was.

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:21.130 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: --who were his fans.

00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:24.220 align:middle line:90%
So Edgar Cayce got romanticized.

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:27.480 align:middle line:84%
And the bottom line is we know
that he was a chain smoker.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.910 align:middle line:84%
We know that he
was an alcoholic.

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:32.360 align:middle line:84%
We know that he left
his wife for four years

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.810 align:middle line:84%
and cheated on her when
he went to Texas to look

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:36.960 align:middle line:90%
for oil with his oil buddies.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And that whole oil
thing fell apart.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And the readings
told him that as long

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:44.884 align:middle line:84%
as even one person in the
team wasn't spiritually

00:21:44.884 --> 00:21:47.050 align:middle line:84%
looking for the right
reasons, that the whole effort

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:48.870 align:middle line:90%
would have to be sabotaged.

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:50.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And so he comes back.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.464 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: So he came back.

00:21:51.464 --> 00:21:52.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As you?

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:54.650 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Ostensibly,
yes, as me.

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:58.200 align:middle line:84%
And I had to face
all the same problems

00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.620 align:middle line:90%
that Edgar faced before.

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:02.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you have-- I don't
want to get too personal here

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:05.624 align:middle line:84%
with you-- but did you have
similar issues that Edgar had?

00:22:05.624 --> 00:22:06.540 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Absolutely.

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:07.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You did?

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:08.730 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: And
what's astonishing is

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:10.960 align:middle line:90%
that it's the same people.

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.390 align:middle line:84%
There's a book called "Edgar
Casey's Photographic Legacy."

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:15.330 align:middle line:84%
You look at the
book, and you see--

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:15.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They match--

00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:16.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: --all
of the key people--

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:17.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --the
people in your life?

00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:18.470 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: They all match.

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.970 align:middle line:90%
In fact--

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:19.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uncanny.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.900 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: --there was only
a few that were loose ends.

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And we've identified
almost all of them now.

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:27.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, how do you fix
this, then, for yourself?

00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:33.200 align:middle line:84%
How do you learn from Edgar's
experience into yours?

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.966 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK:
Extraordinary suffering.

00:22:34.966 --> 00:22:36.291 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: [LAUGHS]

00:22:36.291 --> 00:22:36.790 align:middle line:90%


00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:38.614 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: [LAUGHS]

00:22:38.614 --> 00:22:39.530 align:middle line:90%


00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:41.910 align:middle line:90%
I was addicted to marijuana.

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And I did take LSD sometimes
during the ages of 19 to-- no,

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:49.870 align:middle line:90%
I--

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:50.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we getting
true confessions here--

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:51.270 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: --from 15 to 19.

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:52.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --all of a sudden?

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.443 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Yeah, so I had
to go through addiction.

00:22:54.443 --> 00:22:56.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is a first, folks.

00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:58.490 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: I stopped.

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:00.420 align:middle line:84%
I actually have a
sobriety birthday

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:01.879 align:middle line:90%
coming up on September 21st--

00:23:01.879 --> 00:23:02.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Congratulations.

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:06.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: --where I got 22
years-- never getting high,

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:09.440 align:middle line:84%
never getting drunk,
pfft, no smoking.

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:11.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't
even drink coffee.

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:13.747 align:middle line:84%
And Edgar had a
terrible coffee problem.

00:23:13.747 --> 00:23:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And it actually caused him
to have a really severe bowel

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:16.580 align:middle line:90%
problem.

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:17.326 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:23:17.326 --> 00:23:18.950 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Also, it's
important to note

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:20.950 align:middle line:84%
that Edgar's
readings were telling

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:23.350 align:middle line:84%
him to remember his dreams
and write them down every day.

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And he only did it
for about a year.

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:26.870 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing
it constantly ever

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:29.640 align:middle line:90%
since I got sober for 22 years.

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And I came back, and
I had similar talents

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:35.160 align:middle line:84%
as he did with the
intuitive readings.

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:40.170 align:middle line:84%
But I actually ended up using
that as a booster rocket

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:45.300 align:middle line:84%
to take it to the next level
because Edgar proved that you

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:47.820 align:middle line:84%
have an ability-- some
people have an ability,

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:51.650 align:middle line:84%
at least-- to gain access
to omniscient intelligence.

00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:52.897 align:middle line:90%
He proved it 14,000 times.

00:23:52.897 --> 00:23:53.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:56.022 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: He goes into
deep hypnosis, and--

00:23:56.022 --> 00:23:56.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They help him.

00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:59.740 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: --he can diagnose
people's medical conditions

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:01.460 align:middle line:84%
with no trouble
whatsoever, having

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:03.040 align:middle line:90%
only their name and address.

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.230 align:middle line:84%
And yet he knows
what's wrong with them.

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:05.396 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With huge accuracy.

00:24:05.396 --> 00:24:06.960 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Incredible accuracy.

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:10.030 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at it
from that perspective,

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:13.650 align:middle line:84%
you can say, well, if he's
got such a slam dunk here,

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:15.750 align:middle line:84%
then society should
have adjusted to it.

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:17.530 align:middle line:90%
But it didn't.

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:20.710 align:middle line:84%
We go right on with our
heads buried in the sand.

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:21.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm a skeptic.

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:24.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe in all
this woo woo stuff.

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:27.640 align:middle line:84%
So what apparently had to
happen is that I came back,

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:30.370 align:middle line:84%
saw that proving it
intuitively is not enough,

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:33.260 align:middle line:84%
that we got to argue it
in the realm of science.

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:36.800 align:middle line:84%
So although I ended up
repeating the karma of being

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:40.810 align:middle line:84%
a professional psychic reader--
and I did that for seven years,

00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:44.570 align:middle line:84%
from 1998 to 2005--
thanks to guys like you

00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:46.560 align:middle line:84%
and getting so popular,
I had to retire.

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:50.170 align:middle line:84%
I had too many people that
wanted a reading from me.

00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:52.570 align:middle line:84%
Being on your show, you
get your 400 emails,

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:54.480 align:middle line:84%
and it's like, pfft,
what do I do with this?

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:55.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right, you can barely--

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:55.540 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: You know.

00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:56.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --dent it.

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:59.140 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: So I
ended up deciding

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:02.117 align:middle line:84%
that I've got to go off
in a different direction.

00:25:02.117 --> 00:25:04.200 align:middle line:84%
That's when I started to
work on a Hollywood film.

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:06.100 align:middle line:90%
I moved to Los Angeles.

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And that evolved into finding
other ways to have a career

00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:12.360 align:middle line:84%
and make my income
that didn't involve

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:13.943 align:middle line:84%
having to do psychic
readings anymore.

00:25:13.943 --> 00:25:17.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you move on
to the other existence,

00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:20.950 align:middle line:84%
I would assume, then,
that you have advanced

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:24.142 align:middle line:84%
from where Edgar Cayce
was at that point.

00:25:24.142 --> 00:25:26.120 align:middle line:90%
Do you come back again?

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:28.150 align:middle line:90%
Or are you close to the end?

00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:31.140 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: I would hope
that I have gotten it

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:32.740 align:middle line:84%
down enough that I
don't need to have

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:37.250 align:middle line:84%
another flesh-and-blood
physical body incarnation.

00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:39.510 align:middle line:84%
It would appear, based on
the things I'm telling you

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:42.230 align:middle line:84%
about karma, that
in this lifetime,

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:46.430 align:middle line:84%
I have just stacked the
deck with all of the payouts

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:49.800 align:middle line:84%
that I have to do to
balance everything.

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.144 align:middle line:90%
I have had--

00:25:51.144 --> 00:25:52.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm coming
back again, I think.

00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:53.601 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: You've--

00:25:53.601 --> 00:25:54.945 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:25:54.945 --> 00:25:56.280 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: [LAUGHS]

00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:57.614 align:middle line:90%


00:25:57.614 --> 00:25:59.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, as long as
you're OK with that, then

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:03.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm OK with that because
there's nothing intrinsically

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:07.480 align:middle line:84%
wrong with being
in this reality.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.170 align:middle line:90%
It's not hell.

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:10.650 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about
ascension, when

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:14.960 align:middle line:84%
people see me describing this
dimensional shift that we could

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:17.980 align:middle line:84%
go through as a
planet, the key is

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:20.880 align:middle line:84%
all you have to be
is slightly over 50%

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:27.920 align:middle line:84%
loving as opposed to 50%
or more negative and evil.

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:34.540 align:middle line:84%
So if you, George, feel that
you are not, at least, 50% good,

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:37.090 align:middle line:84%
then you could still do
something about that.

00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:39.099 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think I'm
more than 50% good.

00:26:39.099 --> 00:26:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Then you're
probably good to go.

00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:44.684 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But I don't think--
it's good enough to stay.

00:26:44.684 --> 00:26:46.100 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: Well,
here's the thing.

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:48.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are probably a
few more lessons to be learned.

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:49.140 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Oh, absolutely.

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:50.540 align:middle line:90%
And you've got to remember now--

00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:52.415 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Unless, you're
going to tutor me up there,

00:26:52.415 --> 00:26:53.440 align:middle line:90%
that will be different.

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:54.315 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Who knows?

00:26:54.315 --> 00:26:57.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we may have had
reincarnational existences,

00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:57.640 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:59.860 align:middle line:90%
We both have shows on Gaiam TV.

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:02.004 align:middle line:84%
It could be that
we have long been

00:27:02.004 --> 00:27:03.170 align:middle line:90%
in some sort of affiliation.

00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:04.253 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We probably were.

00:27:04.253 --> 00:27:05.610 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Probably were.

00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:07.693 align:middle line:84%
That's why I like you
better without the mustache.

00:27:07.693 --> 00:27:09.886 align:middle line:84%
It reminds me more of
the way you used to look.

00:27:09.886 --> 00:27:11.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: [LAUGHS] In
the other existence.

00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:12.080 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: That's right.

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.000 align:middle line:90%
You had to do it for me.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.835 align:middle line:84%
That's why the angels made
you shave your mustache off.

00:27:14.835 --> 00:27:16.001 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They did, they did.

00:27:16.001 --> 00:27:16.949 align:middle line:90%
It was bizarre.

00:27:16.949 --> 00:27:17.740 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Anyway--

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:19.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was actually
thinking about the show with you

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:20.364 align:middle line:90%
when I did it.

00:27:20.364 --> 00:27:21.280 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Oh, really?

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:21.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:22.740 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: That could be.

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:24.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bzzt, off it went.

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:25.390 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Well, you never know.

00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:26.920 align:middle line:84%
These things could have
greater causality--

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:27.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Karma.

00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:28.560 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: --than you realize.

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:34.330 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, if we see this
progress that we're

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:38.440 align:middle line:84%
making towards the next level,
you don't have to be perfect.

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:43.910 align:middle line:84%
So as long as you feel confident
that you are at least 51%

00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:44.910 align:middle line:90%
positive that you have--

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:45.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, no question.

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:47.038 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: --loving thoughts.

00:27:47.038 --> 00:27:48.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I would think it's 85%.

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:49.860 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: There you go.

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:51.690 align:middle line:90%
So you're good to go.

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:54.530 align:middle line:84%
You've got your boarding
passes for the mother ship.

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:56.171 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You think so?

00:27:56.171 --> 00:27:57.170 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: I believe so.

00:27:57.170 --> 00:27:58.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: God, I wanted one more.

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.385 align:middle line:90%
Just one more shot.

00:28:00.385 --> 00:28:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>>WILCOCK: [LAUGHS]
But the key is,

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:08.250 align:middle line:84%
there is a difference between
what we-- apocryphally

00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:12.480 align:middle line:84%
called the field goal
ascension and the touchdown.

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:17.610 align:middle line:84%
You can kick the field goal by
just being 51% or more loving.

00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:19.680 align:middle line:84%
If you want to go
for the touchdown,

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.720 align:middle line:84%
that's when you get
into the Olympic athlete

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:25.530 align:middle line:84%
stuff of every thought that
you have is a loving thought.

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And you're really
trying to advance.

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:29.550 align:middle line:84%
You do all this
meditative practice.

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And your goal is
total perfection.

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:36.060 align:middle line:90%
That's the rainbow body, George.

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:40.100 align:middle line:84%
That's where you solve
the entire purpose

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:43.300 align:middle line:84%
of your existence
in one incarnation.

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And you literally
become the universe

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:47.850 align:middle line:84%
because you've solved
the whole reason

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:50.830 align:middle line:84%
for why you would
ever have lifetimes.

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:55.190 align:middle line:84%
However, most people go
through this sequentially,

00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:58.580 align:middle line:84%
similar to playing a video game,
and you have different boards.

00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And you go level 3,
level 4, level 5.

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:06.630 align:middle line:84%
So as a planet, humanity is
about to go into level 4, which

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:11.550 align:middle line:84%
is actually a level that you
are allowed to move into as long

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:15.170 align:middle line:84%
as you are slightly
more good than evil.

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And in that level, we are going
to have profound new abilities

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:23.590 align:middle line:84%
that go way beyond
what we can do now.

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:29.390 align:middle line:84%
In the Bible, Jesus says in John
14:9, "As I do these things,

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:32.940 align:middle line:84%
so shall you do these
things and greater things,

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:34.190 align:middle line:90%
for I go on to my Father."

00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:35.773 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It will be
interesting to see

00:29:35.773 --> 00:29:37.530 align:middle line:90%
what happens on the other side.

00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:38.870 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: So that's ascension.

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:43.290 align:middle line:10%
Ascension is this concept
that if you are ready for it

00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:45.300 align:middle line:10%
and you get to
stay here on Earth,

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:48.370 align:middle line:10%
that you become
part of a new game.

00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:53.630 align:middle line:10%
A total rearranging of the
playing field such that what

00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:56.760 align:middle line:10%
we now experience as
our daily existence

00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:00.660 align:middle line:10%
is akin to superheroes
in a Hollywood movie.

00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:04.070 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I believe that
the ongoing ever-increasing

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:07.050 align:middle line:84%
prevalence of people wanting
to see superhero films

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:10.080 align:middle line:84%
and voting with their wallet
is because, subconsciously, we

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:11.790 align:middle line:90%
feel this coming.

00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:13.670 align:middle line:84%
We see that something's
coming our way that's

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:16.746 align:middle line:84%
much more profound than
what our life is like now.

00:30:16.746 --> 00:30:17.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's true.

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:18.690 align:middle line:84%
David, thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:19.898 align:middle line:90%
>>WILCOCK: Thank you, George.

00:30:19.898 --> 00:30:22.430 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Fascinating
discussion with David Wilcock,

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:24.980 align:middle line:10%
whom you can also see
on Gaiam Television.

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:28.370 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and
this is "Beyond Belief."

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:28.870 align:middle line:90%
