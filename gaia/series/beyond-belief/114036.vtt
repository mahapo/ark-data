00:00:05.115 --> 00:00:06.280 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.822 align:middle line:84%
>>And I think many
people today don't

00:00:07.822 --> 00:00:09.029 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:10.690 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.290 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.770 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.610 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:25.232 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.232 --> 00:00:27.190 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.250 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.490 align:middle line:10%
One of the luxuries
of doing this program,

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.280 align:middle line:10%
I get to deal with
some incredible guests.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And we have one for you
tonight, Brad Olsen.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.290 align:middle line:84%
Brad, of course, is an
expert in ancient mysteries

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.870 align:middle line:90%
and he's a publisher.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.150 align:middle line:84%
What kind of books
do you publish, Brad?

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.500 align:middle line:10%
>>BRAD OLSEN: I do
general nonfiction

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.940 align:middle line:10%
as long as they're along the
lines of esoteric subjects,

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.760 align:middle line:10%
sacred places are the books
that I wrote three out

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.110 align:middle line:10%
of four in this series,
and guests that you've

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.810 align:middle line:10%
had on "Coast to Coast,"
like Lon Milo DuQuette did

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.480 align:middle line:10%
"The Key to Solomon's Key," and
Leo Lyon Zagami is our newest

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.610 align:middle line:10%
author at CCC Publishing.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:05.735 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So you're the guy.

00:01:05.735 --> 00:01:06.660 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: I'm the guy.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.547 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
get started doing that?

00:01:08.547 --> 00:01:10.130 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, I
first traveled around

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.240 align:middle line:84%
the world for three
years, saw many

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.820 align:middle line:84%
of these places we're going
to talk about tonight,

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.670 align:middle line:84%
knew that there was a huge
back story behind them that

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.560 align:middle line:90%
really wasn't being reported.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.740 align:middle line:84%
And just through
my love of travel

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.860 align:middle line:84%
and also being an illustrator
and being a published artist

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.520 align:middle line:84%
since junior high, just
got into book publishing

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.260 align:middle line:90%
and stuck with it.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.930 align:middle line:84%
I have a great distributor in
Chicago, Independent Publishers

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.280 align:middle line:84%
Group, and they've
been very supportive

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.690 align:middle line:90%
and just keep it going.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Good for you
because the book industry

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.980 align:middle line:84%
is a tough industry right
now because everybody

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.340 align:middle line:84%
is used to reading quick
little internet lines.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.790 align:middle line:84%
The old days of reading
books, for the young people,

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.100 align:middle line:90%
seems to have waned away.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.947 align:middle line:90%
We need to get that back, Brad.

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:55.780 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: We do, indeed,
and it's unfortunate

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.420 align:middle line:84%
that the millennial
generation doesn't read as

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.280 align:middle line:90%
much as the previous ones did.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.509 align:middle line:84%
But I'll tell you, ebooks have
given us a new fresh boost

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:05.175 align:middle line:90%
in the industry.

00:02:05.175 --> 00:02:10.039 align:middle line:84%
It is a new emerging market
where there once was none.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And quite frankly,
speaking as a publisher,

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.940 align:middle line:84%
you don't have the returns, you
don't have the printing costs,

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.240 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have
warehousing fees.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I used to remember
on book signings I would

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.860 align:middle line:84%
be at a bookstore
and the publisher

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.270 align:middle line:84%
would try to insist, sign all
the books, sign all the books.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.709 align:middle line:84%
I guess once you sign them,
they can't return them, right?

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.250 align:middle line:84%
There's always a
little secret there.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.930 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Little tricks
of the trade, right?

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:36.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, this evolutionism
as a publisher

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.230 align:middle line:84%
has also led you into covering
and writing books on your own

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.590 align:middle line:90%
in incredible places.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.080 align:middle line:84%
How did you get interested
in these ancient mysteries

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.110 align:middle line:90%
and civilizations?

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.080 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well,
right out of college

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.710 align:middle line:84%
I decided to self finance
my own trip around Europe.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.700 align:middle line:84%
I went for three months after
painting houses in college

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.564 align:middle line:84%
and made enough money
to self finance my trip.

00:03:02.564 --> 00:03:03.980 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, a
few of my buddies

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.570 align:middle line:90%
dropped out but I went solo.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.070 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was
doing great, and I

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.890 align:middle line:84%
met these Australians and
Kiwis that said, three months?

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.064 align:middle line:84%
We've been on the road
for three years, mate.

00:03:13.064 --> 00:03:14.230 align:middle line:90%
So I said, how do you do it?

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.110 align:middle line:90%
And they said, work as you go.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And I went to Japan
a few years later,

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.720 align:middle line:84%
taught English,
made enough money

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.930 align:middle line:84%
to finance my own three-year
trip around the world.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And invariably found
myself attracted

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.290 align:middle line:84%
to go into these locations
and learning more about them.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And then down the line,
when the opportunity

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.200 align:middle line:84%
arose to do the books, I
already had that information.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Three years straight?

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:38.410 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yes.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.257 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:03:39.257 --> 00:03:39.840 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you just
went from place to place?

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:42.730 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where did you live?

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.540 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, when
I was in Japan--

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.450 align:middle line:84%
and I include my 14 months
teaching English in Japan

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.400 align:middle line:84%
into that three years-- only
my dad came out to visit me,

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.110 align:middle line:84%
so I hadn't seen any
friends or family

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.569 align:middle line:90%
or anyone for three years.

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And then when I was
on the road, it's

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.630 align:middle line:84%
easy enough to find a guest
house or inexpensive hotel

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:01.310 align:middle line:90%
to stay at.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.472 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Save a few bucks
and off you go, huh?

00:04:03.472 --> 00:04:04.055 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:04:04.055 --> 00:04:07.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's very
inexpensive to travel

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.840 align:middle line:84%
in countries like southeast
Asia, around parts of Africa.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.360 align:middle line:84%
Even some parts of Europe
are fairly inexpensive.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What have you
concluded about this planet

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.640 align:middle line:84%
and these other
locations compared to us

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.160 align:middle line:84%
here in North
America, for example?

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.290 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, my
conclusion is the story

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.390 align:middle line:84%
is incomplete that we're
getting through academia.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.420 align:middle line:84%
We're not getting the true
story of the great pyramids,

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.910 align:middle line:84%
and I know we're going to get
into that, as well as some

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.490 align:middle line:84%
of the other monuments,
especially the megalithic,

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.610 align:middle line:84%
especially the
very old monuments.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.860 align:middle line:84%
There is technology
that has been employed

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.180 align:middle line:84%
in the construction of
many of these monuments

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.030 align:middle line:84%
that modern machinery
and cranes are still not

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.076 align:middle line:90%
capable of handling.

00:04:55.076 --> 00:04:56.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's what's
so baffling, isn't it?

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:57.554 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yes.

00:04:57.554 --> 00:04:59.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when you
talk about the science,

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.340 align:middle line:84%
it's not telling us
or keeping abreast

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.190 align:middle line:84%
of what's been
happening, is it error

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.170 align:middle line:84%
by omission or are they trying
to truly do this on purpose

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.240 align:middle line:90%
and not tell us anything?

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.640 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: It's a little
of both, but it's

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.520 align:middle line:84%
a story that's so big
and encompassing that it

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.800 align:middle line:84%
would truly rewrite
history as we know it.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And just for example,
the way we're

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.880 align:middle line:84%
taught in grammar
school about Columbus

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.720 align:middle line:90%
making this unique discovery.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.250 align:middle line:84%
Columbus, to his
dying day, thought

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.240 align:middle line:84%
he had discovered the
islands off of India.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.046 align:middle line:84%
He never even came to
the conclusion himself

00:05:39.046 --> 00:05:40.420 align:middle line:84%
that he discovered
a new content.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's what he
thought he stumbled across?

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.700 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: To his dying day, yeah.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
they were going for.

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:49.790 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to find a
new route to the spice islands

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:50.909 align:middle line:90%
by going the opposite way.

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:52.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was a long route.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.741 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: It would
have been, but they

00:05:53.741 --> 00:05:55.720 align:middle line:84%
thought the globe was
a lot smaller then

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:02.440 align:middle line:84%
and for the boats that they
sailed in to find islands

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.259 align:middle line:84%
many weeks or months away would
have seemed like they would

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:06.550 align:middle line:90%
have traveled around the world.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.883 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm trying to remember
what three ships he had.

00:06:08.883 --> 00:06:14.507 align:middle line:84%
He had the Santa Maria, he had
the Pinta, and he had one more.

00:06:14.507 --> 00:06:15.590 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Starts with an N.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:16.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Nina.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:17.740 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.405 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which one was he in?

00:06:19.405 --> 00:06:20.530 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: That I'm not sure.

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.840 align:middle line:84%
I think Santa Maria,
but I'm not positive.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.375 align:middle line:84%
And I think they
lost one, as well.

00:06:24.375 --> 00:06:25.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They did lose one.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.370 align:middle line:84%
I think they may have
lost the Santa Maria.

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.520 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Yeah, and that
was the biggest, I believe.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That must have
been an incredible journey.

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:33.370 align:middle line:90%
Brad, can you imagine that?

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:38.244 align:middle line:84%
Traveling, going on and on and
on and not running into land?

00:06:38.244 --> 00:06:39.910 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Or half of
the sailors thinking

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.450 align:middle line:84%
that they're going to fall
off the edge of the Earth.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:42.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Going to go
right over the edge.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:43.826 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Very superstitious.

00:06:43.826 --> 00:06:46.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wonder if
they mutinied at all.

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.310 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Not on that trip,
but I think on others.

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:52.220 align:middle line:84%
Of course, with Captain Bligh,
the mutiny on the Bounty.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.190 align:middle line:90%
There were episodes like that.

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:57.150 align:middle line:84%
But in order to
run an expedition

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.750 align:middle line:84%
of that caliber or
anyone else, you

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.100 align:middle line:84%
had to have a very
disciplined crew.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they resorted
to flogging and very harsh

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.450 align:middle line:84%
disciplinary actions to
keep the sailors in line.

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:12.787 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Favorite
mysteries of the planet.

00:07:12.787 --> 00:07:14.370 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Has to be
the great pyramids.

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:15.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.386 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: There are just so
many unanswered questions

00:07:17.386 --> 00:07:23.120 align:middle line:84%
about that, as well as some
of the other finds in Egypt

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.420 align:middle line:84%
which date many
thousands of years

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.610 align:middle line:84%
earlier than the standard
Egyptologists are

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:31.830 align:middle line:90%
having us to believe.

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:33.340 align:middle line:90%
This is an ancient culture.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.110 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
could go all the way back

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.440 align:middle line:84%
to even the survivors
of Atlantis.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.112 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is one of the
most fascinating aspects,

00:07:41.112 --> 00:07:43.070 align:middle line:84%
I think, too, I agree
with you, on this planet.

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:45.430 align:middle line:84%
We've got a video here
of the Great Pyramid

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:47.250 align:middle line:90%
so let's take a look.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:48.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: Building
the Great Pyramid

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:51.070 align:middle line:90%
was an astonishing achievement.

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.620 align:middle line:84%
There are eight major
feats of engineering

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:54.770 align:middle line:90%
involved in the building.

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:57.610 align:middle line:90%


00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:01.430 align:middle line:84%
First the builders leveled the
ground and cut a 6,000-hectare

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:05.420 align:middle line:84%
bedrock to fit many
strangely shaped slabs,

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.419 align:middle line:90%
each one as heavy as a car.

00:08:07.419 --> 00:08:20.630 align:middle line:90%


00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:26.650 align:middle line:10%
Second, they carried 130
granite blocks over 500 miles.

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:31.160 align:middle line:84%
Each block weighed
between 12 and 70 tons.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:36.150 align:middle line:84%
The blocks were hauled up to 210
feet, an achievement which even

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:39.510 align:middle line:90%
today would be a challenge.

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:43.360 align:middle line:84%
Third, the Great Pyramid has
three chambers inside it.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.850 align:middle line:84%
With breathtaking
precision, the builders

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:49.750 align:middle line:84%
cut a passage through the
solid rock 300 feet long

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:54.640 align:middle line:84%
by three feet wide to
reach the lowest chamber.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Brad, truly
an incredible feat,

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.060 align:middle line:90%
building those great pyramids.

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:01.600 align:middle line:90%
Truly remarkable.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.650 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Absolutely,
and inexplicable.

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:09.440 align:middle line:84%
How were they able to get 70-ton
granite finely cut blocks--

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 500 miles.

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:12.760 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --transported
to this site

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:16.610 align:middle line:84%
and then 300 feet
up into the complex?

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:18.920 align:middle line:84%
They tried to build
a small replica

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.790 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Pyramid in
Japan a few years ago,

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:22.890 align:middle line:90%
failed miserably.

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:24.400 align:middle line:90%
Couldn't even finish it.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Even with
today's modern technology?

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:27.250 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And then you look at
some of the hewn stones

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.100 align:middle line:84%
at Baalbek in Lebanon, not
too far away from Egypt.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:36.560 align:middle line:84%
They don't even have a crane
today that could lift those.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.930 align:middle line:84%
So what we're looking at is
some kind of lost technology.

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:43.450 align:middle line:84%
I think it was done with
auditive levitation, which

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:45.400 align:middle line:84%
is matching the
frequency of the block

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.100 align:middle line:84%
itself, rendering it
weightless, and then

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.536 align:middle line:90%
able to move it into place.

00:09:49.536 --> 00:09:51.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How come we've
lost that technology?

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:53.050 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:54.640 align:middle line:90%
Or was it ever ours?

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.370 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: If there was
a civilization that

00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:58.830 align:middle line:84%
had this kind of
technology, that

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:02.730 align:middle line:84%
built these kind of monuments,
clearly a lot of resources

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:04.820 align:middle line:84%
went into building
the Great Pyramid.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.300 align:middle line:90%
That has been lost.

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.640 align:middle line:84%
We don't do those
kind of things today.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And clearly we went
into a dark age.

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:14.074 align:middle line:84%
We went into a
very savage period.

00:10:14.074 --> 00:10:15.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something happened.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.698 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Yeah,
where they were just

00:10:16.698 --> 00:10:20.320 align:middle line:84%
wars and knowledge was lost and
then things started rebuilding.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.392 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Cataclysms?

00:10:21.392 --> 00:10:23.100 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: You could
consider that as well.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:24.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wiping
out civilizations.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
pyramids might be much

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:28.910 align:middle line:90%
older than most people think.

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:30.150 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:33.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, we know about the Sphynx
having the weather pattern

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:36.590 align:middle line:84%
dating on the sides
that could have only

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:38.540 align:middle line:90%
been created by water.

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've been to
Egypt and it's very much

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.250 align:middle line:90%
a giant desert out there.

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:44.270 align:middle line:90%
There is no water.

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:46.329 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, Mars is
now a giant desert, too.

00:10:46.329 --> 00:10:47.370 align:middle line:90%
Look what happened there.

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:49.120 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: What does
that tell you?

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:52.120 align:middle line:84%
And so if we look at
the dating of the Sphynx

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:55.650 align:middle line:84%
going back 10,000,
perhaps 12,000 years,

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:59.440 align:middle line:84%
it would be logical to conclude
that the whole Giza complex was

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.670 align:middle line:90%
created around the same time.

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:03.980 align:middle line:84%
So then we're looking
at Egyptologists

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:08.890 align:middle line:84%
tell us 3,000 BCE, we're now
looking a more like 10,000,

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:11.140 align:middle line:84%
12,000, and then even
some of the artifacts

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:18.170 align:middle line:84%
that have been found in some
of the tombs, 30,000 years BCE.

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:20.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With apparently
no technology?

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:21.680 align:middle line:90%
I can't believe it.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.670 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Or using copper
tools to finely cut

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:28.020 align:middle line:84%
granite, which is one of
the hardest stones there is.

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:31.770 align:middle line:84%
But not only that, they've
found other stones not too far

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:37.160 align:middle line:84%
from the Giza Plateau that
show expert planing abilities,

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.197 align:middle line:90%
laser cut--

00:11:38.197 --> 00:11:39.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can't put a razor--

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:40.370 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Can't even do that.

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:41.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --between them.

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:42.520 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: There
are some capstones

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.140 align:middle line:84%
that I saw on the
Great Pyramid that

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:47.124 align:middle line:84%
were buried under the sand
that have been recovered,

00:11:47.124 --> 00:11:48.290 align:middle line:90%
and you're absolutely right.

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:49.600 align:middle line:90%
I tried to do it.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.420 align:middle line:84%
We tried to put a piece of
paper or an ID card through it,

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.060 align:middle line:90%
can't do it.

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:54.122 align:middle line:90%
They're that finely--

00:11:54.122 --> 00:11:54.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Precise.

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:55.570 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Precise.

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:56.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gosh.

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:59.980 align:middle line:84%
The architecture work
must have been incredible

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:03.400 align:middle line:84%
even before they started the
building because these things,

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.450 align:middle line:84%
you just don't say, hey,
let's cut some block

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:08.230 align:middle line:90%
and let's put it in place.

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:12.070 align:middle line:84%
You've got it planned out,
you've got it sketched out.

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:14.590 align:middle line:90%
I wonder where those plans are.

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:17.120 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if they're in
the Hall of Records.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: We've got to get
down below the great pyramids.

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:23.560 align:middle line:84%
It's a honeycomb of
chambers down there.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:28.420 align:middle line:84%
When I was there in March '97,
they had just-- I'm sorry,

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:32.700 align:middle line:84%
March '93-- they had just had
that guy, Rudolf Gantenbrink,

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:34.280 align:middle line:84%
who had the little
robot that went--

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That drilled
a little hole?

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:37.060 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yep.

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And they were also doing sonar
scanning of the Giza Plateau

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.560 align:middle line:84%
and found that it's
like Swiss cheese.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.040 align:middle line:90%
There are chambers everywhere.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.829 align:middle line:84%
But you ask Zahi
Hawass, who's in charge

00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:48.870 align:middle line:90%
of Egyptian antiquities--

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:50.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At least he was.

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:51.760 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:55.800 align:middle line:84%
They'll say, oh, there's maybe
a couple of tombs or chambers

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:59.710 align:middle line:84%
here and there, but now what's
described by these people that

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:00.760 align:middle line:90%
did the sonar scanning.

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And then when they tried to
come back in and follow up,

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:05.310 align:middle line:84%
they weren't granted
the permits to do it.

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:07.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I tried to interview
Zahi Hawass on "Coast

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:12.480 align:middle line:84%
to Coast," Brad, and the mere
thought that Egyptians didn't

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.540 align:middle line:84%
do this or it was done
with high technology

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.580 align:middle line:84%
or maybe even the
alien technology,

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:21.460 align:middle line:84%
he don't want anything
to do with it at all.

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:22.520 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: None at all.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:25.660 align:middle line:84%
And he goes around the
world poo-pooing anyone

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:30.560 align:middle line:84%
who has theories that not
only Egyptian antiquities are

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.660 align:middle line:84%
anything older than
3,000 BCE, but even

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:38.210 align:middle line:84%
like the Bosnian pyramids,
that they do research

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:38.940 align:middle line:90%
every summer in.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:42.520 align:middle line:84%
They've found a network of
tunnels under those pyramids.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.570 align:middle line:84%
He says they were
just coincidence

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:46.640 align:middle line:84%
or maybe they're
just water chambers.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This principle
of levitation,

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.060 align:middle line:84%
how do you think it
was accomplished?

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:54.120 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, I
feature the story

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:58.790 align:middle line:84%
of a Swedish physician
who is invited

00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:01.500 align:middle line:90%
to go to Tibet in the 1930s.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.070 align:middle line:84%
I've featured in my
book, "Future Esoteric."

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And he was allowed to see
how the Tibetans moved

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:10.520 align:middle line:90%
giant blocks.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And basically, and I
even have the diagrams,

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:14.880 align:middle line:84%
I reprinted them in
"Future Esoteric,"

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:19.170 align:middle line:84%
they created three
semicircles of the monks.

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:23.220 align:middle line:84%
Some were playing drums,
others on trumpets,

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:24.300 align:middle line:90%
and others were chanting.

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:24.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So sound resonance.

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:26.350 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Sound resonance.

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:28.730 align:middle line:84%
And once the sound
got loud enough, it

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:32.150 align:middle line:84%
was a cacophony of sound, and
everybody's attention went up

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:34.710 align:middle line:84%
with the trumpets, the
block in the center of them

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:37.140 align:middle line:84%
also rose and went
right into place.

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:38.026 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:14:38.026 --> 00:14:39.150 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: And he went back--

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:41.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Once they reached a
certain kind of sound level.

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:42.790 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Correct.

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:45.030 align:middle line:84%
Which would have been a
cacophony of sound that

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:48.060 align:middle line:84%
would have just made you put
your hands over your ears

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:48.889 align:middle line:90%
it was so loud.

00:14:48.889 --> 00:14:50.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do they direct it?

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:56.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean because if the sound
is emitting everywhere,

00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:59.420 align:middle line:84%
what was to keep them from
floating and things like that?

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:02.782 align:middle line:84%
So they must of have a directed
pulse of this somewhere.

00:15:02.782 --> 00:15:03.490 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Correct.

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the human
consciousness plays a factor.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Because when they were
ready to move the stone,

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.000 align:middle line:84%
the trumpets started
going up and then

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.780 align:middle line:84%
all of the monks heads started
going up and just at the same--

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:17.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the
blocks went up, right?

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:18.746 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: That's right.

00:15:18.746 --> 00:15:23.900 align:middle line:84%
So I think if you have
a whole monastery filled

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:28.580 align:middle line:84%
with Buddha-like
conscious monks,

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:33.840 align:middle line:84%
they have some power of their
mind that can move objects.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you better
be playing it continuously

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:38.910 align:middle line:90%
or it would drop, wouldn't it?

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:40.640 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Well, yeah.

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.060 align:middle line:84%
It could if you just
stopped and let it go.

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:45.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you simply
stop playing or creating

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:48.480 align:middle line:84%
that kind of sound vibration,
these things would just plop.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:51.259 align:middle line:84%
That's how they probably
put them in place, right?

00:15:51.259 --> 00:15:53.550 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: They got them up to
a ledge and then they were

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:55.020 align:middle line:90%
wincing them from that point--

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:55.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:56.940 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --according to
this eyewitnesses testimony.

00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:58.939 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then they
just probably slowed down

00:15:58.939 --> 00:16:00.810 align:middle line:90%
on the music and down it came.

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:01.850 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:02.740 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:06.100 align:middle line:84%
There was an individual
at Coral Castle in Florida

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:08.540 align:middle line:84%
by the name of
Edward Leedskalnin.

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And Edward said
once, and I'm going

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:13.890 align:middle line:84%
to have you describe
Coral Castle-- we'll even

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:17.825 align:middle line:84%
look at a video-- that he knew
the secret of the pyramids.

00:16:17.825 --> 00:16:18.450 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Right.

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So let's look at
this video on Coral Castle

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:22.800 align:middle line:90%
and then let's talk about that.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:23.925 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:16:23.925 --> 00:16:26.400 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:53.160 align:middle line:90%


00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:54.890 align:middle line:84%
Brad, an incredible
piece of video

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:58.980 align:middle line:84%
that showed Edward Leedskalnin,
who was a little man, and Coral

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:01.380 align:middle line:84%
Castle, these huge
blocks of stone

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:05.589 align:middle line:90%
that he made and built himself.

00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:07.800 align:middle line:90%
He had no help.

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:14.190 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, I'm told
that several small boys peered

00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:16.869 align:middle line:84%
at him one night
as he was working

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:20.034 align:middle line:84%
and witnessed him levitating
stones and blocks.

00:17:20.034 --> 00:17:20.950 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: That's right.

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:22.369 align:middle line:90%
And he was very secretive.

00:17:22.369 --> 00:17:24.470 align:middle line:84%
He would not allow
anyone to work.

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:28.720 align:middle line:84%
The only witnesses were, as
you described, some local boys.

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's very
interesting to point out

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:35.680 align:middle line:84%
that Coral Castle is the only
modern megalithic structure

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.100 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:39.700 align:middle line:84%
We have megalithic structures
on just about every continent

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:41.750 align:middle line:84%
of the world, none
of them have been

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:45.490 align:middle line:84%
created in the last few hundred
years except Coral Castle.

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And as you said, he
would only give the clue

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.260 align:middle line:84%
that he knew the secrets
of the ancient Egyptians,

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:56.650 align:middle line:84%
meaning that he must have
been either reincarnated

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:58.440 align:middle line:84%
with some kind of
memory or maybe

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.630 align:middle line:84%
had some ancient texts
in his possession--

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:02.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or somebody
gave him something.

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:04.136 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Or somebody
gave him something.

00:18:04.136 --> 00:18:05.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was an
expert in magnetics

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:09.560 align:middle line:84%
and he wrote a book on
magnetics, a real small one.

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.870 align:middle line:84%
I've got it in one
of my libraries.

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And he had said in
the book that it's not

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:19.200 align:middle line:84%
just metal that
is magnetized, it

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:24.090 align:middle line:84%
is any substance that you
can create polarity for.

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:27.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm beginning to wonder if he
used that to move those blocks.

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:30.590 align:middle line:84%
He also had a machine
there that nobody

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:34.020 align:middle line:84%
could figure out how it worked
because it was in pieces.

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:37.070 align:middle line:84%
I guess somebody must have
raided the place after he died

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:38.040 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.350 align:middle line:84%
But he may have been
able use that machine

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:42.380 align:middle line:90%
to move the blocks, as well.

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:46.710 align:middle line:84%
He moved from an area of
Florida to Homestead, Florida,

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:50.997 align:middle line:84%
and there was a story once
that a flatbed truck came by

00:18:50.997 --> 00:18:53.330 align:middle line:84%
and he was going to load the
blocks of stone-- these are

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:59.576 align:middle line:84%
huge, tons and tons-- and the
truck driver said, where's

00:18:59.576 --> 00:19:00.075 align:middle line:90%
your help?

00:19:00.075 --> 00:19:01.480 align:middle line:90%
I mean what's going on here?

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:03.930 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh, you just
go away for a little bit.

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:07.370 align:middle line:84%
You come back in a few hours,
it'll be loaded and ready.

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:09.410 align:middle line:90%
And he went, yeah, right.

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:11.320 align:middle line:90%
He did, he want away.

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:15.210 align:middle line:84%
Truck driver comes back
and all the blocks of stone

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:17.170 align:middle line:84%
are loaded on this
flatbed truck.

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:19.792 align:middle line:84%
How in the heck did Edward
Leedskalnin do that?

00:19:19.792 --> 00:19:22.000 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And he was just a
little guy, like you said,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.810 align:middle line:90%
99 pounds and very slight frame.

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:28.220 align:middle line:84%
Certainly not with muscle
power, that's for sure.

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:29.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Even if there
were 10 guys there.

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:31.330 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: No.

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:33.920 align:middle line:84%
Or even with his
cranes and winches,

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:37.870 align:middle line:84%
how do you get megalithic blocks
off the ground onto a flatbed?

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And then he would say,
park the truck there,

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:42.690 align:middle line:84%
I'll have it empty for
you in the morning.

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:44.070 align:middle line:90%
Sure enough, he would.

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:47.390 align:middle line:84%
Not only would he have
the flatbed offloaded,

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:49.280 align:middle line:84%
but the bricks would
be up in place.

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:51.400 align:middle line:84%
These giant blocks would
be up on the wall where

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.150 align:middle line:90%
he wanted to position them.

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:56.780 align:middle line:84%
So Coral Castle is clearly
one of the greatest mysteries

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:57.380 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:58.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It truly is.

00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:59.960 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And I certainly feature
it in "Sacred Places North

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:00.459 align:middle line:90%
America."

00:20:00.459 --> 00:20:03.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He left Eastern Europe
to come to the United States

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:07.760 align:middle line:84%
and I believe he waited for his
love of his life to join him

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:11.610 align:middle line:84%
and built Coral Castle
in her remembrance

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:13.220 align:middle line:90%
in his love for her.

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:14.840 align:middle line:90%
She never showed up, did she?

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:15.340 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: No.

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:16.885 align:middle line:90%
His sweet 16, he called her.

00:20:16.885 --> 00:20:17.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Agnes.

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:18.160 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yes.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And she probably had no idea
that he built this whole thing

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:23.970 align:middle line:90%
in her honor.

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:26.804 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wonder if he
died a sad man, Brad.

00:20:26.804 --> 00:20:28.470 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: They say he
died brokenhearted.

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:30.610 align:middle line:90%
He was certainly a loner.

00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:33.770 align:middle line:84%
He always worked alone, he
insisted on always being alone,

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:35.930 align:middle line:84%
usually under the
cover of darkness.

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And you would also quarry
the stones himself, as well.

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:42.685 align:middle line:84%
How he was able to cut them to
be able to fit so precisely--

00:20:42.685 --> 00:20:43.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And move them.

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --and move them
is just a profound mystery.

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:50.032 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I know the
secrets of the pyramid.

00:20:50.032 --> 00:20:51.240 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: How they built them.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isn't that amazing,
because he did the same thing--

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:56.876 align:middle line:84%
much smaller level,
but he did it.

00:20:56.876 --> 00:20:57.610 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:20:57.610 --> 00:20:58.240 align:middle line:90%
He sure did.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And took it
with him to the grave.

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:00.760 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: He did, indeed.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:04.000 align:middle line:84%
And if there were any regrets
about the Coral Castle,

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.780 align:middle line:84%
it would be why couldn't he
have just told us how he did it?

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:10.150 align:middle line:84%
But again, maybe he was
employing technology

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:13.250 align:middle line:84%
that was used by the
ancients to build

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:16.310 align:middle line:84%
many of these megalithic
sites around the world.

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:19.580 align:middle line:84%
And maybe he didn't feel
we were ready for it.

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:20.664 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are we ready now?

00:21:20.664 --> 00:21:21.663 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: I think we are.

00:21:21.663 --> 00:21:22.740 align:middle line:90%
We're talking about it.

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:24.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:25.515 align:middle line:90%
Have you been there?

00:21:25.515 --> 00:21:27.140 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I've been
very close to there.

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:30.220 align:middle line:84%
My dad was just there when
I sent him on a mission

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:32.360 align:middle line:84%
to collect some information
and he came back

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.770 align:middle line:84%
with everything they
owned in the book store.

00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:36.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's owned
by a couple now

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:39.410 align:middle line:84%
and I guess they use it
as a little tourist resort

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:40.910 align:middle line:90%
area for people.

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:42.989 align:middle line:90%
And I hope they're doing well.

00:21:42.989 --> 00:21:43.780 align:middle line:90%
It's a great place.

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:45.500 align:middle line:84%
I haven't been
there, but if I ever

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:48.289 align:middle line:84%
get down to Homestead, Florida,
definitely it's on my list.

00:21:48.289 --> 00:21:50.580 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Just outside of
Miami on your way to the Keys.

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:51.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's fascinating.

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.830 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yes

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:52.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's fascinating.

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:55.490 align:middle line:84%
And again, those
pictures of him--

00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:58.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean he was just a very
small, frail little guy.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.060 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:01.180 align:middle line:84%
If we could set the time
machine back 100 years,

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:03.360 align:middle line:84%
George, we should go
back and interview him.

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are other
places on this planet,

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:10.930 align:middle line:84%
ancient places like Stonehenge,
that are equally baffling.

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:12.460 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a peek.

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:14.940 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:31.830 align:middle line:90%


00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: Stonehenge
is the most important

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:38.750 align:middle line:84%
prehistoric monument in Europe,
perhaps the whole world.

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:41.970 align:middle line:84%
Its impressive design and
meticulous construction

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:45.460 align:middle line:90%
are unmatched anywhere.

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:48.840 align:middle line:84%
Located in southwest
England, its stone circles

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:52.200 align:middle line:84%
were made from 160
enormous megaliths,

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:55.520 align:middle line:84%
some weighing over
50 tons and measuring

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:58.120 align:middle line:90%
over six meters in height.

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:01.170 align:middle line:84%
The sheer magnitude of
a structure so ancient

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:02.270 align:middle line:90%
defies belief.

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:06.440 align:middle line:90%


00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:09.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: OK, Brad, how
do you explain that one?

00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Another megalithic
site, very, very old.

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:14.060 align:middle line:10%
We know this is of
the Neolithic era.

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:17.390 align:middle line:10%
And with the amount
of stones that

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:20.840 align:middle line:10%
were used in their
creation, including there

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:24.290 align:middle line:10%
is an outer ring of what they
call the blue stones, which

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:25.980 align:middle line:10%
came from Wales.

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:29.500 align:middle line:84%
Again we're talking
about a huge effort

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:34.610 align:middle line:84%
to transport the stones to the
site and then use them in a way

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:39.670 align:middle line:84%
that the earliest Christian
people who saw them

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:41.560 align:middle line:84%
thought it was used
for devil worship.

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.360 align:middle line:84%
So what we see at
Stonehenge today

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.760 align:middle line:84%
is a mere shell of
what it used to be.

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And many of the megaliths,
including almost all

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:51.660 align:middle line:90%
of the blue stones, are lost.

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:55.580 align:middle line:84%
But archaeoastronomers are
able to use what's left

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:58.650 align:middle line:84%
and find out that
Stonehenge is actually

00:23:58.650 --> 00:24:01.640 align:middle line:84%
a very accurate
calendar, which can

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:06.420 align:middle line:84%
predict the rising of the summer
solstice as well as the sunset.

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And if you were an
ancient shaman who

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:13.730 align:middle line:84%
was in charge of the
well-being of your people--

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:16.800 align:middle line:84%
and this is also very similar
to the medicine wheels in North

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:22.080 align:middle line:84%
America, which also denote
the solstice lines-- when

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:26.500 align:middle line:84%
your tribe is meant to
migrate or plant the seeds,

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:30.030 align:middle line:84%
having a knowledge of when
the seasons are coming around

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:32.870 align:middle line:84%
and even, for star
gazing purposes,

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:35.840 align:middle line:84%
would be highly
beneficial to your role

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.280 align:middle line:90%
as a shaman in this tribe.

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:40.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What baffles
me, not only just looking

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:44.120 align:middle line:84%
at the size of those stones,
but the fact that they

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:47.570 align:middle line:84%
were able to layer them
on top and go around.

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:50.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean how did they
get them up there?

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:51.559 align:middle line:90%
It makes no sense.

00:24:51.559 --> 00:24:52.600 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: A great mystery.

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps once
again, we're talking

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:57.130 align:middle line:84%
about auditive levitation
as a technique.

00:24:57.130 --> 00:25:00.710 align:middle line:84%
And they did show in the
video the little dimple on top

00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:03.840 align:middle line:84%
and the other sarsen
stones would fit in

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:06.210 align:middle line:90%
and would match the dimple.

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:09.230 align:middle line:84%
So they obviously knew
what they were doing enough

00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:12.650 align:middle line:84%
to prefabricate the
stones before they went

00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:17.020 align:middle line:84%
to the step of placing them in
the right order of where they

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:17.830 align:middle line:90%
needed to be.

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:21.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Throughout this
planet, historically

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:25.150 align:middle line:84%
there was incredible
technology and knowledge.

00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:26.570 align:middle line:90%
It's gone.

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:27.070 align:middle line:90%
It's gone.

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Even with the greatest
minds of today,

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:31.910 align:middle line:84%
with the computers, with
everything we have, Brad,

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:35.950 align:middle line:84%
we can't figure out
how they did it.

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:38.760 align:middle line:90%
We can't do it today.

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.410 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: What happened was
there was a great loss of--

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:44.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something happened.

00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:47.170 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --of information
that we're only now starting

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:52.060 align:middle line:84%
to collect and recreate,
such as at Stonehenge

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:53.980 align:middle line:84%
they now realize that
there were avenues

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:56.370 align:middle line:84%
that lead into it all
the way to Avebury,

00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:59.260 align:middle line:84%
where there's another
great stone circle.

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:02.540 align:middle line:84%
There is the West
Kennet Long Barrow,

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:04.750 align:middle line:84%
which is another
megalithic site,

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:09.800 align:middle line:84%
conveniently called a tomb,
as many of the dolmans

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:14.600 align:middle line:84%
around Europe and even some in
North America are said to be.

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:18.620 align:middle line:84%
But I would say they had a
larger function, especially

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:22.430 align:middle line:84%
when the summer solstice shines
right through the cavity.

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:26.500 align:middle line:84%
Or in the case of Newgrange,
Ireland, on the winter solstice

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:28.350 align:middle line:84%
shines right through,
the only day,

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:30.750 align:middle line:84%
and illuminates a
triple spiral carving

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:32.427 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the recess.

00:26:32.427 --> 00:26:34.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Great
positioning, wasn't it?

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:34.593 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:26:34.593 --> 00:26:36.080 align:middle line:90%
They had to have known.

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:39.480 align:middle line:84%
It had to have been built
around this very auspicious day.

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:40.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, that's not luck.

00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:42.010 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: No.

00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:43.710 align:middle line:90%
It goes beyond that.

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:46.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if civilizations
are like Michael Cremo

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:49.050 align:middle line:84%
says, hundreds of
millions of years

00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:52.310 align:middle line:84%
old, hundreds of
millions of years old?

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:57.760 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that they had
incredible technology then

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:01.840 align:middle line:84%
from ancients who
were very modernistic

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:06.984 align:middle line:84%
and then as calamities occurred,
we lost that knowledge?

00:27:06.984 --> 00:27:09.150 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, then we're
talking about antediluvian

00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:11.490 align:middle line:84%
civilizations here
on Earth that may

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:16.920 align:middle line:84%
have been planted from
extraterrestrial progenitors.

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:19.290 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
not only Atlantis,

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:23.160 align:middle line:84%
but before that Lemuria and,
according to Madame Blavatsky,

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:27.180 align:middle line:84%
as I illustrate in
"Modern Esoteric,"

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:29.760 align:middle line:84%
there were even farther
back civilizations.

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.970 align:middle line:84%
So what Cremo said very
much could be true.

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And the evidence is
in the archaeology.

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:38.340 align:middle line:84%
Some of this archaeology
is even underwater,

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:40.390 align:middle line:90%
such as the site off of Japan.

00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:43.020 align:middle line:84%
There are these megalithic
stones carved right

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:44.620 align:middle line:90%
into the rock.

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And you have a
pyramid on Java island

00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:50.320 align:middle line:84%
which appears to
be very, very old,

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:53.500 align:middle line:90%
washed over by a tidal wave.

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:57.040 align:middle line:84%
I could go on and on,
but a lot of evidence

00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:00.260 align:middle line:84%
that a high
civilization, or several,

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:01.580 align:middle line:90%
existed on this planet.

00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:04.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to show,
Brad, everybody your book,

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:08.910 align:middle line:84%
"Modern Esoteric," that you
published and put together

00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:10.770 align:middle line:90%
yourself.

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:13.160 align:middle line:90%
A great job.

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:17.500 align:middle line:84%
As you were putting it together,
what one thing in the book

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.757 align:middle line:90%
just truly baffled you?

00:28:19.757 --> 00:28:21.590 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, "Modern
Esoteric" pretty much

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:24.170 align:middle line:84%
picks up where the "Sacred
Places" books leave off

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:27.230 align:middle line:84%
because some of these
mysteries are just so much

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:32.100 align:middle line:84%
greater than illustrating
108 locations on two or three

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:35.070 align:middle line:84%
pages, especially, as
we've been discussing,

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:38.640 align:middle line:84%
the Great Pyramid and some
of the Megalithic sites.

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.700 align:middle line:84%
But I think the
big takeaway for me

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:44.200 align:middle line:84%
when I was researching and
writing "Modern Esoteric" was

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:47.770 align:middle line:84%
the fact that, again,
history is not giving us

00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:51.290 align:middle line:84%
a complete picture of the
real human experience,

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:55.920 align:middle line:84%
that there is evidence that
is right there in plain sight

00:28:55.920 --> 00:29:01.070 align:middle line:84%
that we can utilize to
paint a mosaic picture that

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:04.990 align:middle line:84%
is much bigger and much
more complete and much older

00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:07.010 align:middle line:84%
than anybody's
given it credit for,

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:09.040 align:middle line:84%
except for people like
Michael Cremo and others.

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:10.956 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wouldn't you
have loved to have lived

00:29:10.956 --> 00:29:13.067 align:middle line:90%
during this era as a witness?

00:29:13.067 --> 00:29:14.150 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Maybe we all did.

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:14.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My gosh.

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:15.460 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:16.790 align:middle line:90%
There's an area in Europe.

00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:20.200 align:middle line:84%
There's a cathedral there
called Chartres Cathedral, which

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:22.796 align:middle line:84%
is also equally
baffling, is it not?

00:29:22.796 --> 00:29:23.670 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Well, it is.

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And while this is the
newest of the sites

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:31.940 align:middle line:84%
we're discussing, because it
is a Gothic cathedral mixed

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:33.570 align:middle line:90%
with elements of Romanesque.

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:36.020 align:middle line:84%
That's what makes
Chartres so interesting

00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:38.680 align:middle line:84%
is one of the towers
is Romanesque,

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:40.540 align:middle line:90%
the other is Gothic.

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:42.800 align:middle line:84%
It was built by the
Knights Templar,

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:45.620 align:middle line:84%
who were coming back
from the Holy Land

00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:47.740 align:middle line:90%
with many, many secrets.

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:49.670 align:middle line:84%
What's so terribly
interesting about Chartres

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:52.170 align:middle line:84%
and many other of the
sacred places in Europe

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:55.430 align:middle line:84%
and elsewhere that I
illustrate in my books is they

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:59.040 align:middle line:84%
were built upon
much older sites--

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:04.520 align:middle line:84%
pagan sites, earlier
churches, even natural wells

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:07.620 align:middle line:84%
or caves or features
in the landscape.

00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:09.510 align:middle line:84%
So if we're talking
about going back,

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:13.060 align:middle line:84%
George, if we could look at
the world before development,

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:14.980 align:middle line:84%
I think with our
naked eye we'd be

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:17.830 align:middle line:84%
able to discern
that spot over there

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:19.990 align:middle line:84%
is much more interesting
than this spot here.

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:22.840 align:middle line:84%
Let's build our little
pagan shrine here

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:26.620 align:middle line:84%
and then other people come
and that spot stays important.

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:29.680 align:middle line:84%
And next thing you know, you
have a cathedral and a town

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:31.050 align:middle line:90%
that's built up around it.

00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:32.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Surely amazing.

00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:35.049 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at
Chartres Cathedral.

00:30:35.049 --> 00:30:37.510 align:middle line:90%

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:38.010 align:middle line:90%


00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:40.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: Over 800
years ago, Europe's

00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:43.070 align:middle line:84%
first Gothic cathedrals
rose from the dust

00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:45.670 align:middle line:84%
of the Middle Ages,
great monuments

00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:48.600 align:middle line:90%
to God and the Virgin Mary.

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:51.170 align:middle line:84%
Erected at a time when
all of Western Europe

00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:53.440 align:middle line:84%
was Roman Catholic,
the cathedrals

00:30:53.440 --> 00:31:00.050 align:middle line:84%
came to symbolize both faith in
God and pride in the community.

00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:01.990 align:middle line:84%
So it was that in
the early Middle

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:06.570 align:middle line:84%
Ages, a small town in France
banded together and created

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:08.920 align:middle line:84%
one of the greatest
Christian sanctuaries

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:11.266 align:middle line:90%
the world has ever known.

00:31:11.266 --> 00:31:14.050 align:middle line:84%
In many ways, it
would set the standard

00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:17.050 align:middle line:84%
for all Gothic
cathedrals to come.

00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:19.410 align:middle line:90%
This is our Lady of Chartres.

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:21.890 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:31.830 align:middle line:90%


00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:35.380 align:middle line:84%
Chartres Cathedral stands on
a hill above the river Eure

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:40.950 align:middle line:84%
in the town of Chartres, some
56 miles southwest of Paris.

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:44.740 align:middle line:84%
Its spires rise like
beacons on the horizon

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:49.380 align:middle line:90%
and can be seen from miles away.

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:52.970 align:middle line:10%
Today its majestic
carved towers and facades

00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:56.380 align:middle line:10%
project a medieval
splendor in what has become

00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:59.750 align:middle line:10%
an increasingly modern time.

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And you can come
here today, just

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:03.675 align:middle line:84%
as people have for
hundreds of years,

00:32:03.675 --> 00:32:06.580 align:middle line:90%
to worship and to marvel.

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Brad, another
modern miracle I think.

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:12.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean that was absolutely
a gorgeous structure.

00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:13.870 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: It really is, George.

00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:17.380 align:middle line:84%
And I had the great
opportunity of touring it

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:19.320 align:middle line:90%
for a full day inside and out.

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:20.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it huge?

00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:21.298 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Oh, it's huge.

00:32:21.298 --> 00:32:24.240 align:middle line:84%
There are bigger Gothic
cathedrals elsewhere,

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.170 align:middle line:84%
but this one is so
unique because it

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:30.710 align:middle line:84%
has underground crypts, it
has this great labyrinth when

00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:34.270 align:middle line:84%
you walk into it
with inlaid stones,

00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:38.990 align:middle line:84%
and the stained glass is
really second to none.

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:41.000 align:middle line:90%
It is just incredible.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.550 align:middle line:84%
When you walk in there,
you're like walking

00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:46.710 align:middle line:90%
into another environment.

00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:49.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who were these
people who built this?

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.210 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, the
Freemasons, who

00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:55.050 align:middle line:84%
then came out of
the Knights Templar

00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:59.660 align:middle line:84%
and were master stone cutters
and would travel around

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:02.680 align:middle line:84%
the countryside working on
many of these cathedrals.

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:05.940 align:middle line:84%
Many of the great Gothic
cathedrals you see often

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:08.760 align:middle line:84%
had the same workmen
or architects

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:13.170 align:middle line:84%
who would parallel
projects sometimes.

00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:15.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you
do other things.

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:18.310 align:middle line:90%
What is the Weird Street Faire?

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:20.150 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: The How
Weird Street Faire

00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:24.610 align:middle line:84%
is an event that I founded
in San Francisco, which

00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:28.440 align:middle line:84%
started with just two stages
and some vendor friends of ours.

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:32.280 align:middle line:84%
When I started CCC Publishing,
it was this artist's warehouse

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:34.620 align:middle line:84%
on Howard Street,
hence the name.

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And we were doing these
electronic dance music parties.

00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:42.940 align:middle line:84%
The first How Weird-- 17 years
ago was about 2,000 people.

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:45.620 align:middle line:84%
Now we're 10 blocks away
in the SOMA neighborhood,

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:47.350 align:middle line:90%
25,000 people.

00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:50.080 align:middle line:84%
It's just growing
beyond proportions

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:54.340 align:middle line:84%
and that's a job that
takes up a couple of months

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:55.291 align:middle line:90%
of my time every year.

00:33:55.291 --> 00:33:56.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
it about mysteries,

00:33:56.790 --> 00:33:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Brad, that people
are just so into?

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:02.190 align:middle line:90%
They just love them.

00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:06.340 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I think people have
an intuitive sense that there's

00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:08.780 align:middle line:84%
more to the picture
than is being told.

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And I think deep down we have
a yearning to understand,

00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:15.020 align:middle line:84%
and it's not just
who we are but it's

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:17.600 align:middle line:84%
all of what we are
here on the planet.

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's what makes
these books and your show

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:25.870 align:middle line:84%
so utterly fascinating
and why so many of us

00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:28.690 align:middle line:84%
really think you're doing such
a great service to humanity

00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:31.499 align:middle line:84%
by even bringing many of
these issues to light.

00:34:31.499 --> 00:34:33.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, these
are right topics

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:34.969 align:middle line:90%
that I think make people wonder.

00:34:34.969 --> 00:34:37.639 align:middle line:84%
And they make them research
and they make them--

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:40.320 align:middle line:84%
the internet has been
incredible for this.

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:44.280 align:middle line:84%
Companies like yours that
publish books and stories

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.300 align:middle line:84%
on events that are
happening worldwide

00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:48.480 align:middle line:90%
are just fantastic, as well.

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And I think some television
shows like Discovery

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:53.670 align:middle line:84%
and National Geographic
are beginning

00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:58.080 align:middle line:84%
to jump in and cover these
kinds of programs as well.

00:34:58.080 --> 00:34:59.970 align:middle line:90%
This is an amazing planet.

00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:02.550 align:middle line:84%
Something happened
a long time ago.

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:05.450 align:middle line:84%
Whether we were visited
by extraterrestrials

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:08.430 align:middle line:84%
and seeded, as the late
Zecharia Sitchin has

00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:11.670 align:middle line:84%
one set in his works,
something dramatic

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:13.660 align:middle line:90%
has happened on this planet.

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's our push
to get that answer, isn't it?

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:17.720 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And we'll never get that answer
unless we pose questions.

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And those questions need
to be very provocative

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:28.600 align:middle line:84%
and need to challenge the
dominant paradigm of thought.

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:33.000 align:middle line:84%
And only through further
research, new discoveries

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.860 align:middle line:84%
can this great mosaic of who
we are on planet Earth truly

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:38.222 align:middle line:90%
come to fruition.

00:35:38.222 --> 00:35:40.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Brad, do you think
modern science is intentionally

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:41.680 align:middle line:90%
withholding information?

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:45.240 align:middle line:84%
Do you think they know,
whoever they may be,

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:47.370 align:middle line:90%
how these things happened?

00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:50.480 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, it would have to
be compartmentalized to a point

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:53.330 align:middle line:84%
that not many people would
know the big picture.

00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is where a lot
of things in UFO research

00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:03.820 align:middle line:84%
goes is that to know what
MJ12, for example, knows

00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:07.450 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't be what, say, some
of the top generals know.

00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:15.240 align:middle line:84%
But even still, there's a saying
that you can disguise a lie,

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:18.577 align:middle line:84%
you can make it
seem like the truth

00:36:18.577 --> 00:36:19.910 align:middle line:90%
but it's never really the truth.

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:23.180 align:middle line:84%
The truth will always be a
constant in the universe.

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:24.310 align:middle line:90%
It's like a pillar.

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:28.542 align:middle line:84%
And everything else will just
eventually fall away and then

00:36:28.542 --> 00:36:30.250 align:middle line:84%
what you're left with
is still the truth.

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is the truth
and it will come out.

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:36.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you could get one
of these questions answered

00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:41.840 align:middle line:84%
about anything, what is that
one thing you'd like answered?

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:44.780 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I would like
to know the true story

00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:48.180 align:middle line:84%
of the antediluvian
civilizations on this earth,

00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:50.440 align:middle line:84%
what kind of technology
they employed,

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:53.590 align:middle line:84%
and if they were an
aspect of us or us.

00:36:53.590 --> 00:36:55.030 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we're they're descendants.

00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:57.488 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, Mr. Olsen, you're
asking three questions, not

00:36:57.488 --> 00:36:59.530 align:middle line:90%
one.

00:36:59.530 --> 00:37:02.100 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Poised together as one.

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:04.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You may get that wish.

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:05.800 align:middle line:90%
You may get that wish.

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:09.440 align:middle line:84%
I would like to find
out the true origin

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:10.920 align:middle line:90%
of the Great Pyramid.

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:11.890 align:middle line:90%
That's what I want.

00:37:11.890 --> 00:37:15.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean I would like to--
if we could go historically

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:19.490 align:middle line:84%
back and look at a
video of it being built,

00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:21.570 align:middle line:84%
I think that would
tell us everything.

00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:24.390 align:middle line:84%
If we could only go
into a time machine,

00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:27.280 align:middle line:84%
go back to that era, whenever
that era might have been,

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:30.020 align:middle line:84%
and just see how
it was constructed,

00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:36.430 align:middle line:84%
you might see people levitating
things into place or UFOs

00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:39.360 align:middle line:84%
doing it, right,
moving it along.

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:43.430 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Or at least
Galen is another creation.

00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But I really doubt you
had 100,000 Egyptians pulling

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:52.330 align:middle line:90%
ropes to move one block.

00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:52.935 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: No.

00:37:52.935 --> 00:37:54.690 align:middle line:90%
No, it didn't happen that way.

00:37:54.690 --> 00:37:56.740 align:middle line:10%
I had the great opportunity
of actually climbing

00:37:56.740 --> 00:38:00.800 align:middle line:10%
the Great Pyramid on a
full moon in March 1993.

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:02.940 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you're
not allowed to do it.

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:08.220 align:middle line:84%
And it was an opportunity
that I really wanted to do

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:10.730 align:middle line:84%
and I was able to get up there
during the sound and light

00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:11.650 align:middle line:90%
show.

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:13.233 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't know
if you know this,

00:38:13.233 --> 00:38:16.320 align:middle line:84%
but when a light
goes on very bright,

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.941 align:middle line:84%
the human eye does
not adjust right away.

00:38:18.941 --> 00:38:20.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, it takes a while.

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:22.100 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: So I knew this and they
were doing the sound and light

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:23.849 align:middle line:84%
show and the pyramid
would go up in lights

00:38:23.849 --> 00:38:25.040 align:middle line:90%
and then it would go dark.

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:26.670 align:middle line:84%
So I used that as
my opportunity.

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:29.370 align:middle line:84%
I looked around and didn't
see any guards, started

00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:31.960 align:middle line:84%
sprinting up there right
when the lights went down,

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:33.280 align:middle line:90%
hid when the lights came up.

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:35.962 align:middle line:84%
It took me three
segments to get up there

00:38:35.962 --> 00:38:37.170 align:middle line:90%
and wow, was that incredible.

00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:37.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a view huh?

00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:39.776 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I actually saw
a mouse up there, too.

00:38:39.776 --> 00:38:40.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A mouse?

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:41.790 align:middle line:90%
They made it up there.

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:42.470 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Made it up there.

00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:43.261 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love it.

00:38:43.261 --> 00:38:46.830 align:middle line:84%
How do people get a hold of
you or get to your website?

00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:50.366 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: You can find me on
the web on bradolsen.com or CCC

00:38:50.366 --> 00:38:53.845 align:middle line:84%
Publishing to read any of my
books or the other authors

00:38:53.845 --> 00:38:55.225 align:middle line:90%
that I publish.

00:38:55.225 --> 00:38:56.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm also all over Facebook.

00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:59.870 align:middle line:84%
I have a YouTube channel
called "Esoteric Series,"

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:01.100 align:middle line:90%
and it's easy enough to find.

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:03.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Brad, always thanks
for being on "Beyond Belief."

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:04.595 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Thank you, George.

00:39:04.595 --> 00:39:06.200 align:middle line:90%
It was a pleasure to be here.

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:09.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What an exciting aspect
of all of this, of what we do,

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:11.290 align:middle line:84%
and that's trying
to get these answers

00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:12.770 align:middle line:84%
to these incredible
mysteries that

00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:14.940 align:middle line:90%
have occurred on our planet.

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:19.510 align:middle line:10%
And maybe just one day we
will get those answers.

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:23.110 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and
this is "Beyond Belief."
