>>GEORGE NOORY:
What's the agenda

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.902 align:middle line:84%
from those people who want
to control everything we do?

00:00:14.902 --> 00:00:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BRAD OLSEN: There will come
a time where they'll come out

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.220 align:middle line:84%
of their smoky
boardrooms and they're

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.850 align:middle line:84%
going to have to initiate
this new world order agenda.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.970 align:middle line:84%
The good news is the great
awakening is occurring.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.700 align:middle line:84%
People are waking up
to this in droves.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.098 align:middle line:84%
We're really going into this
brave new world, George,

00:00:32.098 --> 00:00:33.890 align:middle line:84%
where we don't know
what's going to happen.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.392 align:middle line:90%

back to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.120 align:middle line:10%
George Noory here with you,
and Brad Olsen is with us.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.820 align:middle line:10%
He's an author and
public speaker.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.440 align:middle line:10%
He's been on the program before.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.740 align:middle line:84%
But he's got a brand new book
out called "Beyond Esoteric:

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.360 align:middle line:90%
Escaping Prison Planet."

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.555 align:middle line:10%
Brad, welcome back
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:53.555 --> 00:00:54.430 align:middle line:10%
>>OLSEN: Hey, George.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.730 align:middle line:10%
It's always great to be
back, and wonderful to see

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.982 align:middle line:10%
you and have this opportunity to
talk to you about my new book.

00:00:59.982 --> 00:01:01.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What an
interesting title,

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.810 align:middle line:84%
"Beyond Esoteric:
Prison Planet."

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.190 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.770 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, it's the third
in the "Esoteric" series.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.300 align:middle line:10%
It started with "Modern
Esoteric," "Future Esoteric,"

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.090 align:middle line:10%
and now "Beyond Esoteric."

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.550 align:middle line:10%
And I came up with that
name because all the things

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.590 align:middle line:10%
that are happening
in the world today,

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.130 align:middle line:10%
no 19th century
occultist could imagine

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.930 align:middle line:10%
this transhumanist and
changing world we live in today

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.630 align:middle line:10%
with this neo fascist police
state seemingly taking hold,

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.595 align:middle line:10%
as well as many
other things that

00:01:32.595 --> 00:01:33.720 align:middle line:10%
are happening in the world.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.880 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, the disclosure

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.110 align:middle line:84%
of new things from
the Pentagon and new

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.430 align:middle line:90%
breakthroughs with our health.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.460 align:middle line:84%
So it's quite an exciting
time to be alive.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And "Escaping Prison
Planet" is just

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.020 align:middle line:84%
a subtitle for how we're waking
up to this control agenda

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.830 align:middle line:84%
that's had an iron grip on
humanity for many, many years.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, exactly what
does esoteric mean, Brad?

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.310 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Esoteric is
a term for knowledge

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.710 align:middle line:84%
that is obtained and hoarded
in a way by a select few.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.419 align:middle line:84%
It's different from
the occult. They

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:11.970 align:middle line:90%
both mean that which is hidden.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.690 align:middle line:84%
But this is the group of
people that basically control

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.670 align:middle line:90%
that flow of information.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And as we know, a
lot of information

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.440 align:middle line:84%
has not been released
to the public.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.990 align:middle line:84%
It's coming through
the alternative media

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.590 align:middle line:84%
now in different ways,
through the internet

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.040 align:middle line:84%
and other sources like
your show "Coast to Coast."

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.430 align:middle line:84%
It's been a wonderful
way to wake people up

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.938 align:middle line:84%
and let them know that there
is another side to all this,

00:02:38.938 --> 00:02:40.230 align:middle line:90%
and that's what esoteric means.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is this agenda?

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.250 align:middle line:90%
The subtitle is "Prison Planet."

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.070 align:middle line:84%
What's the agenda from
those people who want

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.870 align:middle line:90%
to control everything we do?

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.270 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I start the
book out with a section

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.710 align:middle line:90%
called Neo Fascism.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.452 align:middle line:90%
And it's a new form of fascism.

00:02:55.452 --> 00:02:56.910 align:middle line:84%
Remember when we
were in school, we

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.740 align:middle line:84%
heard that fascism was
Mussolini and Hitler who

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.240 align:middle line:84%
were heads of government
controlling corporations?

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.665 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Now it's
the other way around.

00:03:06.665 --> 00:03:09.108 align:middle line:84%
Now it's these invisible
heads of corporations--

00:03:09.108 --> 00:03:10.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Controlling
everything else.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.275 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --controlling
everything else.

00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:14.190 align:middle line:90%
So I termed it neo fascism.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what the
escape from prison planet

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.790 align:middle line:84%
has to do, is waking up
to the control agenda,

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.570 align:middle line:84%
this false matrix that has
been festooned upon the world

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.100 align:middle line:90%
population.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And just stepping outside
of it and not conforming.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You do a little
work on Edward Bernays.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.970 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: I do.

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wasn't he
the guy who came up

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.573 align:middle line:84%
with the public relations
concept and everything else?

00:03:37.573 --> 00:03:38.490 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: That's right.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.450 align:middle line:84%
Start my introduction with
some quotes from Bernays.

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.940 align:middle line:84%
And he believed that the public
needed to be propagandized,

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.640 align:middle line:90%
that we can't handle the truth.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, they
should smooth it over

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.710 align:middle line:84%
with just a gloss
of not giving us

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.510 align:middle line:90%
the full truth about everything.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, when you talk
about control, on the Gaia

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.770 align:middle line:84%
program "Escape the Matrix,"
world-renowned David Icke talks

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.390 align:middle line:90%
just like you.

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.350 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID ICKE: How do a
relative handful of people

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.079 align:middle line:10%
control the direction
of the world

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:21.860 align:middle line:10%
with a population
currently of 7.7 billion?

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And there had to be a structure
that allowed that to happen.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And also, that
structure had to be such

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.180 align:middle line:84%
that the vast, overwhelming
majority of people

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.620 align:middle line:84%
who were playing a
part in that control

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.380 align:middle line:84%
had no idea that's
what they were doing.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out, there
is just such a structure.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.930 align:middle line:90%
You can use the symbolism--

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.010 align:middle line:90%
and it's almost not symbolism.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.450 align:middle line:90%
It's how it is structured.

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.890 align:middle line:84%
But you can use the
symbolism of the spider's web

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.310 align:middle line:84%
to understand how the
few control the many.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.640 align:middle line:84%
Imagine a spider in
the center of the web.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And this spider, for those that
have watched our other programs

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.280 align:middle line:84%
in this series, is
that non-human force,

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.540 align:middle line:84%
that archontic force that
I've been talking about.

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And then you come in
to the human world

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.370 align:middle line:84%
with these strands in the web
immediately around the spider.

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:36.360 align:middle line:84%
These strands are the most
exclusive secret societies.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.940 align:middle line:84%
Some of them don't
even have names,

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.420 align:middle line:84%
which makes them harder
to identify and track.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And within that exclusive
group of secret societies

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.320 align:middle line:84%
are those in the human
realm who absolutely know,

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.340 align:middle line:84%
A, how all this works, and
B, what the end game is

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:03.910 align:middle line:84%
and what the manipulation
is taking humanity towards.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And then you come further
out from the spider,

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.440 align:middle line:84%
and then you start to
meet the secret societies

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.370 align:middle line:90%
we do know about.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we know about
their existence.

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:19.120 align:middle line:84%
We don't know about what their
inner circle is deciding.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.250 align:middle line:84%
But we know their names,
things like the Freemasons,

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:28.600 align:middle line:84%
the Knights of Malta, the
Knights Templar, Opus Dei,

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.900 align:middle line:84%
the inner circle of the Jesuit
order, and so on and so forth.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.290 align:middle line:90%
And that's important.

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:37.930 align:middle line:84%
I'll emphasize this
more in a second.

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.450 align:middle line:84%
When I talk about
secret societies,

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:44.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that everybody
in that secret society

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:45.483 align:middle line:90%
is manipulating the world.

00:06:45.483 --> 00:06:46.900 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] That would
be ridiculous.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.430 align:middle line:90%
So many people would know.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:54.160 align:middle line:84%
It would get out widely
into the public arena.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.790 align:middle line:84%
These are compartmentalized
structures

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:02.230 align:middle line:84%
where the few at the top,
the very few at the top

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:05.150 align:middle line:84%
are the only ones that know
actually what the game really

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.950 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:09.720 align:middle line:84%
Everyone else only
knows a part of it.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You like him.

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:12.795 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: I like David Icke.

00:07:12.795 --> 00:07:15.660 align:middle line:90%
He and I are big picture people.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.970 align:middle line:84%
We look at the whole
entirety of the world

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.540 align:middle line:84%
and many of the
manipulations going on.

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.360 align:middle line:84%
I went and saw David Icke
for 12 and a half hours

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.850 align:middle line:84%
when he came through the
Bay Area a couple years ago.

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:29.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 12 and a half hours?

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:31.690 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Of him
speaking the whole time.

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:32.740 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:34.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And everybody
was glued to him?

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:35.770 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Nobody left.

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:37.810 align:middle line:84%
Everybody was there
the whole time.

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:41.410 align:middle line:10%
And back then, before a
lot of the things that

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:44.455 align:middle line:10%
are happening in the world
today, he would always say,

00:07:44.455 --> 00:07:46.330 align:middle line:10%
there will come a time
where they'll come out

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.460 align:middle line:10%
of their smoky
boardrooms and they're

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:52.430 align:middle line:10%
going to have to initiate
this new world order agenda.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're
seeing that happening

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:55.660 align:middle line:90%
right now in real time.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.612 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was way
ahead of his time too.

00:07:57.612 --> 00:07:58.570 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: He really was.

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And I think he'll be remembered
favorably in history.

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:02.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:05.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, getting back to
your book, what would you

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:08.680 align:middle line:84%
like people to take away
from it after they read it?

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:13.630 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, I'm an optimistic
and a very peaceful person.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:18.580 align:middle line:84%
I think we can get through
this in a nonviolent fashion.

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:21.700 align:middle line:84%
I often say, the revolution
is consciousness.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:22.990 align:middle line:90%
I think it's up to us--

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:24.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And knowledge.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:27.460 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --as individuals
to collect knowledge,

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:32.590 align:middle line:84%
to arm ourselves
intellectually, not physically,

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:36.100 align:middle line:84%
and try to fight this
power in that way,

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.450 align:middle line:90%
because we'll get slaughtered.

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:39.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what happened
in your life, Brad,

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:43.809 align:middle line:84%
where you saw this picture
and started to write about it

00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:44.950 align:middle line:90%
and research it?

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:47.750 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: From the time I was
a child, George, I thought,

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.690 align:middle line:84%
why don't we live
on a utopia planet?

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:54.415 align:middle line:84%
Why is there still war and
starvation and inequities?

00:08:54.415 --> 00:08:55.690 align:middle line:90%
Where's the justice?

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:58.370 align:middle line:10%
Humans are very intelligent.

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.430 align:middle line:90%
We can make change very quickly.

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:01.480 align:middle line:90%
We can invent things.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.800 align:middle line:90%
We've gone to the moon.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.110 align:middle line:10%
We have computers on
our smartphones now.

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:08.230 align:middle line:10%
So why are we still
driving around

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:11.410 align:middle line:10%
in internal combustion
engines and polluting

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:14.290 align:middle line:10%
this atmosphere
and one out of five

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:16.720 align:middle line:10%
is going to bed
starving tonight?

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.430 align:middle line:90%
It shouldn't be happening.

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:21.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have more computer
power on our smartphones

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:23.800 align:middle line:84%
than they had in the
"Apollo" missions

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.600 align:middle line:90%
when they went to the moon.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.500 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:27.300 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Isn't it?

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.320 align:middle line:84%
So why can't we make
these advancements

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.570 align:middle line:84%
with the introduction of free
energy technology, for example?

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:35.680 align:middle line:84%
Which, we know Tesla
and many other inventors

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:40.780 align:middle line:84%
have come to the table with
devices that don't pollute,

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:44.320 align:middle line:90%
that can fuel our world.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:48.220 align:middle line:10%
Even using wireless
technology, as Tesla was

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:50.170 align:middle line:10%
demonstrating 100 years ago.

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And as we know, he was
ruthlessly suppressed

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:54.760 align:middle line:90%
by these same globalists that--

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They couldn't figure
out how to make money from it.

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:57.580 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Right.

00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:59.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And so
they went after him.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.480 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Just like the
old journalistic adage,

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.540 align:middle line:84%
if you can't make sense of
a story, follow the money.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:05.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:09.430 align:middle line:84%
Are you concerned that we
may not pull out of this?

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: We do walk the very
fine line along a razor's edge

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:18.730 align:middle line:84%
where we could flip one way,
talk about the timelines.

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:21.460 align:middle line:84%
Timeline two would be a
disaster for the world.

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:25.180 align:middle line:10%
It would lock us down into
this prison planet much harsher

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:27.190 align:middle line:10%
than anything we can imagine.

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:32.510 align:middle line:84%
Or we could free our
minds, as David Icke wrote

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:36.920 align:middle line:84%
one of his books, that we
can come to the conclusion

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.580 align:middle line:84%
that we've been manipulated
and rise up peacefully,

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.620 align:middle line:90%
change this program.

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps this
current agenda is just

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:47.600 align:middle line:90%
a speed bump in the road.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.580 align:middle line:84%
Then we could reach
a golden age, George.

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And I hope we're
alive to see it,

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:55.250 align:middle line:84%
because I think it's very close
to being within our grasp.

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:57.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we do it
in a nonviolent way?

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.770 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: We have to.

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:01.150 align:middle line:90%
There has to be no other way.

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:04.530 align:middle line:84%
The good news is the great
awakening is occurring.

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:07.350 align:middle line:84%
People are waking up
to this in droves.

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:10.260 align:middle line:84%
When I came out with the first
in my "Esoteric" series almost

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.850 align:middle line:84%
10 years ago, it
was a tough sell.

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:13.650 align:middle line:90%
It was very hard.

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:15.525 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you were
way ahead of your time,

00:11:15.525 --> 00:11:17.520 align:middle line:90%
as David Icke was.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.260 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I pay
attention to things,

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.733 align:middle line:84%
and I've been paying attention
to trends and the way--

00:11:21.733 --> 00:11:22.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You see them.

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:23.450 align:middle line:90%
You sense them.

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:24.750 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: I do indeed.

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And that percolates
into my writing.

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:31.950 align:middle line:84%
But it was much harder to have
this conversation with people

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:34.103 align:middle line:90%
10 years ago than it is now.

00:11:34.103 --> 00:11:35.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which
brings up something

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:38.790 align:middle line:90%
in your book about the embargo.

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:42.123 align:middle line:84%
You believe the embargo
is being shredded away.

00:11:42.123 --> 00:11:43.290 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Well, that's right.

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And our good friend
Stephen Bassett

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:47.045 align:middle line:84%
coined the term
the truth embargo.

00:11:47.045 --> 00:11:47.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, he did.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.550 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And he is the one and
only lobbyist in Washington,

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:53.950 align:middle line:84%
DC, on behalf of
disclosure and--

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:54.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Truth.

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:55.530 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: --UFO truth.

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:56.370 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:59.520 align:middle line:84%
So he's introduced me
in some of my talks,

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.790 align:middle line:84%
and we've established
a very nice friendship,

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:03.750 align:middle line:90%
as I know you have too.

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:05.280 align:middle line:90%
He's a very genuine person.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And the embargo encompasses not
just UFO and ET truth, but also

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:11.820 align:middle line:90%
our human origins.

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:16.500 align:middle line:84%
Also the control mechanism
that's coming down on us.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.260 align:middle line:84%
One of the chapters in my
new book "Beyond Esoteric"

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.020 align:middle line:84%
is called "Being Aware
of Predatory Species."

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.940 align:middle line:84%
We have to look at
the big picture here.

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.790 align:middle line:84%
We have to see
that there could be

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:32.070 align:middle line:84%
predatory species that have a
taste for humans, for example.

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:33.960 align:middle line:84%
And I know this is
a very dark subject,

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.000 align:middle line:84%
and some people may not
want to go this way,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.350 align:middle line:84%
but I think it has to be said
if that's the way it's going.

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:42.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This embargo that
is being shredded away--

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:43.840 align:middle line:90%
I can feel it.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.850 align:middle line:90%
I can feel it.

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:49.260 align:middle line:84%
Every year, it gets a
little more whittled

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.140 align:middle line:84%
away where we're getting
more information,

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:56.190 align:middle line:90%
whether it's UFOs or an agenda.

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:57.270 align:middle line:90%
It's happening.

00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And 15 years ago, Steve Bassett
would say it was happening.

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:05.370 align:middle line:84%
I'd tell him, Steve, it's not
going to happen right now.

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:07.750 align:middle line:84%
Now he's at a point where
he says, you know what?

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:09.930 align:middle line:84%
You were right, but
it is happening.

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:11.040 align:middle line:90%
And I agree with that.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.130 align:middle line:90%
Do you feel it too?

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:13.170 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: I feel it too.

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:16.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's the all-encompassing
great awakening.

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:18.600 align:middle line:90%
We hear about the great reset.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:22.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's probably great
for the financial planners

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:24.093 align:middle line:84%
of the world, that
they'll own everything

00:13:24.093 --> 00:13:25.010 align:middle line:90%
and we'll own nothing.

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:28.080 align:middle line:84%
They even say that
on their website.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.980 align:middle line:90%
And you'll be happy about that.

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:33.270 align:middle line:84%
But that's communism
to the nth degree,

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:37.110 align:middle line:84%
and I don't think that
is really the trajectory

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:38.280 align:middle line:90%
of the human race.

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:40.030 align:middle line:90%
We yearn for freedom.

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And freedom is
truth and knowledge

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:46.700 align:middle line:84%
and understanding the
bigger picture here.

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:50.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that why the embargo
is slowly, slowly happening

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:53.180 align:middle line:90%
and being whittled away?

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.610 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: That's right,
because individuals are waking

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:58.220 align:middle line:90%
up and understanding this.

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And the alternative media
is exploding, because people

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.550 align:middle line:90%
are yearning for the truth.

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:08.760 align:middle line:84%
That's why this book right out
of the gate is doing so well.

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:13.760 align:middle line:84%
Just, people are anticipating
that this kind of information

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:14.810 align:middle line:90%
is coming true.

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:18.050 align:middle line:84%
They can't believe the
mainstream media anymore.

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:20.930 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- we've been
deceived so many times.

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:23.600 align:middle line:84%
And I just can't
watch it anymore.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.290 align:middle line:84%
It's just kind of
disturbing to me.

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, they have
their own agenda now.

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:27.020 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Of course.

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.562 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, in
the old days when

00:14:28.562 --> 00:14:32.210 align:middle line:84%
you would watch Walter Cronkite,
you believed the guy, you know?

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:33.620 align:middle line:90%
Uncle Walter.

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:36.110 align:middle line:84%
You were getting the
information, unbiased

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:37.250 align:middle line:90%
and balanced.

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And he would set
it-- he used to say

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:40.940 align:middle line:84%
he doesn't vote
for the presidency

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:43.400 align:middle line:84%
because he wants to
remain impartial.

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.500 align:middle line:90%
And we don't have that anymore.

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:47.300 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Right.

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And the media has changed
in a multitude of ways.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:55.040 align:middle line:84%
It's been gobbled up by
six large multinational

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:58.250 align:middle line:84%
conglomerates who
are basically owned

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:02.360 align:middle line:84%
by these same globalists that
are initiating this new world

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.920 align:middle line:90%
order agenda.

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they keep force
feeding it down our throats,

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:06.830 align:middle line:90%
don't they?

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:07.747 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: That's right.

00:15:07.747 --> 00:15:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And it just comes a time when
people have just had enough,

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:14.030 align:middle line:84%
and that's why they turn
to the alternative media

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:15.860 align:middle line:90%
and shows like yours, George.

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And I really think you've done
a great service to humanity

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:23.525 align:middle line:84%
for allowing this
information to get out.

00:15:23.525 --> 00:15:24.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We want the truth.

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:25.580 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yes.

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:27.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And one of
the other great things

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:29.870 align:middle line:84%
too about your work is
you look into things that

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:32.750 align:middle line:90%
look even strange and bizarre.

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:35.300 align:middle line:84%
You've stumbled
across old giants.

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:36.260 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.970 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, this is part
of the big picture here.

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:43.310 align:middle line:84%
This is the true,
long-range history of Earth,

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:46.370 align:middle line:84%
that there have been
antediluvian civilizations

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:49.673 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, and
there have been giants

00:15:49.673 --> 00:15:50.840 align:middle line:90%
that have walked this Earth.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:54.920 align:middle line:84%
It's talked about in the Old
Testament and many old texts,

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:58.200 align:middle line:84%
cuneiform texts of
the Sumerians as well.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.715 align:middle line:90%
And in South America, George--

00:15:59.715 --> 00:16:02.220 align:middle line:84%
I was just down there a
little over two years ago--

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:04.470 align:middle line:84%
you can walk into
museums in Peru

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:07.710 align:middle line:84%
and see these massive
elongated skulls.

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:09.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, they're there.

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:11.640 align:middle line:84%
But there is some
kind of suppression.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:14.580 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, on the
"Open Minds" show, a Gaia

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:18.900 align:middle line:84%
program, author Richard Dewhurst
talks about the explorer John

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:23.850 align:middle line:84%
Powell who was influencing the
Smithsonian Institute never

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:26.580 align:middle line:90%
to discuss the giant race.

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:29.850 align:middle line:10%
>>RICHARD DEWHURST: But by
1879, Powell unequivocally

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:33.300 align:middle line:10%
said, we're dealing
with Aboriginal savages

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:35.310 align:middle line:10%
with no signs of
advanced culture,

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:37.770 align:middle line:10%
no signs of higher intellect.

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:42.160 align:middle line:10%
He said, there is absolutely
no pre-Columbian contact.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.560 align:middle line:90%
We will not accept that.

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:47.580 align:middle line:84%
And any talk of lost tribes
will not even be considered.

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:50.670 align:middle line:84%
Now interestingly
enough, Powell's father

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:54.852 align:middle line:84%
was a preacher who lost his
whole congregation to Mormons.

00:16:54.852 --> 00:16:56.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Oh, interesting.

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:57.390 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:00.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DEWHURST: So no
lost tribes for him.

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:03.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah, no
lost tribes for him.

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:05.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DEWHURST: And this dovetailed
with other Smithsonian

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:08.790 align:middle line:84%
policies, and
primarily evolution.

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:12.780 align:middle line:84%
Now in the 19th
century when we had

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:14.640 align:middle line:84%
our modern scientific
institutions,

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:18.010 align:middle line:84%
they prided themselves
on rationality.

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:24.060 align:middle line:84%
So anything to do with religion
or myth was like a curse.

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And the whole idea
of evolution is

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:28.770 align:middle line:84%
that we go from
knuckle draggers,

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:30.690 align:middle line:84%
and we're getting
bigger and smarter.

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:35.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can't have a chart
where you've got 12, 10, eight,

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.000 align:middle line:90%
seven.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: We have
a descending height.

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:38.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DEWHURST: It's
called devolution.

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: [LAUGHS] Exactly.

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:41.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DEWHURST: The
band Devo actually

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.500 align:middle line:90%
was named after that concept.

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.080 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Right.

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DEWHURST: And so you--

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:51.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: So he was able
to influence the Smithsonian.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of that,
most of the other journals

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:58.200 align:middle line:84%
of the day that would have been
considered the more headier,

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:01.650 align:middle line:84%
academic journals of the
day bought into the mindset.

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:04.747 align:middle line:84%
And it was dovetailing
with Darwinism, right?

00:18:04.747 --> 00:18:05.580 align:middle line:90%
>>DEWHURST: Correct.

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:06.380 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:07.360 align:middle line:90%
It was a perfect storm.

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:12.030 align:middle line:84%
And all of the universities
took their lead

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:13.470 align:middle line:90%
from the Smithsonian.

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And the Powell doctrine
has never been rescinded,

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:18.690 align:middle line:84%
even though there's people
internally at the Smithsonian

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:22.260 align:middle line:84%
now that are trying to argue
their way out of that box

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.510 align:middle line:90%
and doing some interesting work.

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:27.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are things
hidden away at the Smithsonian

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:29.980 align:middle line:84%
that I know we
should know about.

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:32.010 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Oh, absolutely, George.

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:32.970 align:middle line:90%
I've read that book.

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:35.310 align:middle line:84%
I have great respect
for Richard Dewhurst.

00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And I quote him in my chapter
on suppressed human origins.

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.870 align:middle line:84%
So much so about
our early origins--

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:47.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why would
they suppress this?

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.043 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, he
made the point there

00:18:49.043 --> 00:18:51.690 align:middle line:84%
that they just
didn't want to try

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:55.260 align:middle line:84%
to aggrandize the
savages as they

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:56.730 align:middle line:90%
were known in the 19th century.

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:59.490 align:middle line:84%
It was during the period
of Manifest Destiny

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:02.550 align:middle line:84%
when white people were meant to
just conquer this land of ours,

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:04.983 align:middle line:84%
that it was our duty and
it was ours for the taking.

00:19:04.983 --> 00:19:06.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was our destiny.

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:08.130 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And the natives
were just in our way,

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:12.990 align:middle line:84%
and they were more considered
a hindrance and a nuisance

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:13.960 align:middle line:90%
than anything else.

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:16.650 align:middle line:84%
So why would we
want to in any way

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:21.270 align:middle line:84%
make their culture
seem better than it is?

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:23.760 align:middle line:84%
Especially if it was
a high culture, which

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.897 align:middle line:84%
we see in the mound cities in
the Midwest where you're from

00:19:26.897 --> 00:19:27.730 align:middle line:90%
and where I'm from--

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:30.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Cahokia in Illinois,
which I've seen, by the way.

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:31.590 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating.

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:33.892 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: St. Louis was
once known as Mound City.

00:19:33.892 --> 00:19:35.850 align:middle line:84%
There were so many mounds,
and they've just all

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:36.740 align:middle line:90%
been plowed over.

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:37.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yep.

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:38.130 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:41.220 align:middle line:84%
The Smithsonian has
things hidden away

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:44.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm convinced in the
basement somewhere

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.540 align:middle line:90%
that we should know about.

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:49.483 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to me, it's an
abomination that we don't.

00:19:49.483 --> 00:19:51.900 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Remember in the end
of "Raiders of the Lost Ark,"

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:54.390 align:middle line:84%
they showed just the general
warehouse with everything

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:55.320 align:middle line:90%
hidden down there?

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:59.460 align:middle line:84%
There's also reports that they
would just go to a dig site--

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:04.230 align:middle line:84%
and I profiled Beloit College,
a very well-established college

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:05.040 align:middle line:90%
in Wisconsin.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:09.060 align:middle line:84%
They were doing a dig at Lake
Delavan, finding giant bones.

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:11.400 align:middle line:84%
Smithsonian comes
in like the FBI.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:12.848 align:middle line:90%
We'll take over here.

00:20:12.848 --> 00:20:13.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're in charge.

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:16.020 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And they said,
well, we just want

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:18.370 align:middle line:84%
to keep track of
what's going on,

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:20.520 align:middle line:84%
and let us know
what you guys find.

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:23.270 align:middle line:84%
They followed up a
little time later.

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:26.012 align:middle line:84%
Smithsonian's like, we don't
know what you're talking about.

00:20:26.012 --> 00:20:27.720 align:middle line:84%
So there are reports
that they would just

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:30.600 align:middle line:84%
dump the bones in the Atlantic
Ocean, just out of sight.

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:31.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just to
get rid of them?

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:31.990 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yep.

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:32.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't think they did.

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:33.930 align:middle line:90%
I think they hid them.

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:34.888 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Well, maybe.

00:20:34.888 --> 00:20:36.180 align:middle line:90%
Let's hope they emerge someday.

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:36.810 align:middle line:90%
That would be great.

00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:39.018 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or they're in some
billionaire's living room

00:20:39.018 --> 00:20:39.960 align:middle line:90%
somewhere.

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:41.010 align:middle line:90%
Set up like that.

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:42.300 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Or Masonic temple.

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:44.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The uber mind.

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:45.960 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking
about the car company.

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:46.350 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: No.

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:47.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is that?

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:51.180 align:middle line:10%
>>OLSEN: So that's a term
I use for the final chapter

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:54.930 align:middle line:10%
in "Beyond Esoteric,"
and that includes what

00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:56.903 align:middle line:10%
we're going through right now.

00:20:56.903 --> 00:21:03.640 align:middle line:84%
A stage, even a chrysalis moment
in humanity into human 2.0.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.525 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we
go beyond esoteric,

00:21:05.525 --> 00:21:07.150 align:middle line:84%
because nobody could
have even imagined

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:09.400 align:middle line:90%
this when we were kids, George.

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nor would
they teach us.

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Of course not, how this
transhumanist agenda is taking

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:17.420 align:middle line:90%
hold for better or for worse.

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:20.320 align:middle line:84%
There are some things that
can truly enhance our health,

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:24.550 align:middle line:84%
and then other things that
perhaps are not so good.

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:28.165 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps putting bio
chips under our skin,

00:21:28.165 --> 00:21:31.360 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't agree with that
as being an enhancement,

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.390 align:middle line:84%
even if you can open your
door or pay your bills with it

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:38.548 align:middle line:84%
or use it as a key to get
into the office at work.

00:21:38.548 --> 00:21:40.090 align:middle line:84%
I just think there's
some things that

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:43.960 align:middle line:84%
are being a bit too
evasive into our privacy

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.580 align:middle line:90%
and into our personal lives.

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.700 align:middle line:84%
We don't need our phone
spying on us all the time

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:49.720 align:middle line:90%
or tracking our--

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:52.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Telling us where
we are and everything else.

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:55.630 align:middle line:84%
Do you notice on every
app, do you give permission

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:57.310 align:middle line:90%
for your location?

00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:58.190 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:21:58.190 --> 00:21:58.990 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Right.

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:00.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But it's everywhere.

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:02.530 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And sometimes you
have to go well into the menu

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:06.160 align:middle line:84%
to turn this stuff off, that
they track you automatically

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:09.367 align:middle line:84%
when AI starts creeping
into our lives as well.

00:22:09.367 --> 00:22:10.450 align:middle line:90%
And this is another thing.

00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:13.420 align:middle line:84%
I think we need to
take pause and consider

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:17.230 align:middle line:84%
if this is really good or
necessary for moving on

00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:18.400 align:middle line:90%
as a human race.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Elon Musk
would like to put

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:22.348 align:middle line:90%
computer chips in our heads.

00:22:22.348 --> 00:22:24.640 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Yeah, I don't think
I want the Neuralink chip.

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.608 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] That's another one.

00:22:26.608 --> 00:22:27.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't need it.

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:28.970 align:middle line:90%
I don't want it.

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:30.880 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Why can't
we just be humans?

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.650 align:middle line:84%
Why can't we just
go on with our lives

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:35.987 align:middle line:84%
without being enhanced in
all these different ways?

00:22:35.987 --> 00:22:36.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:38.710 align:middle line:84%
Richard Dolan,
he's a researcher.

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:41.110 align:middle line:84%
Was on the Gaia
program "Deep Space."

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And he talks about different
human-computer relationships

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:47.843 align:middle line:84%
that he's convinced could
happen in the future.

00:22:47.843 --> 00:22:49.510 align:middle line:10%
>>RICHARD DOLAN: What
I think we can say

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:52.660 align:middle line:10%
is that we're seeing a lot
of technologies coalescing

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:58.370 align:middle line:10%
to cause a speeding
up of this process.

00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:00.310 align:middle line:10%
So I'm very
sympathetic to the idea

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:02.590 align:middle line:10%
that this is going to
happen very suddenly,

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:04.100 align:middle line:10%
without our warning.

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:06.328 align:middle line:84%
We will probably be
caught off guard by it.

00:23:06.328 --> 00:23:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it's interesting
to talk about the phrase

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:10.790 align:middle line:90%
singularity in this context.

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:13.360 align:middle line:84%
So AI people call
this the singularity

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:14.980 align:middle line:90%
for a very definite reason.

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:17.440 align:middle line:84%
They liken it to the
physics of a black hole.

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.710 align:middle line:84%
At the center of black hole,
you have the singularity.

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, a point
of virtual infinite

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:26.380 align:middle line:84%
density and infinite
gravitational power.

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And in that type
of crazy physics,

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:34.580 align:middle line:84%
all of the physics that we
have don't seem to apply.

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:38.320 align:middle line:10%
We don't know how to predict
things at the singularity.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:41.320 align:middle line:10%
And this is what AI
theorists are saying.

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:44.500 align:middle line:10%
When computing intelligence
exceeds our own,

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:46.600 align:middle line:10%
we human beings will
not have the ability

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:50.230 align:middle line:10%
to predict the trajectory
of our civilization.

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:52.900 align:middle line:10%
We're basically going to be
losing control over this car

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:56.380 align:middle line:10%
that we think we're driving, and
now the dominant intelligence

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:57.400 align:middle line:10%
will be beyond us.

00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And what will that
dominant intelligence do?

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:02.500 align:middle line:84%
Will it merge with us as
Kurzweil thinks, a combination

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:05.140 align:middle line:84%
of human-machine
hybrid intelligence

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:09.310 align:middle line:84%
where we'll be some freakish
bunch of creatures living

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:13.600 align:middle line:84%
for 500 years and IQs of 1,000,
totally unlike what we are?

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.610 align:middle line:84%
Or will the computers
think, humanity?

00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:17.090 align:middle line:90%
Let's pull a Terminator on them.

00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:18.200 align:middle line:90%
We have no idea.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.000 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.690 align:middle line:84%
Or will they be our willing
slaves and make our world

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:24.190 align:middle line:90%
a paradise?

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:25.270 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:26.590 align:middle line:90%
That's why it's a singularity.

00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:28.880 align:middle line:84%
We can't really
predict any of this.

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:29.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who knows?

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:32.630 align:middle line:84%
But I have a feeling
it's going to happen.

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:34.490 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: He mentioned
going beyond.

00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:35.750 align:middle line:90%
We're on "Beyond Belief."

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:37.820 align:middle line:84%
My book is "Beyond
Esoteric," and this

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:39.030 align:middle line:90%
is what it's all about.

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:42.290 align:middle line:84%
We're really going into this
brave new world, George,

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:44.360 align:middle line:84%
where we don't know
what's going to happen.

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we
going too fast, Brad?

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:47.180 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Look at what's happened
just in our own lifetimes.

00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:51.690 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine our kids
or our grandchildren,

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:52.820 align:middle line:90%
the world they'll live in?

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:55.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was watching
some old television shows,

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:57.890 align:middle line:84%
and life seemed so
much simpler then,

00:24:57.890 --> 00:24:59.750 align:middle line:84%
even though I was
just a little kid.

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:03.950 align:middle line:84%
But I just think things are
happening way too quickly,

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:05.458 align:middle line:90%
don't you?

00:25:05.458 --> 00:25:06.500 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Way too quickly.

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And isn't it funny how
we always hearken back

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:12.530 align:middle line:84%
to these simpler times
when life was a lot easier

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:14.990 align:middle line:84%
and before so many
complications or technology?

00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:17.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we still remember
the rotary phones.

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:19.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I think
back at the times

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:21.190 align:middle line:90%
we never had the internet.

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:22.010 align:middle line:90%
We got by.

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:22.950 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I love it.

00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:24.390 align:middle line:90%
It's a great tool.

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:27.650 align:middle line:84%
It helps, especially with
me doing my talk show.

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:30.890 align:middle line:84%
In those old days, you'd go
through magazines and newspaper

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:34.700 align:middle line:84%
articles and clip them out,
and you'd walk into the studio

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:37.160 align:middle line:84%
and you'd have papers
flying all over the place.

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.980 align:middle line:84%
Now everything's concise
and to the point.

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:43.440 align:middle line:84%
It's got some benefits, but it's
got some negative things to.

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:44.240 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Right.

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And we just have to weigh
the good from the bad,

00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:50.120 align:middle line:84%
as Richard Dolan,
our good friend,

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:55.340 align:middle line:84%
talks about so eloquently with
this emerging transhumanism

00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:59.330 align:middle line:84%
creeping into our world
where robots, robotic tree

00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:01.380 align:middle line:90%
will merge with humanity.

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think we do need
to put the brakes on some

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:04.640 align:middle line:90%
of this stuff.

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:08.600 align:middle line:84%
At least try it out first and
see if it's right for people.

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And then the good stuff we
keep, the bad stuff we don't.

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:16.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we going to lose
who we are as individuals?

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:19.160 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: That is a great
philosophical question,

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.560 align:middle line:84%
and it hearkens back to
a book in the '80s called

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:22.460 align:middle line:90%
"Megatrends."

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:23.502 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember that one?

00:26:23.502 --> 00:26:24.680 align:middle line:90%
By John Naisbitt.

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And I always
remember, there was--

00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:25.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good memory.

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:27.590 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --a
chapter-- oh, yeah--

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:29.600 align:middle line:90%
called "High Tech High Touch."

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And he called it
back in the '80s.

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:35.000 align:middle line:84%
The more we get into
this high-tech world,

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.580 align:middle line:84%
the more we're going
to have a yearning

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:41.150 align:middle line:84%
to be close to one another,
because technology does

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:44.990 align:middle line:84%
seem to put up this divide
between us that separates us,

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:48.217 align:middle line:84%
and in many ways
makes us more lonely.

00:26:48.217 --> 00:26:50.300 align:middle line:84%
You know, you think you're
in touch with everybody

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:54.200 align:middle line:84%
on social media and how it has
brought the world much closer

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:58.430 align:middle line:84%
together, but it eliminates
that face-to-face contact.

00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And we're both so yearning
for the conferences

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.400 align:middle line:84%
that we used to speak at
so much, so many of which

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:07.940 align:middle line:84%
have been gone into
the online realm.

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:09.470 align:middle line:90%
And we miss it.

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:10.295 align:middle line:90%
I sure do.

00:27:10.295 --> 00:27:11.990 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
like human contact.

00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:13.115 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I like one on one.

00:27:13.115 --> 00:27:13.948 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:27:13.948 --> 00:27:16.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, I'm glad
you're here in the studio

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:19.940 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to home somewhere
where I would interview you

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:23.870 align:middle line:84%
via video, which works, but
there's a different feeling

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:25.732 align:middle line:90%
when you're one on one.

00:27:25.732 --> 00:27:26.690 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: There sure is.

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And you can't beat that
high tech, high touch when

00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:33.380 align:middle line:90%
it comes to human interaction.

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:35.420 align:middle line:90%
We're hardwired for it.

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:37.470 align:middle line:90%
We need it in our lives.

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we have
families and loved ones

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:43.520 align:middle line:84%
and we love to be
around our friends.

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And if that were
ever to go away,

00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:47.450 align:middle line:84%
I think we'd be a
very lonely world.

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:49.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How important
is our human brain

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:50.640 align:middle line:90%
to all of this, Brad?

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:51.440 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Ooh.

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:54.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's really where
the uber mind section

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:58.130 align:middle line:84%
comes into play, because
it is so much more

00:27:58.130 --> 00:28:01.680 align:middle line:84%
powerful than we've ever
been led to believe.

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:04.220 align:middle line:84%
And if we were to,
for example, start

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:09.470 align:middle line:84%
to de-calcify our pineal
gland and open that up, that's

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:13.730 align:middle line:84%
our third eye, the seat of the
soul, the I am, all that is.

00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:16.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's where
melatonin's created, right?

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:18.000 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: That and
many other things.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And it is also our ability to
astral travel, to remote view

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:28.610 align:middle line:84%
if you're able to train
your mind to do this.

00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:31.220 align:middle line:84%
And then amazing things
which could come out

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:35.480 align:middle line:84%
such as telepathy
and telekinesis,

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:39.020 align:middle line:84%
the bending of spoon like
Uri Geller does on stage.

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:42.110 align:middle line:84%
We have these human
abilities innate within us.

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:46.400 align:middle line:84%
If we were just to bring it out,
that would be the golden age.

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:48.680 align:middle line:84%
And that ability
to be a mentalist--

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:52.160 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't that be great if
we learned these trades when

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:53.480 align:middle line:90%
we were going to school?

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:54.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'd love it.

00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:55.440 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Maybe
that's the school--

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.273 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We'd get
straight A's, wouldn't we?

00:28:57.273 --> 00:28:59.340 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: [LAUGHS]

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:01.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Morgellons disease.

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:02.320 align:middle line:90%
You write about that.

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:03.120 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:04.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How come?

00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:07.200 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Because it's what's
happening in the world today.

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:11.770 align:middle line:84%
It's starting to emerge
all around the world.

00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:14.380 align:middle line:84%
It's even coming out
in pets and mammals.

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:16.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is it, as
far as you're concerned?

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: So it's
a fibrous material

00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:21.450 align:middle line:90%
that emerges from the skin.

00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:24.960 align:middle line:84%
And Joni Mitchell,
folk singer, had it.

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:27.810 align:middle line:90%
She called it the alien fiber.

00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It kind of
sticks out, right?

00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:30.210 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:32.520 align:middle line:84%
It'll protrude and
break through the skin.

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:35.593 align:middle line:84%
It'll also show
up in the organs.

00:29:35.593 --> 00:29:37.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People feel
like there's creepy

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:39.000 align:middle line:90%
crawly things under their skin?

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:39.875 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yep.

00:29:39.875 --> 00:29:41.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What a
horrible feeling.

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:42.090 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: It sure is.

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:46.240 align:middle line:84%
It's only been diagnosed
just late 1990s.

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.660 align:middle line:84%
So it's really a 21st
century affliction.

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:50.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The CDC finally
has recognized it

00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:52.670 align:middle line:90%
as an affliction or disease.

00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:53.610 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: No, not yet.

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:54.990 align:middle line:90%
They still--

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They brought
it up a little bit.

00:29:56.730 --> 00:29:57.570 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: They have
brought it up.

00:29:57.570 --> 00:29:58.570 align:middle line:90%
They have to address it.

00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:00.390 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
people that have it.

00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:05.280 align:middle line:84%
But they refer to it as
delusional parasitosis,

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:08.790 align:middle line:84%
that it's just all in
our heads and we're just

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:11.760 align:middle line:84%
scratching our skin and
creating these sores.

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:14.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You call it
Morgellons nanobytes.

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:15.100 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Nanobots.

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:15.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nanobots.

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:16.700 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:19.950 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: So nanobots are
nano, very small-scale bots

00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:23.070 align:middle line:84%
like robots that
they have a form

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:25.710 align:middle line:90%
of artificial life in them.

00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:29.820 align:middle line:84%
Just like all life in the
world, it seeks to survive.

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:30.870 align:middle line:90%
It wants to live.

00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:33.120 align:middle line:84%
It does not want
to be wiped out.

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:35.340 align:middle line:84%
Similar to the way
we've heard people

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:39.480 align:middle line:84%
who have had alien implants and
doctors trying to remove them,

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:42.120 align:middle line:90%
those implants evade capture.

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:44.080 align:middle line:90%
They're very hard to get out.

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:45.570 align:middle line:90%
Same thing with the Morgellons.

00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:48.950 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to be
captured and killed.

00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:51.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, in "Beyond
Esoteric," you know firsthand

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:53.450 align:middle line:90%
about Morgellons, don't you?

00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:55.100 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I have been
afflicted by it.

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's the one chapter
I write in first person.

00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And I want to just
help other people that

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:04.850 align:middle line:84%
have it try to understand what
it is and know that there's

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:10.080 align:middle line:84%
hope and there are very
homeopathic ways to resolve it

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:10.880 align:middle line:90%
and get over it.

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:12.547 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When did you
realize you had it

00:31:12.547 --> 00:31:14.150 align:middle line:90%
or that something was wrong?

00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:15.470 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: About 10 years ago.

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:16.910 align:middle line:90%
I've had it that long.

00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of blew it
off for a long time,

00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:22.500 align:middle line:84%
because there was just no
information out there about it.

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And I've just been constantly
researching it and doing

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:32.780 align:middle line:84%
different homeopathic
remedies to myself that

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:34.310 align:middle line:90%
are not harmful to the body.

00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:35.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it working?

00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:36.750 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: I think so.

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:39.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm pretty much over
the hump, but I wouldn't

00:31:39.410 --> 00:31:41.090 align:middle line:90%
say it's completely gone.

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:43.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm not entirely sure
there's a cure for it.

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:44.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's scary.

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:45.280 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yes.

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:46.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
think you got it?

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:48.410 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: I don't know.

00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:49.800 align:middle line:90%
I've traveled around the world.

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:52.760 align:middle line:84%
I've been now to all
seven continents.

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:56.180 align:middle line:84%
My dad thinks it was
living many years in Asia,

00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:57.480 align:middle line:90%
but I don't know about that.

00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:58.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You feel the fibers?

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:00.650 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Yeah, but
that was in the 1990s.

00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:01.850 align:middle line:90%
This is kind of before it came.

00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:03.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It kind of went away.

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:04.910 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Sofia Smallstorm
was a researcher.

00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:07.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if her videos
are on YouTube anymore.

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:11.000 align:middle line:84%
But she was collecting rainwater
on heavy chemtrail days

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.333 align:middle line:84%
and found these fibers
in the water samples.

00:32:15.333 --> 00:32:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you know research
scientist Clifford Carnicom?

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:18.550 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: I sure do.

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:20.008 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He talks
about Morgellons.

00:32:20.008 --> 00:32:20.945 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: He does.

00:32:20.945 --> 00:32:23.750 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What do you think
has caused this Morgellons

00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:25.468 align:middle line:10%
disease in people?

00:32:25.468 --> 00:32:27.260 align:middle line:10%
>>CLIFFORD CARNICOM:
Well, it is the result

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:29.090 align:middle line:10%
of a very specific microbe.

00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:34.100 align:middle line:10%
The answer is it's a submicron
caucus form in a bacteria.

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:36.480 align:middle line:90%
It is very similar--

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:39.060 align:middle line:84%
it has many attributes
of the bacterial world.

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:41.510 align:middle line:84%
However, I mentioned
earlier that it crosses over

00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:43.490 align:middle line:84%
into other domains,
and there's problems

00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:46.800 align:middle line:84%
with a straightforward
bacterial classification, OK?

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:51.230 align:middle line:84%
But I will make the claim
that that specific microbe

00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:52.400 align:middle line:90%
is responsible.

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:54.620 align:middle line:84%
And I will make it
based upon evidence.

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:58.670 align:middle line:84%
I have 400 basically research
papers that I will present.

00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:01.700 align:middle line:84%
If somebody wishes to
examine, I will say,

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:03.980 align:middle line:84%
you will have to
look at the evidence.

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:05.780 align:middle line:84%
You're not allowed--
no one is allowed

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:07.790 align:middle line:84%
to adopt a position
of skepticism

00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:09.270 align:middle line:90%
until you do the work.

00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:11.030 align:middle line:90%
You have to read the papers.

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And if you have
any doubt about it,

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.330 align:middle line:84%
you have to repeat
all of the work.

00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:16.910 align:middle line:84%
All the work I've done,
one of the standards

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:18.230 align:middle line:90%
is that of repeatability.

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:19.730 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the
rules of science.

00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:22.280 align:middle line:84%
That's a huge task
for 400 papers.

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:24.260 align:middle line:90%
Essentially, it's all there, OK?

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:27.380 align:middle line:84%
In addition to the
biomolecules of life,

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:30.600 align:middle line:84%
the next thing you need, if
you can get it, is the DNA.

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:33.080 align:middle line:84%
I have the DNA for
this organism, OK?

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:35.015 align:middle line:84%
I know how to get
it, and I have it.

00:33:35.015 --> 00:33:37.717 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was it done
intentionally, Clifford?

00:33:37.717 --> 00:33:39.050 align:middle line:90%
>>CARNICOM: We don't know again.

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:40.500 align:middle line:90%
We don't know the answer.

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:42.290 align:middle line:84%
How do we know the
answers to that which

00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:44.522 align:middle line:90%
we're not privy to, right?

00:33:44.522 --> 00:33:46.880 align:middle line:84%
We can try to work
to the answers,

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:47.900 align:middle line:90%
but we don't have them.

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:51.230 align:middle line:84%
What I can do is present
possibilities, right?

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:53.420 align:middle line:84%
You know, where
did it come from?

00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:54.520 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:56.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And when?

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:58.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: Possibilities
are first of all

00:33:58.210 --> 00:34:01.630 align:middle line:84%
to acknowledge and
be aware that even--

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:03.520 align:middle line:84%
and there are
always these claims

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:05.080 align:middle line:90%
of how we know everything.

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:07.210 align:middle line:84%
In the world of
microbiology, we're

00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:10.179 align:middle line:84%
lucky if we know
a few percentage

00:34:10.179 --> 00:34:13.000 align:middle line:84%
points of the number
of species that

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.350 align:middle line:90%
exist in the microbial world.

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:16.300 align:middle line:90%
We know nothing, OK?

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:19.420 align:middle line:84%
So one possibility is we don't
even know that it existed.

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:20.739 align:middle line:90%
That's one, OK?

00:34:20.739 --> 00:34:23.050 align:middle line:84%
But you'll have to look
at history and chronology.

00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:26.920 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, you have
an onset and an arrival

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:28.900 align:middle line:90%
of this particular condition.

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:31.040 align:middle line:84%
We're talking the
last 20, 30 years.

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.390 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have something
that has a history prior

00:34:33.390 --> 00:34:34.190 align:middle line:90%
to that we know of.

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:35.732 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what
you can say, though,

00:34:35.732 --> 00:34:37.989 align:middle line:84%
is you believe
Morgellons, this disease,

00:34:37.989 --> 00:34:40.929 align:middle line:84%
has come from geoengineering,
but you don't know

00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:42.969 align:middle line:90%
if it's intentional or not?

00:34:42.969 --> 00:34:44.190 align:middle line:90%
Could be a mistake.

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:45.565 align:middle line:84%
>>CARNICOM: No,
it's intentional.

00:34:45.565 --> 00:34:46.524 align:middle line:90%
We know that much.

00:34:46.524 --> 00:34:47.500 align:middle line:90%
It's by design.

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:49.929 align:middle line:84%
We know that much,
because it's dispersed.

00:34:49.929 --> 00:34:51.760 align:middle line:90%
It's dispersed.

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Cliff was getting a
little hot under the collar.

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:57.040 align:middle line:90%
This is very sensitive to him.

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:59.570 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: He's one of the leading
researchers in the field.

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:02.320 align:middle line:84%
I have the utmost respect
for what he's done.

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:03.610 align:middle line:90%
I've consulted with him.

00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:06.640 align:middle line:84%
I've put myself
into his data bank.

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And I would like
to go to his clinic

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:12.610 align:middle line:84%
and actually work
with him, because this

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:17.680 align:middle line:90%
is a very fluid knowledge base.

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:21.280 align:middle line:84%
It's moving very
quickly, and it changes.

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:24.820 align:middle line:84%
400 papers, you can
tell he's very well

00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:26.380 align:middle line:90%
versed in this subject.

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:28.810 align:middle line:90%
And that's what he does.

00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:31.990 align:middle line:84%
The Carnicom Institute
is devoted to this.

00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are the chances
that this came from chemtrails?

00:35:36.010 --> 00:35:38.620 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, that's
what Clifford Carnicom was

00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:41.080 align:middle line:84%
suggesting, and also
Sofia Smallstorm

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:45.340 align:middle line:84%
actually found samples of
it in heavy chemtrail days.

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:50.440 align:middle line:84%
As you know, they spray a
lot before and after storms,

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:53.800 align:middle line:84%
and it comes down
in those storms

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:56.930 align:middle line:84%
and can be collected and
examined under a microscope.

00:35:56.930 --> 00:35:59.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it could
come from chemtrails,

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:03.130 align:middle line:84%
could come from environment,
but you're convinced it's real.

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:05.350 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I'm convinced it's
real because I have it.

00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:07.015 align:middle line:84%
And I've been to
dermatologists--

00:36:07.015 --> 00:36:08.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did they say?

00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: They have
not served me, George.

00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:11.975 align:middle line:84%
They tried to put
me on psych meds.

00:36:11.975 --> 00:36:12.850 align:middle line:90%
They thought it was--

00:36:12.850 --> 00:36:14.267 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Everybody
who thinks they

00:36:14.267 --> 00:36:16.390 align:middle line:90%
have Morgellons is whacked out.

00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:17.625 align:middle line:90%
Is that what they think?

00:36:17.625 --> 00:36:19.750 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Well, that was
the case a couple years ago

00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:21.700 align:middle line:84%
when I was at the
top dermatology

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:23.560 align:middle line:90%
clinic in San Francisco.

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:28.540 align:middle line:84%
And they diagnosed me
as having parasitosis--

00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:32.710 align:middle line:84%
delusional parasitosis, that
I was just dreaming it all up.

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And they gave me some
creams, some topicals,

00:36:35.170 --> 00:36:36.190 align:middle line:90%
that didn't do anything.

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:37.930 align:middle line:90%
Maybe even made it worse.

00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:41.800 align:middle line:84%
And then I've moved to the
alternative treatments,

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:45.490 align:middle line:84%
including some of the research
that the Carnicom Institute has

00:36:45.490 --> 00:36:46.293 align:middle line:90%
come out with.

00:36:46.293 --> 00:36:48.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could these little
feelings under your skin

00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:49.930 align:middle line:90%
be parasites?

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:51.677 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: They're a
form of parasites.

00:36:51.677 --> 00:36:52.510 align:middle line:90%
They are certainly--

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:53.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That are moving?

00:36:53.590 --> 00:36:57.240 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --a pathogen, yep,
that have a life of their own.

00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And people didn't have this
even 30, 40, 50 years ago.

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:03.930 align:middle line:84%
So I agree with
Clifford Carnicom,

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:08.250 align:middle line:84%
that it is newly introduced
and widely dispersed.

00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:11.940 align:middle line:84%
It's also been found in
certain kind of foods as well

00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:14.700 align:middle line:90%
as consumer products.

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:17.430 align:middle line:84%
Looking at it
under a microscope,

00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:21.900 align:middle line:84%
I've heard it being in tampons
and other products that

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:25.657 align:middle line:84%
are very close to the
skin, close to the body.

00:37:25.657 --> 00:37:27.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you buy the
product, it's already in that?

00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:28.790 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yes.

00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:30.150 align:middle line:90%
It's being tainted.

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:33.285 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long would these
fibers get at one point on you?

00:37:33.285 --> 00:37:34.270 align:middle line:90%
Could you see them?

00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:35.310 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah, you can.

00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And you can also do
the red wine test,

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:41.400 align:middle line:84%
and that's holding a glass of
red wine or organic grape juice

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:42.840 align:middle line:90%
in your mouth for five minutes.

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:43.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:43.930 align:middle line:90%
What does that do?

00:37:43.930 --> 00:37:44.850 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Well, you spit it out.

00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:46.860 align:middle line:84%
It comes out of the
tongue and the soft tissue

00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:47.490 align:middle line:90%
and the throat--

00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:48.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And fibers
come out with it?

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:49.490 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yes.

00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:51.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can see
them all over the place?

00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:52.170 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: You can.

00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:52.620 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:54.620 align:middle line:84%
I was just at dinner last
night with some people

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:58.200 align:middle line:84%
that were interested, and we
did it, and everybody has it.

00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Deborah Tavares is also
saying that everybody has it

00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:03.150 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's people that are
Rh negative like my family,

00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:11.080 align:middle line:84%
that somehow our bodies
are trying to expel it,

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:13.320 align:middle line:84%
and that's why it
comes through the skin.

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:15.810 align:middle line:84%
But other people have it,
and it's kind of dormant.

00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:17.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's
next for Brad Olsen?

00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:20.070 align:middle line:10%
>>OLSEN: Well, I'm doing
a lot of interviews

00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:21.300 align:middle line:10%
and talking about this.

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:24.780 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to the 5D
conference in Las Vegas

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:30.330 align:middle line:10%
and doing a whole lot of
events online, and still trying

00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:33.960 align:middle line:10%
to enjoy my life and go
skiing while we still have

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.177 align:middle line:10%
snow for the next six weeks.

00:38:35.177 --> 00:38:37.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, keep fighting
the good fight, Brad.

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:38.950 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: It's always wonderful
to talk to you, George.

00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:39.970 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me on.

00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:42.262 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So great having
people like Brad Olsen around.

00:38:42.262 --> 00:38:44.280 align:middle line:10%
His book, of course,
"Beyond Esoteric,"

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:48.210 align:middle line:10%
to help teach us and guide
us so we can fight back.

00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:49.200 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:51.360 align:middle line:10%
