>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.382 --> 00:00:08.840 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.640 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.210 align:middle line:84%

really happened.

>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.240 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.285 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:26.494 --> 00:00:27.910 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY:
Well, welcome back

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.950 align:middle line:10%
to another stunning
edition of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.620 align:middle line:10%
You know, they say there are
two things we just cannot avoid:

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.270 align:middle line:10%
death and taxes.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.030 align:middle line:10%
And with me, of
course, is an expert.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.700 align:middle line:10%
We're going to talk about one
facet of that, Raymond Moody,

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.890 align:middle line:10%
near death experiences.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.080 align:middle line:90%
Noted author, of course.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.592 align:middle line:84%
His bestselling book,
"Life After Life."

00:00:47.592 --> 00:00:48.800 align:middle line:90%
It's always good to have you.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>>RAYMOND MOODY: It's
always great to be --

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Always.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: --with
you, George, always.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.250 align:middle line:90%
It's just so much fun.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.804 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You are so upbeat.

00:00:54.804 --> 00:00:57.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, I've been through
my periods of depression,

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.030 align:middle line:90%
too, like us all.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.070 align:middle line:10%
But you'll find at 69, life
becomes a lot smoother, really,

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.060 align:middle line:10%
in terms of those ups and downs.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.810 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It is,
especially when you

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.460 align:middle line:10%
know what you know about
what's on the other side.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.650 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: Well, you know, I
think when you and I met,

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.050 align:middle line:10%
I probably just wasn't sure.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.510 align:middle line:10%
Reason is my only way
of figuring it out.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.670 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, in the
last year or so,

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.070 align:middle line:84%
I've had to sort of give up
and admit that it seems to me

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.010 align:middle line:84%
that the only way I
can think about this

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.250 align:middle line:84%
now is to acknowledge
that when we die,

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.311 align:middle line:84%
we do go into some other
dimension of existence.

00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:39.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whatever it might be.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.495 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: That's right.

00:01:40.495 --> 00:01:42.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in this, Raymond?

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, was there an
episode in your life

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.360 align:middle line:90%
a long, long time ago?

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.260 align:middle line:84%
Because you are-- Elisabeth
Kubler-Ross and your name

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.897 align:middle line:90%
comes up all the time.

00:01:53.897 --> 00:01:54.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yeah.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.570 align:middle line:84%
What happened to me,
George, was that I just

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.380 align:middle line:84%
had zero religious background,
which is odd for somebody

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.210 align:middle line:84%
from Portaldale,
Georgia, I suppose.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.070 align:middle line:90%
But I just didn't.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You just weren't
brought up that way, right?

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.188 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: I just wasn't.

00:02:06.188 --> 00:02:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And my thing was astronomy,
and from the age of seven.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.280 align:middle line:10%
So at the age of 18, I went away
to the University of Virginia

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.279 align:middle line:10%
with the intention of
being an astronomy major.

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:17.070 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I love it.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.590 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: But I had gotten
interested in philosophy

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.390 align:middle line:10%
in high school.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.290 align:middle line:10%
So my first semester at UVA,
I took a course in philosophy.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.960 align:middle line:10%
And the first thing they had us
to read was Plato's "Republic,"

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.000 align:middle line:10%
which is about, actually,
at the end, a near-death--

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The other side.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: --experience.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.150 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.910 align:middle line:84%
And so the fact that Plato
took this question seriously

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.010 align:middle line:90%
impressed me.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.470 align:middle line:84%
As incidentally,
George, if you wrote up

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.210 align:middle line:84%
the history of the
ancient Greek philosophers

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.400 align:middle line:84%
and just submitted it to
the "National Inquirer,"

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.960 align:middle line:84%
they would turn
it down because it

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.510 align:middle line:84%
would be too sensational
for anybody to believe.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.310 align:middle line:90%
But it was a reality.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And these early
philosophers collected

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.010 align:middle line:84%
cases of what they
call the revenants,

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.170 align:middle line:84%
or people who had-- believed
to be died and returned,

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.610 align:middle line:84%
and so I knew about that
from Greek philosophy.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.530 align:middle line:84%
Then in 1965, I met
Dr. George Richie,

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.380 align:middle line:84%
who was a professor
of psychiatry

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.080 align:middle line:84%
there at UVA at that time, who
had had such an experience,

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.140 align:middle line:84%
and then I got
really interested.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And since that time, I've
talked with literally thousands

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.760 align:middle line:84%
of people from all over the
world who were brought back

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.490 align:middle line:84%
from death and had these
amazing experiences.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And where has
the time gone, Raymond.

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:32.195 align:middle line:90%
My god.

00:03:32.195 --> 00:03:32.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Where?

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just clicking by.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: I know, I know.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.130 align:middle line:84%
I've got a 15-year-old
and a 13-year-old,

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.624 align:middle line:90%
both adopted at birth.

00:03:40.624 --> 00:03:41.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.940 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: And when
I look at them,

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.220 align:middle line:10%
I see these little babies,
sort of holographically,

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.220 align:middle line:10%
all the images of
all the memories

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.735 align:middle line:10%
all sort of superimposed.

00:03:51.735 --> 00:03:53.650 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's amazing.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you were
starting to study this,

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.320 align:middle line:84%
and like you said, you didn't
have a religious background,

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.860 align:middle line:90%
which is difficult to come from.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.650 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have a strong
religious background,

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.564 align:middle line:84%
you really don't
believe in a lot--

00:04:07.564 --> 00:04:08.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: That's right.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.135 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --life after
death and things like that.

00:04:11.135 --> 00:04:14.400 align:middle line:84%
That convincing point for
you, when you realized,

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.370 align:middle line:84%
you know what, there's
something here.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.370 align:middle line:84%
There's something
on the other side.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.649 align:middle line:84%
Do you even, at your
point now in your career,

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:24.790 align:middle line:84%
are you still
changing a little bit?

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: I still realize that
it's personal in the sense

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:35.500 align:middle line:84%
that there is no technically
correct logical process you can

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.150 align:middle line:84%
go through to infer that
there's life after death.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.290 align:middle line:84%
But I think that is a
problem with our logic, which

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.390 align:middle line:84%
comes to us ultimately from
Aristotle, who predicated it

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.890 align:middle line:90%
on--

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:48.848 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Another Greek.

00:04:48.848 --> 00:04:49.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: That's right.

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.650 align:middle line:84%
Predicated it on literal meaning
and the true/false distinction.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And so the question
of life after death

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.740 align:middle line:90%
doesn't fit into that format.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.710 align:middle line:84%
But I think that--
I think, George,

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.850 align:middle line:84%
that we are soon on the--
we're on the cusp here

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.970 align:middle line:84%
of amazing developments in the
genuine, rational investigation

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.120 align:middle line:90%
of the afterlife question.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.770 align:middle line:84%
So about a year and a half
ago, I reached the point

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.920 align:middle line:84%
where I ran out of
wiggle room, and I

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.393 align:middle line:84%
realized that there's
something to this.

00:05:20.393 --> 00:05:20.976 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:05:20.976 --> 00:05:21.890 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yeah.

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: After all these years,
only a year and a half ago?

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.884 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yeah, yeah.

00:05:25.884 --> 00:05:28.300 align:middle line:84%
You know, I mean, I'm sure
everybody's heard these things.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.580 align:middle line:84%
But as people come
back from death,

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.170 align:middle line:84%
they tell us that they
get out of their body,

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.495 align:middle line:84%
and they go through the
tunnel into this light,

00:05:35.495 --> 00:05:37.460 align:middle line:90%
and they see their life review.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.490 align:middle line:84%
They meet their relatives
who've died and so on.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And so that is well-ingrained
into our culture.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And we also know that there's
a standard format for debating

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.760 align:middle line:84%
that, namely, that some people
sort of sit there and say,

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.040 align:middle line:84%
yeah, well, it indicates
there's an afterlife.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.160 align:middle line:84%
But other people come
along and say, no, this

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.050 align:middle line:84%
is just the cutoff
of the oxygen flow

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.220 align:middle line:84%
to the brain and the
hallucinatory things and so on.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.750 align:middle line:84%
But what happened
was I met a man

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.160 align:middle line:84%
some years ago out West, who
had this amazing near-death

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.130 align:middle line:84%
experience when he was
in a horrific car crash,

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:19.980 align:middle line:84%
and his wife was
killed instantly.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.340 align:middle line:84%
So he came up to me
several years back

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.880 align:middle line:90%
talking about his experience.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.600 align:middle line:84%
So I encouraged him
to write this up,

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.980 align:middle line:84%
because he's an
artist, and I thought

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.590 align:middle line:84%
that's how artists process
things, which he did.

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:38.387 align:middle line:84%
Then in August of 2013,
2012, he sent me his book.

00:06:38.387 --> 00:06:39.470 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Only a few years.

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:40.230 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: Yeah.

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.740 align:middle line:10%
2012, he sent me his book.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.730 align:middle line:10%
And then less than two
weeks later, he called me up

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:50.630 align:middle line:10%
and he said in writing--
looking through his own book,

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.030 align:middle line:10%
he realized that
he had mentioned

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:55.880 align:middle line:10%
the name of the trauma
surgeon who saved his life.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.630 align:middle line:84%
He hadn't told the
doctor about this,

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:01.120 align:middle line:84%
so he thought, well, you
know, it's not polite.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.740 align:middle line:84%
So he contacted the
doctor and invited him

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.020 align:middle line:84%
to lunch, when he told him
the near-death experience.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.810 align:middle line:84%
So when the doctor
listened to this--

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:10.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's in shock, right?

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: --he became
silent and said,

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.780 align:middle line:84%
well, I've never
told anybody this,

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.030 align:middle line:84%
but that night you
came into the hospital,

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.660 align:middle line:90%
I was talking with your wife.

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:22.760 align:middle line:84%
I felt the presence of your
wife in the ER-- I mean,

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.260 align:middle line:84%
in the operating room, who
had died in the accident.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And then, as this
developed, so did

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.290 align:middle line:84%
the nurse have a
similar experience.

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:30.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: So did his brother
who came into the hospital.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:38.650 align:middle line:10%
And so when these things start
leaking out to the bystanders--

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:41.680 align:middle line:10%
and I call these shared-death
experiences, where

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:46.770 align:middle line:10%
not the person who almost dies
and recovers tells the story,

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.680 align:middle line:10%
but rather the people who are
standing around the bedside

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:55.360 align:middle line:10%
say that as grandma died, they
left their physical bodies

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.840 align:middle line:10%
and went towards this light.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.590 align:middle line:84%
Or that they saw grandma's
spirit leave her body,

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:02.850 align:middle line:84%
or that the room
filled with light,

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:06.470 align:middle line:84%
or they saw the apparitions
of the dying person's

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:09.930 align:middle line:84%
relatives come in
to take them away.

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:11.990 align:middle line:10%
And incredibly,
George, I even have

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:16.110 align:middle line:10%
plenty of cases where the
bystander empathically

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:22.510 align:middle line:10%
co-lived the dying life review
of the person who passed away.

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:25.790 align:middle line:10%
And at that point, you see,
it becomes rather arbitrary.

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:29.534 align:middle line:10%
I mean, am I going
to trust what--

00:08:29.534 --> 00:08:30.700 align:middle line:10%
well, let's put it this way.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.990 align:middle line:10%
I have so many medical
colleagues whose judgment

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:37.015 align:middle line:10%
I trust, who, if heaven
forbid, I got sick, I would--

00:08:37.015 --> 00:08:38.640 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You'd go
there in a heartbeat.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: --go there,
just like that,

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:42.919 align:middle line:84%
who've had these
experiences themselves.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And they tell me,
yeah, this is real.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And I ran out of wiggle
room with the story

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:50.070 align:middle line:90%
that I mentioned.

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:52.325 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you want to
run out of wiggle room?

00:08:52.325 --> 00:08:55.515 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: Well, yes, George,
because-- let me say this.

00:08:55.515 --> 00:08:58.680 align:middle line:10%
This is going to of come as
a shocker, but hear me out.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.040 align:middle line:10%
I am a skeptic.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:03.030 align:middle line:10%
Now, I don't mean these
people, the pseudo-skeptics

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:06.344 align:middle line:10%
as I call them, this fascist
organization, the committee.

00:09:06.344 --> 00:09:07.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The non-believers--

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:08.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: That's right.

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:09.151 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --of everything.

00:09:09.151 --> 00:09:11.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: The skeptical inquirer.

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:13.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, the reason I get
so angry about that group

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.290 align:middle line:84%
is that I teach ancient
Greek philosophy.

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.870 align:middle line:10%
So when I get to the Skeptics,
I have to backtrack and explain

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:24.660 align:middle line:10%
that, no, a skeptic is not
what these ideologues tell us.

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.940 align:middle line:84%
But what a skeptic
is, it was invented

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.970 align:middle line:84%
by Pyrrho, who was
a Greek philosopher

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:31.960 align:middle line:90%
in the wake of Aristotle.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.650 align:middle line:84%
Aristotle taught us
how to codify logic

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:37.260 align:middle line:84%
and, in effect, taught
us a set of procedures

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.140 align:middle line:90%
for drawing conclusions.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:42.460 align:middle line:84%
But after mastering
this, the skeptic thought

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:45.740 align:middle line:84%
was, well then, what if we
don't draw the conclusion?

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And this was like a
spiritual quest in essense.

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:51.780 align:middle line:84%
But the reason they did this,
they even had these manuals

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:53.730 align:middle line:84%
to tell you, like,
don't draw a conclusion,

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:55.190 align:middle line:90%
there's a table here.

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:58.270 align:middle line:10%
It might be a cardboard
cut-out, or an optical illusion,

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:00.130 align:middle line:10%
or blah, blah, blah.

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:02.890 align:middle line:84%
But the reason they
did this was they

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:06.040 align:middle line:84%
found that if they
practiced this assiduously,

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:10.470 align:middle line:84%
then they would have a kind
of mind-expanding experience.

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:11.600 align:middle line:90%
And it really does work.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've been this
way for many years.

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:14.055 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We've done that.

00:10:14.055 --> 00:10:14.638 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yeah.

00:10:14.638 --> 00:10:17.020 align:middle line:90%


00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:18.860 align:middle line:84%
If you think of
it geometrically,

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.580 align:middle line:84%
and everybody else is
rushing in this direction

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:25.430 align:middle line:84%
to get to the conclusion,
but you are withholding

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:29.470 align:middle line:84%
a conclusion, and that is what
the essence of being a skeptic

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:33.270 align:middle line:84%
is is to refrain
from a conclusion.

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:36.950 align:middle line:84%
Then we see side
pathways of inquiry

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:38.950 align:middle line:84%
that nobody else had
noticed because they're all

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:40.400 align:middle line:90%
heading in this direction.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.930 align:middle line:90%
And that's being a skeptic.

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:42.890 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But being a
skeptic is healthy.

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:45.195 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: It is.

00:10:45.195 --> 00:10:46.020 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And it is not only
that, it's fun.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And so the reason why I went
through this long period

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.860 align:middle line:84%
of just not knowing
was that I never

00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:00.870 align:middle line:84%
really took seriously the idea
that this was brain chemistry.

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:03.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: DId you have doubts?

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:09.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: I never had
any doubt that it's not

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.820 align:middle line:84%
neurophysiological, because
I knew all along that-- one

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:15.500 align:middle line:84%
of my medical school
professors told me

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.920 align:middle line:84%
about her own empathic
death experience,

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:22.460 align:middle line:84%
her shared-death experience when
she resuscitated her mother.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:25.220 align:middle line:10%
And she was not sick, but
she had all these things.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:28.500 align:middle line:10%
So I knew it wasn't just the
cutoff of the oxygen flow.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:29.550 align:middle line:10%
But I just didn't know.

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:31.020 align:middle line:10%
I couldn't draw a conclusion.

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.912 align:middle line:84%
But when I came across
this case, like I said,

00:11:33.912 --> 00:11:36.090 align:middle line:84%
a year and a half
ago, I consciously

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:40.000 align:middle line:84%
detected myself, when I was
trying to put this together,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.080 align:middle line:84%
trying to run away and
escape and rationalize

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:47.430 align:middle line:84%
rather than just saying,
straightforwardly, what is.

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:51.480 align:middle line:84%
So as incredible as it may
seem, I'm ready to say here,

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.099 align:middle line:84%
yeah, there is a
life after death,

00:11:54.099 --> 00:11:55.140 align:middle line:90%
to my utter astonishment.

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:58.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know, when
you think of life itself,

00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:00.820 align:middle line:84%
how it started, how
we got here, you

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:04.200 align:middle line:84%
have got to take the
next logical conclusion

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:07.590 align:middle line:90%
and simply say it exists.

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:10.740 align:middle line:84%
Life after death is the
same process of the birth.

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.866 align:middle line:84%
We don't understand it,
but it's got to be there.

00:12:13.866 --> 00:12:15.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, you're
a good Platonist there,

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:17.198 align:middle line:84%
and that's the way
he looked at it.

00:12:17.198 --> 00:12:20.720 align:middle line:84%
You know, to him, time
wasn't linear like we think

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:21.710 align:middle line:90%
but cyclic.

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:23.724 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, yeah.

00:12:23.724 --> 00:12:25.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I've always
thought that, always.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:26.990 align:middle line:90%
I've had doubts, Raymond.

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:29.064 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had a
friend of mine died

00:12:29.064 --> 00:12:30.730 align:middle line:84%
five years ago in a
motorcycle accident.

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.260 align:middle line:90%
It was a horrible story.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was on the air
doing "Coast to Coast."

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:36.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Oh, my.

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:40.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And his girlfriend
sends me a text message.

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.400 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Oh, no, George.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:45.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I generally
have my phone close by,

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:47.640 align:middle line:84%
but not where it's
interrupting me.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And I could hear
it vibrate, right?

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, jeez,
who is texting me?

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:54.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm on the air.

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.070 align:middle line:90%
So I go to a commercial break.

00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And I look at it and it
said, "Jason is dead."

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Oh, my god.

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:03.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And I'm going, what?

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:04.760 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And when I had a
moment, I called her.

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And she said he had died
in a motorcycle accident.

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:15.860 align:middle line:84%
He foolishly was doing
like 110 miles an hour.

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And a little old lady was
driving her car, and he hit it.

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:26.170 align:middle line:84%
Went flying and landed
atop a stop sign.

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:27.387 align:middle line:90%
It almost severed him.

00:13:27.387 --> 00:13:28.220 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Oh, my god.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:28.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He died.

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:29.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Oh, my god.

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:30.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We go to the funeral.

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:32.090 align:middle line:90%
I hate funerals.

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:35.475 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking
at him, he's cold.

00:13:35.475 --> 00:13:38.050 align:middle line:90%
He's in the coffin.

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:40.430 align:middle line:84%
And for the first
time in my life,

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:43.180 align:middle line:90%
I doubted life after death.

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:48.120 align:middle line:84%
I looked at this body and
I'm saying, this is it.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:49.540 align:middle line:90%
It's done.

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:51.230 align:middle line:90%
He has no idea what's going on.

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:53.380 align:middle line:90%
He's dead.

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:54.570 align:middle line:90%
And there is no more.

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:55.460 align:middle line:90%
It's over.

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:59.045 align:middle line:84%
It was the coldest
feeling I've ever had.

00:13:59.045 --> 00:14:01.490 align:middle line:90%
I had shivers.

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:04.690 align:middle line:84%
I went back, did my
show the next night.

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And then it started to come back
again, the old me and my belief

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:10.780 align:middle line:84%
systems, that there
is life after death.

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:12.930 align:middle line:10%
But I have to tell
you, the thought

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:18.660 align:middle line:10%
that it ends and just ends
is the worst feeling ever.

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:20.470 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: Now, that is
so fascinating to me,

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:23.770 align:middle line:10%
George, because I have
really, most of my life,

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:25.760 align:middle line:10%
entertained the
opposite opinion.

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, my best
friend of 30 years

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:31.270 align:middle line:84%
was Milton Friedman,
not the economist.

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:32.880 align:middle line:90%
My Milton always used to say--

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.576 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who just passed
away, by the way, that one.

00:14:34.576 --> 00:14:35.742 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: That's right, yeah.

00:14:35.742 --> 00:14:38.920 align:middle line:84%
But my Milton always used to say
there are two Milton Friedmans.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.330 align:middle line:84%
One has the economic
solution, and the other

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:43.142 align:middle line:90%
has the economic problem.

00:14:43.142 --> 00:14:43.975 align:middle line:90%
And he was that one.

00:14:43.975 --> 00:14:45.030 align:middle line:90%
And he was also famous.

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:49.230 align:middle line:84%
He was a big-- special
assistant to President Ford,

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:51.370 align:middle line:84%
knew every president
since Truman, but just

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:53.210 align:middle line:90%
a thoroughly wonderful guy.

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And Milton and I used to
talk about this a lot.

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:57.870 align:middle line:84%
And we kind of
agreed that there's

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:03.140 align:middle line:84%
a certain kind of aesthetic
pleasingness to think,

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:07.460 align:middle line:84%
well, I'm born, I
live, and I die.

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:10.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way I'd always
sort of thought about it.

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:12.820 align:middle line:10%
But now it's a
major revision to me

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:16.380 align:middle line:10%
to have to shift all
this around to say, well,

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:23.050 align:middle line:10%
now I'm beginning to think
or I'm sort of confident now

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:24.820 align:middle line:10%
that there is something
after this and--

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.810 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Too many
people have seen things,

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:28.884 align:middle line:10%

00:15:28.884 --> 00:15:29.800 align:middle line:10%
You've talked to them.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:31.010 align:middle line:10%
I've talked to them.

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:35.330 align:middle line:10%
You have to conclude there's
something going on here.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:36.330 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: That is right.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:39.240 align:middle line:10%
Because it's like
when your logic begins

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:42.040 align:middle line:10%
to get crystallized,
and it makes

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:46.700 align:middle line:10%
you have to deny lots of stuff
that you can perceive just

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:50.410 align:middle line:10%
right by looking at it, then
you know that the problem is not

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:53.240 align:middle line:10%
necessarily in the
phenomena, but it's

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.670 align:middle line:10%
in the structure we
use to think about it.

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:57.700 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I've reached.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:59.690 align:middle line:84%
I think that, yeah,
there's an afterlife.

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And so we better
get busy thinking

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:04.710 align:middle line:84%
about new ways of
thinking logically--

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:07.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

pretty refreshing outlook with

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:20.840 align:middle line:10%

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.034 align:middle line:10%
a good life, to help the

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:30.530 align:middle line:10%
that I think is so
important for people.

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:36.450 align:middle line:84%
Why does mainstream religion
try to put this fear of God

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:40.430 align:middle line:84%
in us, that when you
die and if you're bad,

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:42.150 align:middle line:90%
you're going to hell?

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:43.850 align:middle line:90%
It's over for you.

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:45.480 align:middle line:90%
Why do they do that to us?

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.134 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: That's
curious to me, too.

00:16:47.134 --> 00:16:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:50.395 align:middle line:84%
plenty of religions
that don't do that.

00:16:50.395 --> 00:16:51.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:54.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: You know, I can
think of lots of denominations

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.800 align:middle line:90%
that were very comforting to me.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.010 align:middle line:84%
But then when "Life
After Life" came out,

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:02.250 align:middle line:84%
you should have seen some
of the communications I got.

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:04.430 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you're in with the

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:14.859 align:middle line:84%
that for you it's easy

00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:17.020 align:middle line:84%
For me, it's easy
to say I don't know.

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:18.354 align:middle line:90%

00:17:18.354 --> 00:17:19.770 align:middle line:84%

>>MOODY: --gifted

But there are a lot more
people in the world who

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:29.100 align:middle line:10%
are terrified of having
to say, "I don't know."

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:33.240 align:middle line:84%
So in some sort of bizarre
way, it's comforting to them

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:36.130 align:middle line:84%
to adopt this mechanical
ideology so that--

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:38.405 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And their business

And afraid of saying,
"I don't know."

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:43.760 align:middle line:90%
So it's fear-based.

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.760 align:middle line:90%
And I understand fear.

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:48.150 align:middle line:84%

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:56.350 align:middle line:84%
It's just a difference in what

But you know this concept
of an event boundary?

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:16.130 align:middle line:10%
What an event boundary is is
like when you're in one room,

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:19.141 align:middle line:10%
and you decide to go into
another room to get something,

00:18:19.141 --> 00:18:19.640 align:middle line:10%
right?

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.880 align:middle line:10%
And as soon as you go through

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.010 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Your forget what

>>MOODY: That's right.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.280 align:middle line:84%

an event boundary.

>>NOORY: I do that now when I'm
ready to go to an internet site

back and you're ready to go,

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:33.485 align:middle line:90%

that's a great example,

00:18:36.496 --> 00:18:37.910 align:middle line:90%
like an event boundary.

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's
kind of an event

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:43.210 align:middle line:84%
boundary between that
other state of existence

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:44.020 align:middle line:90%
and this one.

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:46.105 align:middle line:84%
And that's described,
for example, in Plato.

00:18:46.105 --> 00:18:49.820 align:middle line:84%
He talks about how just
before people come back

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:52.160 align:middle line:84%
from the other
side to this world,

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.570 align:middle line:84%
they go through a process where
they forget all they know.

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:57.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's part of the
learning process.

00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:01.010 align:middle line:84%
Because if we did come in here
with a bunch of knowledge,

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:02.940 align:middle line:84%
it sure would interfere
with our ability--

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:03.981 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With everything.

00:19:03.981 --> 00:19:05.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: --to

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:08.450 align:middle line:84%
So I kind of think that we
can't really know for sure.

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And yet there are many-- if
you look at thousands of cases,

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:18.160 align:middle line:84%
then what I see is that
people who have extremely

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:21.240 align:middle line:84%
lengthy cardiac arrests,
these kinds of things

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.720 align:middle line:84%
that really don't
make sense medically,

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.900 align:middle line:84%
who had these really
profound experiences,

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:28.510 align:middle line:84%
say that they become
aware that there

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:31.350 align:middle line:90%
are other levels of reality.

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:33.710 align:middle line:84%
For example, some
people say that they

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:36.820 align:middle line:84%
can see a level
of reality-- they

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:39.370 align:middle line:84%
can see into this
physical reality

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:41.230 align:middle line:90%
that you and I are in right now.

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:44.600 align:middle line:84%
But they can also
see in and among us,

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:48.580 align:middle line:84%
there seem to be other people
who, for want of a better term,

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:50.734 align:middle line:84%
don't quite realize
that they are dead.

00:19:50.734 --> 00:19:51.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're dead.

00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:56.238 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Exactly.

00:19:56.238 --> 00:20:00.020 align:middle line:10%
And people say that-- And they
say even when you see this,

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:02.840 align:middle line:10%
you see these people are kind
of dim and they don't get it.

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:05.480 align:middle line:10%
It's kind of like I like to say
that they got out of their body

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:09.500 align:middle line:10%
on the wrong side or something,
and they're repeating this.

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.205 align:middle line:84%
But then in and out
among them, there

00:20:11.205 --> 00:20:13.882 align:middle line:84%
are these people,
enlightened people,

00:20:13.882 --> 00:20:15.382 align:middle line:84%
who are trying to
say, hey, wake up.

00:20:15.382 --> 00:20:16.650 align:middle line:90%
Snap out of it.

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:20.280 align:middle line:10%
But then a lot of
people say also

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:26.100 align:middle line:10%
that they become aware of an
entire other realm of existence

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.430 align:middle line:10%
in which there
seem to be people,

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:32.520 align:middle line:10%

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:46.930 align:middle line:84%
get a vague idea of
what this is like.

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And then beyond that,
people will tell you

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:53.276 align:middle line:84%
that they see realms that
seem to be sheer light.

00:20:53.276 --> 00:20:54.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Different
levels, right?

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:55.233 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yeah.

00:20:55.233 --> 00:20:57.280 align:middle line:10%
That everything in
this light realm

00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:00.390 align:middle line:10%
seems to be constructed
of sheer light

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:02.280 align:middle line:10%
and that the people
there just seem

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:06.680 align:middle line:10%
to be tuned into love and joy.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:10.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think astral
projection is part of almost

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:12.089 align:middle line:90%
like the death and dying cycle.

00:21:12.089 --> 00:21:13.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: I think so, too.

00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:13.405 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

>>NOORY: And Hayward
Carrington, Sylvan Muldoon

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.220 align:middle line:84%
wrote a book called "The
Projection of the Astral Body"

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:20.520 align:middle line:84%
a long time ago, one
of the first books I

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.350 align:middle line:90%
read when I was young.

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And they talked about different
levels that they were at.

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:29.110 align:middle line:84%
They said there were some
levels you don't want to be at.

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:30.930 align:middle line:90%
It just felt like hell.

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:32.360 align:middle line:90%
It was a ghoulish.

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.490 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't pleasant.

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:35.930 align:middle line:90%
And maybe that's what hell is.

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:38.810 align:middle line:84%
Maybe religion has
manifested hell

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:40.870 align:middle line:84%
with the devil and
stuff like that,

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:43.780 align:middle line:84%
but it's really these
different tiers.

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:46.220 align:middle line:84%
But he did say the
higher up he got,

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:48.200 align:middle line:90%
the more enlightened he felt.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yeah, yeah.

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:51.747 align:middle line:84%
That light becomes more
and more of a part of it.

00:21:51.747 --> 00:21:52.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:52.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yeah.

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:55.150 align:middle line:84%
But you know, I'm not saying
these things as absolute.

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:56.670 align:middle line:84%
This is just what
people tell me.

00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:59.250 align:middle line:84%
But I gather from
what people say

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:03.910 align:middle line:90%
is the next world is layered.

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:05.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
afraid of dying?

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:09.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: I am not

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm not afraid of death.

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:16.000 align:middle line:84%
But lest that sounds macho,
which I definitely am not,

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.550 align:middle line:84%
let me just say it's
life that scares me.

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:22.210 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of stuff
here that's scary.

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:23.502 align:middle line:90%
Right now, I don't want to die.

00:22:23.502 --> 00:22:24.376 align:middle line:90%

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:33.705 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:22:33.705 --> 00:22:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Close to it.

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:37.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: --I would have

00:22:38.589 --> 00:22:40.630 align:middle line:84%
But now I've got a
15-year-old and a 13-year-old.

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:41.963 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You want to watch them.

00:22:41.963 --> 00:22:45.652 align:middle line:84%

00:22:45.652 --> 00:22:46.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You know what?

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:48.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm exactly the same way.

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:52.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
leave things undone.

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And there are many things
I haven't accomplished yet

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:59.910 align:middle line:84%
that I want to do, for myself,
for the people I care about.

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And if I jumped off
right now, I truly

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:08.047 align:middle line:84%
would feel as if
I cheated myself--

00:23:08.047 --> 00:23:08.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yeah.

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.880 align:middle line:90%
And I--

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:09.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: --and I
don't want to do that.

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: --would feel as though
I cheated my kids, you know,

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:12.099 align:middle line:90%
I guess.

00:23:12.099 --> 00:23:13.710 align:middle line:90%
Now I've got two grown kids.

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:17.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm not leaving them out,
but they're doing great.

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And I've got a wonderful
grandson, and he's doing great.

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:21.470 align:middle line:90%
He's got his parents.

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:21.980 align:middle line:90%
But the 15--

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:22.938 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How old is he?

00:23:22.938 --> 00:23:25.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: --and 13-year-old--
my grandson is 6.

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:30.550 align:middle line:84%
But the 13 and the 15-year-old,
see, all they've got is me.

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
interesting studies

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:35.750 align:middle line:84%
that have come out in the
last few years that indicate

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:42.060 align:middle line:84%
that if somebody loses their
parent before the age of 20,

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:43.985 align:middle line:84%
it becomes
particularly difficult,

00:23:43.985 --> 00:23:44.860 align:middle line:90%
the grieving process.

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:46.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's absolutely true.

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.206 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: And you know, the
articles don't speculate.

00:23:48.206 --> 00:23:50.620 align:middle line:84%
But what I think about
that is, remember

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:53.660 align:middle line:84%
how when you were
14 and 15, your dad

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.750 align:middle line:84%
was the stupidest guy
in the world, right?

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:58.934 align:middle line:84%
Then when you're 20, you
make that comeback, right?

00:23:58.934 --> 00:23:59.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:02.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: So I suspect that what
happens is if you get caught

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:03.630 align:middle line:90%
in that--

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:04.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That cycle.

00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:04.930 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yeah.

00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:05.620 align:middle line:90%
And you can't--

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:06.578 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And he's gone.

00:24:06.578 --> 00:24:09.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: --go back to make that
reunion when you're about 20,

00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:10.300 align:middle line:90%
then it's harder.

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:13.412 align:middle line:84%
So for my kids, I hope I can
stay around a few more years.

00:24:13.412 --> 00:24:13.995 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:24:13.995 --> 00:24:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the living
process is all about.

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:19.540 align:middle line:84%
But it's also exciting to
look at the possibilities

00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:21.500 align:middle line:90%
of the other side.

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:23.420 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk with
you in our next program

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:24.770 align:middle line:90%
about reincarnation--

00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:25.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Oh, cool.

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:27.091 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --and get
your take on that.

00:24:27.091 --> 00:24:31.041 align:middle line:84%
But it also seems that Hollywood
is grasping this subject, too,

00:24:31.041 --> 00:24:31.540 align:middle line:90%
Raymond.

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:35.255 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Eben
Alexander, the doctor,

00:24:35.255 --> 00:24:38.070 align:middle line:84%
he's done well with his
book, the movie that's

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:41.820 align:middle line:84%
out there now about
life after death.

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:43.420 align:middle line:90%
Hollywood has embraced that.

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:46.100 align:middle line:84%
People are fascinated
with this subject.

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:48.400 align:middle line:84%
Is it because we're
all headed there?

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.460 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, I think it's
probably multi-factorial.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:54.450 align:middle line:84%
However, I think a
really big thing is

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:58.850 align:middle line:84%
that I've noticed just since I
was into this in my 20's, and

00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:00.720 align:middle line:84%
I've observed this
now for many years,

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:04.860 align:middle line:84%
but it seems that when
they're about 50 to 60,

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:07.570 align:middle line:84%
people who have spent
their whole life

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:11.570 align:middle line:84%
in the practical pursuits and
so on and been focused on that,

00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:13.930 align:middle line:84%
that suddenly they
have this wake-up call,

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:17.580 align:middle line:84%
that mortality begins
to dawn as an issue.

00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And then they come about it
with a real sense of urgency.

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:22.890 align:middle line:90%
They've got to know right now.

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:25.010 align:middle line:84%
So what I think is
happening, at least one

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:28.350 align:middle line:84%
of the things is, that you think
of all the tens of millions

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:30.689 align:middle line:84%
of Baby Boomers
are suddenly now--

00:25:30.689 --> 00:25:31.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm one of them.

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:33.354 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: --entering
that period of life

00:25:33.354 --> 00:25:35.970 align:middle line:84%
where it's natural to
start thinking about this.

00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And also, because
we came from such

00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:41.320 align:middle line:84%
a immediate
gratification generation

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.830 align:middle line:84%
that we want the
answers right now.

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:46.050 align:middle line:84%
So I think what
Hollywood is reflecting

00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:51.540 align:middle line:84%
is this huge demographic surge
of the Baby Boomers reaching

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:54.460 align:middle line:84%
that point in life
becomes natural to think

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:55.917 align:middle line:90%
about afterlife things.

00:25:55.917 --> 00:25:56.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: True.

00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:57.850 align:middle line:90%

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:03.304 align:middle line:84%

00:26:03.304 --> 00:26:03.969 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: We are.

00:26:03.969 --> 00:26:05.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --and there's

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:09.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yeah.

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:10.440 align:middle line:90%

I mean, I just got to
laugh at all these people

00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:21.320 align:middle line:84%

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:28.950 align:middle line:84%
To me, it's like I'm happy
to be rid of my hair.

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And even the arthritis is
beginning to say, oh, now

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:35.160 align:middle line:84%
I understand what my
grandma was talking about.

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.170 align:middle line:84%
It was like always
talking about her joints--

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:37.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's the aging--

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:37.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: --and what was this?

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:38.751 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --process.

00:26:38.751 --> 00:26:40.115 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: And it's fascinating.

00:26:40.115 --> 00:26:41.692 align:middle line:90%
I'm just-- I love it.

00:26:41.692 --> 00:26:44.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What you can do is
control what you eat and stuff,

00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:44.869 align:middle line:90%
stay healthy.

00:26:44.869 --> 00:26:45.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yes.

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:46.951 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's the
name of the game.

00:26:46.951 --> 00:26:48.872 align:middle line:84%
There's no sense going
into this being sick.

00:26:48.872 --> 00:26:49.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yeah, oh yeah.

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:52.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can't help
being sick once in a while.

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.450 align:middle line:84%
But it's like my
natural thing is

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:57.510 align:middle line:84%
I get up every morning
out of bed and walk.

00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:59.344 align:middle line:90%
And I don't do it for virtue.

00:26:59.344 --> 00:27:00.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't do it
because I think it's

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:03.330 align:middle line:90%
going to make me live longer.

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:05.392 align:middle line:84%
I just do it because
it feels so good.

00:27:05.392 --> 00:27:06.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mine is
simply getting up.

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:07.933 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yeah, getting up.

00:27:07.933 --> 00:27:11.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
wake up-- I did it.

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.370 align:middle line:90%
I got through.

00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:14.920 align:middle line:90%
What does Raymond Moody do next?

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, I just
finished a great book,

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.206 align:middle line:84%
I think, on figures of
speech, because it's

00:27:19.206 --> 00:27:20.580 align:middle line:84%
been one of my
favorite subjects.

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:21.663 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's it called?

00:27:21.663 --> 00:27:24.241 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: It's called "Figures
of Speech Made Simple."

00:27:24.241 --> 00:27:24.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:27.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Been working on it
for 40 years, no kidding.

00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:30.051 align:middle line:90%
And I'm always doing new things.

00:27:30.051 --> 00:27:30.550 align:middle line:90%
I just--

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:31.594 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't stop.

00:27:31.594 --> 00:27:32.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: I just love--

00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:33.509 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't stop.

00:27:33.509 --> 00:27:37.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Finding out stuff to
me is kind of-- it's my drug.

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:40.201 align:middle line:84%
I just love to think and
to find out new things.

00:27:40.201 --> 00:27:42.075 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You travel
around the country still.

00:27:42.075 --> 00:27:43.186 align:middle line:90%
You're all over at events.

00:27:43.186 --> 00:27:44.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: I do, all
over the world.

00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:45.166 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:27:45.166 --> 00:27:46.750 align:middle line:84%
What do people ask
you, primarily,

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:48.370 align:middle line:90%
when they first come up to you?

00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they know you're
the "life after death guy."

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:52.680 align:middle line:90%
But what do they ask?

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:54.700 align:middle line:90%
What's that first question?

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:56.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: You know,
a lot of things.

00:27:56.420 --> 00:28:01.450 align:middle line:84%
When people come to me
in a lecture situation,

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:03.110 align:middle line:90%
there's two big things.

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:04.950 align:middle line:84%
One is that they
come to me and they

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:07.480 align:middle line:84%
say, almost kind of
under their voice,

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:10.720 align:middle line:84%
under their breath,
"Dr. Moody, I've

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:13.930 align:middle line:84%
never told anybody
this, but--" So one

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:15.820 align:middle line:84%
of the good things in
my life is that I'm

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:18.800 align:middle line:84%
happy that I've been able
to-- a lot of people who

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:21.580 align:middle line:84%
had these experiences
and just were troubled.

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's like they
knew it was real,

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:26.740 align:middle line:84%
they just couldn't talk
about it with anybody.

00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:28.890 align:middle line:84%
That, to me, has
been a great thing.

00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:31.930 align:middle line:10%
And then another
thing I think, George,

00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:34.763 align:middle line:10%
I lost my first child in 1970.

00:28:34.763 --> 00:28:36.100 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Sorry to hear that.

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:38.930 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: And he was
only 36 hours old,

00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:42.150 align:middle line:10%
but to me that was like
nine months old, right?

00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:46.500 align:middle line:10%
And you can imagine how that
has played out in my life.

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:50.420 align:middle line:10%
Well, there's nothing that
would ever justify that.

00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:51.270 align:middle line:10%
Right?

00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:53.340 align:middle line:10%
And at the same
time, I look back

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:55.440 align:middle line:10%
and say, well,
because my son died,

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:58.414 align:middle line:10%
I think I've been able to
be more helpful to people--

00:28:58.414 --> 00:28:59.330 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Other people.

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:00.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: --who've
lost their children.

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:00.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:01.383 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yeah.

00:29:01.383 --> 00:29:02.340 align:middle line:90%
And so a lot of my--

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:03.465 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I agree with that.

00:29:03.465 --> 00:29:08.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: --work in my remaining
practice is grief counseling.

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:10.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's
comforting for people.

00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:12.320 align:middle line:84%
Raymond, thank you again for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:14.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: George, it's
always great being with you.

00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:15.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Continued
success to you.

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:15.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Thank you.

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:16.441 align:middle line:90%
And you, too.

00:29:16.441 --> 00:29:18.780 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You know, I hope
this moment enlightened

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:24.450 align:middle line:10%
you somewhat about what
truly is on the other side.

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:26.840 align:middle line:90%
You do not have to fear death.

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:30.306 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
