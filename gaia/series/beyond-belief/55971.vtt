[BACKGROUND MUSIC]

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.790 align:middle line:84%
>>And I think many
people today don't

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.286 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:09.286 --> 00:00:10.917 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.917 --> 00:00:13.220 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.460 align:middle line:84%
>>It felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.370 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.285 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:26.765 --> 00:00:29.140 align:middle line:10%
>> GEORGE NOORY: Well, welcome
to this edition of "Beyond

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.630 align:middle line:10%
Belief," where my special
guest, Tom Benedict,

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.800 align:middle line:10%
is a stone energy healer.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.600 align:middle line:10%
He literally uses
stones like this

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.380 align:middle line:10%
to create an energy environment.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And each stone, Tom,
does something different,

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.970 align:middle line:90%
doesn't it?

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.280 align:middle line:90%
>> TOM BENEDICT: It does.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.030 align:middle line:90%
It's such a fascinating thing.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.560 align:middle line:10%
There are thousands of
different stones out there,

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.822 align:middle line:10%
and we keep finding new ones--
what we would call new ones,

00:00:52.822 --> 00:00:54.780 align:middle line:10%
they might have been
around thousands of years.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.970 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure, or billions.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.447 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: Billions
of years, exactly.

00:00:58.447 --> 00:01:00.280 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You've brought
an array of stones.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.100 align:middle line:90%
>> BENEDICT: I did.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.940 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And it looks like
there are like 12 to 15

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.020 align:middle line:90%
different kinds.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.332 align:middle line:84%
How many different kinds
of stones are out there?

00:01:09.332 --> 00:01:11.290 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: You know,
that's a great question.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.960 align:middle line:10%
There would have to be
thousands of different stones.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.180 align:middle line:10%
At my shows I carry about
six to eight of these boxes.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.320 align:middle line:84%
I carry about 105
different items for people

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.220 align:middle line:90%
to choose from.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.430 align:middle line:90%
A great variety I've covered.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.170 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Let's go back to
the creation of these stones.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.780 align:middle line:84%
When the planet was being formed
4 and 1/2 billion years ago,

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.640 align:middle line:84%
how did these
stones get created?

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.360 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: It always takes
either a combination of certain

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.840 align:middle line:84%
minerals being around in
certain environments that create

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.240 align:middle line:90%
the stone itself.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.670 align:middle line:90%
Petrified wood is an example.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.940 align:middle line:84%
It has to be wood that
becomes in the right location,

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.630 align:middle line:84%
the right pressure, so that the
mineralization of the crystals

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.330 align:middle line:84%
can work up through the
item itself and create

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.240 align:middle line:84%
the crystalline nature
of the petrified wood.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.810 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I notice you didn't
bring me a box of diamonds.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.500 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: No, it's
not my cup of tea.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.680 align:middle line:90%
Diamonds are pure amplifiers.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.630 align:middle line:84%
And it don't matter
what it amplifies.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.950 align:middle line:84%
It could be bad
moods, good moods.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.245 align:middle line:84%
And so my suggestion is
for an engagement ring,

00:02:22.245 --> 00:02:23.870 align:middle line:84%
you know, I think
we've been programmed

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.180 align:middle line:84%
to think that it should be
diamonds when it should be

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.540 align:middle line:84%
something more along the
lines of rose quartz, or--

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.460 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Why are there certain
regions of the planet where

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.790 align:middle line:84%
stones-- like a diamond, for
example-- are more prevalent,

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.850 align:middle line:84%
South Africa, than other
areas on the planet?

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.050 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: It all depends upon
the environment of that area,

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.250 align:middle line:90%
many eons ago, we'll say.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.060 align:middle line:84%
And because of those
different environments--

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.550 align:middle line:84%
the heat, the pressure-- all
of those stones got created,

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.520 align:middle line:84%
like the diamond itself
is a pure carbon form.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.320 align:middle line:84%
But because of the
pressure and intense heat,

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.220 align:middle line:84%
it creates the diamond
that we know now.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.620 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So something may
have happened in that region?

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.494 align:middle line:90%
>> BENEDICT: Exactly.

00:03:02.494 --> 00:03:05.065 align:middle line:84%
It could be anything
from volcanic reactions

00:03:05.065 --> 00:03:05.690 align:middle line:90%
that happened--

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:06.899 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: An asteroid strike.

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:08.148 align:middle line:90%
>> BENEDICT: That can be also.

00:03:08.148 --> 00:03:10.380 align:middle line:84%
That's where this stone
right here, the moldavite,

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.980 align:middle line:90%
comes from.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.570 align:middle line:90%
It's through an asteroid strike.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.270 align:middle line:84%
So it takes all kinds of
different natural environments

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.150 align:middle line:90%
to create different minerals.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And even though the same
minerals of items could be

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.690 align:middle line:84%
in formation in one place,
it's not going to look exactly

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.119 align:middle line:84%
the same as the same mineral
from another location .

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:31.910 align:middle line:84%
They're going to have
a little differences.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.890 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You are
an energy healer,

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.630 align:middle line:90%
but you use stones to do it.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.640 align:middle line:84%
If you didn't have the stones,
could you still heal people?

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.550 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: As
a matter of fact,

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.190 align:middle line:84%
I use about 50-50
percent, we'll say.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.440 align:middle line:84%
Most the time when
I do energy work,

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.180 align:middle line:84%
I realize everything is
vibrational frequencies.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.990 align:middle line:84%
And all of the
frequencies that I need

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.970 align:middle line:84%
are available
throughout the universe.

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have to have
that mineral right in my hand

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.320 align:middle line:84%
that would be the
perfect stone to be used.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.269 align:middle line:84%
I just know that I can ask that
vibration to be in that space

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:05.810 align:middle line:84%
that we need for
the healing process.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.540 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But when
you do use the stones,

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.080 align:middle line:90%
what does that do then?

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.550 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: It amplifies
that area of the body.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.240 align:middle line:84%
If I lay somebody out on a
table and I put certain stones

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.820 align:middle line:84%
over their chakras, then
those certain stones

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.360 align:middle line:84%
could influence how those
chakras work from then

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.230 align:middle line:84%
on just by that
vibrational frequency

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.290 align:middle line:90%
being in their energy space.

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.330 align:middle line:84%
And knowing which stones to
pick is a trick in itself.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.010 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I will assume that
over the past hundreds if not

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.750 align:middle line:84%
thousands of years, human beings
have been using stones much

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.310 align:middle line:84%
like you do today
to help heal people.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.660 align:middle line:90%
Is that pretty accurate?

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.035 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: As
a matter of fact,

00:04:44.035 --> 00:04:46.640 align:middle line:84%
the ice man that we found,
in-- I believe it was the Alps?

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.310 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.740 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: --was
carrying a crystal point.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, why would he be carrying
a rock around with him?

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And yet he also had
tattoos in places

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.910 align:middle line:84%
that were part of the
meridian line of challenges

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.300 align:middle line:90%
that he had challenges with.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And so this is
information and knowledge

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.450 align:middle line:84%
that's been used
throughout so much time.

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.030 align:middle line:90%
And then we lose it for a while.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.340 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.298 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: And now
we're coming back to that.

00:05:10.298 --> 00:05:13.600 align:middle line:84%
Even the Bible mentions stones
in many different aspects

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.670 align:middle line:90%
and different ways.

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:18.270 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How would you know
what particular stone did what

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.070 align:middle line:90%
particular thing for you?

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.570 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: Since
I'm clairaudiant,

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:22.850 align:middle line:90%
I hear direct words.

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.020 align:middle line:84%
When I buy a new stone, I
put the stone in my hand,

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.220 align:middle line:90%
and I ask the stone.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.907 align:middle line:84%
How would you prefer being
used in healing situations?

00:05:29.907 --> 00:05:31.240 align:middle line:90%
>> BENEDICT: You talk to stones?

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.125 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: I talk to
the stones, yes I do.

00:05:33.125 --> 00:05:34.458 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And do they talk back?

00:05:34.458 --> 00:05:37.510 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: And as a matter of
fact, I hear direct words back.

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:41.460 align:middle line:84%
So I would hear
it's like lung work,

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.040 align:middle line:90%
I like to work with lungs.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And so that would be the
information that I give away

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.630 align:middle line:84%
at shows is I have a sheet that
has that information on there.

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And each of those
stones was information

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.320 align:middle line:84%
that I received directly
from the universe-- I'll

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.280 align:middle line:84%
say it that way--
about that stone.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do you have to go into
any kind of trance or anything

00:05:58.910 --> 00:05:59.410 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:00.510 align:middle line:90%
>> BENEDICT: Not at all.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.780 align:middle line:84%
I just ask, and I know
that it's available.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.840 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Interesting job, Tom.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.840 align:middle line:90%
>> BENEDICT: It's a job.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.720 align:middle line:90%
And yet it's not a job.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.530 align:middle line:84%
It's more of a calling, more
of a passion that I live

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:17.850 align:middle line:84%
and that I just-- when we
live in our passion, life

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.000 align:middle line:84%
is so fascinating,
and we live in joy.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.750 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What do these
stones do for you,

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.840 align:middle line:84%
the fact that you are
around them so often,

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.300 align:middle line:90%
you touch them so often?

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.300 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: Well,
around my house--

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.320 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't realize this till
my stepdaughter moved back

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.140 align:middle line:90%
in-- we had stones everywhere.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:40.890 align:middle line:90%
And she was energetic adept.

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:43.460 align:middle line:90%
She felt vibrations very easily.

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.099 align:middle line:84%
She couldn't sleep in
my place for months.

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:47.390 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It was just too much?

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:48.660 align:middle line:90%
>> BENEDICT: Too much energy.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And the way that I see it,
the more energy that we get

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.650 align:middle line:84%
used to being around and
living in, the more energy

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.770 align:middle line:84%
that we're able to access
for healing purposes.

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:02.650 align:middle line:84%
And so I have a huge
altar right next to my bed

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.930 align:middle line:84%
with some huge
stones, great stones,

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:07.840 align:middle line:90%
and thousands of stones.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And so I get used
to living with that,

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.817 align:middle line:84%
and that access of the
energy is available.

00:07:12.817 --> 00:07:14.650 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well hopefully
after this program,

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:17.520 align:middle line:84%
more and more people will
understand the power of stones.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.510 align:middle line:84%
But how many people
generally, if you're

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:21.620 align:middle line:84%
walking around the streets
and you walk up to them

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.250 align:middle line:84%
with a box of these stones, how
many people know what they are

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:26.700 align:middle line:90%
and what they mean?

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:30.300 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: I would have
to say less than 15%.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:31.892 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: If not
even more, less?

00:07:31.892 --> 00:07:32.600 align:middle line:90%
>> BENEDICT: Yes.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.725 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Is that accurate?

00:07:33.725 --> 00:07:34.370 align:middle line:90%
More less?

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.620 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: As you asked,
I actually tuned in and got

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.210 align:middle line:90%
the number of about 15%.

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:42.680 align:middle line:84%
And so 15% percent,
no more than 15%,

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.740 align:middle line:84%
would understand that
you could use stones

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:46.400 align:middle line:90%
in your healing processes.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.910 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But I bet less than
2% could identify these stones.

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:51.810 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: You're
probably right on that.

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:52.590 align:middle line:90%
I'd go with 3.

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:54.920 align:middle line:84%
But you're so close, you
know, give or take a percent.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:55.520 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I'm close.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.049 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:07:56.049 --> 00:07:57.340 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at some stones here.

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.830 align:middle line:84%
You brought some
pictures and we've

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:01.570 align:middle line:84%
got some actual
samples of these.

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:03.700 align:middle line:84%
What is this first
one we're looking at?

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.340 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: This one is the
apophyllite that we talked

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:06.840 align:middle line:84%
about earlier on
a previous show.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.020 align:middle line:84%
It has a beautiful
white light energy.

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:11.190 align:middle line:90%
It creates sacred space.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:15.910 align:middle line:84%
And so many of what we
call indigo children,

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:18.746 align:middle line:84%
they get woke up by spirits
in the middle of the night.

00:08:18.746 --> 00:08:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And one of the ways that
we could help them--

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.930 align:middle line:84%
because spirits are
asking for people

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:25.740 align:middle line:84%
to help them, and
especially wayward spirits.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And this stone, if you
put it in a sunny window

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:30.850 align:middle line:84%
sill in their bedroom,
then usually within two

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:34.799 align:middle line:84%
to four days, there'll be so
much white light in that room

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:37.630 align:middle line:84%
that only their spirit
guides and their helpers

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:40.000 align:middle line:84%
would be allowed
into that space.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.280 align:middle line:84%
So the wayward spirits that woke
them up in the middle of night

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.125 align:middle line:90%
can't enter anymore.

00:08:44.125 --> 00:08:46.500 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Was this formed with
this actual tip like this,

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.680 align:middle line:90%
or was this cut?

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:52.730 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: It is exactly as
it was formed, natural pyramids.

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:54.550 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: That is truly
bizarre, isn't it?

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:55.050 align:middle line:90%
>> BENEDICT: It is.

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:56.924 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How could
something form like this,

00:08:56.924 --> 00:08:58.740 align:middle line:90%
this kind of shape?

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.290 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: Sometimes I
just have to put my hands up

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:04.311 align:middle line:84%
in the air, George,
and say, it just is.

00:09:04.311 --> 00:09:05.310 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Truly amazing.

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:08.260 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's take a look
at our next batch here.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And you can tell
us what these are.

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:11.120 align:middle line:90%
>> BENEDICT: Black tourmaline.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.870 align:middle line:84%
Black tourmaline,
and black tourmaline

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:17.244 align:middle line:84%
the difference is this
is a natural formation.

00:09:17.244 --> 00:09:18.660 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: This is
it in the rough.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:20.440 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: It is
in a rough form.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:24.200 align:middle line:84%
The black tourmaline helps us
to stay super, super grounded

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.020 align:middle line:84%
so that our focus
is exceptional.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.180 align:middle line:84%
Especially if you're
doing spiritual things,

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.400 align:middle line:84%
the better grounded
we are, the easier

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.705 align:middle line:84%
it is to do those
spiritual things.

00:09:33.705 --> 00:09:35.870 align:middle line:84%
And black tourmaline says,
smack me in the face,

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:38.890 align:middle line:84%
I want to ground so that
I can play so much easier.

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:41.030 align:middle line:84%
That's why this stone
right here, that sphere,

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:45.060 align:middle line:84%
has been in my hand and been
on my space for 15 years.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:48.560 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is this is the one you
were holding the time we met?

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.026 align:middle line:90%
>> BENEDICT: Yes it was, George.

00:09:50.026 --> 00:09:51.480 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And you
would just constantly--

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.938 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: I was
just constantly,

00:09:52.938 --> 00:09:55.430 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to be sure I was in
tune with that stone and I

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:57.841 align:middle line:84%
could articulate as
well as I needed to.

00:09:57.841 --> 00:09:58.840 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Truly amazing.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.210 align:middle line:90%
All right, next picture.

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:03.980 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: Brecciated
jasper, brecciated jasper.

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:06.780 align:middle line:90%
And that's this one right here.

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:09.730 align:middle line:84%
Brecciated jasper is
a spectacular stone

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:13.620 align:middle line:84%
to help teach us why the
stones can actually help us.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:16.400 align:middle line:84%
When we're having skin
or tissue challenges,

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:19.190 align:middle line:84%
our skin or tissue doesn't
have all the perfect vibrations

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:21.070 align:middle line:90%
it needs to accomplish a task.

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:23.550 align:middle line:84%
It could be psoriasis, it
could be just dry skin.

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:24.410 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:27.350 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: And this stone
has the same vibration

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:29.450 align:middle line:90%
as our tissue.

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:32.750 align:middle line:84%
So if we don't have enough
vibration in our space,

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:34.810 align:middle line:84%
and then we add that
stone to our space,

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:37.550 align:middle line:84%
it boosts that vibration
and helps the skin to heal,

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:38.630 align:middle line:90%
or tissue.

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:39.963 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: How long does it take?

00:10:39.963 --> 00:10:42.580 align:middle line:84%
How long does the process take
before you see some change?

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.160 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: It depends upon
what challenge we're talking

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:44.660 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:48.366 align:middle line:90%
This stone I gifted a lady.

00:10:48.366 --> 00:10:50.390 align:middle line:84%
It was one of those
that jumped out at her.

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'd gifted it
to her, and she

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:55.390 align:middle line:84%
said, oh honey, my right hand
is always dry, no matter what

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:57.750 align:middle line:90%
I use-- lotion all the time.

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I gifted it to her, she
went to a one hour lecture,

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:02.390 align:middle line:90%
came back all excited.

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:03.630 align:middle line:90%
Her hand was smooth.

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:04.309 align:middle line:90%
It was soft.

00:11:04.309 --> 00:11:05.350 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Just like that?

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:07.050 align:middle line:90%
>> BENEDICT: Just like that.

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:07.819 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Wow.

00:11:07.819 --> 00:11:09.360 align:middle line:84%
All right, let's
flip to our next one

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.000 align:middle line:90%
and see what we've got here.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.990 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: Blue lace agate is
an exceptional stone to help us

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:18.830 align:middle line:90%
to stay very relaxed.

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And George, as you
know, life is full

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.600 align:middle line:84%
of its stressed little game
plans here and there that kind

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.020 align:middle line:84%
of pick and aggravate
us a little bit.

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:28.300 align:middle line:84%
This stone helps us to
stay much more relaxed.

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:29.100 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Grounded.

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:33.130 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: Much more
calmed, much more focused.

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:35.191 align:middle line:84%
And this is just one of
those that I think most

00:11:35.191 --> 00:11:37.440 align:middle line:84%
every human ought to carry,
at least for a while, just

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.960 align:middle line:84%
to eradicate some of the
stress that we go through

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.070 align:middle line:90%
during the day.

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:43.671 align:middle line:84%
It's just a great
stress reliever.

00:11:43.671 --> 00:11:46.170 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: All right, let's flip
to our next one and see what

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:46.935 align:middle line:90%
we've got here.

00:11:46.935 --> 00:11:47.810 align:middle line:90%
>> BENEDICT: Kyanite.

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:48.760 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What are these?

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:49.843 align:middle line:90%
>> BENEDICT: Blue kyanite.

00:11:49.843 --> 00:11:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And we've got the raw
form here, and I also

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:54.930 align:middle line:90%
have a tumbled form here.

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:58.720 align:middle line:84%
The blue kyanite balances
the entire chakra system.

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:01.570 align:middle line:84%
It charges the
entire chakra system.

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:04.340 align:middle line:84%
It helps us to stay balanced
and focused no matter

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:06.280 align:middle line:90%
what's going on around us.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.790 align:middle line:84%
The other way of
saying it, it helps

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:10.810 align:middle line:84%
to snap this back
our personal center.

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:13.630 align:middle line:84%
So if you've been around a lot
of emotional things going on

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:17.620 align:middle line:84%
and you just don't feel
quite all together on target,

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:21.260 align:middle line:84%
then blue kyanite is
an exceptional stone

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.050 align:middle line:84%
to carry just to keep
all of our chakras just

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:26.950 align:middle line:84%
balanced and focused so that
no matter what's going on

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:29.910 align:middle line:84%
around us, challenging, we
can just still smile and go

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:30.785 align:middle line:90%
on right through it.

00:12:30.785 --> 00:12:31.618 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

00:12:31.618 --> 00:12:34.140 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look, we've got
a few more pictures left here.

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:39.110 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: Citrine, citrine
right here is a fabulous stone

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:40.320 align:middle line:90%
to be a battery.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:40.970 align:middle line:90%
It's a battery.

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:41.850 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's a pretty stone.

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:43.290 align:middle line:90%
>> BENEDICT: Isn't it awesome?

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:46.840 align:middle line:84%
It's a battery for us or for
other stones that we carry.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.430 align:middle line:84%
Like if you were
carrying a bloodstone

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:52.640 align:middle line:84%
for a while, or any other stone
that you really just don't

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:56.200 align:middle line:84%
want out of your personal space,
well, to keep it charged up,

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.372 align:middle line:84%
you could actually carry
it beside a citrine.

00:12:58.372 --> 00:13:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's a battery for
us, or for other stones.

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:01.621 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Does it recharge you?

00:13:01.621 --> 00:13:05.190 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: It recharges us,
and sometimes it can have up

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:08.960 align:middle line:84%
to a 10% effect on bringing
us more energy into our own

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.050 align:middle line:90%
personal space.

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:11.640 align:middle line:84%
So that's a fabulous
side effect.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:12.473 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

00:13:12.473 --> 00:13:14.720 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at our
last picture here.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.550 align:middle line:90%
>> BENEDICT: Royal chalcedony.

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:18.370 align:middle line:84%
And royal chalcedony--
and that's

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:22.664 align:middle line:84%
this right here--
royal chalcedony,

00:13:22.664 --> 00:13:24.330 align:middle line:84%
one of the teachings
that I like with it

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:27.430 align:middle line:84%
is it can help us to
access information

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:29.700 align:middle line:90%
from our past lives.

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And the way that we utilize this
is we can put it in our hand

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:36.120 align:middle line:84%
either before dream time
or before meditation

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.935 align:middle line:84%
and just ask it to
show us information

00:13:37.935 --> 00:13:41.660 align:middle line:84%
that we need to know from any
lifetime we want to choose.

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And the best way to
do that is to choose

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.200 align:middle line:84%
the same lifetime for three
to four straight days,

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.790 align:middle line:84%
skip a day or two, and then
go to any other lifetime

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:49.640 align:middle line:90%
you want to.

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.500 align:middle line:84%
But it helps to
bring information,

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.545 align:middle line:84%
our personal information,
into our space.

00:13:53.545 --> 00:13:55.920 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Tom, if people want
to get a hold of you to get

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.010 align:middle line:84%
an interpretation of all these
stones, where do they find you?

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:02.680 align:middle line:10%
>> BENEDICT: My website
is tomstones.org.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:08.040 align:middle line:10%
And also a phone
number, 502-741-0686.

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.890 align:middle line:84%
I do a fabulous job of
answering emails and texts,

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:12.870 align:middle line:84%
and that's one of the
best ways that you

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:15.715 align:middle line:84%
can get in touch with
me, either way of that.

00:14:15.715 --> 00:14:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And we'll just set an
appointment up and work it

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:20.087 align:middle line:84%
out, either for a stone
reading or for healing work.

00:14:20.087 --> 00:14:20.920 align:middle line:90%
It's all up to them.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.378 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are there books out
there too for people who want

00:14:23.378 --> 00:14:27.010 align:middle line:84%
to learn about the stones, and
obviously they don't possess

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:30.680 align:middle line:84%
the kind of knowledge you have,
so I would have no idea what

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.079 align:middle line:90%
these are and what they do.

00:14:32.079 --> 00:14:32.870 align:middle line:90%
>> BENEDICT: Right.

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:34.150 align:middle line:90%
And there are many books.

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:37.040 align:middle line:84%
You have to kind of look at
all the books and look at them

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:40.390 align:middle line:84%
and read them really good, like
pick a stone that you really

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:41.080 align:middle line:90%
like.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.190 align:middle line:90%
It might be amethyst.

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:43.970 align:middle line:90%
It might be blue lace agate.

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:45.760 align:middle line:90%
And see what they say about it.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:49.250 align:middle line:84%
If it harmonizes
with how you feel,

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:51.340 align:middle line:84%
then that would be a
great book to follow.

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:53.770 align:middle line:84%
But so many of them teach so
many different things, just

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:55.460 align:middle line:84%
like me, they tune
into the stones

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.380 align:middle line:84%
and they ask the
stones many times

00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.370 align:middle line:90%
how they can be used in healing.

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:02.460 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times, that's
channeled information.

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And we have to pick the person
that we harmonize with best.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.840 align:middle line:84%
So just take a look at
all the books out there

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.557 align:middle line:84%
and see which ones just
kind of harmonize with you.

00:15:11.557 --> 00:15:12.390 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:15.640 align:middle line:84%
Now let's look at
me as an example.

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:18.810 align:middle line:84%
What kind of stones
would you pick for me,

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:21.170 align:middle line:90%
or do I just reach and pick one?

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:21.870 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:24.030 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: Well, with
you, I know that you like

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:26.570 align:middle line:84%
apophyllites, because who
doesn't like playing with white

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:27.070 align:middle line:90%
light?

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:27.930 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: These
are the big ones?

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:29.415 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: They are the
bigger ones, and I carry--

00:15:29.415 --> 00:15:30.750 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: The ones
we just showed.

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:31.500 align:middle line:90%
>> BENEDICT: Mmhm.

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And I carry the smaller versions
too, just different sizes.

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And so the
apophyllite, I like it.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.046 align:middle line:84%
It helps us to live
in sacred space.

00:15:40.046 --> 00:15:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And when we live
in sacred space,

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:43.330 align:middle line:84%
we get to smile at
all the challenges

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:45.220 align:middle line:90%
that are going through life.

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.920 align:middle line:84%
And George, I think you
do a fine job of that.

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:51.000 align:middle line:84%
You just really like playing
in the white light of life

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.890 align:middle line:84%
and looking at everything
from a different perspective.

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's where this huge
white light beam comes in.

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So you would say that
this stone would be for me,

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:03.490 align:middle line:90%
basically?

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:04.610 align:middle line:90%
>> BENEDICT: Yes.

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:06.680 align:middle line:84%
One of the key
things that you like

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:11.080 align:middle line:84%
as well as the black tourmaline
to stay perfectly grounded.

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.410 align:middle line:90%
And this is a polished version.

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:15.150 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Little polish on it.

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:17.150 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: It's easier
to keep in your pocket.

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:19.600 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times,
the raw versions--

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.130 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Yes, that
one would hurt.

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:22.296 align:middle line:90%
>> BENEDICT: That one could.

00:16:22.296 --> 00:16:23.990 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Especially
if you sit on it.

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:25.823 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: I would
suggest not to do that.

00:16:25.823 --> 00:16:26.780 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Exactly.

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:27.356 align:middle line:90%
Ouch.

00:16:27.356 --> 00:16:29.480 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: The black
tourmaline in a raw version,

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.240 align:middle line:90%
a lot of times falls apart.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.217 align:middle line:84%
And so it may become
many different pieces.

00:16:34.217 --> 00:16:35.550 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Where does this one--?

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:37.591 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: That one goes
right here, my friend,

00:16:37.591 --> 00:16:40.160 align:middle line:84%
or in your pocket in a
minute if you'd like.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:43.430 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How many people are
readers of stones out there?

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:45.050 align:middle line:90%
Just a few I would guess, right?

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:48.970 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: As far as I know,
I'm the only one at shows that

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:51.250 align:middle line:84%
does what we call
a stone reading,

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:55.234 align:middle line:84%
where I have five
different-colored plastic tooth

00:16:55.234 --> 00:16:57.150 align:middle line:84%
picks-- they're actually
olive picks, I think.

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And once somebody stands in
front of me, I pick a color,

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:00.830 align:middle line:90%
and that's their color.

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:03.400 align:middle line:84%
I put pins in the stones
that I hear calling to them

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:04.744 align:middle line:90%
and explain why.

00:17:04.744 --> 00:17:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And then I have another color
for the next person in line.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.050 align:middle line:84%
That way, they can take
their opportunity of time

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:11.994 align:middle line:84%
anytime they want to
to pick the stones out

00:17:11.994 --> 00:17:14.035 align:middle line:84%
of each of those bins that
are ringing with them.

00:17:14.035 --> 00:17:16.104 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do you find
people flock to you?

00:17:16.104 --> 00:17:18.020 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: That does
happen very frequently.

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And at shows where
I'm well-known,

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:23.440 align:middle line:84%
there's a line usually for me
to do stone readings for them.

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:26.380 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What do
they want to know?

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:30.920 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: Where they are and
how they can get through life

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:35.106 align:middle line:84%
easier and with less
pain, aches, emotionals,

00:17:35.106 --> 00:17:35.980 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:37.710 align:middle line:90%
They actually want healing.

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's just fascinating
to see so many,

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.850 align:middle line:84%
what some people call miracles,
from people just carrying

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:44.440 align:middle line:90%
these stones.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And I get so much
positive feedback.

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:48.270 align:middle line:90%
Last year, I saw you.

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:50.600 align:middle line:84%
Which stones are
calling to me today?

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And as we grow and
we change, then so

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.500 align:middle line:90%
do the stones that call to us.

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:59.660 align:middle line:84%
If we were having a challenge
with being less stressed

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:01.950 align:middle line:84%
or stress, then blue
lace is a great stone.

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:05.019 align:middle line:84%
But in a year's time, you
may be a lot more relaxed.

00:18:05.019 --> 00:18:07.310 align:middle line:84%
And you may not need that
stone that helps with stress.

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:08.980 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What's
your favorite stone?

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:10.010 align:middle line:90%
>> BENEDICT: Apophyllites also.

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:11.100 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Same one I have?

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:12.970 align:middle line:90%
>> BENEDICT: Same stone, yeah.

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:16.100 align:middle line:84%
It helps me to stay
in sacred space,

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:18.290 align:middle line:84%
or what I call sacred
space, to where

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:21.340 align:middle line:84%
if it's not for my highest
good, it can't enter ever.

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:24.980 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is there a
bad stone, a dark stone,

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:25.980 align:middle line:90%
out there for people?

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.313 align:middle line:90%
>> BENEDICT: Not that I know of.

00:18:27.313 --> 00:18:30.550 align:middle line:84%
The only thing I would say is,
if you're looking at stones

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:32.830 align:middle line:84%
and trying to pick
which ones call to you,

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:36.220 align:middle line:84%
then either you can use somebody
like me to help you choose,

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:38.330 align:middle line:84%
or the chakras, the
colors of the chakras,

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:41.400 align:middle line:84%
and match those up
on our challenges.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.570 align:middle line:84%
Or you can just see which
ones look extra pretty.

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:47.810 align:middle line:84%
And it may be like
the Native Americans

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:49.250 align:middle line:90%
call the stones stone people.

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And they've been saying that
for years-- eons-- many of them

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:54.780 align:middle line:90%
also hear the stones.

00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And so if you were looking
for stones on which ones

00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:01.350 align:middle line:84%
are most pretty, then it may
be that stone literally calling

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:02.070 align:middle line:90%
to you.

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:05.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm so pretty, oh so
pretty, I'm so pretty.

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's how it's
calling you to it.

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:10.105 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Rubies, emeralds.

00:19:10.105 --> 00:19:10.730 align:middle line:90%
They're stones.

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:11.730 align:middle line:90%
>> BENEDICT: They are.

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:12.730 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are they
healing stones?

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:13.855 align:middle line:90%
>> BENEDICT: They sure are.

00:19:13.855 --> 00:19:20.020 align:middle line:84%
Rubies help our personal
energies of unconditional love.

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I'm
wearing, by the way, ruby.

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:23.620 align:middle line:90%
I just really like rubies.

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:25.980 align:middle line:84%
It helps the unconditional
love that we live in

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:30.450 align:middle line:84%
to amplify and then
spread out further from us

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:33.190 align:middle line:84%
so that like the book,
"The Course in Miracles,"

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:35.720 align:middle line:84%
tells us that we could
walk into a grocery store,

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.610 align:middle line:90%
not say one word to anybody.

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:39.880 align:middle line:84%
But if we're radiating
unconditional love,

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.670 align:middle line:90%
20 people may have epiphanies.

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:42.920 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What about emeralds?

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:46.750 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: Emeralds help us to
receive compassion from others

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:47.380 align:middle line:90%
much easier.

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:50.300 align:middle line:10%
A lot of times, the
emeralds that call to people

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:54.880 align:middle line:10%
are because they are fabulous
givers, but not so good

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.460 align:middle line:10%
about receiving.

00:19:56.460 --> 00:20:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And so emeralds help us to
receive compassion, and allow

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.697 align:middle line:90%
others to give to us also.

00:20:01.697 --> 00:20:04.280 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Why are stones, some
stones like diamonds, emeralds,

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:07.650 align:middle line:84%
rubies so expensive compared
to stones like this?

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:13.990 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: Well, the rarity
of the mineral is part of that.

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:17.690 align:middle line:84%
Where they come from, it might
be a very challenging spot

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:19.630 align:middle line:90%
to dig or to get to.

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And the other one is
people want to make money.

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:25.965 align:middle line:84%
And the jewelry--
and I'm just going

00:20:25.965 --> 00:20:29.216 align:middle line:84%
to say the jewelry
type energies-- they

00:20:29.216 --> 00:20:30.840 align:middle line:84%
want to make as much
money as possible.

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:33.235 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So they hold back
stones and control them that

00:20:33.235 --> 00:20:33.560 align:middle line:90%
way.

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:33.980 align:middle line:90%
>> BENEDICT: Yeah.

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:34.540 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:36.164 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be
back in just a moment

00:20:36.164 --> 00:20:38.840 align:middle line:84%
here on "Beyond
Belief," where Tenna

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.850 align:middle line:84%
will get a reading
from Tom Benedict.

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:47.990 align:middle line:90%


00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:49.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, welcome back
to "Beyond Belief."

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:53.020 align:middle line:84%
Tom Benedict with me,
the stone energy healer.

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And we have Tenna
with us, who is

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:57.620 align:middle line:84%
going to get a little
reading from Tom.

00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:59.190 align:middle line:84%
So Tom, I'll let
you do your thing.

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:00.630 align:middle line:90%
>> BENEDICT: All right.

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:03.210 align:middle line:84%
Tenna, thank you so
much for being with us.

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:06.899 align:middle line:84%
One of the first stones I
hear for you is red jasper.

00:21:06.899 --> 00:21:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And red jasper--
have you been having

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:12.859 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of a challenge with
your multitasking abilities?

00:21:12.859 --> 00:21:13.650 align:middle line:90%
>> TENNA: Slightly.

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:14.733 align:middle line:90%
>> BENEDICT: Slightly, OK.

00:21:14.733 --> 00:21:17.920 align:middle line:84%
The red jasper is a soft
and gentle grounder.

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:19.950 align:middle line:84%
It should help your
multitasking abilities

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:21.590 align:middle line:84%
to jump right back
into your body

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:24.104 align:middle line:84%
from the very first second you
put that stone in your hand.

00:21:24.104 --> 00:21:24.770 align:middle line:90%
>> TENNA: Great.

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:26.530 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: This red
jasper stone, Tom,

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:30.280 align:middle line:84%
is it different for everybody,
or is it always the same?

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:33.820 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: The teaching of the
red jasper is a good grounder

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:35.990 align:middle line:84%
and it helps the
multitasking ability,

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:38.020 align:middle line:84%
so it is very similar
to most people.

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:39.960 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So if you
had four people,

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.994 align:middle line:84%
it would be almost
the same for all four?

00:21:41.994 --> 00:21:43.910 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: As which
stone calls to them, no.

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:47.100 align:middle line:84%
It may be only one or two
of them calls red jasper.

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:50.140 align:middle line:84%
The others may be a
different form of grounder

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:52.500 align:middle line:84%
that would help their same
multitasking abilities.

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.790 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But if they
all had red jasper,

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:56.422 align:middle line:90%
then it would be the same?

00:21:56.422 --> 00:21:57.130 align:middle line:90%
>> BENEDICT: Yes.

00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:59.130 align:middle line:84%
If it was one of the
stones that called to them.

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:00.910 align:middle line:84%
The next stone is
Botswana agate.

00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:02.630 align:middle line:90%
>> TENNA: Ooh, I love that one.

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:03.796 align:middle line:90%
>> BENEDICT: Oh, good, good.

00:22:03.796 --> 00:22:07.790 align:middle line:84%
This stone helps us to detoxify
our mind, body, and spirit.

00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:11.737 align:middle line:84%
My guess is you love to
stay energetically clean.

00:22:11.737 --> 00:22:12.820 align:middle line:90%
Is that one of your goals?

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:14.560 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:16.883 align:middle line:84%
Are you a sea salt
bath kind of person?

00:22:16.883 --> 00:22:17.466 align:middle line:90%
>> TENNA: Yes.

00:22:17.466 --> 00:22:18.507 align:middle line:90%
>> BENEDICT: I knew that.

00:22:18.507 --> 00:22:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And so this stone helps
to pull things out

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:23.560 align:middle line:84%
of your system
that's not necessary.

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:25.400 align:middle line:84%
It could be physical,
like it could

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.380 align:middle line:84%
be the diesel smell from
coming down that road that day,

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.270 align:middle line:84%
or old dogma stuff that
we were trained with.

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:33.390 align:middle line:84%
The Botswana agate
pulls those things

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:35.960 align:middle line:84%
that are not for our highest
good out of our system.

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:36.305 align:middle line:90%
>> TENNA: Awesome.

00:22:36.305 --> 00:22:36.805 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:22:36.805 --> 00:22:39.920 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: And so great
phrase that I use with that is,

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:42.760 align:middle line:84%
I release those things
that no longer serve me.

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:44.310 align:middle line:84%
That's where that
stone comes in.

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:46.720 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Who
named these stones?

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: Whoever found
them gets to name them.

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's really the way
that works now in general.

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:54.650 align:middle line:84%
Whoever finds them can
label them and name them.

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:55.040 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:55.970 align:middle line:90%
What else do we have for her?

00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:57.850 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: The next
one is carnelian.

00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:00.135 align:middle line:84%
You're an exceptionally
creative lady, aren't you?

00:23:00.135 --> 00:23:00.760 align:middle line:90%
>> TENNA: Mmhm.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:01.620 align:middle line:90%
I paint.

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:02.010 align:middle line:90%
>> BENEDICT: You paint?

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:02.660 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And my guess is
either you're stuck

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:06.490 align:middle line:84%
on something you've
been painting,

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:09.550 align:middle line:84%
or you've got a bunch
of your craft type work

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:11.532 align:middle line:90%
in the background, which is it?

00:23:11.532 --> 00:23:12.740 align:middle line:90%
>> TENNA: I'm a little stuck.

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:13.990 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: You're
a little stuck.

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:15.720 align:middle line:84%
So you put this
stone, the carnelian,

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:20.460 align:middle line:84%
a great stone for creativity,
you put that on the easel.

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And within two weeks,
you may go, I got it!

00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:25.215 align:middle line:90%
This is where I go with this!

00:23:25.215 --> 00:23:25.965 align:middle line:90%
>> TENNA: Awesome.

00:23:25.965 --> 00:23:29.626 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: So it boosts
all forms of creativity with

00:23:29.626 --> 00:23:30.125 align:middle line:90%
ourselves.

00:23:30.125 --> 00:23:31.041 align:middle line:90%
>> TENNA: I like that.

00:23:31.041 --> 00:23:33.900 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: And the
next one is blue kyanite.

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:37.840 align:middle line:84%
It can help us to stay much more
balanced and much more focused.

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:42.080 align:middle line:84%
It helps us to snap back
into our center much easier.

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And I believe over the last
one, two, three months,

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:47.630 align:middle line:84%
you've been around a lot
of more emotional things

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:49.200 align:middle line:90%
going on around you.

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.870 align:middle line:84%
So this stone, even
though we're going

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:52.720 align:middle line:84%
through emotional
challenges, it will

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:56.550 align:middle line:84%
help you to stay stable
and focused a lot better.

00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:57.870 align:middle line:90%
>> TENNA: That's great.

00:23:57.870 --> 00:23:58.980 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: That's
right up your alley, too?

00:23:58.980 --> 00:23:59.770 align:middle line:90%
>> TENNA: I need that.

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:01.470 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So what do you
think of these, Tenna?

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:01.990 align:middle line:90%
>> TENNA: You know what?

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:03.480 align:middle line:90%
I've always loved stones.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:04.740 align:middle line:90%
And I have quite a few.

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:07.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't have the ones
that you're giving me,

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:09.487 align:middle line:90%
which I find very interesting.

00:24:09.487 --> 00:24:10.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't have these at all.

00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:12.320 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: Then the last
stone, and this one is--

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.200 align:middle line:90%
it's a little stone.

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.140 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Oh, this
is a little dinky one

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:16.360 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: Well, you know,
I've got to say, George,

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:18.910 align:middle line:84%
the ones that I sell are
way smaller than that.

00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:23.180 align:middle line:84%
This is actually an old stock
from a miner that I bought.

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:26.520 align:middle line:84%
And so this is one of the stones
that, for visualization, I

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:28.140 align:middle line:84%
knew that it would
come in handy.

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:29.700 align:middle line:90%
You have been doing this, honey.

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:32.965 align:middle line:84%
Should I or should I not
about something, haven't you?

00:24:32.965 --> 00:24:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a stone
to help us with courage,

00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:39.380 align:middle line:84%
to courageously step
forward into the things

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:41.260 align:middle line:90%
that you've been visualizing.

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:44.900 align:middle line:84%
You've been hesitant about
this for probably eight

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:46.590 align:middle line:90%
months is what I'm hearing.

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And so this stone will help you
to just step right into that

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:51.445 align:middle line:90%
like, OK, I can do this.

00:24:51.445 --> 00:24:52.070 align:middle line:90%
>> TENNA: Good.

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.860 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Let's do it.

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:53.509 align:middle line:90%
>> TENNA: Good.

00:24:53.509 --> 00:24:55.050 align:middle line:84%
That's my business
that I'm starting.

00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:55.690 align:middle line:90%
>> BENEDICT: Oh, good.

00:24:55.690 --> 00:24:57.290 align:middle line:84%
>> TENNA: And I was
a little hesitant.

00:24:57.290 --> 00:25:01.065 align:middle line:90%
But I just recently embraced it.

00:25:01.065 --> 00:25:02.440 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: I'm
so glad for you.

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:03.000 align:middle line:90%
>> TENNA: So this will help.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.041 align:middle line:90%
Now, what is this called?

00:25:04.041 --> 00:25:05.300 align:middle line:90%
>> BENEDICT: It's peridot.

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:06.050 align:middle line:90%
>> TENNA: Love it.

00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:06.480 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Peridot.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.250 align:middle line:84%
You would never know
that, would you?

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:10.550 align:middle line:84%
>> TENNA: Well, you know,
I thought it was a peridot,

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:11.590 align:middle line:90%
but I wasn't for sure.

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:14.434 align:middle line:84%
Because my birthday's in August
and this is my birthstone.

00:25:14.434 --> 00:25:15.600 align:middle line:90%
>> BENEDICT: And so is mine.

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:16.731 align:middle line:90%
>> TENNA: Oh, very good.

00:25:16.731 --> 00:25:18.110 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: So good,
we're both Leos.

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:19.276 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Now, I'm a Gemini.

00:25:19.276 --> 00:25:22.540 align:middle line:90%
What's my birthstone?

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:24.550 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: Astrology
is not my cup of tea.

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:25.050 align:middle line:90%
It's not--

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:25.750 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: There's a
little bag for you.

00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:27.130 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: I have a the little
bag for you to carry those

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:27.910 align:middle line:90%
stones.

00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:31.190 align:middle line:84%
I just know mine, and I have
a little sheet with others

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:33.870 align:middle line:84%
from books that kind
of match them up.

00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:34.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:36.310 align:middle line:90%
But I believe it's waterstone.

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:40.020 align:middle line:84%
So I'm thinking jade may be
a great connection with you

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:42.205 align:middle line:84%
to evenly and perfectly
flow through life.

00:25:42.205 --> 00:25:43.080 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Watch this.

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:44.335 align:middle line:90%
Criss Angel taught me this.

00:25:44.335 --> 00:25:44.835 align:middle line:90%
You ready?

00:25:44.835 --> 00:25:46.860 align:middle line:90%
>> TENNA: Mmhm.

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:49.660 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What hand?

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: I
would say this one.

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:52.620 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You're right.

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:54.114 align:middle line:90%
Right before your eyes.

00:25:54.114 --> 00:25:56.530 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: I saw the energy
of the stone, I'm a cheater.

00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:59.590 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: We're doing
magic and energy healing.

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:01.840 align:middle line:84%
What do you think about the
energy healing with stones

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:02.340 align:middle line:90%
though?

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:04.270 align:middle line:90%
Do you think it really works?

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:05.270 align:middle line:90%
>> TENNA: I actually do.

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:07.480 align:middle line:90%
I have citrine at home.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.526 align:middle line:90%
I have the rose quartz at home.

00:26:09.526 --> 00:26:10.776 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: So you're into this?

00:26:10.776 --> 00:26:11.401 align:middle line:90%
>> TENNA: Yeah.

00:26:11.401 --> 00:26:12.515 align:middle line:90%
I like it.

00:26:12.515 --> 00:26:13.890 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: I'm
so glad for you.

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:15.515 align:middle line:84%
>> TENNA: Now, tell
me what does again?

00:26:15.515 --> 00:26:18.200 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: The apophyllites
radiate sacred space.

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And I will gift
you four of these

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.430 align:middle line:84%
so that you can put them
around your household

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:25.390 align:middle line:84%
and create sacred
space that you live in.

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:27.807 align:middle line:84%
>> TENNA: Do you put them on
the outskirts, or the inside?

00:26:27.807 --> 00:26:29.556 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: Either
way you want to do it.

00:26:29.556 --> 00:26:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And that information is on my
website under Stone Teachings

00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:36.720 align:middle line:84%
so that you can just read it
and just follow the game plan.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.000 align:middle line:90%
I love the way that works.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.300 align:middle line:84%
When we live in sacred space,
everything as possible.

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:42.866 align:middle line:84%
>> TENNA: So would you bury
it in the ground outside?

00:26:42.866 --> 00:26:44.490 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: You
could bury it outside.

00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:48.152 align:middle line:84%
You could put it in farthest
corners of inside the house.

00:26:48.152 --> 00:26:49.110 align:middle line:90%
That part's irrelevant.

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:49.880 align:middle line:90%
>> TENNA: I like that.

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:51.150 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And hope
nobody takes them.

00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:52.150 align:middle line:90%
>> TENNA: Yeah, exactly.

00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:54.387 align:middle line:90%


00:26:54.387 --> 00:26:56.970 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are there any stones
out there for spiritual things,

00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:59.320 align:middle line:90%
for God-like things?

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:01.815 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: Selenite is one
of those spectacular stones

00:27:01.815 --> 00:27:02.315 align:middle line:90%
for that.

00:27:02.315 --> 00:27:06.370 align:middle line:84%
The selenite really amplifies
God's light that we live in

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:07.377 align:middle line:90%
and that we work in.

00:27:07.377 --> 00:27:08.210 align:middle line:90%
>> TENNA: Beautiful.

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:10.020 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: And the
apophyllites also,

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:13.780 align:middle line:84%
they radiate more of
a Christ-like energy.

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:17.400 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Now, why are
they all different shapes?

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:20.000 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: Different
vibrations, different minerals,

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.340 align:middle line:84%
and different formations
create that different shape.

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:28.100 align:middle line:84%
They found a selenite
mine in Mexico

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:32.580 align:middle line:84%
that has 50-foot blades
that weight two tons.

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:33.940 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Wow.

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:35.660 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: People can't-- as
a matter of fact, this cavern--

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:36.900 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They cut those up?

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:37.733 align:middle line:90%
>> BENEDICT: Uh huh.

00:27:37.733 --> 00:27:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And out of this
cavern, you can't

00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:41.160 align:middle line:84%
be in it for three
minutes without dying.

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are there actually
companies that sell these

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:45.994 align:middle line:90%
stones and finds them?

00:27:45.994 --> 00:27:47.160 align:middle line:90%
>> BENEDICT: Yes, there are.

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And I deal with about
10 of those, 10 or 15

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:53.932 align:middle line:84%
of those companies to keep
the supply going that I have.

00:27:53.932 --> 00:27:56.592 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What do
you think, Tenna?

00:27:56.592 --> 00:27:57.710 align:middle line:90%
>> TENNA: I'm fascinated.

00:27:57.710 --> 00:28:00.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, what would be one
to have in your car,

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:02.609 align:middle line:84%
safe driving and
protecting shield?

00:28:02.609 --> 00:28:04.650 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: And the shield
that we talked about,

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:07.512 align:middle line:84%
the hematite shield would
be spectacular to use.

00:28:07.512 --> 00:28:09.470 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: That's that
heavy, metal-feeling one.

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:10.345 align:middle line:90%
>> BENEDICT: It does.

00:28:10.345 --> 00:28:11.980 align:middle line:90%
It has that hard kind of metal.

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:15.270 align:middle line:84%
But as I teach on my website
under Stone Teachings,

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:18.020 align:middle line:84%
the hematite shield you could
use around your whole vehicle.

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:19.580 align:middle line:90%
And I did that once.

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And I was doing--
let's just say that it

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:23.810 align:middle line:84%
was a little over
the speed limit.

00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And I ran across a guy around a
corner doing 40 miles an hour.

00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:30.460 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Why does
this feel metallic?

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:33.080 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: It has
a lot of iron in it.

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.230 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's very heavy.

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:35.521 align:middle line:90%
Did you notice how heavy it is?

00:28:35.521 --> 00:28:37.034 align:middle line:90%
>> TENNA: Oh yeah.

00:28:37.034 --> 00:28:39.450 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: I missed that
person because I was using this

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:39.950 align:middle line:90%
shield.

00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:42.760 align:middle line:10%
And I had extended that
shield out in front of me

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:44.150 align:middle line:10%
for several feet.

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:47.247 align:middle line:10%
And literally, the guy
that-- another friend that

00:28:47.247 --> 00:28:48.955 align:middle line:10%
was driving in the
vehicle beside me-- he

00:28:48.955 --> 00:28:51.760 align:middle line:10%
said, Tom, I don't know
how you missed that truck.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:53.610 align:middle line:10%
Because it was doing
40, and I was doing 80.

00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:54.920 align:middle line:10%
And just like
that, it was there.

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:56.050 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well,
that's fascinating.

00:28:56.050 --> 00:28:57.460 align:middle line:84%
Well Tenna, thanks
for joining us.

00:28:57.460 --> 00:28:57.700 align:middle line:90%
>> TENNA: Thank you.

00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:59.310 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And good luck with
your use of the stones, OK?

00:28:59.310 --> 00:28:59.910 align:middle line:90%
>> TENNA: Thank you.

00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:01.020 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Tom.

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:01.290 align:middle line:90%
>> BENEDICT: Many blessings.

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:03.030 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And Tom, always a
pleasure to you, my friend.

00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:03.940 align:middle line:84%
>> BENEDICT: Many
blessings, George.

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:04.730 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:07.200 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Energy
healing with stones.

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.770 align:middle line:90%
It's remarkable.

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:11.755 align:middle line:10%
Each stone has a
different property.

00:29:11.755 --> 00:29:13.880 align:middle line:10%
So the next time you're
perusing and you're saying,

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:14.730 align:middle line:10%
hey, you know what?

00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:17.080 align:middle line:10%
I want something to
create a better mood,

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:20.670 align:middle line:10%
or I want a stone
that brings me riches.

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:22.950 align:middle line:90%
Each stone can help you.

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:26.222 align:middle line:84%
