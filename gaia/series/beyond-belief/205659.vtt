>>THERESA BULLARD: My
journey through physics

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.460 align:middle line:90%
has been an interesting one.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.490 align:middle line:84%
That's what put me on a new
path to bridge the science

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.560 align:middle line:84%
and spirituality
through sacred geometry,

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.450 align:middle line:90%
numerology, Tarot, astrology.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've learned all of these
systems as different ways

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.580 align:middle line:84%
for communicating
with the universe.

>>GEORGE NOORY: You can
really change your life

if you tap into this.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Then there's 22
archetypes or 22 pathways that

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.980 align:middle line:84%
are these life lessons and
transformations that we're

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.070 align:middle line:90%
supposed to go through.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.340 align:middle line:84%
It's not just about
having the information.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.063 align:middle line:84%
It's about directly
experiencing it

00:00:39.063 --> 00:00:41.230 align:middle line:84%
so that I can create the
life I really want to live.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.930 align:middle line:90%

>>NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.430 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Theresa Bullard is with
us, a PhD, a physicist.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.810 align:middle line:10%
Hosts a great program on Gaia
called "Mystery Teachings,"

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.600 align:middle line:10%
and is an international
spiritual teacher

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.160 align:middle line:10%
with the Modern Mystery School.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.670 align:middle line:84%
Now she merges science,
ancient wisdom,

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.030 align:middle line:84%
powerful, time-tested techniques
for harnessing consciousness,

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.570 align:middle line:84%
which is pretty interesting
for a physicist, Theresa.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.780 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the program.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.530 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Thank you, George.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:12.750 align:middle line:90%
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me about
your physicist background.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.350 align:middle line:90%
How did that all happen for you?

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: A lot
of it was, I think,

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.130 align:middle line:84%
the universe guiding
me into physics.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.370 align:middle line:10%
But I started out
wondering, what

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.070 align:middle line:10%
was I going to do as
I got into college

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.450 align:middle line:10%
and was going for my degrees?

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.100 align:middle line:90%
What was I going to major in?

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.810 align:middle line:10%
And I had been having--

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.290 align:middle line:10%
I was on a tour to try
and explore some colleges.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.490 align:middle line:10%
And then we went through
Sedona, and my mom and I

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.480 align:middle line:10%
were on this road trip.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.182 align:middle line:84%
And we had a really
magical time in Sedona

00:01:42.182 --> 00:01:43.140 align:middle line:90%
just with the vortexes.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a
magical area too.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.820 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:45.900 align:middle line:90%
Very beautiful.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.707 align:middle line:90%
And it was just very elevating.

00:01:47.707 --> 00:01:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And so then we were driving
through the desert at night.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.050 align:middle line:84%
I was looking out at
the stars at night

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.200 align:middle line:84%
with no light pollution, and you
could just see the whole Milky

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.305 align:middle line:90%
Way stretching across.

00:01:56.305 --> 00:01:57.305 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Shooting stars.

00:01:57.305 --> 00:01:58.140 align:middle line:90%
Choo!

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Yeah, I might
have seen a shooting star

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:00.770 align:middle line:90%
that night.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And I just remember thinking,
gosh, what is out there?

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.790 align:middle line:90%
I want to know what's out there.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.680 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be so
much more going on

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.730 align:middle line:84%
in this universe than
our mundane little lives

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:10.530 align:middle line:90%
here on Earth.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.988 align:middle line:84%
So I want to know
what's out there.

00:02:11.988 --> 00:02:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
moment that I thought,

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.380 align:middle line:84%
oh, that's what I will study
is astronomy and astrophysics.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And so then that led me into
getting first my bachelor's

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.120 align:middle line:90%
in physics.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And then when I was in
the physics studies,

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.750 align:middle line:84%
I really got excited by
high-energy physics, particle

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.040 align:middle line:84%
physics, astrophysics, and
went into then graduate school

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.830 align:middle line:90%
to explore some of those topics.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And my journey through physics
has been an interesting one.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, I ended up
doing my dissertation work

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.630 align:middle line:84%
in crystal chemistry,
material science, and origin

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.597 align:middle line:90%
of life theories.

00:02:49.597 --> 00:02:50.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fantastic.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.720 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.550 align:middle line:90%
Very, very eclectic--

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You seem to
merge a lot of that

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.150 align:middle line:84%
into your television show here
on Gaia, "Mystery Teachings."

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.200 align:middle line:84%
So you've taken that
love and that passion,

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.850 align:middle line:84%
and you've turned
it into that too.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:03.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Yeah,
you know, I always

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.610 align:middle line:84%
found that I was
one who really liked

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.880 align:middle line:84%
to explore a broad
range of topics

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.080 align:middle line:84%
and see how the different pieces
of the puzzles fit together,

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.615 align:middle line:84%
even when they were
disparate fields,

00:03:15.615 --> 00:03:20.590 align:middle line:84%
different DNA versus quantum
physics versus our psychology.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: And yet,
I was often one

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.840 align:middle line:84%
of those people who
was just-- my mind was

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.180 align:middle line:84%
really good at putting those
puzzle pieces together.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.760 align:middle line:84%
So most physicists
tend to be very

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.770 align:middle line:84%
into the minutia
and the details,

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.880 align:middle line:84%
and they get really deep into
their expertise in one area.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.420 align:middle line:84%
But I was one of
those people who's

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.013 align:middle line:84%
more learning different subjects
and putting them together.

00:03:39.013 --> 00:03:41.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you have loved
to have met Albert Einstein?

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.230 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Oh, yeah.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
you have asked him?

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.200 align:middle line:84%
If he were on "Mystery
Teachings," you're

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.935 align:middle line:84%
interviewing him, what
would you have asked him?

00:03:48.935 --> 00:03:50.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: I would
have asked him

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.873 align:middle line:84%
what he feels is the most
important aspect to life.

00:03:54.873 --> 00:03:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think I know what he would
have answered, because he often

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.140 align:middle line:84%
talked about it, which was
creativity, to not just get so

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.010 align:middle line:84%
stuck in the left brain
and to allow the spirit

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.810 align:middle line:84%
to explore through the
creative dimensions as well

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.110 align:middle line:84%
and have that balance
between the two.

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
been able to merge

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.529 align:middle line:84%
science and the
spiritual aspect of life?

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:19.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: That has been
one of my lifelong goals

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.650 align:middle line:84%
is to find the ways to merge
the two, because I feel

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.690 align:middle line:84%
that the science
really gives us a very

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.622 align:middle line:84%
grounded, rational
approach to the world

00:04:29.622 --> 00:04:31.080 align:middle line:84%
and trying to
understand how things

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.300 align:middle line:84%
work from first principles,
but it lacks the deeper meaning

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.370 align:middle line:90%
and purpose to it all.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.490 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we can apply those
technologies towards--

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.250 align:middle line:84%
the science towards the
technology and advancing

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.460 align:middle line:90%
from that perspective.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.000 align:middle line:84%
But what's the deeper purpose
when it comes to our lives

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.430 align:middle line:84%
and how it makes our lives
really better or more

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.430 align:middle line:90%
meaningful?

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.570 align:middle line:84%
So I feel that the
spirit and that pursuit

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.290 align:middle line:84%
of what is within us and what
is the purpose of our lives

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.560 align:middle line:84%
and the meaning for why we're
here, I feel like that for me

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.980 align:middle line:84%
personally was such a big
piece, a key to bringing

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.780 align:middle line:84%
a sense of balance
and joy and direction

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.530 align:middle line:84%
to why I was studying
what I was studying.

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.287 align:middle line:84%
So bringing the two
together has been the key.

00:05:13.287 --> 00:05:14.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's your goal.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:15.180 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You could
tell on your program

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.730 align:middle line:84%
that you're looking
for that answer.

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:19.530 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah.

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:20.572 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Trying to merge.

00:05:20.572 --> 00:05:22.410 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
on your first season

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.330 align:middle line:84%
of "Mystery
Teachings," you jumped

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.660 align:middle line:84%
into a story about how
22 different aspects

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.595 align:middle line:84%
of our personal selves are
living within ourselves.

00:05:31.595 --> 00:05:33.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: How does this
work from the metaphysical

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.580 align:middle line:90%
perspective then?

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, the science of
universal Kabbalah

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.170 align:middle line:84%
limits the number of
parallel realities

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:44.400 align:middle line:84%
we might be in based on the
pattern of the tree of life.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.880 align:middle line:84%
Rather than a potentially
infinite number,

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.280 align:middle line:84%
as in the many worlds
interpretation,

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:55.590 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalah organizes them into 22
pathways on the tree of life.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.550 align:middle line:84%
These 22 pathways define
the archetypes of life

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.920 align:middle line:90%
or the ways of living life.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.430 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever wished there could
be two or more versions of you

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.070 align:middle line:84%
to accomplish all you
want to do in life,

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.130 align:middle line:84%
or that you could have
become somebody different?

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:15.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, Kabbalah says we have
22 distinct parallel realities

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.930 align:middle line:84%
or versions of ourself
in this physical world.

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:23.700 align:middle line:84%
They are 22 different
aspects of our total self,

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.490 align:middle line:84%
each one being very
different and living out

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.530 align:middle line:90%
its own physical life.

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.830 align:middle line:84%
In each one of them, the
brain and the nervous system

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.840 align:middle line:84%
are programmed
differently, giving us

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.340 align:middle line:84%
22 unique perspectives
and experiences of life

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:39.870 align:middle line:90%
and how things are.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.180 align:middle line:84%
All together, they
cover everything

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.878 align:middle line:84%
we need to learn in
this physical life.

00:06:44.878 --> 00:06:46.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Theresa, I'm a Gemini.

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:47.128 align:middle line:90%
I've got two within me.

00:06:47.128 --> 00:06:48.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: [LAUGHS]

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:49.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
talking about 22.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:50.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's actually
22 parallel selves.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:58.320 align:middle line:84%
So more like if you think from
our higher self, our spirit

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:03.030 align:middle line:84%
self, that part of us is so vast
that it couldn't necessarily

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:06.240 align:middle line:84%
be all captured within
one aspect or one

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.420 align:middle line:90%
expression of the self.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.860 align:middle line:84%
So it has 22 different
archetypal selves

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:12.990 align:middle line:90%
incarnated simultaneously.

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:15.670 align:middle line:84%
Maybe not in this timeline
that we experience.

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:17.500 align:middle line:84%
It could be throughout
multiple timelines.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did they get
22 instead of 23 or 21?

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.460 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Well, that's where
we kind of are relating it

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.220 align:middle line:84%
to the tree of life and
Kabbalah and the tree of life

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.880 align:middle line:90%
being this universal template.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.270 align:middle line:90%
It's the pattern.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And within-- it they actually
talk about 32 paths of wisdom.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:38.190 align:middle line:84%
So there's 10 spheres, which are
10 aspects of our total self.

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:41.130 align:middle line:84%
But then there's 22
archetypes or 22 pathways

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:43.920 align:middle line:84%
that are these sort
of experiences of life

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.950 align:middle line:84%
or these life lessons and
transformations that we're

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:47.950 align:middle line:90%
supposed to go through.

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:49.500 align:middle line:84%
So those archetypes
kind of oversee

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.930 align:middle line:84%
each of those different
22 parallel lives.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:55.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people pick
up on these parallel lives

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:55.950 align:middle line:90%
that they have?

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:58.650 align:middle line:84%
How do they learn
these 22 aspects?

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:00.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Some people
never do, but if they

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:04.410 align:middle line:84%
are on a path of really
trying to know thyself,

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:06.990 align:middle line:84%
to awaken more of
their full potential

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:09.510 align:middle line:84%
and their consciousness
to realize that we're

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:11.400 align:middle line:84%
more than just
this little life--

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.463 align:middle line:84%
most people are living their
lives with the blinders on,

00:08:15.463 --> 00:08:17.880 align:middle line:84%
and they're only looking at
what's right in front of them.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.047 align:middle line:84%
But as they start to realize
that I'm more than just

00:08:20.047 --> 00:08:24.270 align:middle line:84%
one thing and I can be the
artist, I can be the scientist,

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:27.420 align:middle line:84%
I can be the athlete, I
can be the entertainer,

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.700 align:middle line:84%
I can be all of these
things in one life,

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.400 align:middle line:84%
now they're starting to
wear multiple characters

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.220 align:middle line:84%
or working with the
different archetypes of life.

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And that broadens their
perception of who they are.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And it also starts tapping them
into those parallel dimensions

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:44.545 align:middle line:84%
or parallel aspects
of their life.

00:08:44.545 --> 00:08:46.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Theresa, do you find
that most successful people

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:50.722 align:middle line:84%
like Jeff Bezos, Arnold
Schwarzenegger tap into this?

00:08:50.722 --> 00:08:51.930 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Some of them have.

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:55.080 align:middle line:84%
I think some of them have
just gotten really good

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.940 align:middle line:90%
in one archetype, you know?

00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:00.010 align:middle line:84%
You have your Jeff Bezos
or your Zuckerberg,

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:04.230 align:middle line:84%
who they're really
good at innovating

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:07.710 align:middle line:84%
or they're really good at
being the leader, right?

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:09.390 align:middle line:84%
Being the emperor
kind of energy.

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:10.190 align:middle line:90%
So they can--

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:12.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Surrounding
themselves with good people

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:12.840 align:middle line:90%
to do the work.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.673 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: And then
they surround themselves

00:09:14.673 --> 00:09:17.290 align:middle line:84%
with the other archetypes
who do those work.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:18.810 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's
actually people who

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:23.740 align:middle line:84%
are more on a journey of
expanding their sense of self,

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:25.290 align:middle line:90%
their consciousness.

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:28.410 align:middle line:84%
Not just peak performance
or just achieving

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:30.420 align:middle line:90%
material success, for example.

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:32.790 align:middle line:84%
But really awakening
consciousness

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:35.920 align:middle line:84%
to a higher, more expanded
version of the self.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.280 align:middle line:84%
So when we're on
a spiritual path

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.877 align:middle line:84%
and we start to
study the archetypes,

00:09:39.877 --> 00:09:42.210 align:middle line:84%
I think we have to study those
archetypes to even become

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:44.200 align:middle line:84%
aware of those
aspects of the self.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.950 align:middle line:84%
So people start to, for example,
just becoming more aware

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:48.300 align:middle line:90%
of astrology.

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.880 align:middle line:84%
That is one way to
study the archetypes.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.310 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalah gives us another
way to study the archetypes.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:55.500 align:middle line:90%
The Tarot gives us another way.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:59.160 align:middle line:84%
Jungian analysis and
studying the archetypes

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.010 align:middle line:84%
of movies and books
and so forth, those

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:04.770 align:middle line:84%
are all ways to start becoming
aware of those archetypes.

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:07.170 align:middle line:84%
I think they really have
to get keyed in on that

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:08.640 align:middle line:90%
as a first step.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And then they have to recognize,
how is this a part of me?

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And how is this
showing up in my life?

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:18.120 align:middle line:84%
Maybe my best friend,
maybe that person

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.310 align:middle line:90%
plays a certain role in my life.

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And you know, this
mentor over here

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:24.720 align:middle line:84%
plays another role that
I had, and they wear

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.920 align:middle line:90%
different archetypes for me.

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.200 align:middle line:84%
But how am I also a reflection
of them and them a reflection

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.000 align:middle line:90%
of me?

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.870 align:middle line:84%
So we have to really start to
perceive life and ourselves

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:36.570 align:middle line:84%
and the people in our
lives in different ways

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.360 align:middle line:90%
from a much higher perspective.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not difficult
to do that once you

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.680 align:middle line:90%
learn the techniques, is it?

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: It's not difficult,
but it takes awareness, right?

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:47.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:48.790 align:middle line:90%
You have to know about it.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:49.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: You have
to know about it,

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:51.270 align:middle line:84%
but you also have to
pay attention to it.

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:52.110 align:middle line:90%
You have to care.

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
get too wrapped up

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:57.450 align:middle line:84%
in just the mundane
materiality of life

00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:58.920 align:middle line:84%
that they're not
paying attention

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:02.760 align:middle line:84%
to those higher, more subtle
aspects that are influencing us

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.260 align:middle line:84%
all the time, but
we're maybe just

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.510 align:middle line:84%
getting caught up in
the drama of the details

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:09.550 align:middle line:84%
versus the bigger archetypal
themes that are happening.

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:10.630 align:middle line:90%
So it's about awareness.

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:12.000 align:middle line:90%
It's a key, awareness.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.980 align:middle line:90%
And then proper knowledge.

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.710 align:middle line:84%
But also living it,
embodying it, really

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:19.710 align:middle line:84%
working with tools that help
you to awaken on a daily basis

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:21.810 align:middle line:84%
to the presence of
these archetypes

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:25.080 align:middle line:84%
or these symbols, these
universal principles that

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.655 align:middle line:84%
are at play in our
life all the time.

00:11:26.655 --> 00:11:28.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I read a book,
small little red book

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:32.580 align:middle line:84%
called "The Magic of
Believing" by Claude Bristol.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.920 align:middle line:84%
An incredible book,
Theresa, where it just

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.590 align:middle line:84%
basically points
out these aspects

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:39.270 align:middle line:90%
without knowing about it.

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:43.815 align:middle line:84%
But it's very pointed that you
can really change your life

00:11:43.815 --> 00:11:45.260 align:middle line:90%
if you tap into this.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:46.060 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: You can.

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:46.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And when you become
aware of them, just

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:52.320 align:middle line:84%
by your awareness
of their presence,

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:55.560 align:middle line:84%
it's like it's opening
up the door for them

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:58.320 align:middle line:84%
to come more and
work with you more.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:02.670 align:middle line:84%
So by our awareness, we are
opening up that possibility

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:05.160 align:middle line:84%
and almost invoking that
energy into our life

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.150 align:middle line:84%
so that it becomes
alive in our life.

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And as we directly experience
it, it comes to life for us,

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:12.210 align:middle line:90%
then we know it, you know?

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:14.520 align:middle line:84%
It's not just about
having the information.

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:17.820 align:middle line:84%
It's about directly experiencing
it and living it in your life,

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:18.758 align:middle line:90%
and then you know it.

00:12:18.758 --> 00:12:19.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And learning it.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:23.340 align:middle line:84%
"Great Minds" is a Gaia
program by Jonathan Young,

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:25.980 align:middle line:90%
and he talks about his journey.

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:26.820 align:middle line:90%
Let's watch this.

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:28.040 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: OK.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.415 align:middle line:84%
>>JONATHAN YOUNG:
Joseph Campbell

00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:31.100 align:middle line:84%
had a best-selling
book in 1949 called

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.170 align:middle line:84%
"The Hero with a
Thousand Faces."

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:37.430 align:middle line:84%
That is to say, stories
are similar over time

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:38.540 align:middle line:90%
and in different cultures.

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And there is one main
story, the monomyth,

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.790 align:middle line:90%
that is told again and again.

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:46.145 align:middle line:84%
It's essentially a
journey story, a quest.

00:12:46.145 --> 00:12:50.960 align:middle line:90%


00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:52.610 align:middle line:84%
When you diagram
the hero's journey,

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:55.310 align:middle line:84%
it's customarily
depicted as a circle.

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:56.690 align:middle line:90%
You start at the top.

00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:59.360 align:middle line:84%
A calling takes you
away from the ordinary,

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.470 align:middle line:90%
and there is a descent.

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:03.900 align:middle line:84%
You cross a threshold into a
place you have not been before.

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:08.390 align:middle line:84%
There are companions, allies,
mentors, and opponents.

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:09.560 align:middle line:90%
There are ordeals.

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.270 align:middle line:84%
There is a good
deal of suffering.

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:14.870 align:middle line:84%
At the bottom, the nadir,
the dark night of the soul,

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:16.850 align:middle line:90%
it gets really hard.

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:19.130 align:middle line:84%
There is a death and
rebirth experience.

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:23.280 align:middle line:84%
The redemption is the rising up
the other side of the circle,

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.940 align:middle line:84%
and there are several lessons
to be learned on the way back.

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:28.520 align:middle line:84%
Finally, a return
threshold crossing

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.040 align:middle line:84%
when you re-enter
the place you left,

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.360 align:middle line:90%
but you are changed forever.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did he just say?

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:37.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: [LAUGHS] He's
talking about something

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:39.150 align:middle line:90%
called the hero's journey.

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:42.890 align:middle line:84%
So the hero's journey is one
of those archetypal themes

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:45.470 align:middle line:84%
or universal themes
that can play out

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:48.300 align:middle line:84%
in the process of
transformation,

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.050 align:middle line:84%
especially the
transformation of the self.

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:53.840 align:middle line:84%
So we start off sort
of naive, maybe excited

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:57.150 align:middle line:90%
for the adventure ahead.

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:58.858 align:middle line:84%
And we start to
prepare ourselves.

00:13:58.858 --> 00:13:59.900 align:middle line:90%
We do our basic learning.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:01.700 align:middle line:84%
We get our basic
skills together.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.920 align:middle line:90%
And then we venture off.

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.770 align:middle line:84%
We kind of leave home
off on this adventure

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:09.170 align:middle line:90%
of life, whatever that is.

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And through that adventure,
you start to have challenges.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.520 align:middle line:90%
You start to meet adversaries.

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:17.720 align:middle line:90%
You meet teachers.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.990 align:middle line:84%
You meet different
characters along the way who

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:23.750 align:middle line:90%
are all a part of that journey.

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:26.077 align:middle line:84%
Whether they're an adversary
or a teacher or a friend,

00:14:26.077 --> 00:14:28.160 align:middle line:84%
they're all there to teach
us something, you know?

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.990 align:middle line:84%
They're there to
help us discover

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:31.880 align:middle line:90%
the resources that are within.

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:35.450 align:middle line:84%
And then in the real
testing of the hero

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:38.090 align:middle line:84%
or the person who's on this
journey of transformation,

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:40.970 align:middle line:84%
they have to meet a real
dark place within themselves

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:46.070 align:middle line:84%
and really not run away
from the challenge,

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:49.160 align:middle line:84%
not let their fears
paralyze them,

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.310 align:middle line:84%
but move forward with
courage to continue

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:55.280 align:middle line:84%
through those darker
or challenging times,

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.710 align:middle line:84%
because those are the times
that test us the most,

00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:00.200 align:middle line:84%
but they're also the times
that really reveal to us

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.670 align:middle line:90%
our greatest strengths.

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:03.870 align:middle line:84%
So that time is a place
where we often call

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:05.120 align:middle line:90%
it the dark night of the soul.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.880 align:middle line:84%
It's a letting go of the
old, the false identities

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:11.000 align:middle line:84%
of the self, the personality
that is just a mask.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.860 align:middle line:84%
It's not the truth
of who we are.

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.590 align:middle line:84%
And really digging
in to discover

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:17.660 align:middle line:84%
the deeper essence
of who we are that

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:21.350 align:middle line:84%
is more a part of our
essential self, our core.

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And then as we
emerge out of that,

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:27.320 align:middle line:84%
we start to come into greater
and greater levels of light,

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:32.640 align:middle line:84%
of joy again, of breakthroughs,
and sense of accomplishment

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.850 align:middle line:84%
and so forth until we
complete the journey

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:38.180 align:middle line:84%
and achieve the goal, which
is really the transformation

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:39.050 align:middle line:90%
of the self.

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:39.950 align:middle line:90%
And it's a cycle.

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:40.910 align:middle line:90%
It's a cyclic process.

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:42.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
ever think when you

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:44.960 align:middle line:84%
were getting your degree
in physics that you'd

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.550 align:middle line:90%
be dealing with this?

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:48.620 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Not originally, no.

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:51.080 align:middle line:84%
At first I just thought,
I'm just on a path

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:54.800 align:middle line:84%
to get a career in
some field that will

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.380 align:middle line:90%
keep my interest for my life.

00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to go as
far with my education

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:03.860 align:middle line:84%
as I needed to go so that I
never hit that glass ceiling

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:07.130 align:middle line:84%
or that kind of, that's as
far as you're going to go.

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:10.990 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to be able to go as
far as wherever my interest took

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:11.790 align:middle line:90%
me.

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:14.400 align:middle line:84%
And then as I got
into graduate school,

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.210 align:middle line:84%
I realized it wasn't what I
thought it was going to be.

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:18.860 align:middle line:90%
It didn't talk about meaning.

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:21.510 align:middle line:84%
It didn't talk about the deeper
aspects of what I was learning.

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:24.320 align:middle line:84%
It was just like,
solve the equations.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.310 align:middle line:90%
Pass your tests.

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:26.720 align:middle line:90%
Do your homework.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:27.830 align:middle line:90%
Do your research.

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And don't ask questions
about meaning or philosophy

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:31.770 align:middle line:90%
or any of that.

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And so I found myself
really out of balance

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:35.482 align:middle line:90%
after about a year of that.

00:16:35.482 --> 00:16:37.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't
teach this in school.

00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:38.060 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: No, no.

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:38.902 align:middle line:90%
I wish they did.

00:16:38.902 --> 00:16:41.360 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're starting to teach
more interesting things now

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:44.420 align:middle line:84%
because they're starting
to open up and into more

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:48.290 align:middle line:84%
interdisciplinary research
than when I was there.

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:52.670 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, I realized that the
search of the self and what

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:55.250 align:middle line:84%
brings us meaning
and purpose was

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:59.493 align:middle line:84%
equally important to gaining the
knowledge and the information

00:16:59.493 --> 00:17:01.160 align:middle line:84%
that could be applied
in a material way.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.990 align:middle line:84%
It was like, well,
what about the soul?

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:05.630 align:middle line:84%
What about who am I, and
what do I like to do?

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And how am I going to really
bring my gifts into the world?

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And then how can I
do that in a way that

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:13.609 align:middle line:84%
actually leaves some kind of
meaningful impact or legacy?

00:17:13.609 --> 00:17:16.819 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what really
put me on a new path

00:17:16.819 --> 00:17:19.760 align:middle line:84%
to finding ways to
bridge the science

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:22.579 align:middle line:84%
and spirituality, but not
just at a philosophical level.

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:24.950 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to really make it
practical and applicable

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:29.357 align:middle line:84%
to life where we could really
see the results and the impact

00:17:29.357 --> 00:17:30.440 align:middle line:90%
that it makes in our life.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's what led
me into discovering

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:37.170 align:middle line:84%
my way onto the Mystery School
path and deeper ancient wisdom

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:37.970 align:middle line:90%
teachings.

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:42.140 align:middle line:84%
Not just new agey stuff,
but deeper, really grounded,

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:44.840 align:middle line:84%
really practical
and applied approach

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:47.510 align:middle line:84%
that does draw from
ancient science--

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:51.260 align:middle line:84%
hermetics, alchemy,
sacred geometry,

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:52.685 align:middle line:84%
divine mathematics--
you know, it

00:17:52.685 --> 00:17:54.590 align:middle line:84%
draws from those
ancient sciences,

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:57.740 align:middle line:84%
but then also merges it
with the modern science.

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:01.055 align:middle line:84%
And yet, it also has this
spiritual component to it.

00:18:01.055 --> 00:18:04.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, the fact that
the ancients tapped into this

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:07.880 align:middle line:84%
tells you a lot about what
they believed in those days,

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.110 align:middle line:90%
doesn't it?

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:10.070 align:middle line:90%
Remarkable.

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:11.050 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: They were.

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:14.570 align:middle line:84%
They had really amazing
visions and insights

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:16.520 align:middle line:90%
into how the universe works.

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:19.910 align:middle line:84%
And they needed to use
a metaphorical language

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:23.335 align:middle line:84%
to try and put their
visions into a context

00:18:23.335 --> 00:18:25.460 align:middle line:84%
that they could express
and understand at that time

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:27.000 align:middle line:90%
to teach it to others.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.840 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at just
the essence of what

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.980 align:middle line:84%
they were teaching, it's amazing
how much the ancient wisdom

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:37.680 align:middle line:84%
teachings parallel what modern
science is discovering today.

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:40.100 align:middle line:84%
So we have a new metaphorical
language today, which

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:42.200 align:middle line:90%
is the language of science.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And it might be more
applied and mathematical,

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:48.200 align:middle line:84%
but we can take these ancient
principles and ancient wisdom

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.690 align:middle line:84%
teachings and we can take
it with modern science

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:53.033 align:middle line:84%
and show how they parallel,
which is a big part of what

00:18:53.033 --> 00:18:54.200 align:middle line:90%
I do in "Mystery Teachings."

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are archetypes?

00:18:56.250 --> 00:19:00.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Archetypes are a
pattern of creation, maybe

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:00.860 align:middle line:90%
a symbol.

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:02.735 align:middle line:84%
We could say it's a
symbol, but it's actually

00:19:02.735 --> 00:19:06.740 align:middle line:84%
got its own life, its own
being in these higher--

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:08.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's own personality?

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:09.048 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Personality.

00:19:09.048 --> 00:19:11.390 align:middle line:84%
We can maybe say personality,
but it's characteristics,

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:11.560 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:12.860 align:middle line:90%
It has its character.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.060 align:middle line:90%
And it's sort of a--

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:18.920 align:middle line:84%
Carl Jung called it a certain
motif or pattern whereby

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:23.540 align:middle line:84%
in every book, every movie,
every story that we've ever

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:25.610 align:middle line:84%
told, as well as
in our own lives,

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:27.998 align:middle line:84%
these archetypes show up
again and again and again.

00:19:27.998 --> 00:19:29.040 align:middle line:90%
There's certain limited--

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:29.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
patterns to this.

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:30.947 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: There's patterns.

00:19:30.947 --> 00:19:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And those can be characters like
the maiden, the hero, the king,

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:37.045 align:middle line:90%
the queen, the villain.

00:19:37.045 --> 00:19:38.045 align:middle line:90%
Those can be characters.

00:19:38.045 --> 00:19:39.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sounds
like Tarot cards.

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:40.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yes.

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And it could also
be live lessons.

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:46.190 align:middle line:84%
So the journey of the hero, life
and death, good versus evil.

00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:48.420 align:middle line:84%
These are also
themes that show up.

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:50.720 align:middle line:84%
But yes, the Tarot
are one way in which

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:56.360 align:middle line:84%
we can capture the 22 major
archetypes that influence us

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:57.170 align:middle line:90%
as humans.

00:19:57.170 --> 00:19:59.003 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On your program,
your latest season

00:19:59.003 --> 00:20:03.110 align:middle line:84%
of "Mystery Teachings," you
discuss the Tree of Life

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:04.070 align:middle line:90%
in more detail.

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:06.650 align:middle line:84%
What exactly is the Tree
of Life in your opinion?

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:10.400 align:middle line:10%
>>BULLARD: The Tree of Life
is a glyph, a pattern, again,

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:14.030 align:middle line:10%
of creation that relates to
the Kabbalistic tradition.

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:15.830 align:middle line:90%
But it's really this--

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:19.820 align:middle line:84%
it's a sacred geometry that
our own DNA is built around.

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:21.800 align:middle line:84%
You could lay out
crystals according

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.360 align:middle line:90%
to that same geometry.

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:26.667 align:middle line:84%
Our DNA, which is a liquid
crystal, our own body.

00:20:26.667 --> 00:20:28.250 align:middle line:84%
They say it's the
pattern of creation,

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:31.100 align:middle line:84%
and it can apply at many
different levels and kind

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:35.420 align:middle line:84%
of holographically from the
cosmic into the microcosmic.

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:37.940 align:middle line:84%
So we use it as
a tool for really

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:40.100 align:middle line:84%
helping us understand
many different aspects

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:41.520 align:middle line:90%
of the universe and ourselves.

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:44.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How does the
Tarot relate to this?

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: So Tarot
is not Kabbalistic,

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:49.130 align:middle line:84%
but because the tree of
life is a universal template

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:54.080 align:middle line:84%
for organizing information
from physics all the way down

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:57.920 align:middle line:84%
to psychology and divinity,
we can use this Tree of Life

00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:58.910 align:middle line:90%
as a filing system.

00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And you kind of map all
these different systems--

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:03.620 align:middle line:84%
we call them systems
of correspondence--

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:04.800 align:middle line:90%
onto the Tree of Life.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:10.130 align:middle line:84%
So the 22 Major
Arcana of the Tarot

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:14.750 align:middle line:84%
can be associated with the 22
pathways of the Tree of Life.

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:18.350 align:middle line:84%
The Minor Arcana,
the one through 10

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:21.440 align:middle line:84%
or the ace through 10 can
be related to the spheres

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:22.610 align:middle line:90%
on the Tree of Life.

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And then you have some
suit cards as well,

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:26.900 align:middle line:84%
which relate to
the four elements.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:30.260 align:middle line:84%
So we can map this
system of Tarot,

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:32.930 align:middle line:84%
which goes all the way
back to ancient Egypt.

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And we can map it
onto the tree of life

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:37.350 align:middle line:84%
so we can show the
correlations between them.

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:40.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take a look how
you illustrate it even more.

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:43.100 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Now, why 22?

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:45.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's based on the
structure of the Tree of Life.

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:47.330 align:middle line:84%
There are 10
Sephiroth on the Tree

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:51.560 align:middle line:84%
of Life, and 22 paths that
connect those together.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.050 align:middle line:84%
The spheres represent
objective states

00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:56.570 align:middle line:84%
of being while the
pathways represent

00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:59.810 align:middle line:84%
the subjective experience
of traveling between them.

00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:03.380 align:middle line:84%
And they're often referred
to as states of becoming.

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:07.340 align:middle line:84%
These 22 pathways basically
define the key lessons

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:10.520 align:middle line:84%
and transformations that we're
meant to go through in life.

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:13.580 align:middle line:84%
Each path invokes an energy
that brings movement,

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:17.330 align:middle line:84%
and it shifts us from one
state of being to another.

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:21.620 align:middle line:84%
In essence, they catalyze
spiritual and personal alchemy.

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:24.530 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything that can
help us better understand

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:26.450 align:middle line:90%
what these archetypes are?

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:28.636 align:middle line:90%
Fortunately, yes.

00:22:28.636 --> 00:22:31.220 align:middle line:10%
Now while there's many
layers to these archetypes,

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:32.960 align:middle line:10%
one tool that we
can use that makes

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.660 align:middle line:10%
them more relatable
to our physical lives

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:38.620 align:middle line:10%
is the Major Arcana
of the Tarot.

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:41.660 align:middle line:10%
Now, the term "arcana" comes
from the Latin "arcanum,"

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:45.420 align:middle line:10%
which basically means
a mystery or a secret.

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:47.030 align:middle line:84%
But before we go
much further, let

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:51.110 align:middle line:84%
me first clarify that Tarot
does not come from Kabbalah,

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:53.900 align:middle line:84%
but it can be related,
because the Tree of Life

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:56.390 align:middle line:84%
is a universal
template for organizing

00:22:56.390 --> 00:23:01.760 align:middle line:84%
information about our lives
and the universe as a whole.

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And the Major Arcana do
relate to the 22 archetypes

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:08.160 align:middle line:84%
of our physical
life experiences,

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:13.580 align:middle line:84%
so they can be mapped onto the
Tree of Life and its 22 paths.

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:16.700 align:middle line:10%
These correlations of the
archetypes to the paths

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:20.870 align:middle line:10%
were first made by a French
initiate, Eliphas Levi,

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:22.580 align:middle line:10%
over 100 years ago.

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And then he was followed by
other initiates of the Western

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:27.250 align:middle line:90%
Mystery School tradition.

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:29.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These mystery schools
are fascinating, aren't they?

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:30.290 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah.

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:31.290 align:middle line:90%
I think so too.

00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:34.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, how does
he develop things like that?

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:36.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Well,
first they would

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:38.780 align:middle line:90%
study the various mysteries.

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And you know, they were
like scientists to me.

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:42.620 align:middle line:90%
They were researchers.

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:45.260 align:middle line:84%
They really dug
into the old texts.

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:46.430 align:middle line:90%
They also practiced.

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:49.550 align:middle line:84%
They applied the tools
and the teachings.

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:51.590 align:middle line:90%
You know, they lived it, right?

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:53.320 align:middle line:90%
But they were scholarly as well.

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:58.640 align:middle line:84%
So they really researched all
these different traditions,

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.650 align:middle line:84%
the different knowledge,
the wisdom teachings,

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:02.930 align:middle line:84%
and then they started
to see the correlations.

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And Kabbalah in particular
in the Western Mystery School

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:09.380 align:middle line:84%
tradition has become
a central framework

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:13.220 align:middle line:84%
for helping understand
and put context or see

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:16.970 align:middle line:84%
the relationships between all
these other kind of aspects

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:18.350 align:middle line:90%
of the Mystery teachings.

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:20.090 align:middle line:84%
And so it became this
framework to start

00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:22.700 align:middle line:84%
organizing all of this
information into one

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:25.370 align:middle line:84%
more cohesive whole,
which is one of the things

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:27.200 align:middle line:84%
I loved about it,
because it helps

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:30.170 align:middle line:84%
to see the connections that
you might not ordinarily

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:31.310 align:middle line:90%
see otherwise.

00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:33.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Tarot card
readers, the people

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:38.660 align:middle line:84%
who have the deck of cards
and pull, are they tuned in?

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:40.282 align:middle line:90%
Do they know what they're doing?

00:24:40.282 --> 00:24:41.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Well, I
think just by the fact

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:43.490 align:middle line:84%
that they're working
with the Tarot,

00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:46.610 align:middle line:84%
they are developing relationship
with these archetypes.

00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:50.570 align:middle line:84%
But I think it also depends
on which deck they use,

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:53.340 align:middle line:84%
because there are going to be
slightly different depictions

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:55.550 align:middle line:90%
in every deck, and so forth.

00:24:55.550 --> 00:25:00.170 align:middle line:84%
But the way that we work
with the Tarot in the Mystery

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:04.730 align:middle line:84%
tradition is first and
foremost to use them as windows

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:08.570 align:middle line:84%
or like a symbolic
visual representation

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:11.210 align:middle line:84%
of the archetypes in a way
to start connecting with them

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:14.180 align:middle line:84%
from our consciousness and
awareness into that energy

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:15.230 align:middle line:90%
symbolically.

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:17.120 align:middle line:84%
So we're not using
them initially so much

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:17.990 align:middle line:90%
for divination.

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:20.810 align:middle line:84%
We're using them for
helping them become windows

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:23.732 align:middle line:84%
into the self and those
aspects of ourselves.

00:25:23.732 --> 00:25:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And then down the
line, once you've

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:27.740 align:middle line:84%
developed that
relationship with them

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:29.840 align:middle line:84%
at a very personal
level, then if you wanted

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:33.770 align:middle line:84%
to use them to gain insight into
synchronicities, for example,

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:34.853 align:middle line:90%
or for what people might--

00:25:34.853 --> 00:25:36.395 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
what the Tarot card

00:25:36.395 --> 00:25:37.590 align:middle line:90%
readers are doing nowadays.

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:38.390 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah.

00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:38.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.220 align:middle line:84%
But they're not
necessarily always

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:41.990 align:middle line:84%
studying the deeper
mysteries of the Tarot

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:43.220 align:middle line:84%
before they're
starting to learn how

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:44.590 align:middle line:90%
to use Tarot for divination.

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:46.430 align:middle line:90%
So I would reverse that process.

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:48.470 align:middle line:84%
I would learn the deeper
mysteries of the Tarot

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:52.190 align:middle line:84%
first and then use them for
divination, because then you

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:55.610 align:middle line:84%
really understand deeper
messages and deeper

00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:57.770 align:middle line:84%
teachings that are there,
contained within it.

00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:00.710 align:middle line:84%
The Tarot is like
a book of wisdom,

00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:05.950 align:middle line:84%
but it's depicted in visual
format versus language.

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:08.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you had a Tarot
card reading done on yourself?

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:09.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Sure.

00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:10.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it fascinating?

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.540 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: You know, it is.

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:15.890 align:middle line:84%
It's one way that we can
tap into synchronicity

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:18.710 align:middle line:84%
and the universe communicating
to us through symbols.

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:20.600 align:middle line:90%
I also like numerology.

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:21.490 align:middle line:90%
I like astrology.

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:23.510 align:middle line:84%
You know, they're
all different windows

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:26.540 align:middle line:84%
into the self and windows
into the different themes

00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:28.347 align:middle line:84%
or energies that are
at play in our lives,

00:26:28.347 --> 00:26:29.930 align:middle line:84%
so I think they're
very helpful tools.

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:31.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they predictive?

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: They
can be predictive,

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:35.480 align:middle line:84%
but it's more like
they're just showing you

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:38.460 align:middle line:90%
influences that are happening.

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:41.450 align:middle line:84%
We don't necessarily know how
those influences are exactly

00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:44.360 align:middle line:84%
going to manifest themselves,
because that has a lot

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:46.120 align:middle line:90%
to do with human choice, right?

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:48.650 align:middle line:84%
So for us in the
Mystery tradition,

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:51.260 align:middle line:84%
if anyone were to
go to a reader,

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:53.330 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a psychic
reader, a Tarot reader,

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:53.900 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't matter--

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:55.233 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Numerologist, whatever.

00:26:55.233 --> 00:26:56.300 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Any kind.

00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:58.430 align:middle line:84%
That reader should
only be saying,

00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:00.590 align:middle line:84%
these are the influences
I see, but you always

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:03.450 align:middle line:84%
have a choice about what
you want to do with this.

00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:04.950 align:middle line:84%
So what do you want
to do with this?

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:06.700 align:middle line:84%
It's not like,
this is the reading

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:08.540 align:middle line:84%
and this is going
to happen this way.

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:11.810 align:middle line:84%
It's more like this is the
influence available right now.

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:13.640 align:middle line:84%
This is the message
that's coming through.

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:15.360 align:middle line:84%
What do you choose to
do about it, right?

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:18.200 align:middle line:84%
So we're always empowered
to make a choice about what

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.060 align:middle line:84%
we do with the
information we're given,

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:22.055 align:middle line:84%
and that's really
important, I think.

00:27:22.055 --> 00:27:25.685 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to look at the
Tarot card-- the Wheel of Life.

00:27:25.685 --> 00:27:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And you tell us what we're
looking at here, Theresa.

00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:29.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: OK.

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:30.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Explain that.

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:31.210 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah.

00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:35.810 align:middle line:84%
So this Wheel of Fortune
really explains in a large part

00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:38.480 align:middle line:84%
the whole of the
journey of the hero.

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:41.897 align:middle line:10%
So if you look at the top,
you see a sphinx at the top.

00:27:41.897 --> 00:27:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And the sphinx is kind
of like the guardian.

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:45.560 align:middle line:90%
It represents the spirit.

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:49.040 align:middle line:10%
It's got both the human head
but also the animal body,

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.390 align:middle line:10%
but it's got a sword.

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:52.670 align:middle line:10%
It's got an Egyptian
kind of headdress on.

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:54.080 align:middle line:10%
So it represents a deity.

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:55.135 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And a long tail.

00:27:55.135 --> 00:27:56.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: And a
long tail, yeah.

00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:59.310 align:middle line:84%
But it kind of represents this
union of heaven and Earth,

00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:00.110 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:03.350 align:middle line:10%
And it's sort of this
transformed being.

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:05.520 align:middle line:10%
But then you come down
the left-hand side

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:09.180 align:middle line:10%
and you see the serpent, which
is the search for knowledge.

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:11.660 align:middle line:10%
It's also the search of
the life force energy,

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:13.830 align:middle line:10%
descending into matter.

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:16.310 align:middle line:10%
And so it's in this
descent process,

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:18.650 align:middle line:10%
which usually the hero's
journey starts off

00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:23.030 align:middle line:10%
with the descent into the
world, into physicality.

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:24.320 align:middle line:10%
And then you see--

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.870 align:middle line:10%
they call it the hermanubis.

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:28.880 align:middle line:10%
It's like a jackal-headed,
human kind of character.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.860 align:middle line:10%
And he's just
rounding the corner

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:34.730 align:middle line:10%
and starting the ascent back
up towards the spiritual realm.

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:36.920 align:middle line:10%
So he's not quite on
the full ascent yet,

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:38.540 align:middle line:10%
but he's rounding the corner.

00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:41.690 align:middle line:10%
And this represents humans
on their ascension journey

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:43.220 align:middle line:10%
to higher consciousness.

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:46.250 align:middle line:10%
And then you have what we
call the four holy living

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:47.400 align:middle line:10%
creatures around.

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.580 align:middle line:10%
They represent the
four fixed signs

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:55.070 align:middle line:10%
of the zodiac, of Leo,
Taurus, Aquarius, and Scorpio.

00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:57.720 align:middle line:10%
And they represent the four
elements, the four watchtowers.

00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:00.980 align:middle line:10%
So they're these energies that
kind of anchor this experience

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:01.910 align:middle line:10%
we're having.

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:04.910 align:middle line:10%
And then in the center of the
wheel, it's like a portal.

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:05.820 align:middle line:10%
You have--

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:06.620 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: A doorway?

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:07.985 align:middle line:10%
>>BULLARD: A doorway, yeah.

00:29:07.985 --> 00:29:09.050 align:middle line:10%
It's a rotation.

00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:10.350 align:middle line:10%
It's a cycle.

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:12.950 align:middle line:10%
And as you go around
each cycle, it's

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:15.350 align:middle line:10%
like you're spiraling
up to another level

00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:16.580 align:middle line:10%
and another level.

00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:18.590 align:middle line:90%
And it spells Tarot.

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:21.650 align:middle line:84%
It also spells
roda, ator, Tarot.

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:24.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of
a clue, you know?

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:26.510 align:middle line:84%
There's a secret mystery
hidden within it.

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:28.710 align:middle line:84%
You see symbols of
alchemy inside of it.

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:32.600 align:middle line:84%
So this one card represents
the entire journey

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:38.370 align:middle line:84%
of the hero's journey, the
cycle of transformation.

00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:40.370 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot
going on in there.

00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:42.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's very much
about the alchemy that

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:44.660 align:middle line:84%
happens through that
journey, the alchemy

00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:47.480 align:middle line:84%
of personal transformation,
separating out

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:49.880 align:middle line:84%
the essentials of
who we are, trying

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:52.610 align:middle line:84%
to extract the
true essence of who

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:56.570 align:middle line:84%
we are from the core
self versus what

00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:58.100 align:middle line:90%
happens on the outer realm.

00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:00.410 align:middle line:84%
So it's about ultimately
trying to get into the center.

00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:02.202 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's just
one of how many cards?

00:30:02.202 --> 00:30:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: 22 of
the Major Arcana.

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:07.940 align:middle line:10%
And this is the 10th one,
which is kind of a turning

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:09.380 align:middle line:10%
point in the whole journey.

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:12.230 align:middle line:84%
So we start off as
the fool, as a sort

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:16.190 align:middle line:84%
of naive, exuberant spirit,
ready to go off on adventure.

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And then the fool goes
through this descent

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:20.810 align:middle line:84%
until it comes to
this card, the Wheel.

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:24.420 align:middle line:84%
And the Wheel of Fortune is
sort of like the twist of fate.

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:27.773 align:middle line:84%
There's the fates that just sort
of make it an unexpected change

00:30:27.773 --> 00:30:30.440 align:middle line:84%
in your life, and then that sets
you on the rest of the journey.

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:32.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got a clip of
you discussing this journey

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:34.940 align:middle line:90%
and this transformation.

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Returning to
Kabbalah for a moment,

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:41.270 align:middle line:84%
recall that we said that the 22
Major Arcana can be mapped out

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:44.390 align:middle line:84%
onto the 22 paths
of the Tree of Life.

00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:47.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, each of these paths is
really more about the 22 Hebrew

00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:51.500 align:middle line:84%
letters, which are said to be
an ancient language of light

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:53.480 align:middle line:90%
and creation.

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:56.330 align:middle line:84%
Now in addition to these
letters being associated

00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:58.970 align:middle line:84%
with the Tree of Life,
in the Sefer Yetzirah

00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:00.560 align:middle line:84%
or the Book of
Formation, they're

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:04.520 align:middle line:84%
also described as being
arranged on a sphere.

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:07.790 align:middle line:84%
And in this circular format,
when every letter is then

00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:10.340 align:middle line:84%
connected to every
other letter, it

00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:15.830 align:middle line:84%
forms a beautiful mandala
known as the 231 gates.

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:18.770 align:middle line:84%
When we then match the Tarot
keys with their Hebrew letters

00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:23.240 align:middle line:84%
around this sphere, we can see
that it becomes like a wheel.

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:26.240 align:middle line:10%
Now in this arrangement,
the key zero or the fool

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:29.210 align:middle line:10%
is placed at the top of
the wheel with aleph.

00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:33.710 align:middle line:10%
Keys one through 10 then
descend down on the last side.

00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:37.850 align:middle line:10%
Between key 10, the wheel,
and key 11, justice,

00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:41.150 align:middle line:10%
is what we call a turning
point at the bottom.

00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:47.420 align:middle line:10%
And then keys 12 through 21
ascend up on the right side.

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:50.900 align:middle line:84%
As this wheel spins, it goes
through one complete cycle

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:53.420 align:middle line:90%
of the alchemical process.

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:58.260 align:middle line:10%
Now in alchemy, the number
seven is also really important.

00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:02.030 align:middle line:10%
There's seven stages in the
transformational process, which

00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:04.580 align:middle line:10%
is something that we explored
in season three of "Mystery

00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:06.800 align:middle line:10%
Teachings."

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:08.450 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Egyptian
mythology, there

00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:11.000 align:middle line:84%
were also seven stages
of the soul's journey

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.710 align:middle line:90%
through the afterlife.

00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And in hermetic
philosophy, there's

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:16.850 align:middle line:90%
seven hermetic principles.

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:21.920 align:middle line:84%
So this number seven shows
up in many significant ways.

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:25.610 align:middle line:84%
We can also divide the Tarot
keys into groups of seven.

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:27.890 align:middle line:10%
When we do this,
the fool or key zero

00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:30.500 align:middle line:10%
is put into its own
category, because this

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:35.810 align:middle line:10%
represents us embarking
on the spiritual journey.

00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:39.440 align:middle line:10%
Then keys one through seven, the
magician through the chariot,

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:44.030 align:middle line:10%
relate to the stages of
preparation for the great work.

00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:47.120 align:middle line:10%
These form the early lessons
of this journey that teach us

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.880 align:middle line:10%
about the archetypal
principles as powers

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:53.240 align:middle line:10%
within our own consciousness.

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:57.410 align:middle line:10%
Then keys eight through 14,
strength through temperance,

00:32:57.410 --> 00:32:59.870 align:middle line:10%
connect to the
experiences of life

00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:03.290 align:middle line:10%
that take us through the
first four stages of alchemy,

00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:06.980 align:middle line:10%
which are calcination,
disillusion, separation,

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:09.230 align:middle line:10%
and conjunction.

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:12.440 align:middle line:10%
And then finally,
keys 15 through 21,

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:15.800 align:middle line:10%
which are the devil
through the world card,

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:19.190 align:middle line:10%
these represent the final
three stages of alchemy

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:24.260 align:middle line:10%
that refine our soul and bring
us more spiritual attainment.

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And those alchemical stages
relate to fermentation,

00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:31.580 align:middle line:90%
distillation, and coagulation.

00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:33.860 align:middle line:84%
We'll explore each
of these as we

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:39.110 align:middle line:84%
go through the journey of this
season's "Mystery Teachings."

00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:40.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Theresa,
of these 22 cards,

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:43.308 align:middle line:84%
is there one more
important than the other?

00:33:43.308 --> 00:33:45.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: I don't know
about one more important.

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:48.125 align:middle line:84%
I think they all have a
really important piece--

00:33:48.125 --> 00:33:49.557 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're like a puzzle?

00:33:49.557 --> 00:33:50.390 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: They are.

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:51.860 align:middle line:90%
They're a sequence, you know?

00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:54.650 align:middle line:84%
They're like stepping
stones through a sequence.

00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:59.940 align:middle line:84%
But you can in a way capture
the whole journey in four cards,

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:00.740 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:03.710 align:middle line:84%
So if we started with
the fool, that's us.

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:07.438 align:middle line:84%
And that represents us all
the way through the journey.

00:34:07.438 --> 00:34:09.230 align:middle line:84%
Then we had the wheel
which we were talking

00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:12.040 align:middle line:84%
about a moment ago, and that
really kind of represents

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:14.719 align:middle line:84%
the process, the cyclic
journey of transformation

00:34:14.719 --> 00:34:16.010 align:middle line:90%
that we're going through.

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:18.685 align:middle line:84%
And then we had
the judgment card,

00:34:18.685 --> 00:34:19.810 align:middle line:90%
which was right next to it.

00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:21.199 align:middle line:90%
It's number 11.

00:34:21.199 --> 00:34:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And that represents
decisions, right?

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And choices that we have
to make and discernment

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:28.040 align:middle line:84%
that we have to have in
this journey, and the fact

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:31.699 align:middle line:84%
that we have to learn to
achieve a balance in how

00:34:31.699 --> 00:34:34.400 align:middle line:84%
those choices are leading
to different results.

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And then the culmination
of the journey

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:40.100 align:middle line:84%
is in the wheel card, which
is the last, the 22nd one

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:40.920 align:middle line:90%
or the-- yeah.

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:41.720 align:middle line:90%
Zero to 21.

00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:44.989 align:middle line:84%
So it's key number 21, but
it's the 22nd card, the very

00:34:44.989 --> 00:34:46.969 align:middle line:90%
last of the Major Arcana.

00:34:46.969 --> 00:34:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And the world represents
the final result

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:53.600 align:middle line:84%
of the fool's journey
or the hero's journey.

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And it embodies the essence
of all the other cards,

00:34:57.470 --> 00:35:00.020 align:middle line:84%
but in a perfect
harmony within it.

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And it also represents
that this is

00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:03.440 align:middle line:84%
meant to bring us
to what we would

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:05.570 align:middle line:84%
call maybe a cosmic
consciousness

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:07.350 align:middle line:90%
or a divine consciousness.

00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:10.285 align:middle line:84%
It's a more awakened being,
a more perfected being.

00:35:10.285 --> 00:35:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's what that journey
is leading us towards.

00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:15.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is each
card representative

00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:18.440 align:middle line:84%
for an individual,
or does he just pick

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:20.530 align:middle line:84%
one and that's what
you have to look at?

00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:21.780 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Mm.

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:23.600 align:middle line:90%
Well, we all--

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:26.160 align:middle line:84%
I would say we're a
combination of different keys.

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.370 align:middle line:84%
So we each have
certain ones that

00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:30.380 align:middle line:90%
will be our dominant archetype.

00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:33.380 align:middle line:84%
So for example, as
a Gemini, you might

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:37.040 align:middle line:84%
have a relationship with
one of the cards that

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:39.440 align:middle line:90%
is ruled by Gemini.

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:42.100 align:middle line:84%
But also, you have
your rising sign.

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:43.100 align:middle line:90%
You have your moon sign.

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:45.017 align:middle line:84%
So those are all going
to have different cards

00:35:45.017 --> 00:35:48.440 align:middle line:90%
that they're associated with.

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:50.630 align:middle line:84%
The day of the month
that you were born on,

00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:53.480 align:middle line:84%
your birthday day, that
also has a number which

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:55.370 align:middle line:84%
associates with a card
as well, and so that

00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:56.780 align:middle line:90%
might also influence you.

00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:58.850 align:middle line:84%
So we're a combination
of these archetypes.

00:35:58.850 --> 00:36:03.320 align:middle line:84%
We're not necessarily
actively manifesting all 22

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:04.550 align:middle line:90%
in this life.

00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:07.970 align:middle line:84%
We're probably having strengths
and weaknesses of certain ones

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:09.860 align:middle line:84%
that are really
active in this life.

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:12.680 align:middle line:84%
But the goal to becoming
more of a multidimensional,

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:17.660 align:middle line:84%
more awakened being is
to come into this ability

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:21.320 align:middle line:84%
to have relationship
and to see all 22

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:25.580 align:middle line:84%
archetypes active within your
life and working in a balanced

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:30.110 align:middle line:84%
and harmonious, integrated way,
versus just being a few, right?

00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:31.550 align:middle line:84%
So the more we
kind of strip away

00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:34.370 align:middle line:84%
just layers of personality,
which tend to be our masks,

00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:37.280 align:middle line:84%
and we get more into the core
essence of our true self,

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:40.460 align:middle line:84%
then all 22 can become
active within our lives.

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
would call living

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:43.168 align:middle line:90%
a more multidimensional life.

00:36:43.168 --> 00:36:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who
interprets these cards?

00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:47.090 align:middle line:84%
Would you do it for
somebody, or do they

00:36:47.090 --> 00:36:48.405 align:middle line:90%
have to do it themselves?

00:36:48.405 --> 00:36:49.280 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: It's both.

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:53.210 align:middle line:84%
So the individual would develop
a relationship with the cards

00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:56.910 align:middle line:84%
so if they meditate
upon them, for example,

00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:58.630 align:middle line:84%
the card is meant to
teach them directly.

00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:00.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they just
picking from the deck?

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:01.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: They
could, or they could

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:03.380 align:middle line:90%
work with them in sequence.

00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:06.230 align:middle line:84%
So in my season four of
"Mystery Teachings," which

00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:09.260 align:middle line:84%
is all about the Tarot and
the hero's journey and living

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:11.960 align:middle line:84%
a multidimensional life, we
go through them in sequence

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:12.980 align:middle line:90%
from zero to 22.

00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:15.980 align:middle line:84%
We go around the wheel
in the proper order.

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And we work on
each one at a time.

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I talk about
how to work with them

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:26.090 align:middle line:84%
and how to use the visual
imagery of the Tarot card

00:37:26.090 --> 00:37:29.360 align:middle line:84%
as a meditation tool, and
to work with building up

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:31.310 align:middle line:84%
the images within your
own mind, to bring it

00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:34.760 align:middle line:84%
into a state of being
alive within you,

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:35.960 align:middle line:90%
alive within your life.

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:37.980 align:middle line:84%
And you work with them
about once a week.

00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:40.610 align:middle line:84%
You take a card, and you work
with that card for a week,

00:37:40.610 --> 00:37:42.590 align:middle line:84%
and then you move
on to the next one.

00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:44.902 align:middle line:84%
Once you've gone through
all 22 like that,

00:37:44.902 --> 00:37:46.610 align:middle line:84%
you've developed a
relationship with them

00:37:46.610 --> 00:37:51.020 align:middle line:84%
all, then you could work with
just kind of randomly drawing

00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:54.590 align:middle line:84%
a card out of the
pack and see, OK, this

00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:55.610 align:middle line:90%
is my card for the day.

00:37:55.610 --> 00:37:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And then what is its
message for me today?

00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:58.908 align:middle line:84%
And then you work
with it that way.

00:37:58.908 --> 00:38:00.950 align:middle line:84%
And you can also then look
up the interpretations

00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:03.470 align:middle line:84%
in the books, for example,
and see, what else does that

00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:04.340 align:middle line:90%
give you?

00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:06.110 align:middle line:84%
But most important
is to meditate on it

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:08.930 align:middle line:84%
and to see from the
inner planes, what

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:10.130 align:middle line:90%
is it teaching you?

00:38:10.130 --> 00:38:13.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's fascinating as a
physicist for you to do this.

00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:14.540 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yes.

00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:19.856 align:middle line:84%
That's because in my studies
in the Mystery tradition,

00:38:19.856 --> 00:38:24.710 align:middle line:84%
I saw how alive they really
are within our own lives.

00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And I started to study some
of the works of Carl Jung,

00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:30.320 align:middle line:84%
and he talks about
archetypes and the importance

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:32.480 align:middle line:84%
of bringing our awareness
to those archetypes.

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:34.640 align:middle line:84%
They show up in our
dreams all the time.

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:38.240 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the ways that
our spirit communicates to us

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:40.250 align:middle line:84%
or that the universe
can communicate to us.

00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:41.990 align:middle line:84%
So I found over time
that it was really

00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:45.030 align:middle line:84%
important to learn this
language of the universe

00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:47.540 align:middle line:84%
so that we can be in
cooperation with it

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:48.890 align:middle line:90%
and communication with it.

00:38:48.890 --> 00:38:49.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you learned it.

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:50.240 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: I did.

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:51.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And both through
sacred geometry,

00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:54.780 align:middle line:90%
numerology, Tarot, astrology.

00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:58.250 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've learned all of
these systems as different ways

00:38:58.250 --> 00:38:59.960 align:middle line:84%
for communicating
with the universe

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:04.310 align:middle line:84%
and being more attuned to
or able to pay attention to,

00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:10.320 align:middle line:84%
what is this symbol, this
dream, this sort of experience

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:11.120 align:middle line:90%
that I've just had?

00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:14.450 align:middle line:84%
What is spirit trying to teach
me about me or about my life?

00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:15.860 align:middle line:84%
Or how is it trying
to direct me?

00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:17.870 align:middle line:84%
Because I feel that we
are in participation

00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:19.140 align:middle line:90%
with this universe.

00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very
quantum physics

00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:23.690 align:middle line:84%
kind of approach to
life, is that this

00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:25.160 align:middle line:90%
is a participatory universe.

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:28.130 align:middle line:84%
But we need to have the
right knowledge and awareness

00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:31.610 align:middle line:84%
to really be effective in
our participation with it.

00:39:31.610 --> 00:39:35.150 align:middle line:10%
If we just let it happen
to us, we're participating,

00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:37.340 align:middle line:10%
but we're participating
from an unconscious place.

00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:39.482 align:middle line:10%
And I'd rather be
conscious about how

00:39:39.482 --> 00:39:40.940 align:middle line:10%
I'm participating
with the universe

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:43.700 align:middle line:10%
so that I can create the
life I really want to live.

00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:46.070 align:middle line:10%
And I've seen how
these archetypes really

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:48.410 align:middle line:10%
do play in our lives
and how we can work

00:39:48.410 --> 00:39:49.635 align:middle line:10%
with them in a positive way.

00:39:49.635 --> 00:39:50.510 align:middle line:90%
