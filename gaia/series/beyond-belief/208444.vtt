>>GEORGE NOORY: People
come to you for what?

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:13.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LAUREN CIELO: I
want to say this.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.720 align:middle line:84%
I would never have really
thought I'd say this-- hope.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.350 align:middle line:90%
I think it's hope.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.517 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You give them hope?

00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:19.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: No, I don't
think I give them hope.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.920 align:middle line:84%
I think I show them how
to find their own hope.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.870 align:middle line:90%
The stumbling block is fear.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.040 align:middle line:84%
As our planet is moving
through time and space,

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.040 align:middle line:84%
I think more changes are
happening inside the planet

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.320 align:middle line:84%
and migrating out
to her surface.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ironically,
it's the Gaia theory.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:36.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Exactly.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.885 align:middle line:90%

00:00:42.243 --> 00:00:44.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Welcome to this
edition of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.780 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Lauren Cielo
is back with us,

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.500 align:middle line:10%
a clairvoyant healer,
teacher, and author

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.170 align:middle line:10%
that helps people tap into
their own intuitive gifts

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.850 align:middle line:10%
and energetic healing.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.350 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the program, Lauren.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.010 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Thanks, George.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.980 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me back.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.855 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What an incredible
gift you possess.

00:00:59.855 --> 00:01:01.567 align:middle line:90%
How did this all happen for you?

00:01:01.567 --> 00:01:03.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, I started
out as an engineer.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.620 align:middle line:10%
And I stumbled on to a
psychic training institute.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.510 align:middle line:10%
And so I decided
to give it a go.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.510 align:middle line:84%
I just thought it was
something to do, something.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You didn't feel that
special calling or anything

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:16.570 align:middle line:90%
at that time?

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: George, if
I would have known

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:18.970 align:middle line:84%
that I was going to
leave engineering

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.860 align:middle line:84%
by taking that class, I
would have never done it.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:21.660 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:22.135 align:middle line:90%


00:01:22.135 --> 00:01:22.955 align:middle line:90%
Never.

00:01:22.955 --> 00:01:23.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But you did.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:24.630 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: I did.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.560 align:middle line:90%
It was a very organic process.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you've
learned a lot, haven't you?

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.332 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Oh, my gosh,
I've learned so much.

00:01:30.332 --> 00:01:33.280 align:middle line:84%
The training itself
is very encompassing.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.640 align:middle line:10%
But what I've learned by using
what I've learned by reading

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.030 align:middle line:10%
people and learning about
what their higher selves are

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.440 align:middle line:10%
trying to do, it's amazing.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.240 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.000 align:middle line:84%
It's never ending,
how much information

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.360 align:middle line:90%
I get from their higher selves.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk
about the astral plane.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.460 align:middle line:90%
We hear so much about it.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.170 align:middle line:90%
What do you think it is?

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.880 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I think
it's the real world.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.490 align:middle line:84%
I think that's where
our souls live forever.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And every once in a while,
I think our higher self

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.370 align:middle line:84%
decides to incarnate into what
would be a virtual reality.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.460 align:middle line:90%
So the astral plane is real.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.400 align:middle line:90%
And everything here is not real.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you access the
astral plane anytime you want?

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.190 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, when I read,
that's about all I access.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.560 align:middle line:84%
That's where most of the
information comes from.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.930 align:middle line:84%
If somebody has a
question, either I'm

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.390 align:middle line:84%
going to ask their higher
selves on the astral

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.000 align:middle line:84%
or I'm going to read
in their energy field.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And really, that's
the two places.

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.330 align:middle line:84%
If somebody has an issue, it's
either an issue on the astral

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.580 align:middle line:84%
or an issue in
their energy field.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And quite honestly,
it's much easier

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.810 align:middle line:84%
to shift your energy field than
to ever get your higher self--

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:38.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.507 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: --to do anything.

00:02:39.507 --> 00:02:41.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when we talk
about the astral plane,

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.830 align:middle line:84%
are we talking about
your astral body?

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.060 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Absolutely.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OBEs?

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: That's it.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Stuff like that?

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:48.897 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: That's right.

00:02:48.897 --> 00:02:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And when I talk about the
astral body, really our dreams.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.130 align:middle line:84%
If we remember our
dreams, that's the astral.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:03.760 align:middle line:84%
So when we think about what
it is that we're really

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.870 align:middle line:84%
trying to achieve,
being in touch

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.340 align:middle line:84%
with our higher self on the
astral makes it so much easier.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.140 align:middle line:90%
That's what I mean.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.210 align:middle line:84%
It's like if your
energy field isn't

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.470 align:middle line:84%
set to what your higher self
wants you to do by contracts,

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.460 align:middle line:90%
then, oh, my gosh.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.060 align:middle line:84%
Life becomes so
difficult, so frightening.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.280 align:middle line:84%
So by being in touch
with your higher self

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.860 align:middle line:84%
and trying to match
what it's creating,

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.750 align:middle line:84%
then life becomes
very much easier.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.030 align:middle line:90%
And, my friend, I'm the example.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.360 align:middle line:84%
Before, my life
was very confusing.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And now, it's the
best it's ever been.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And when I ask my
guides, why is it better?

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.180 align:middle line:84%
The thing they say is
that here on Earth, I'm

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.970 align:middle line:84%
not in resistance to
my contracts anymore.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.800 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I
tell my clients,

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.420 align:middle line:90%
to align to their contracts.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we can help
align the energy field

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.525 align:middle line:90%
to those contracts.

00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:55.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do your clients
want when they come to you?

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:56.700 align:middle line:90%
What do they say?

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Oh, gosh.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.530 align:middle line:90%
They want answers, I guess.

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.150 align:middle line:84%
I think they want to know
what's going to happen.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think probably
what they really

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.370 align:middle line:84%
get is why what's
happening is happening.

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:11.170 align:middle line:90%
I think that's it.

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.400 align:middle line:90%
It's a better understanding.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have a lot
of students that are trying

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.290 align:middle line:90%
to access the astral plane?

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:17.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Oh, yeah.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.209 align:middle line:84%
That's the main thing
of what we teach

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.810 align:middle line:90%
is how to read the astral.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:21.610 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.107 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do they
want to learn this?

00:04:24.107 --> 00:04:25.190 align:middle line:90%
What are they looking for?

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, it's probably
different for each student.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.972 align:middle line:84%
Probably some of them
want to heal themselves.

00:04:30.972 --> 00:04:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And maybe some of
them-- their number one

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.210 align:middle line:90%
goal is healing others.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.080 align:middle line:84%
But they heal themselves
in the process.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.300 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at your work
with a client in San Diego.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.660 align:middle line:90%
>> So good to meet you.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:44.460 align:middle line:90%
>> And meet you.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Welcome to San Diego.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:46.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.180 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.680 align:middle line:84%
When I first met
Lauren, I felt safe.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.480 align:middle line:84%
This was someone that I could
go on this journey with.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And I knew I was
in a safe place.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.720 align:middle line:90%
I knew I was in good hands.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I thought what we'd
do is first do a little--

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.510 align:middle line:84%
get in our bodies
type meditation

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.490 align:middle line:90%
and just get comfortable.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And then if you could
close your eyes,

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:15.100 align:middle line:84%
and take a deep, cleansing
breath, and begin to let go.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.380 align:middle line:84%
We're going to open a
door in our forehead

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.040 align:middle line:84%
and step out onto
the astral plane.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And would you please
perceive the Hall

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.160 align:middle line:84%
of Records, the
cathedral of the souls

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.280 align:middle line:84%
where the Akashic
Records are kept?

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.930 align:middle line:90%
What are you experiencing?

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Just a cave.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.820 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's go
walk into the cave.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you walk in,
you'll notice there's

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.700 align:middle line:90%
several Akashic Record Keepers.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:51.820 align:middle line:84%
Ask some of the general record
keepers to come to meet you.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>> I have something that
wants to come, but isn't--

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:57.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.870 align:middle line:90%
>> --a human.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:05.320 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's ask this being to
go to your records and pull out

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.220 align:middle line:84%
maybe one of your last
lifetimes as a healer.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.930 align:middle line:90%
And what are you perceiving now?

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:17.440 align:middle line:84%
>> A a flowing white sheet
as if it were hanging

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.760 align:middle line:90%
on a clothesline.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a female with that
sheet with laundry.

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, you're the female.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.590 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not really showing
healing as much as a sense

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.090 align:middle line:90%
of danger.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>> You knew when danger
was coming, precognitive?

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Protecting a child.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:37.330 align:middle line:90%
>> That's somewhere.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.720 align:middle line:84%
The reading with Lauren
was incredibly intense.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.320 align:middle line:90%
I was this woman.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.080 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a visualization.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.700 align:middle line:84%
I felt it in my body, the
feeling of fear and danger

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.670 align:middle line:84%
for a child that
I was protecting.

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:55.450 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know where
the child was.

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:59.860 align:middle line:10%
Not only me as a person
sitting with Lauren,

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.160 align:middle line:10%
but the person in this
visualization-- we connected.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And there was a sadness
that something had happened

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:13.540 align:middle line:84%
and mirrored a sadness
in my own current life

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.200 align:middle line:84%
of losing something that
was very important to me.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Would you please step back
in to the center of your head?

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.050 align:middle line:90%
Close the door in your forehead.

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And when you're ready,
you can open your eyes

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:26.860 align:middle line:90%
and come on back.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.050 align:middle line:90%
>> That was a little emotional.

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:31.660 align:middle line:84%
So something was coming as
you were bringing me back.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.650 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like there
was a message of even

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:37.930 align:middle line:90%
if you are not here, I am.

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:39.340 align:middle line:90%
There's a higher part of you.

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:44.770 align:middle line:84%
Whether you believe this is
just some imagery or not,

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:46.020 align:middle line:90%
I believe this.

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:47.738 align:middle line:84%
So whatever is happening
right now is OK.

00:07:47.738 --> 00:07:49.030 align:middle line:90%
>> That's so interesting to me.

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:51.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Very safe.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.670 align:middle line:84%
So I think this was an
incredibly healing experience

00:07:54.670 --> 00:08:00.430 align:middle line:84%
in the same right of
knowing we're connected

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:05.140 align:middle line:84%
to each other as human beings
as well as to our past lives,

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:10.780 align:middle line:84%
to who we were before, to who
we will be in the future, just

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:12.040 align:middle line:90%
human connection.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.803 align:middle line:84%
It was a very
healing experience.

00:08:13.803 --> 00:08:15.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lauren, what do
you think she tapped into--

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:16.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Oh, my gosh.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --to get so emotional?

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:18.878 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Everyone does.

00:08:18.878 --> 00:08:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And what it's like,
George, is you don't really

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:23.710 align:middle line:90%
know why you're overcome.

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:25.195 align:middle line:90%
It's not a logical--

00:08:25.195 --> 00:08:26.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tears were coming.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.120 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Yeah.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.780 align:middle line:84%
Instantaneously
that's how it happens.

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And there's so much that happens
in such a small amount of time

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:34.240 align:middle line:84%
that you can't really
explain to somebody,

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.309 align:middle line:90%
this is why I'm crying.

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how do you
pick that up off the client?

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:41.690 align:middle line:90%
You sense this, don't you?

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:43.220 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Yes.

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:44.840 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I
was going to school

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.670 align:middle line:90%
and I was to my psychic school.

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And one of the people I
was reading started to cry.

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:52.130 align:middle line:90%
And I was taken back.

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:54.440 align:middle line:84%
I thought, did I
do somebody wrong?

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.997 align:middle line:84%
And my teacher said that's a
good reading when somebody--

00:08:56.997 --> 00:08:58.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When they
get that emotional.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:08:59.720 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: --releases
that much energy.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.530 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:01.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is the astral
plane so important to people

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:05.910 align:middle line:90%
in your opinion?

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:07.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, I
think the reason why--

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:10.880 align:middle line:84%
to consider that
there's an astral plane.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:14.300 align:middle line:84%
For one thing, it changes
this reality for you.

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.890 align:middle line:84%
What I'd like to
tell my students

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:18.420 align:middle line:84%
is we can have a
foot in both worlds.

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.960 align:middle line:84%
So when things are happening
here on the Earth plane,

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.840 align:middle line:84%
which are crazy
right now, that we

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:28.320 align:middle line:84%
have some experience from our
other lives to fall back on.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:32.360 align:middle line:84%
So it maybe brings things
into perspective more.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it heal
people emotionally--

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:34.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Oh, I
absolutely think so.

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:36.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --by tapping
into the plane?

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:36.980 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Yeah.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.530 align:middle line:84%
And with Ashley, the
reason that she experienced

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:42.260 align:middle line:84%
what she's experienced
in that meditation

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.060 align:middle line:84%
is because something
very close to that's

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:45.890 align:middle line:90%
happening for her now.

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:48.350 align:middle line:84%
So she's actually pulling
that information right

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:49.670 align:middle line:90%
into her space.

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:53.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever had a
case where they tap into this,

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:58.470 align:middle line:84%
and they just are so emotional,
they completely fall apart?

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:00.540 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Yes, I think so.

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:03.693 align:middle line:84%
Usually, we'll pause the
reading while they do that.

00:10:03.693 --> 00:10:05.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Get their
composure back?

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:07.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Yeah, but
what I really think

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:09.990 align:middle line:84%
is when they listen to
it again, they probably

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:12.480 align:middle line:84%
break down more than the
first time they hear it.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
the soul, Lauren,

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:16.012 align:middle line:90%
doing on the astral plane?

00:10:16.012 --> 00:10:17.220 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Oh, my gosh, George.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.980 align:middle line:90%
I wish I knew.

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:21.180 align:middle line:84%
That's where I find
my work so fascinating

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.040 align:middle line:84%
is, again, talking
to the higher selves

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.550 align:middle line:84%
and trying to understand
what their experience is.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:29.760 align:middle line:84%
What's their day job when
they're not incarnating?

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:33.570 align:middle line:84%
And I'm starting to piece
it together, I think.

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:38.050 align:middle line:84%
I saw this one very interesting
person, very interesting life.

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And when I was reading
his higher self,

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.890 align:middle line:84%
his higher self said
it had been isolated

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:46.950 align:middle line:90%
for a long time on the astral.

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't have
considered that.

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:53.730 align:middle line:84%
So really, each and every time
I read somebody's higher self,

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:57.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm learning more and more about
what that experience is like.

00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:58.380 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:01.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever been
tricked on the astral plane?

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:04.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Not in a malicious
way, in a fun way.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.140 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but it was made
known that it was a trick.

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But it could be
malicious, couldn't it?

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:13.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I don't really
ever see anything malicious.

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:16.020 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it could be the
people that I'm reading.

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:18.720 align:middle line:90%
They're high vibrating, maybe.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Interesting
take on that.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:24.120 align:middle line:84%
Our souls learn on the astral
plane all along, aren't they?

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:24.960 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Yes.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And I think the reason
that they incarnate

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:33.070 align:middle line:84%
is because they
can learn something

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:35.110 align:middle line:84%
in the virtual reality
that they can't

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:36.580 align:middle line:90%
learn in the real reality.

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
haven't figured out yet.

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:42.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when we are
trying to gain knowledge

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.080 align:middle line:84%
from the astral plane
because it's out there,

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.230 align:middle line:84%
how do we bring it into
our physical lives?

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:51.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, there's
actually a spirit guide

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:53.690 align:middle line:84%
that's assigned to each
of us that does that.

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:55.820 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
Akashic Record Keeper.

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:57.860 align:middle line:84%
So what its job
is, is to go back

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:00.800 align:middle line:84%
to your individual records,
and pull out information

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.920 align:middle line:84%
from your other lives, and
install it in your energy

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.630 align:middle line:84%
field, your body
chakras in order

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:07.430 align:middle line:90%
so that you can use it now.

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:09.770 align:middle line:84%
And that information
and energy is constantly

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:14.210 align:middle line:84%
being moved from this virtual
reality in your energy field

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:15.770 align:middle line:90%
back to your records.

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And so it's this
constant updating,

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:19.790 align:middle line:90%
bringing us into present time.

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On the Gaia show
"Inspirations," our Lisa

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:24.770 align:middle line:84%
Garr had a chance to
talk with Sandra Anne

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:29.040 align:middle line:84%
Taylor about the astral
plane and what they learn.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.480 align:middle line:10%
>> You can find
out your past life,

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.240 align:middle line:10%
and you can actually
rescript it.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.910 align:middle line:10%
You can rewrite the
records of your past life,

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:40.480 align:middle line:10%
support it with
affirmations in this life.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.920 align:middle line:10%
Let's say you were--

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:42.950 align:middle line:10%
>> Give us an example.

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:44.020 align:middle line:10%
>> Let's say you were--

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:47.630 align:middle line:10%
OK, I'm getting this actually
happened-- burned as a witch.

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:48.430 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, OK.

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:48.940 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:49.870 align:middle line:10%
I've heard this before.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:50.590 align:middle line:10%
>> You have heard that before?

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:51.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:51.810 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:55.030 align:middle line:10%
So when you come into
this, you can rewrite it.

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:57.340 align:middle line:10%
You can visualize
yourself, meditate,

00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:00.190 align:middle line:10%
visualize yourself walking
away from the tribunal

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:02.560 align:middle line:10%
or the judgment
and say, I'm free.

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.850 align:middle line:10%
And I can practice
my spiritual arts.

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:05.650 align:middle line:10%
And it's safe.

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:08.050 align:middle line:10%
And then you support it
in your present life,

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:09.580 align:middle line:10%
even with affirmations.

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:14.230 align:middle line:10%
It's safe and comfortable for me
to practice my spiritual arts.

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:16.360 align:middle line:10%
And for this, this
was a big one for you.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:19.540 align:middle line:10%
It's safe and comfortable
for me to go public

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:23.440 align:middle line:10%
with my spiritual practice
and my spiritual beliefs.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:28.940 align:middle line:10%
And that just expands the
energy of your intention.

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:31.240 align:middle line:10%
And then it shifts that energy.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to go
through that difficulty anymore.

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:36.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lauren, what
did you think of Sandra?

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:39.130 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I think what
she's talking about is

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:42.280 align:middle line:84%
the information in your field
that you might have pulled

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.440 align:middle line:90%
in from those other lives--

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:48.197 align:middle line:84%
that there's a way that you can
energetically shift it back out

00:13:48.197 --> 00:13:49.780 align:middle line:84%
and put it back in
your record, so you

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.910 align:middle line:90%
don't have to relive it again.

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:55.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If a person does not
tap into the astral plane,

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:56.927 align:middle line:90%
what happens to them?

00:13:56.927 --> 00:13:59.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I think it's all
about awareness, George.

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:01.950 align:middle line:84%
I think it happens
without you realizing it.

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And we can just walk
around the Earth

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:07.590 align:middle line:84%
plane, fat, dumb, and happy
Homo sapiens if we want to.

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:08.700 align:middle line:90%
And we have.

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:11.050 align:middle line:84%
I think the reason I'm so
interested in spirituality

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:13.260 align:middle line:84%
now is because I've had
so many lifetimes of being

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.150 align:middle line:90%
a farmer or a warrior.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:18.270 align:middle line:84%
So I think it just makes
life more interesting.

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:21.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there helpers
on the astral plane?

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.080 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: There are all
kinds of different beings

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.130 align:middle line:90%
on the astral plane.

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:25.130 align:middle line:90%
Some of them--

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:27.280 align:middle line:90%
I don't think there's words for.

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:28.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm not really
sure what they do.

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:30.580 align:middle line:90%
I met a client the other day.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And I actually wrote
it down in my notebook,

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:34.665 align:middle line:90%
what her higher herself told me.

00:14:34.665 --> 00:14:36.040 align:middle line:84%
Her higher self
told me that it's

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:40.330 align:middle line:84%
a broadcaster of the Akashic
Records to this planet.

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:42.715 align:middle line:84%
And I never heard of
anything like that before.

00:14:42.715 --> 00:14:43.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, it's not me.

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.217 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:45.217 --> 00:14:46.550 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Yeah, it's interesting.

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:47.633 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:14:47.633 --> 00:14:51.460 align:middle line:84%
The astral plane-- how
did it get created?

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:52.630 align:middle line:90%
Is it like heaven?

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:54.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I think, probably,
that's where we get

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:56.260 align:middle line:90%
the idea of heaven and hell.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.750 align:middle line:84%
The highest part of the astral
is really high vibrating.

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:00.430 align:middle line:90%
And the lower is really dense.

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:04.420 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's always been,
even before the Big Bang

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:06.265 align:middle line:84%
that created this
virtual reality.

00:15:06.265 --> 00:15:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was an old
book by two individuals--

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:11.950 align:middle line:84%
Hereward Carrington
and Sylvan Muldoon.

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And they talked about
the astral plane

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.950 align:middle line:84%
much like you just did,
that it has levels.

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:21.590 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you don't want
to be on the lower level.

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:22.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: No.

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:23.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
entities there that

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:26.350 align:middle line:84%
try to attach to you
and everything else.

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:28.240 align:middle line:84%
You want to be up
on the higher level.

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And they called it heaven,
just like you have.

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:31.300 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Yeah.

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:31.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And the thing about
the astral plane

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:36.790 align:middle line:84%
is that you can really
go wherever you want to,

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:38.600 align:middle line:90%
on whatever level you want.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And I think that has a lot
to do with why this planet is

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:44.620 align:middle line:90%
ascending, I think.

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:48.970 align:middle line:84%
This is what I think, because
the astral is the real world.

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And you might like to
hover, maybe halfway up,

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:54.220 align:middle line:90%
and you wonder what's higher.

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:55.990 align:middle line:90%
You can go there if you want to.

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:58.030 align:middle line:84%
But maybe you're a
bit apprehensive.

00:15:58.030 --> 00:15:59.320 align:middle line:90%
So what would you do?

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:02.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, you might incarnate
in a virtual reality that

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:05.710 align:middle line:84%
isn't real, that is
at that vibration,

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:07.540 align:middle line:90%
almost like a flight simulator.

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:11.470 align:middle line:84%
Before you want to get into
the cockpit of a real airplane,

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:14.560 align:middle line:84%
you want to go into the
unreal airplane first.

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.150 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I think happens.

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:20.470 align:middle line:84%
I think some people incarnate
in virtual realities

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:22.990 align:middle line:84%
that are higher than
where they're comfortable.

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:24.760 align:middle line:84%
Once they live through
that, now they're

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.250 align:middle line:84%
more comfortable going
higher on the astral.

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:28.900 align:middle line:90%
But not everybody does that.

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.420 align:middle line:90%
Some actually incarnate lower.

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:33.040 align:middle line:90%
And those are the lightworkers.

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Those are the ones that
incarnate in denser realities

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:38.620 align:middle line:84%
and try to raise
the vibration up.

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:41.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are the lightworkers
a little more perfected

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:42.625 align:middle line:90%
than we are?

00:16:42.625 --> 00:16:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I think they're not too
bright, to tell you the truth.

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:46.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Yeah,
because it's painful.

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:49.990 align:middle line:90%
It's painful to go from a high--

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:52.630 align:middle line:84%
every single morning,
a lightworker--

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:55.850 align:middle line:84%
when the part of their awareness
that goes back to the astral

00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:56.650 align:middle line:90%
at night--

00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:58.930 align:middle line:84%
every single morning
when they wake up,

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:01.490 align:middle line:84%
their energy goes boom
and drops down to the--

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:02.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Crashes.

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:03.123 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: It crashes.

00:17:03.123 --> 00:17:05.079 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
symptoms of that--

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:09.430 align:middle line:84%
being oversensitive,
maybe not wanting

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:12.069 align:middle line:84%
to engage with other
people too much.

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:13.180 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of--

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:17.260 align:middle line:84%
I call it soul sadness, that
you actually think of your death

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:18.849 align:middle line:90%
as a graduation.

00:17:18.849 --> 00:17:21.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How important is it
to tap into the astral plane?

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.993 align:middle line:84%
And how often
should people do it?

00:17:23.993 --> 00:17:26.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I think you should
do it every day in meditation,

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:29.470 align:middle line:84%
but realize that it's
happening all of the time.

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:32.350 align:middle line:84%
It's this constant
movement of information,

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:34.760 align:middle line:84%
like I said, in and out
of your energy field.

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:36.880 align:middle line:84%
But just like everything
with Homo sapiens,

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.940 align:middle line:84%
George, if you focus your
awareness on something,

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:42.790 align:middle line:90%
that something gets really big.

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:45.550 align:middle line:84%
So if you do focus
on asking your guides

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:48.610 align:middle line:84%
to update your space,
take out all the old stuff

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:52.900 align:middle line:84%
that was from yesterday, and
bring in from your records

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:54.540 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, I
sometimes think I've

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.930 align:middle line:84%
tapped into the astral plane,
and I didn't even know it.

00:17:58.930 --> 00:17:59.797 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:17:59.797 --> 00:18:00.630 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Absolutely.

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:02.790 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:05.475 align:middle line:84%
You might call it
imagination, maybe.

00:18:05.475 --> 00:18:07.980 align:middle line:90%


00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:09.367 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or creativity?

00:18:09.367 --> 00:18:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, when you think
of the word "imagination,"

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.330 align:middle line:90%
it means to see images.

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:14.130 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:17.220 align:middle line:84%
So when Ashley was
in meditation and she

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:20.820 align:middle line:84%
was seeing these images,
one might say, oh, well,

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:22.690 align:middle line:90%
you're just imagining that.

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:25.380 align:middle line:84%
But I think what's happened
in this virtual reality

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:30.040 align:middle line:84%
is we've been taught not
to trust what we imagine.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:33.180 align:middle line:84%
So when you think about
it, why would a Homo sapien

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:37.570 align:middle line:84%
be able to imagine
something that's not here?

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:38.370 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:41.220 align:middle line:84%
Why can we picture in
our mind a red apple?

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:42.820 align:middle line:90%
Or why is that?

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:44.350 align:middle line:90%
Why do we have that ability?

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
just what I said.

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:48.180 align:middle line:84%
It's to be able to bring
something to this reality

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:49.710 align:middle line:90%
that you've never seen before.

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:52.020 align:middle line:84%
Think of the first
people that thought in--

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:55.172 align:middle line:84%
let's stack some rocks together
and make a shape like this.

00:18:55.172 --> 00:18:56.130 align:middle line:90%
Well, somebody had to--

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:56.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They keep stacking.

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:58.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: --see that
shape in their mind's eye

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.153 align:middle line:90%
before they built the pyramid.

00:19:00.153 --> 00:19:02.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You needed an
architect of some sort.

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:03.057 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Exactly.

00:19:03.057 --> 00:19:04.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:08.010 align:middle line:84%
When I was a little
boy, I would constantly

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:15.100 align:middle line:84%
try to massage my career, what
I wanted to do when I grew up.

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:17.410 align:middle line:90%
And I was raised as a Catholic.

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:19.165 align:middle line:84%
And we went to
catechism classes.

00:19:19.165 --> 00:19:19.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Sure.

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:24.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they would teach
us that when you passed on--

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:26.860 align:middle line:84%
and it was horrible to talk to
little kids about passing on,

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:28.120 align:middle line:90%
but they did--

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:32.020 align:middle line:84%
you get to a place where they
have a Hall of Records for you,

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:34.030 align:middle line:90%
a book of your life.

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:36.387 align:middle line:84%
Is that the same as
the Akashic Records?

00:19:36.387 --> 00:19:37.220 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: I think so.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:41.710 align:middle line:84%
I think when we pass
away, that is a big review

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:44.245 align:middle line:84%
of all of the contracts
that our higher self

00:19:44.245 --> 00:19:45.580 align:middle line:90%
created for this lifetime.

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:46.600 align:middle line:90%
Did we complete them?

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.520 align:middle line:84%
Should we pull them over
to another lifetime?

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.290 align:middle line:90%
Should we cancel them?

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:53.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who taps
into it when we die?

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:54.920 align:middle line:90%
Our helpers?

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.150 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen?

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:57.890 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: No, it's ourselves.

00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:00.620 align:middle line:10%
I think probably
there are guides

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:03.080 align:middle line:10%
that help you with the review.

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:04.820 align:middle line:10%
But this is my
mental image picture.

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:07.130 align:middle line:84%
As you go into a
big library, you

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:10.250 align:middle line:84%
find the shelf that
has all of your books,

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:12.410 align:middle line:84%
and you pull out the one
that was that lifetime,

00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:14.070 align:middle line:84%
and you start
looking through it.

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:16.670 align:middle line:84%
And once you finally
reviewed that,

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:19.970 align:middle line:84%
then you start to
realize what's missing.

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And then you start to
write another book.

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:24.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do we need
to review the Akashic

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:27.560 align:middle line:84%
Records in the first place if
we've already done what we did?

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Yeah, it's
about information.

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:31.070 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that we want to do

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:33.500 align:middle line:84%
is when we've had a
lifetime and it's over,

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.600 align:middle line:84%
we want to bring
all the information

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.270 align:middle line:84%
from that last lifetime
right into the next one.

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:41.660 align:middle line:84%
So it's this constant
progression forward.

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:44.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Once you go
forward, what do you learn?

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:46.307 align:middle line:84%
What lessons can
you learn from this?

00:20:46.307 --> 00:20:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, I think
that lessons always change.

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:50.840 align:middle line:84%
I think that the astral
is just as dynamic

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:55.740 align:middle line:84%
as this reality, where E equals
MC squared might have always

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:56.540 align:middle line:90%
been the case.

00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:59.720 align:middle line:84%
But we didn't know
it until the 1940s.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why would you think
the Akashic Records would

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:04.260 align:middle line:90%
benefit us personally?

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.270 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I think it
helps you make decisions

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:10.440 align:middle line:84%
for that day on the best way
to live through your contracts

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.260 align:middle line:84%
in the moment, not out
of present time where

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.750 align:middle line:84%
that might be a decision
you made in high school.

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:18.450 align:middle line:84%
But that's not a
decision you'd make now.

00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:20.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: "Microdose"
on Gaia put together

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:23.370 align:middle line:84%
a little piece that
puts insight on what

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:27.740 align:middle line:84%
our Akashic Records might be
able to do and provide us.

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:30.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Spiritually minded
individuals suggest that with

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:33.980 align:middle line:10%
the knowledge of the Akashic
Records and their chronicling

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:38.060 align:middle line:10%
of our past, present, and
future comes a great tool

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:40.370 align:middle line:10%
for enriching one's life.

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:43.430 align:middle line:10%
>> There's literally no
inaccuracy with the book.

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:46.940 align:middle line:10%
Because the book is
not going to be telling

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:48.630 align:middle line:10%
a fictional story for you.

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:53.330 align:middle line:10%
The book is literally going
to be your truest self.

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:55.820 align:middle line:10%
So if you connect
into your records,

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:58.080 align:middle line:10%
if you connect into
your book of life,

00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.510 align:middle line:10%
it's like looking in the mirror.

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:00.920 align:middle line:10%
The mirror doesn't lie.

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:03.500 align:middle line:10%
And the interesting
thing about this mirror

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.390 align:middle line:10%
is it's a mirror for the soul.

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:10.070 align:middle line:10%
And when you look into it,
you're actually able to write.

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:14.180 align:middle line:10%
You're actually able to create,
to heal, to clear yourself,

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:17.260 align:middle line:10%
to create a great life.

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:20.410 align:middle line:10%
>> The story of our
lives is both individual

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:23.680 align:middle line:10%
and the coalescence of
all living things within

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:24.970 align:middle line:10%
our reality.

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:28.330 align:middle line:10%
Accessing the Akashic Records
and viewing our own past,

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:32.110 align:middle line:10%
present, and future may be
the most profound guidance

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:36.065 align:middle line:10%
to understanding the true
nature of our reality.

00:22:36.065 --> 00:22:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That is kind
of exciting to be

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:38.980 align:middle line:90%
able to tap into that.

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:40.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I really like
the way he said that.

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:42.388 align:middle line:90%
That was very insightful.

00:22:42.388 --> 00:22:43.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, that
was a good piece.

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:44.890 align:middle line:90%
Daniel Tammet.

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:45.790 align:middle line:90%
Who is Daniel Tammet?

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:46.590 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:50.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: So I first heard of
Daniel, oh, gosh, years ago.

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.660 align:middle line:84%
It was a show that
he did called "Boy

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:54.285 align:middle line:90%
with the Incredible Brain."

00:22:54.285 --> 00:22:55.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've
heard of that show.

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:57.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Yeah, it
really captivated me.

00:22:57.430 --> 00:23:03.520 align:middle line:84%
This guy in this particular
show calculated pi to something

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.800 align:middle line:90%
like 20,000 digits.

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.510 align:middle line:90%
And so it really--

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:09.010 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was
really interesting.

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:13.360 align:middle line:84%
Because I thought at first
that he was calculating,

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:15.650 align:middle line:84%
using the left
part of his brain.

00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:19.510 align:middle line:84%
But as he kept talking about
what his experience was

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:23.770 align:middle line:84%
of getting the next number
as he's doing the division,

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:26.500 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't the left brain
calculating at all.

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:28.360 align:middle line:84%
It was accessing
the Akashic Record.

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And he used his entire
energy field here on Earth

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.080 align:middle line:90%
to do the reading.

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.820 align:middle line:84%
So it might be something
like if the next number is 9,

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:38.230 align:middle line:90%
his nose would tickle.

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:40.410 align:middle line:84%
If the next number is 3,
he'd see a flash of green.

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:41.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something else.

00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:42.210 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Yeah.

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:44.950 align:middle line:84%
So he was actually using
his entire energy field

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:45.915 align:middle line:90%
to read the records.

00:23:45.915 --> 00:23:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Because when I first
saw him, I'm like,

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:49.150 align:middle line:84%
where is he getting
these numbers?

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:50.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was he mystical?

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:52.360 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: No, not really.

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:54.800 align:middle line:84%
No, he didn't seem
mystical at all.

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:55.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Magical?

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.730 align:middle line:84%
Did he possess
any special gifts?

00:23:57.730 --> 00:23:59.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I think,
probably, if I had

00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:03.170 align:middle line:84%
to say what was different
from him, he's autistic.

00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:06.080 align:middle line:84%
His brain accesses the
records in a different way

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:08.360 align:middle line:90%
than the average Homo sapien.

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:09.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like "Rain Man?"

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:10.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Maybe.

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:11.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:14.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lauren, we
talk about ascension.

00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:16.800 align:middle line:84%
William Henry talks about
ascension quite a bit.

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:17.990 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean to you?

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, I think the
ascension that we're mostly

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:23.040 align:middle line:84%
talking about is the
ascension of this reality

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:24.890 align:middle line:90%
and everything in it.

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:29.900 align:middle line:84%
So I probably would
think of it this way,

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:34.940 align:middle line:84%
is the vibration of this
video game is getting higher.

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's because of
the lightworkers.

00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:37.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:42.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: And as our planet is
moving through time and space,

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:45.060 align:middle line:84%
it's getting into a
new place in space.

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And so that new place in
space has a higher vibration.

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:50.960 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just
changing all of us

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:52.550 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of the planet.

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:55.490 align:middle line:84%
I think more changes are
happening inside the planet

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:57.770 align:middle line:84%
and migrating out
to her surface.

00:24:57.770 --> 00:24:59.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ironically,
it's the Gaia theory.

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:00.560 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Exactly.

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:01.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right?

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:02.400 align:middle line:90%
The planet is alive.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.250 align:middle line:90%
It's a living organism.

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And it thinks, it
breathes, it does whatever.

00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's
a possibility there.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.430 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: I do, too.

00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:11.910 align:middle line:90%
The planet is alive.

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:15.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can tell if you look
at a street that's paved over.

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:18.230 align:middle line:84%
As soon as there's a
crack, something grows.

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:21.167 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, that's true.

00:25:21.167 --> 00:25:23.650 align:middle line:90%
Jesus ascended into heaven.

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:26.170 align:middle line:84%
Is that the same kind of
ascension we're talking about?

00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:27.760 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Oh, let's
talk about Jesus.

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.190 align:middle line:84%
So every once in
a while, somebody

00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:33.100 align:middle line:84%
will throw in a question
about Jesus into a reading.

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I'm really
surprised about the answers.

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:42.170 align:middle line:84%
Somebody was asking me to
ask him about his ascension.

00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And what that would mean
on an individual level

00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:48.490 align:middle line:84%
is that you don't go back
to the same video game.

00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:50.810 align:middle line:90%
You realize it's a video game.

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:52.900 align:middle line:84%
And so you don't
incarnate there.

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:55.840 align:middle line:84%
So the story of Jesus
going into the temple

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:58.180 align:middle line:84%
and turning over the tables
of the money lenders--

00:25:58.180 --> 00:25:59.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yes, he
was just ticked off.

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:00.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Yeah.

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:04.990 align:middle line:84%
And if you were really ascending
while you were in one reality,

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:06.160 align:middle line:90%
that wouldn't bother you.

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:08.830 align:middle line:84%
You would think, well,
that temple isn't real.

00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:11.080 align:middle line:90%
That money isn't real.

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:15.130 align:middle line:84%
Really, according to Jesus, he
ascended in another lifetime.

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:17.260 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean
by that is, again,

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:22.030 align:middle line:84%
being incarnate and
realizing this isn't real.

00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:23.890 align:middle line:90%
He lived in a cave.

00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:27.770 align:middle line:84%
He looked like a guru of some
type, completely isolated.

00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:30.670 align:middle line:10%
And the image that
I was shown is

00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:33.310 align:middle line:10%
that once he realized that
the cave that he was in

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:36.130 align:middle line:10%
wasn't real, he just
stopped participating

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:40.130 align:middle line:10%
in the reality, which would
mean don't eat, don't sleep.

00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:42.650 align:middle line:90%
And finally, you leave.

00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:44.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when you do
leave, where do you go?

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: You go
back to the astral.

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:48.900 align:middle line:84%
You go back and
review your records.

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:54.230 align:middle line:84%
But again, you're not going to
be able or willing to incarnate

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:55.820 align:middle line:90%
into that reality again.

00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And if, for some
reason, you do, you'll

00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:01.940 align:middle line:84%
probably jump out of it
really quick, like SIDS--

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:03.920 align:middle line:90%
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:06.080 align:middle line:84%
You can't figure out why
those healthy babies--

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.330 align:middle line:84%
why those healthy
bodies just stop.

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:10.370 align:middle line:84%
I think it's because
the soul attached to it

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:13.100 align:middle line:90%
realizes this isn't real.

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:14.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:16.280 align:middle line:90%
We've talked about ascension.

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:19.630 align:middle line:90%
What about the other way?

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:20.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Going backward?

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:21.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Backward.

00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:25.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I'm not sure that
a reality can go backward.

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:28.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm not really sure if this
virtual reality that we're in.

00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:30.190 align:middle line:90%
It ebbs and flows.

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:35.770 align:middle line:84%
But I think the overall
push is forward and upward.

00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:40.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And by doing so, what
happens to the personal spirit?

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:41.680 align:middle line:90%
Does it get better?

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Yeah, I think
it becomes whole.

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:45.550 align:middle line:84%
I think that's why it's
doing what it's doing.

00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:48.490 align:middle line:84%
There's still parts of itself
that it doesn't understand.

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of
the things I try

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:54.250 align:middle line:84%
to tell my clients and students
is that our higher self is not

00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:55.720 align:middle line:90%
omnipotent.

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:58.450 align:middle line:84%
It knows everything
about itself,

00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:02.150 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't know
everything about everything.

00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:04.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you learn
this by trial and error?

00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:04.640 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Oh, my gosh.

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:07.100 align:middle line:84%
I learned it from the super
genius clients that book

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:09.255 align:middle line:90%
with me.

00:28:09.255 --> 00:28:10.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The planet itself.

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:12.120 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back and
talk about that.

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:16.060 align:middle line:84%
Is it teaching us
anything as individuals?

00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:19.100 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I think that
humans and the Earth

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:21.610 align:middle line:90%
are so closely connected.

00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:23.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
you could really

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:26.720 align:middle line:90%
split off who's teaching who.

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:28.665 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
energy mean to you?

00:28:28.665 --> 00:28:29.540 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Oh, my gosh.

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:31.010 align:middle line:90%
I struggled with energy.

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:33.920 align:middle line:84%
I came from engineering,
and it was all electricity.

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:36.260 align:middle line:84%
But when I started to read
these metaphysical books

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:41.570 align:middle line:84%
about "energy," I couldn't
quite put my mind around it.

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:45.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, after being trained and
reading people for so long,

00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:46.520 align:middle line:90%
I understand energy.

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:49.590 align:middle line:84%
And I can feel when it shifts,
especially in my own field.

00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:51.500 align:middle line:90%
So everything is energy.

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:54.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Baptisms
are done in water.

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:58.160 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be a connection
between energy and water.

00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.400 align:middle line:90%
What do you think that is?

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.567 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, I think
that's why I live on the West

00:29:01.567 --> 00:29:03.200 align:middle line:90%
Coast of the United States.

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:06.530 align:middle line:84%
The energy that's bubbling
up inside the planet--

00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:09.320 align:middle line:84%
as I mentioned
during her ascension,

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:13.700 align:middle line:84%
as it spews up to the
surface and moves across it,

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:16.760 align:middle line:84%
it's so much easier for
it to move through water.

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:21.230 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of times the life
that are on the coasts

00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:24.428 align:middle line:84%
get that energy and
information first.

00:29:24.428 --> 00:29:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's refreshing.

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:26.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Yeah.

00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
I tell my students

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:31.190 align:middle line:84%
is I remember the
puka shell fad.

00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Here where I lived on the
West Coast, it was really big.

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:36.650 align:middle line:84%
It was really big
on the East Coast.

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And after a couple years,
it migrated into the--

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:39.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Midwest.

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:40.105 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: --middle
of the country.

00:29:40.105 --> 00:29:40.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:41.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, by
then, we thought

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:43.550 align:middle line:90%
they weren't cool anymore.

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:45.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have a beach
out, near your hometown--

00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:46.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: I do.

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:51.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --that has a lot to do
with what we're talking about.

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things I've
noticed is our planet is moving

00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:57.830 align:middle line:90%
into a new place in space.

00:29:57.830 --> 00:30:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And that new place has
a different frequency.

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:03.980 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, the surface
of our planet

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:05.630 align:middle line:90%
is changing like we notice.

00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:08.510 align:middle line:84%
But she's changing from
the inside as well.

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:11.110 align:middle line:90%


00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:14.490 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things I
really like about this place

00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:17.550 align:middle line:84%
is, first of all, I
come here all the time.

00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:20.460 align:middle line:84%
And right across
the ocean is Hawaii.

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is as our
planet is shifting and changing

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:30.960 align:middle line:84%
from the inside out, as
those volcanoes erupt,

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:34.530 align:middle line:84%
all of that new energy that
the planet is producing,

00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:37.170 align:middle line:84%
all that ascension
energy is so easy

00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:39.690 align:middle line:84%
to propagate right
through the water.

00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:44.490 align:middle line:84%
So where these tide pools
are, the water pools up.

00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:48.510 align:middle line:84%
So this is a best
place to sit and stew,

00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:51.930 align:middle line:84%
if you think of it, in the
newest ascension energy that's

00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:53.430 align:middle line:90%
coming from the planet.

00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And what makes the
planet change is we're

00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:58.800 align:middle line:84%
actually moving into
a new place in space.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.920 align:middle line:84%
So the outside of the
planet is getting bombarded.

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:03.735 align:middle line:84%
And it starts to change
her on the inside.

00:31:03.735 --> 00:31:07.050 align:middle line:90%
[WATER ROARING]

00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:08.520 align:middle line:90%


00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:13.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is there a serenity
about the sound of an ocean?

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:16.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I think it's energy,
just like you were asking.

00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:20.460 align:middle line:84%
I think the sound
energy, the smell energy.

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:22.770 align:middle line:90%
I think we're mostly water.

00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:25.140 align:middle line:90%
So we adapt well in water.

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:26.197 align:middle line:90%
We shift and change.

00:31:26.197 --> 00:31:27.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lauren, you
have gone through

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:31.540 align:middle line:84%
an incredible metamorphosis
for yourself physically,

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:34.060 align:middle line:90%
emotionally, spiritually.

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:37.710 align:middle line:84%
What do you think is behind the
spiritual growth that you have?

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:40.320 align:middle line:84%
Because just in the
three to four times

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:42.480 align:middle line:84%
you've been on
"Beyond Belief," I've

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:46.800 align:middle line:84%
noticed an incredible
growth for you spiritually.

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:48.390 align:middle line:90%
What's doing that?

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, I think I'm
becoming more of my true self.

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:57.210 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, earlier in my
life, it was very confusing.

00:31:57.210 --> 00:32:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And the more I learned
from other higher selves,

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:03.450 align:middle line:84%
how they're expressing
their uniqueness,

00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:05.790 align:middle line:84%
I think it's becoming
easier and easier for me.

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:08.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What have you
learned on the astral plane

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:10.455 align:middle line:90%
that you will never forget?

00:32:10.455 --> 00:32:11.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Oh, my gosh.

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:14.390 align:middle line:84%
I think, probably if I had to
say, is that we're all one.

00:32:14.390 --> 00:32:17.480 align:middle line:84%
I think if anything
I could tell people

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:20.570 align:middle line:84%
is you might think you're
not the other person,

00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:22.012 align:middle line:90%
but you really are.

00:32:22.012 --> 00:32:23.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've got
a podcast going, too.

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:24.050 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that.

00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:25.160 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: I do.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.830 align:middle line:84%
It's called "What
Ascension Looks Like."

00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And what I do is I take little
observations of different parts

00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:38.570 align:middle line:84%
of this reality, and show how
that is creating our ascension,

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:41.240 align:middle line:84%
and how it's an example
of our ascension.

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:43.640 align:middle line:90%
So it's really easy to find.

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:47.335 align:middle line:84%
It's
www.whatascensionlookslike.com.

00:32:47.335 --> 00:32:48.335 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Simple as that?

00:32:48.335 --> 00:32:49.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: It's that simple.

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:50.443 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How long is the show?

00:32:50.443 --> 00:32:51.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well,
it's still growing.

00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:53.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if I'll ever stop.

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:56.877 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And in terms of
length of the podcast?

00:32:56.877 --> 00:32:58.835 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Each one is
probably about 45 minutes.

00:32:58.835 --> 00:32:59.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, that's not bad.

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:00.560 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: No.

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:01.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not bad at all.

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:02.810 align:middle line:84%
People love
podcasting these days.

00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:03.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: They do.

00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:05.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We podcast
"Coast to Coast" as well.

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:07.520 align:middle line:84%
We chop it up into
little pieces.

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:10.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's got a different,
but huge following.

00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:11.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: I noticed.

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:14.960 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, I got a
big activity on my website,

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:17.540 align:middle line:84%
because you did that
with "Coast to Coast."

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:20.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A couple years ago when
you were on "Coast to Coast,"

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:24.330 align:middle line:84%
it almost put you on
the map, didn't it?

00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:29.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, that is a
very interesting story.

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:30.830 align:middle line:84%
Because I had
access to computers

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:32.990 align:middle line:84%
before other people did,
because I was in tech,

00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:34.370 align:middle line:90%
I was all over the internet.

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:38.330 align:middle line:84%
I was looking at the end of
the Mayan calendar, the I AM

00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:39.780 align:middle line:90%
Map, all of it.

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And what's so
interesting is I don't

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:44.120 align:middle line:90%
know if I really believed it.

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:47.390 align:middle line:84%
But I did your show
for the very first time

00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:50.090 align:middle line:90%
on December 20, 2012.

00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:53.180 align:middle line:90%
And it went over to December 21.

00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:56.600 align:middle line:90%
So that event ascended me.

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:58.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:33:58.110 --> 00:33:58.910 align:middle line:90%
Amazing.

00:33:58.910 --> 00:34:00.140 align:middle line:90%
Well, you did a good job.

00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:02.265 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, I couldn't
have done it without you.

00:34:02.265 --> 00:34:06.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when you were
raised as a little person,

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:08.690 align:middle line:90%
did you have these abilities?

00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:10.190 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Oh, I was
such a weird kid.

00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:11.732 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
ever think you would

00:34:11.732 --> 00:34:14.179 align:middle line:84%
be talking about ascension,
and astral planes,

00:34:14.179 --> 00:34:15.440 align:middle line:90%
and things like that?

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:17.268 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Maybe when
I was really young.

00:34:17.268 --> 00:34:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And I've noticed that I'm
at the point in my life

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:23.237 align:middle line:84%
now, where a lot of the truths
that I had as a child that

00:34:23.237 --> 00:34:25.070 align:middle line:84%
seemed, of course, if
I told my parents they

00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:26.100 align:middle line:90%
would pooh-pooh it.

00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:26.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:28.130 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: But they are my truths.

00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:29.420 align:middle line:90%
And now, I have all my power.

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And I don't care if other
people don't believe it.

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:37.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What lesson would
you tell someone who's lost,

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:38.840 align:middle line:90%
who can't find themselves.

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:41.270 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: What I would
say is this is not real.

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:42.830 align:middle line:90%
It's not real.

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And to take the
perception that I'm just

00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:49.730 align:middle line:84%
going to laugh about
whatever situation

00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:53.870 align:middle line:84%
I find myself in,
because it's not real.

00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:56.449 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's take
this lost person, Lauren,

00:34:56.449 --> 00:34:57.860 align:middle line:90%
and fix them.

00:34:57.860 --> 00:34:58.777 align:middle line:90%
How do you start?

00:34:58.777 --> 00:35:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, first, I
start by getting a message

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:02.180 align:middle line:90%
from their higher self.

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:05.275 align:middle line:84%
And it really is the most
important part of the reading.

00:35:05.275 --> 00:35:06.650 align:middle line:84%
Whether the person
thinks they're

00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:09.488 align:middle line:84%
coming in for one
topic or the other,

00:35:09.488 --> 00:35:11.030 align:middle line:84%
the higher self is
going to tell them

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:13.160 align:middle line:90%
exactly what they need to know.

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I tell
people over and over.

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:17.240 align:middle line:84%
Listen to the first
part of the reading

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:19.400 align:middle line:84%
before I even know
why we're talking.

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:21.713 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's fascinating
with what you do

00:35:21.713 --> 00:35:22.880 align:middle line:90%
and how have you've done it.

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:23.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: I love it.

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:25.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what's
next for you?

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:27.170 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Well, the podcast.

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:32.840 align:middle line:84%
I think the ascension is
the most important thing

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:35.150 align:middle line:90%
that I'm focused on right now.

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:37.280 align:middle line:84%
Of course, with everything
that's going on,

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:40.038 align:middle line:84%
I think maybe the podcast
will help bring it

00:35:40.038 --> 00:35:42.080 align:middle line:84%
into perspective for
people, so they don't have--

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:42.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:44.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: --to be afraid
of what comes next.

00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:46.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has been
the most rewarding aspect

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:48.090 align:middle line:90%
of all of this for you?

00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:49.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I saw what you
did with that client

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:54.710 align:middle line:84%
in San Diego who had tears
rolling down her eyes.

00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:57.668 align:middle line:90%
What has really touched you?

00:35:57.668 --> 00:35:59.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I think
what I'm really here

00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:02.750 align:middle line:84%
to do is to save
people from pain.

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:05.120 align:middle line:84%
I've had a lot of
pain in my life.

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:09.500 align:middle line:84%
And If I could teach or
maybe one of my guides

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:12.290 align:middle line:84%
could move energy in their
field so that they just don't

00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:13.700 align:middle line:90%
have to go through that pain.

00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:16.430 align:middle line:84%
I just don't wish
that on anybody.

00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:18.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, when
I hear about that,

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:21.950 align:middle line:84%
I think of the great
comedian Robin Williams

00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:26.070 align:middle line:84%
who took his own life, who had
incredible pain that none of us

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:26.870 align:middle line:90%
saw.

00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:28.100 align:middle line:90%
None of it.

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:29.630 align:middle line:90%
He hid it well.

00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:30.960 align:middle line:90%
But he had a disease.

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:32.040 align:middle line:90%
He had an affliction.

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:35.030 align:middle line:90%
It was called Lewy's disease.

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:37.140 align:middle line:90%
And it just made him depressed.

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And I think you try to
avoid that with other people

00:36:41.090 --> 00:36:43.070 align:middle line:84%
and make them feel
good about themselves.

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:45.260 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: And I do
supplement a lot

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:47.600 align:middle line:84%
of what I do if
somebody will meditate,

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:50.210 align:middle line:84%
then I'll inundate them
with a lot of my content

00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:51.395 align:middle line:90%
that I think will help them.

00:36:51.395 --> 00:36:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, if
you'll focus on something,

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:57.830 align:middle line:84%
it will shift and
change faster than

00:36:57.830 --> 00:36:59.120 align:middle line:90%
if you completely ignore it.

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:01.550 align:middle line:84%
It'll still change if
you're ignoring it.

00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:06.260 align:middle line:84%
But if you focus your
awareness, it will get huge.

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:07.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People come
to you for what?

00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:10.670 align:middle line:90%


00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:12.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: I would say--

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:15.330 align:middle line:90%
maybe I want to say this.

00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:17.730 align:middle line:84%
I never really have thought
I'd say this-- hope.

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:18.600 align:middle line:90%
I think it's hope.

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:19.767 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You give them hope?

00:37:19.767 --> 00:37:22.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: No, I don't
think I give them hope.

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:25.980 align:middle line:84%
I think I show them how
to find their own hope

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:28.590 align:middle line:84%
that what they see
in this reality

00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:30.772 align:middle line:90%
isn't the whole enchilada.

00:37:30.772 --> 00:37:31.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You open their eyes.

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:32.897 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: I think I do.

00:37:32.897 --> 00:37:34.290 align:middle line:90%
That's what I try to do--

00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:37.200 align:middle line:90%
try to raise their vibration.

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And by raising
their vibration,

00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:41.020 align:middle line:90%
you give them that hope.

00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:41.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Yeah.

00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:45.590 align:middle line:90%
And the stumbling block is fear.

00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And it comes in all
kinds of different forms.

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:49.730 align:middle line:90%
It's really been interesting.

00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:50.840 align:middle line:90%
I'll even say something.

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:52.250 align:middle line:90%
I was reading somebody one time.

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And I could see that almost 90%
of the energy in their field

00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:58.280 align:middle line:90%
was fear.

00:37:58.280 --> 00:37:59.900 align:middle line:90%
And so I mentioned that.

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:00.860 align:middle line:90%
This was an alpha male.

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:02.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't read too
many alpha males.

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I'm not
afraid of anything, George.

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:06.740 align:middle line:90%
That's what he told me.

00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:09.448 align:middle line:84%
And by looking at him, I
think the opposite is true.

00:38:09.448 --> 00:38:10.865 align:middle line:84%
I think he's afraid
of everything.

00:38:10.865 --> 00:38:11.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everything.

00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:12.853 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: But he
wouldn't call it fear.

00:38:12.853 --> 00:38:13.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everything.

00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:17.420 align:middle line:84%
I got a call a couple
weeks ago on my radio show

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:22.730 align:middle line:84%
from someone who was living
in his truck with his pet dog,

00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:26.550 align:middle line:84%
had no job, and didn't
know what to do.

00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:28.305 align:middle line:84%
How do you reach
that kind of person?

00:38:28.305 --> 00:38:30.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, first, I would
tell them I lived in my car

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:31.430 align:middle line:90%
with my cat.

00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.970 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:32.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you really?

00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Absolutely.

00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:36.810 align:middle line:84%
So I think I might be a
great healer for that person.

00:38:36.810 --> 00:38:39.260 align:middle line:84%
And I think
experiences like that--

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:44.060 align:middle line:84%
they take away all of the
facade of this reality,

00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:46.820 align:middle line:84%
that our parents told
us that you'll be happy

00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:48.440 align:middle line:90%
if you have this kind of life.

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:51.080 align:middle line:10%
And we all know that a lot of
people have the American dream,

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:52.400 align:middle line:10%
and they're not happy.

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:55.040 align:middle line:10%
So by having these other
type of experiences,

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:57.570 align:middle line:10%
you start to build on what's
really important to you.

00:38:57.570 --> 00:38:59.570 align:middle line:10%
But, yeah, sometimes you
have to get all the way

00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:01.982 align:middle line:10%
down to living in your
car with an animal.

00:39:01.982 --> 00:39:04.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lauren, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:05.648 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: George,
thank you so much.

00:39:05.648 --> 00:39:08.240 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: If you ever feel
yourself feeling down,

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:10.910 align:middle line:10%
think of this program
and think of the things

00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:13.100 align:middle line:10%
that Dr. Lauren Cielo
has just passed on

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:15.440 align:middle line:10%
to us, to uplift all of us.

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:16.520 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:18.020 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:21.370 align:middle line:90%
