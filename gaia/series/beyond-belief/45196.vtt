00:00:05.306 --> 00:00:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>> [BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:08.888 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.888 --> 00:00:12.554 align:middle line:84%
>> People are basically going
to keep on to help uncover what

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:13.220 align:middle line:90%
really happened.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.550 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.260 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:26.801 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.801 --> 00:00:28.800 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE NOORY: And
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.450 align:middle line:84%
Paul McGuire, our special
guest, back with us,

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.850 align:middle line:84%
as we talk about his
work, "A Prophecy

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.360 align:middle line:84%
of the Future of America,"
which is informative but also

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.550 align:middle line:90%
frightening.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.310 align:middle line:84%
Frightening, Paul, because
if some of these things

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.870 align:middle line:84%
do happen-- and some
of them are happening--

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.379 align:middle line:84%
this is going to change the
planet like crazy, isn't it?

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:50.670 align:middle line:84%
>> PAUL MCGUIRE: Yes, it is
going to change the planet,

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.880 align:middle line:90%
and that's why I wrote it.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And I know people are
cynical, and I'm cynical, too.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.440 align:middle line:84%
The primary purpose of
the book was not monetary.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
I'm saying that is

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.900 align:middle line:84%
because I'm convinced
that our money may

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.880 align:middle line:90%
lose its value in the next year.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.750 align:middle line:84%
So what good is having a
lot of worthless money?

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.310 align:middle line:84%
The book is a
warning about what's

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.940 align:middle line:84%
happening to America
and the world.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.015 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I use
the term "prophecy"

00:01:18.015 --> 00:01:20.770 align:middle line:84%
is because everything
that's happened

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.450 align:middle line:84%
has been predicted in the
Old Testament and the New

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.560 align:middle line:90%
Testament.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.010 align:middle line:84%
But it's also been predicted
by scientists, other religions,

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.630 align:middle line:90%
and other sources.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.460 align:middle line:84%
So we're in a time
period that people

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.170 align:middle line:84%
from numerous religious
perspectives have predicted,

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.740 align:middle line:84%
and our own scientific
community, as well as

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:42.240 align:middle line:90%
the Bible.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.948 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: That's what
I find frightening.

00:01:43.948 --> 00:01:48.890 align:middle line:84%
Because they all seem to be
aimed at the same focal point.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.870 align:middle line:84%
I look at your book, "A Prophecy
of the Future of America,"

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.400 align:middle line:84%
as a modern day
Book of Revelation,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:00.100 align:middle line:84%
where you, too, focus in on
this point that one day--

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.710 align:middle line:84%
probably sooner than
later, unfortunately--

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.960 align:middle line:90%
we're going to meet.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.060 align:middle line:84%
What is it about this prophecy
that so many different cultures

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.270 align:middle line:84%
have come up with
the same conclusion?

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.960 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: Well,
it's very interesting.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean you go to the Mayan
ruins, and the Incan ruins,

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.110 align:middle line:90%
and the Egyptian pyramids.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.200 align:middle line:84%
And as you know, the
pyramids under the water

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.920 align:middle line:84%
in the Bahamas-- supposedly they
found the ruins of Atlantis.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.390 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if that's true.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.189 align:middle line:90%
But they claim--

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:34.480 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They found something.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.270 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Something huge.

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.540 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Something.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.080 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Something huge.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And you have the scientific
predictions regarding

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.900 align:middle line:84%
polar shifts and solar
flares, and all this stuff

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.620 align:middle line:90%
is converging.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.380 align:middle line:84%
In addition, you
have the potential

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.380 align:middle line:90%
of biological plagues.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.410 align:middle line:84%
Never in the history-- a
guy asked me, well, Paul,

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.350 align:middle line:84%
why are you so
passionate in saying

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.640 align:middle line:90%
this could be the end times.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.720 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'm passionate about
it because never before

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.120 align:middle line:84%
in the history of
mankind have we

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.450 align:middle line:84%
had the technology and
weapons to eradicate

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.510 align:middle line:84%
the earth-- nuclear technology,
biotechnology, or whatever--

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:15.840 align:middle line:90%
in a very short time frame.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.881 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Just like that.

00:03:16.881 --> 00:03:18.020 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Just like that.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:25.040 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Why is it that these
power brokers-- the Illuminati,

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.727 align:middle line:84%
the elitists-- why
are they doing this?

00:03:28.727 --> 00:03:29.810 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what do they want?

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, already they've
got more money than God.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.580 align:middle line:84%
They've got more homes than
they know what to do with.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.990 align:middle line:84%
They travel and do
whatever they want.

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.700 align:middle line:90%
They have a very free life.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.640 align:middle line:90%
Why dabble with ours?

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.322 align:middle line:90%
What do they want, Paul?

00:03:47.322 --> 00:03:49.780 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: Well, that's a very
important question, George.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.900 align:middle line:90%
And it's a huge question.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And when people answer that
for themselves, a lot of doors

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.520 align:middle line:90%
unlock.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.820 align:middle line:84%
I think that the
answer is two-fold.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.670 align:middle line:84%
Number one is they
truly believe--

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
the top people.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.270 align:middle line:84%
They truly believe that
they are genetically

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.980 align:middle line:90%
superior to the rest of us.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.840 align:middle line:84%
They truly believe
that they are god-men.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.040 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the case could be
made that they may be god-men,

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.880 align:middle line:84%
in the sense that their
DNA may be coupled with,

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.074 align:middle line:84%
let's say, Nephilim DNA,
going back thousands of years.

00:04:25.074 --> 00:04:26.990 align:middle line:84%
But they believe they're
genetically superior,

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.015 align:middle line:84%
that they're the
god-men, the god-race.

00:04:29.015 --> 00:04:30.140 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's their right.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.740 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: It is their right.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And because they believe in a
brutal social Darwinian theory,

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.610 align:middle line:84%
they believe that
might makes right.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And because they have the power,
because they are genetically

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.950 align:middle line:84%
superior, they have the right
to control and dominate us

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.070 align:middle line:84%
like god-kings, like a
Pharaoh with his slaves.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.834 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Because they
know better, right?

00:04:54.834 --> 00:04:55.500 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Yes.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, they actually
consider themselves

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.730 align:middle line:90%
the scientific elite.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.190 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Are they bored?

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.790 align:middle line:84%
Do they have so much, Paul,
that this is like a little game,

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.810 align:middle line:84%
and we're little chess
pieces, and they just

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.650 align:middle line:90%
enjoy moving us around?

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.550 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: I don't
know if they're bored,

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.920 align:middle line:84%
but I will say this-- and this
may be controversial to some

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.620 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.064 align:middle line:84%
First of all, the
term Illuminati--

00:05:20.064 --> 00:05:21.480 align:middle line:84%
some people don't
think it exists.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.520 align:middle line:84%
But George Washington
knew it existed.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.270 align:middle line:84%
Thomas Jefferson
knew it existed.

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.727 align:middle line:84%
Benjamin Franklin
knew it existed.

00:05:26.727 --> 00:05:28.810 align:middle line:84%
These were articulate men
and they wrote about it.

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.345 align:middle line:90%


00:05:31.345 --> 00:05:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to make
a blanket statement.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Because there are
people who would

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.990 align:middle line:84%
be in the category of
the Illumined Ones,

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.110 align:middle line:84%
and people who were members
of certain societies.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.030 align:middle line:90%
They're not all bad.

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.210 align:middle line:84%
Just like, you just can't
make a blanket statement.

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.940 align:middle line:84%
There are some who have made
very-- like Thomas Paine,

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.020 align:middle line:84%
during the American Revolution,
who wrote "Common Sense."

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.700 align:middle line:84%
He was supposedly
an Illumined One.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.100 align:middle line:84%
Without him, we would have
had no American Revolution.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.340 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:06.080 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: But there are groups
in this group that I believe

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.630 align:middle line:90%
are very evil.

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:13.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, evil in the sense that
they worship Lucifer-- they

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:14.760 align:middle line:90%
are Luciferians.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, they don't think
that's a bad idea.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.940 align:middle line:84%
But the point is, if
they're worshipping Lucifer,

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.010 align:middle line:84%
then they play by
Lucifer's rules.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.450 align:middle line:90%
Lucifer's rules are real simple.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:27.139 align:middle line:90%
It's my way or--

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:28.180 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Or the highway.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.200 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Right.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.520 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And I want your soul.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.353 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Exactly.

00:06:31.353 --> 00:06:32.500 align:middle line:90%
And I want your soul.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:37.067 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You have talked
about inter-dimensional beings.

00:06:37.067 --> 00:06:38.400 align:middle line:90%
Tell me a little bit about that.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.140 align:middle line:84%
Because science now is saying
that we have multiverses.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.830 align:middle line:90%
We have more than one universe.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:49.050 align:middle line:84%
Theories that would've
astounded us 20 years ago,

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:52.880 align:middle line:84%
they now say it's commonplace,
that we could have universes

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.125 align:middle line:84%
hooked together, like
bubbles would come out

00:06:56.125 --> 00:06:57.470 align:middle line:90%
of a bubble machine.

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.280 align:middle line:90%
And they're all stuck together.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.950 align:middle line:84%
But there could be hundreds,
thousands of other universes.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:06.160 align:middle line:84%
My little brain can't
comprehend this.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.500 align:middle line:84%
Is that where these
inter-dimensional beings are

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.110 align:middle line:84%
coming from, these
other universes that are

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.304 align:middle line:90%
hooked into ours?

00:07:13.304 --> 00:07:13.970 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Yes.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's very interesting
that the apostle Paul,

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:22.000 align:middle line:84%
in the book of Ephesians, talks
about this spiritual dimension,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.840 align:middle line:84%
this invisible realm,
or parallel universe.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And he talks about
a massive conflict

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:33.930 align:middle line:84%
between the forces of good and
evil in this other dimension.

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:37.370 align:middle line:84%
So he's talking, really, about
a multi-dimensional universe.

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And now we have
string theory, which

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.930 align:middle line:84%
says we have what, 11 or
13 dimensions-- quantum

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:45.320 align:middle line:90%
physics that confirms this.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.300 align:middle line:84%
So because there are
other dimensions,

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:53.510 align:middle line:84%
there are also beings that
inhabit those other dimensions.

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:55.260 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Like we
inhabit this one, right?

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.120 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Exactly.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And these
inter-dimensional beings

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:04.250 align:middle line:84%
have gained access to
our physical world.

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And I would have to say
that's one of the greatest

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:11.490 align:middle line:84%
secrets of our world that
most people don't know.

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:15.770 align:middle line:84%
Most people who read
history and study economics,

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:19.270 align:middle line:84%
they leave out this
all-important dimension--

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:20.210 align:middle line:90%
no pun intended.

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:20.990 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:26.420 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: And that is that
our history has been influenced

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.930 align:middle line:84%
by beings from
another dimension.

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And it goes back before the
flood, all the way to Atlantis,

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.220 align:middle line:90%
and it continues on today.

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And these inter-dimensional
beings very much

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:41.700 align:middle line:90%
affect the ruling elite.

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.970 align:middle line:90%
They guide the ruling elite.

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:46.910 align:middle line:84%
But here's the most
fascinating thing.

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:50.550 align:middle line:84%
These inter-dimensional
beings possess

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:56.710 align:middle line:84%
highly advanced scientific and
highly advanced technology.

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:59.660 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Because they were
probably years ahead of us--

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:00.657 align:middle line:90%
years ahead of us.

00:09:00.657 --> 00:09:03.240 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: Hundreds of years,
thousands of years ahead of us.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.406 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Millions, perhaps.

00:09:04.406 --> 00:09:05.510 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Millions, yes.

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:09.660 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: When I read
Genesis, both as a child

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:14.150 align:middle line:84%
and as an adult, I came up with
a couple of my own theories.

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And that was what are, and
who are, fallen angels?

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:20.450 align:middle line:90%
How did they get here?

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:22.440 align:middle line:90%
Were they extraterrestrial?

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.410 align:middle line:90%
Possibly.

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:27.140 align:middle line:84%
Fallen angels-- like,
what did they fall from?

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:29.040 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how did they get here?

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.460 align:middle line:84%
That's where I think the
inter-dimensional beings

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:33.120 align:middle line:90%
theory really comes in.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.760 align:middle line:84%
They probably came here
through some kind of a stargate

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:37.826 align:middle line:90%
or portal, didn't they?

00:09:37.826 --> 00:09:39.450 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: Well,
George, you're right.

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really amazed that
I didn't get that when

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:45.320 align:middle line:84%
I was young reading
all that stuff.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.270 align:middle line:90%
But you're absolutely right.

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And here's the thing that I
found personally problematic,

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.780 align:middle line:84%
and now I don't,
because I researched it.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.820 align:middle line:84%
But initially it was
bothersome to me.

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:00.450 align:middle line:84%
These inter-dimensional
beings-- or in Genesis 6,

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:04.390 align:middle line:84%
it says "the b'nai Elohim,"
which means fallen angels

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:06.170 align:middle line:90%
or the sons of God.

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:07.690 align:middle line:84%
They came from
another dimension.

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:10.820 align:middle line:84%
But here's the key thing that
many people don't realize.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:13.090 align:middle line:84%
When they came to
the earth initially,

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:15.500 align:middle line:84%
on Mount Herman
in Phoenicia, they

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:19.200 align:middle line:90%
brought with them technology.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.180 align:middle line:84%
Now my book, "A Prophecy
of the Future of America,"

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:24.770 align:middle line:90%
deals with Bible prophecy.

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:28.890 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people don't know
that, within Bible prophecy,

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:33.480 align:middle line:84%
these fallen angels
use technology.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:37.810 align:middle line:84%
They have, for example,
ships-- you could call them

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:39.520 align:middle line:90%
UFOs, if you wanted.

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:43.070 align:middle line:90%
They know genetic technology.

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:46.940 align:middle line:84%
They imparted the technology
to build super-civilizations,

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:50.350 align:middle line:84%
like Atlantis and
the great pyramids.

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And they know
genetic technology.

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:57.770 align:middle line:84%
So these aren't just people
with wings floating around.

00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Which is how
they want us to think.

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:00.870 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Exactly.

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:06.170 align:middle line:84%
They have highly
advanced technology.

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:11.260 align:middle line:84%
As I said in the book, the
Tower of Babel is a stargate.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.450 align:middle line:84%
It's an
inter-dimensional portal.

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:16.920 align:middle line:84%
And if we begin to realize,
when we look at the Bible,

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:20.980 align:middle line:84%
that the Bible isn't just some
funky old religious book that

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.300 align:middle line:84%
should be tossed
in the fireplace,

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:26.090 align:middle line:84%
if you run out of--
an EMP hits us.

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:27.282 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's a road map.

00:11:27.282 --> 00:11:28.740 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: Right,
it's a road map.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:33.820 align:middle line:84%
But it's a DNA,
holographic, virtual world,

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:40.390 align:middle line:84%
multi-dimensional road map into
the universe and our lives.

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:42.380 align:middle line:90%
And it's a code, if you will.

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And when you open the
code, it'll blow your mind.

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:46.620 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Let's assume
for a moment, Paul,

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:51.400 align:middle line:84%
that this universe is connected
to all these other multiverses

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.280 align:middle line:90%
through these portals.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how many there
might be on this planet,

00:11:55.750 --> 00:12:00.960 align:middle line:84%
these gates-- maybe Babylon,
maybe some other area, maybe 20

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.130 align:middle line:84%
places around this
planet-- who knows.

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:07.360 align:middle line:84%
But I think somehow these
inter-dimensional beings,

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:12.850 align:middle line:84%
by the process of intelligence
and being ahead of us, probably

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:16.670 align:middle line:84%
figured out how to travel
through these things

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:18.870 align:middle line:84%
to get to wherever
they want to go,

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:20.770 align:middle line:84%
throughout all of
these universes.

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:24.260 align:middle line:84%
You think that might be one
of the ways they've done this?

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:25.410 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Absolutely.

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:31.630 align:middle line:84%
Because you go back to Babylon,
and in Revelation 7:18,

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:34.150 align:middle line:90%
it talks about Mystery Babylon.

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:38.120 align:middle line:84%
So Mystery Babylon was these
secret occult religions

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.410 align:middle line:84%
that used technology
and used science,

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:43.810 align:middle line:84%
back there with the Tower of
Babel, developed by Nimrod

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:46.390 align:middle line:90%
and his wife, Semiramus.

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:51.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, that technology
was passed on.

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:53.770 align:middle line:84%
Semiramus, by the way,
killed her husband Nimrod.

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And to cover it up, she said
he ascended into the heavens

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:00.250 align:middle line:90%
and became Ra the sun god.

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And as you move through
history, Nimrod's name

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:09.870 align:middle line:84%
changes from Ra to, like, Osiris
to Apollo to Zeus, Prometheus.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:11.020 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They're all gods.

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:11.770 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Right.

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:13.470 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And you see, though, that
a governing structure

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:20.530 align:middle line:84%
is built in along
with the technology.

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And the governing structure
is that the god-men

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.010 align:middle line:90%
rule the earth.

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:30.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, you keep moving
forward, and you

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.250 align:middle line:84%
have these secret
occult societies.

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And let's just take Nazi
Germany, for example.

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:41.230 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
don't understand that

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:45.510 align:middle line:84%
why was it that the Nazis
were 100 years, 50 years more

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:46.199 align:middle line:90%
advanced than--

00:13:46.199 --> 00:13:47.740 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Anybody
else on the planet.

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:48.573 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Exactly.

00:13:48.573 --> 00:13:51.630 align:middle line:84%
You go back to 1926-- and I
deal with this in my book,

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:53.240 align:middle line:84%
"A Prophecy of the
Future of America."

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:57.900 align:middle line:84%
You go back to 1926, and
there were these clairvoyant

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:02.720 align:middle line:84%
beautiful females called the
Vril-ya maidens from the Vril

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.410 align:middle line:90%
force.

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And they telepathically
downloaded,

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:12.335 align:middle line:84%
from some other dimension,
actual UFO rocket technology

00:14:12.335 --> 00:14:12.835 align:middle line:90%
blueprints.

00:14:12.835 --> 00:14:14.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can say,
well, that's nuts.

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, it wasn't nuts,
because Wernher von Braun,

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:21.630 align:middle line:84%
who started our space program--
the Nazis actually used

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:26.130 align:middle line:84%
these blueprints and developed
all this rocket technology.

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:28.100 align:middle line:90%
So it wasn't nuts.

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:31.000 align:middle line:84%
The Nazis, they
pulled information

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.780 align:middle line:90%
in from another dimension.

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:34.040 align:middle line:90%
And they were occultists.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.630 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: And they were
hard-core occultists.

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:37.880 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That is fascinating.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.730 align:middle line:84%
I know the story of Robert
Oppenheimer, the father

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:46.810 align:middle line:84%
of our atomic program,
utilized stories in old texts

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:51.670 align:middle line:84%
from India about
atomic bombs and wars.

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
they had that.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And he used that
as a blueprint when

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:59.969 align:middle line:84%
he developed the
nuclear program for us.

00:14:59.969 --> 00:15:01.010 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: You're right.

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And I have that
account in my book.

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:09.560 align:middle line:84%
Because after they
detonated the a-bomb test,

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:13.880 align:middle line:84%
he quoted something from
the Vedic's scriptures

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:17.290 align:middle line:90%
of the "destroyer of worlds."

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:20.120 align:middle line:90%
So he was very involved in that.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:26.410 align:middle line:84%
Now the other thing
is the Nazis--

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:29.910 align:middle line:84%
they were accessing
technology and science

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:31.400 align:middle line:90%
from another dimension.

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And they believed in this
master race theory, which

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:36.940 align:middle line:84%
was the genetic
creation of, quote,

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:41.170 align:middle line:84%
god-men, which is what
was happening in Atlantis,

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:44.700 align:middle line:84%
is what was happening--
the invention of god-men

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:49.340 align:middle line:84%
was why God destroyed the
world with the flood of Noah.

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:53.710 align:middle line:84%
Because the fallen angels
and inter-dimensional

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:57.450 align:middle line:84%
beings were mating
with human women.

00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:00.830 align:middle line:84%
Now the Nazis accessed this
supernatural technology.

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:02.890 align:middle line:84%
But let's go back
to the mid-1600s.

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:06.210 align:middle line:84%
We have a man named
Sir Francis Bacon.

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:09.580 align:middle line:84%
He had a secret occult
plan for America--

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:14.790 align:middle line:84%
in the 1600s-- for America
to be the new Atlantis

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:16.810 align:middle line:90%
and the new world order.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:22.840 align:middle line:84%
But the secret of it
revolves around the rebirth

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:26.159 align:middle line:90%
of the god-men in America.

00:16:26.159 --> 00:16:27.950 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: That's what
they were aiming for.

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:28.908 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Absolutely.

00:16:28.908 --> 00:16:30.100 align:middle line:90%
And they've done it.

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:33.630 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Where are we today,
Paul, with all of this?

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:37.050 align:middle line:84%
Because let's assume
this has all happened.

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:40.950 align:middle line:84%
We've got the elitists who
think that they're the gods.

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:42.680 align:middle line:90%
Where do we go from here?

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:44.664 align:middle line:90%
What happens, in your opinion?

00:16:44.664 --> 00:16:46.330 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: Well,
it's very interesting.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:48.380 align:middle line:84%
Jesus Christ said, "as it
was in the days of Noah,

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:50.838 align:middle line:84%
so it will be in the days of
the coming of the Son of Man."

00:16:50.838 --> 00:16:53.180 align:middle line:84%
I believe he was
primarily referencing

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:56.600 align:middle line:84%
the god-men, the fact that
the fallen angels were

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.460 align:middle line:90%
mating with human women.

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:01.060 align:middle line:84%
What he was saying was
that, before his return,

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:03.070 align:middle line:90%
that was going to happen again.

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:03.940 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Again.

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.730 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: So here we are
in America and the world,

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:10.740 align:middle line:84%
and Transhumanism and
biotech and the singularity.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:13.170 align:middle line:84%
Transhumanism is
the biggest science,

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:15.510 align:middle line:90%
genetically perfecting man.

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:18.609 align:middle line:84%
And you have a lot
of scientists like,

00:17:18.609 --> 00:17:21.819 align:middle line:84%
Kurzweil, who plans
to live forever

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:25.900 align:middle line:84%
by genetically
creating a new body.

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:27.859 align:middle line:84%
And you have the
Department of Defense

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:30.510 align:middle line:90%
creating genetic super soldiers.

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And you have experiments--
they're quite open, where

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:37.440 align:middle line:84%
they're merging animal
DNA with human DNA.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:41.490 align:middle line:84%
Although we don't have proof,
but it's quite possible,

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:45.000 align:middle line:84%
based on Jesus Christ's
words, that in addition

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.280 align:middle line:84%
to the integration of
human DNA and animal DNA,

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.440 align:middle line:84%
we have currently
going on, right now,

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:55.550 align:middle line:84%
the integration of
the Nephilim DNA

00:17:55.550 --> 00:18:00.480 align:middle line:84%
with human DNA, which would be
a fulfillment of Christ's words

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.830 align:middle line:84%
about the return of the
Nephilim in our time.

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:08.680 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: If we went up to some
of these elitists and gathered

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:15.340 align:middle line:84%
their DNA and tested it, would
we see this link, this lineage?

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: I personally
think we would.

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:19.480 align:middle line:90%
I can't prove it.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And I personally think
that going back--

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:27.530 align:middle line:84%
after the polluted DNA was
wiped out during the flood,

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:30.200 align:middle line:90%
the Nephilim returned.

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that, in what
is called Illuminati bloodline

00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:38.970 align:middle line:84%
societies, and Royal
Societies and families,

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:43.050 align:middle line:84%
I think there's been an
intentional preservation

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:44.900 align:middle line:90%
of that Nephilim DNA.

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:48.410 align:middle line:84%
I suspect-- I can't prove it--
that in many of the world's

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:53.970 align:middle line:84%
royalty and elite, there exists
that Nephilim-- or you could

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:55.960 align:middle line:90%
say god-men-- DNA.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.259 align:middle line:90%
Their DNA would be different.

00:18:57.259 --> 00:18:58.300 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's different.

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:01.600 align:middle line:84%
What about people who say
that they're reptilian?

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:06.530 align:middle line:84%
David Icke, for example, will
say that, beyond a doubt,

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:09.490 align:middle line:84%
he knows that the power
brokers on this planet

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:12.610 align:middle line:84%
have a reptilian
bloodline to them.

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:15.150 align:middle line:84%
He said you look at their
eyes, and you can almost

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:19.360 align:middle line:84%
see that reptilian,
the yellow looking.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.940 align:middle line:90%
And they have this facade.

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:23.850 align:middle line:90%
They can do this metamorphosis.

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:26.732 align:middle line:84%
You think that's
all real or not?

00:19:26.732 --> 00:19:28.610 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: Well, David
is very interesting.

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And when he first said this, I
said, oh god, this guy's crazy.

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:33.061 align:middle line:90%
That was my initial reaction.

00:19:33.061 --> 00:19:34.560 align:middle line:84%
But then I began
to think about what

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:40.440 align:middle line:90%
he said in reference to the DNA.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:45.250 align:middle line:84%
If they have this DNA, which
I think they probably do,

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:47.500 align:middle line:84%
then-- I don't know
if I would take

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:51.090 align:middle line:90%
the metaphor as far as he does.

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:54.900 align:middle line:84%
But I think he's
touching on a truth.

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:59.830 align:middle line:84%
You go back to the Garden
of Eden, Adam and Eve,

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:02.430 align:middle line:84%
the first man and
women were immortal.

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:03.330 align:middle line:90%
They didn't die.

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:06.250 align:middle line:90%
They were god-men, if you will.

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:14.790 align:middle line:84%
And Lucifer inhabits
a reptilian being.

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:20.090 align:middle line:84%
And he gets them to
pull the cosmic trigger,

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:22.600 align:middle line:84%
and the death force
enters the human race.

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:27.610 align:middle line:84%
So this reptilian
being, Lucifer,

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:28.940 align:middle line:90%
infects the human race.

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:32.760 align:middle line:84%
Now what's interesting
is that these

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:36.700 align:middle line:84%
fallen angels that are
mating with human women,

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:40.315 align:middle line:90%
they are from a reptilian race.

00:20:40.315 --> 00:20:43.100 align:middle line:90%


00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:44.820 align:middle line:90%
So there's a truth there.

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:47.170 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So he's
onto something.

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:49.640 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: I don't know about
the degree of his metaphor,

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:52.370 align:middle line:84%
but he's definitely
onto something.

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:55.700 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: This
mating with humans--

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:59.050 align:middle line:84%
if they were dimensional,
for me to assume this,

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:00.604 align:middle line:90%
they also had to be physical.

00:21:00.604 --> 00:21:01.270 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Yes.

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:02.810 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: How did they get here?

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:04.800 align:middle line:84%
They didn't fall
through a tunnel,

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.140 align:middle line:84%
like we see in some
of the "Slider" type

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:09.060 align:middle line:90%
movies and TV shows.

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:12.040 align:middle line:84%
Did they come through
with real, actual craft

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:14.610 align:middle line:84%
that we see, these
UFOs that people see?

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:16.350 align:middle line:84%
Is that how they're
getting here?

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:17.690 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:19.240 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: Well, George,
that's an extremely important

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:19.880 align:middle line:90%
question.

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And that goes again
to the reality

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:29.720 align:middle line:84%
that these Nephilim or fallen
angels utilize technology.

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And utilizing spacecraft
is not that far-fetched,

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:39.300 align:middle line:84%
in the light of the fact
that they use technology.

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:41.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, they used technology
to build Atlantis.

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:45.090 align:middle line:84%
They used technology
to build the pyramids.

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:47.770 align:middle line:90%
But here's the other thing.

00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:51.690 align:middle line:84%
They were experimenting
genetically on, not only

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:54.500 align:middle line:84%
the human race, but
they were experimenting

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.095 align:middle line:84%
genetically on the
animal species.

00:21:57.095 --> 00:21:57.595 align:middle line:90%
That's why--

00:21:57.595 --> 00:21:58.460 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Of this planet.

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:00.668 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: Of this planet--
that's why the flood had

00:22:00.668 --> 00:22:02.520 align:middle line:90%
to wipe out all the animals.

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:07.120 align:middle line:84%
So these fallen angels, or
inter-dimensional beings,

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.860 align:middle line:84%
were experimenting
genetically with animals

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:12.170 align:middle line:90%
utilizing technology.

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:13.640 align:middle line:90%
And people don't understand it.

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:16.272 align:middle line:84%
When you read the
biblical account,

00:22:16.272 --> 00:22:17.730 align:middle line:84%
which I talk about
in my book and I

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:22.080 align:middle line:84%
give examples-- that
the biblical account

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:27.830 align:middle line:84%
deals constantly with the
technology of the fallen

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:28.800 align:middle line:90%
angels.

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.390 align:middle line:90%
They have technology.

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And we can't compartmentalize
and think of them

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:37.629 align:middle line:84%
as some kind of beings with
wings, and stuff like that.

00:22:37.629 --> 00:22:38.670 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Playing a harp.

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:39.420 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Right.

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:41.550 align:middle line:84%
They have science
and technology.

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:43.350 align:middle line:90%
And here's the key thing.

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:46.980 align:middle line:84%
The elites in our world--
the scientific elite,

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:51.680 align:middle line:84%
the secretive elite-- they
are accessing this technology

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.980 align:middle line:84%
and science now,
even as we speak,

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:56.830 align:middle line:84%
which is 100 years
into the future.

00:22:56.830 --> 00:23:00.380 align:middle line:84%
And they're doing all kinds of
things-- weather modification

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:03.110 align:middle line:84%
being one-- but things
that most people probably

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:05.790 align:middle line:84%
would think belong
in a sci-fi novel.

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:07.950 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, you know,
when I talk to people,

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:11.040 align:middle line:84%
whether it's on my
radio show or in person,

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:13.690 align:middle line:84%
and they question the
possibility of this--

00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:17.450 align:middle line:84%
for them to understand
inter-dimensional beings

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:20.510 align:middle line:84%
and other universes is
beyond what they're capable

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:22.140 align:middle line:90%
of knowing.

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:25.670 align:middle line:84%
But I bring them back home
to a realistic question.

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And that is, can
you even explain

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:32.140 align:middle line:84%
how you're here,
why you're here,

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:34.250 align:middle line:90%
the purpose of you being here?

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And they don't have
any answers for that.

00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:40.960 align:middle line:84%
So I said, if you can't
answer those questions,

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:44.010 align:middle line:84%
then maybe it's very
logical to assume

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:46.070 align:middle line:84%
that all these other
things are possible,

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:48.852 align:middle line:84%
too, as far-fetched
as they seem.

00:23:48.852 --> 00:23:50.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, on the face
of it, when you

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:53.095 align:middle line:84%
talk about inter-dimensional
beings coming through portals

00:23:53.095 --> 00:23:55.970 align:middle line:84%
and stargates, breeding
with-- I mean, it's just,

00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:57.970 align:middle line:84%
whoa-- as you said,
science fiction.

00:23:57.970 --> 00:23:58.720 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Right.

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:01.160 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But when you can't
answer the basic questions

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:02.010 align:middle line:90%
of who are we?

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:03.420 align:middle line:90%
What are we doing here?

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:04.590 align:middle line:90%
How did we get here?

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:06.730 align:middle line:90%
How did our own universe start?

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:08.990 align:middle line:84%
You then have to
say, you know what?

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:12.340 align:middle line:84%
All these other
things are possible.

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And maybe one day, Paul,
we'll get the answer to this,

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:17.800 align:middle line:90%
but I think you're close.

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.190 align:middle line:84%
And "A Prophecy in the
Future of America,"

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:26.180 align:middle line:84%
those kinds of theories are
very, very close to the answer.

00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:29.572 align:middle line:84%
And maybe one day the world
will start realizing that.

00:24:29.572 --> 00:24:32.030 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: Well, you said in
your radio program when I was

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:33.863 align:middle line:84%
a guest on it-- you
were talking, I believe,

00:24:33.863 --> 00:24:35.040 align:middle line:90%
it was about Francis Crick.

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:41.200 align:middle line:84%
He saw the DNA helix
when he was taking LSD.

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:45.000 align:middle line:84%
He got that information not
from his intellectual mind.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:45.680 align:middle line:90%
He accessed--

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:46.250 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: He had to tap.

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:47.650 align:middle line:90%
He had to tap into something.

00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:48.399 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Right.

00:24:48.399 --> 00:24:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And Thomas Edison was
tapping into stuff.

00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:55.320 align:middle line:84%
Nikola Tesla technology--
he tapped into stuff.

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:58.900 align:middle line:84%
So this skalar technology
and string theory--

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:02.090 align:middle line:90%
there are other dimensions.

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:03.710 align:middle line:84%
There is the kingdom
of Heaven, which

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:06.010 align:middle line:84%
is-- the kingdom
of Heaven is not

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:08.100 align:middle line:84%
like up in the
atmosphere with clouds.

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:09.230 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: In clouds.

00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:09.690 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Exactly.

00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:10.189 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:25:10.189 --> 00:25:13.430 align:middle line:84%
And we're not going to be
playing harps, thank god.

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:15.525 align:middle line:90%
It is in a different universe.

00:25:15.525 --> 00:25:17.450 align:middle line:90%
It's in a different dimension.

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:19.880 align:middle line:84%
You read the Book of
Revelation, and you

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:22.510 align:middle line:90%
see the depiction of Armageddon.

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:24.700 align:middle line:90%
And you read about this abyss.

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:27.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, the abyss
is a portal where

00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:32.660 align:middle line:84%
all these demonic entities come
out for this last day's battle.

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:35.760 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Things aren't what
they seem to be, are they?

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:36.710 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: No.

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:39.335 align:middle line:84%
It reminds me of this girl
who asked me a question,

00:25:39.335 --> 00:25:40.430 align:middle line:90%
and she was terrified.

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:44.820 align:middle line:84%
She thought that Heaven was
going to be eternal monotony.

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:46.180 align:middle line:90%
And I thought the same thing.

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:47.721 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the last
thing I wanted to do

00:25:47.721 --> 00:25:49.261 align:middle line:90%
was play a harp for a million--

00:25:49.261 --> 00:25:49.969 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Forever

00:25:49.969 --> 00:25:51.730 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: --years.

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:57.710 align:middle line:84%
Heaven is so far beyond the
scope of the human imagination.

00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:00.950 align:middle line:84%
Think of your creativity,
my creativity, your viewers'

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:03.310 align:middle line:90%
creativity.

00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:05.550 align:middle line:90%
People forget God is a creator.

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:07.220 align:middle line:90%
It's a creative world.

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:10.740 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
creativity enhanced.

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:15.290 align:middle line:84%
We are going to see, in that
other dimension of Heaven--

00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:17.440 align:middle line:84%
and you can read about
this in Revelation.

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:19.840 align:middle line:84%
We're going to see
colors that are

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.010 align:middle line:84%
beyond the color
spectrum of earth.

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:27.450 align:middle line:84%
We will see flowers and
waterfalls and natural displays

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:30.920 align:middle line:84%
that are so far beyond
the beauty of earth.

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:33.560 align:middle line:84%
Where do people get the idea
that Heaven-- God is not

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:34.420 align:middle line:90%
boring.

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:35.739 align:middle line:90%
So why would Heaven be boring?

00:26:35.739 --> 00:26:37.280 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
be bor-- it's going

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:40.560 align:middle line:84%
to be the most mind-blowing
cosmic adventure.

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And what I like
to tell people is

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:47.150 align:middle line:84%
that Heaven is going to
be an ecstatic state where

00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:52.320 align:middle line:84%
every second you get higher,
more ecstatic, more ecstatic.

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:55.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking about
"Breaking Bad" meth addiction.

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
the euphoria that

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:00.842 align:middle line:90%
comes from being in paradise.

00:27:00.842 --> 00:27:03.594 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Yeah, which
we can all reach--

00:27:03.594 --> 00:27:05.260 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: Which we
can all reach, yes.

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:08.490 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: --if, and here's
the big if-- if we can fight

00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:12.480 align:middle line:84%
the shackles of the elitists,
who have their own plan,

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:13.530 align:middle line:90%
don't they?

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:16.150 align:middle line:84%
>> MCGUIRE: You're
right, because they have,

00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:20.480 align:middle line:84%
to use the old expression, they
have sold their-- there are

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:23.270 align:middle line:84%
people, sadly to say,
who on this earth,

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:24.362 align:middle line:90%
who have sold their--

00:27:24.362 --> 00:27:25.680 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Sold their soul
to the devil, didn't they?

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:26.360 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Faustus.

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:27.077 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Yes.

00:27:27.077 --> 00:27:28.410 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And they regretted it.

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:29.118 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Yeah.

00:27:29.118 --> 00:27:32.910 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I remember when
the time came for reckoning,

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:35.295 align:middle line:84%
he didn't want to give his
soul up, but it was too late.

00:27:35.295 --> 00:27:35.920 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: No.

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:36.780 align:middle line:90%
And people laugh.

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:41.790 align:middle line:90%
People laugh, but you know what?

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:44.644 align:middle line:84%
The universe is built
on economics and laws.

00:27:44.644 --> 00:27:46.060 align:middle line:84%
Whether people
like it or not, you

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:48.817 align:middle line:84%
stand on the top of the
Empire State Building,

00:27:48.817 --> 00:27:49.650 align:middle line:90%
you're going to die.

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:50.400 align:middle line:90%
Splat.

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:51.560 align:middle line:90%
That's the law of gravity.

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:53.060 align:middle line:84%
You can say you
don't believe in it.

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:54.560 align:middle line:90%
It exists.

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:57.900 align:middle line:84%
So the universe
and life has laws.

00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:00.420 align:middle line:84%
There's the laws of
this time period.

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the
laws of eternity.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:07.594 align:middle line:84%
And so, our ideas and our
choices have consequences.

00:28:07.594 --> 00:28:08.510 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All the way.

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:09.850 align:middle line:84%
Paul, thank you for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:10.580 align:middle line:90%
>> MCGUIRE: Thank you, George.

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:12.730 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Paul McGuire,
author of, of course,

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:16.830 align:middle line:84%
"A Prophecy of the Future of
America," and also, of course,

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:19.320 align:middle line:90%
"The Day the Dollar Died."

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:20.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:22.405 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:28:22.405 --> 00:28:39.034 align:middle line:90%
