00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.100 align:middle line:84%
You just say Uber into the

>>BEN STEWART: There's
cameras everywhere.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.720 align:middle line:84%
So if you can't escape it,
you have to transcend it.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, there was
so much viewer response

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.740 align:middle line:90%
to this incredible show.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.400 align:middle line:84%
We're going to pull some emails
from some of our viewers.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>>BEN STEWART: Is
God afraid of 5G?

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.700 align:middle line:84%
Is 5G just the one thing
that's outside of God's hands?

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.790 align:middle line:90%
We need to wake up.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.400 align:middle line:84%
We're a lot more
powerful than that.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.920 align:middle line:84%
If we wake up with only
fear in our hearts,

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.720 align:middle line:90%
then that's what will manifest.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.120 align:middle line:84%
If we wake up to our
potential, that's

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.710 align:middle line:90%
the future I'm moving into.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.380 align:middle line:84%

be optimistic about this.

>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.640 align:middle line:10%
And we have a great
program for you.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.150 align:middle line:10%
Ben Stewart with us, a
researcher and documentarian

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.620 align:middle line:10%
who has been featured
on many Gaia programs,

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.940 align:middle line:10%
including his own series,
which was called "Limitless."

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, most recently, Ben was
on one of our "Beyond Belief"

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.600 align:middle line:84%
programs talking about
living in a 5G world.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And there was lots of
controversy over this program.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.713 align:middle line:84%
Let's remind you what
that show was all about.

00:01:28.713 --> 00:01:30.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BEN STEWART: There's
no outrunning 5G.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.540 align:middle line:10%
And it's rolling
out as we speak.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.380 align:middle line:10%
Instead of trying to beat it, I
think we need to transcend it.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.470 align:middle line:10%
Currently, as we speak, there
are satellites going up,

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.820 align:middle line:10%
5G satellites.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.205 align:middle line:84%
Soon we're going to have 5G
pumping all over the world.

00:01:44.205 --> 00:01:45.830 align:middle line:10%
You could be in the
middle of the ocean

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.890 align:middle line:10%
eventually and still be
able to get your 5G service.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.750 align:middle line:10%
Let's say self-driving cars.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.670 align:middle line:90%
It needs high-speed internet.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.590 align:middle line:84%
It can't have lag
time, otherwise,

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.780 align:middle line:90%
it may miss its turn, right?

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.670 align:middle line:10%
Most people aren't
getting the full story

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.520 align:middle line:10%
of what the
infrastructure of 5G has

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.100 align:middle line:10%
to do to support such
high-speed internet.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.100 align:middle line:10%
In a 5G world,
you can't opt out.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.490 align:middle line:10%
So the phone is less
needed, because if you're

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.280 align:middle line:10%
in a city like Wuhan, China,
you step out your door,

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.390 align:middle line:10%
and you say Uber.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.070 align:middle line:10%
You don't need to
say into your phone.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.842 align:middle line:10%
A self-driving
car might come up.

00:02:17.842 --> 00:02:18.800 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Wait a minute.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.107 align:middle line:10%
You just say Uber into the
ether, and an Uber shows up?

00:02:22.107 --> 00:02:23.690 align:middle line:10%
>>STEWART: There's
cameras everywhere.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.720 align:middle line:10%
So right now, there's a
billion cameras in China.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.140 align:middle line:10%
By 2022, there'll be two
cameras for every one citizen.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.520 align:middle line:10%
So let's say you say Uber.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.540 align:middle line:10%
A car comes up.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.700 align:middle line:10%
It sees who you
are, the car does.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.560 align:middle line:90%
It knows your digital identity.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.090 align:middle line:90%
It docks your pay from that.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.830 align:middle line:10%
So now instead of having
towers every several miles,

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.780 align:middle line:10%
these tall towers, now--

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:45.650 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: For 4G.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.950 align:middle line:10%
>>STEWART: For 4G, where they're
really, really big, tall masts.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.950 align:middle line:10%
Now you're going to have
things the size of a shoe box

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.280 align:middle line:10%
every couple feet on top of or
on the side of every building.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.860 align:middle line:10%
Eventually, it's
going to be where

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.025 align:middle line:10%
you could be sitting
in your seat,

00:03:00.025 --> 00:03:01.400 align:middle line:10%
and you're hooked
up to a system,

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.025 align:middle line:10%
and you feel like
you're in that world.

00:03:03.025 --> 00:03:05.610 align:middle line:84%
You're smelling what they want
you to smell in that world.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.610 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing what
they want you to see.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.030 align:middle line:10%
And this can be done
wirelessly and remotely,

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.500 align:middle line:10%
not even invasively.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.970 align:middle line:10%
I always study
conspiracy theory.

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.470 align:middle line:10%
And all the conspiracy
theorists are

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.040 align:middle line:10%
saying that this 5G
world is the end game.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.040 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's dangerous.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.790 align:middle line:10%
>>STEWART: It's going
to be the end of us.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.620 align:middle line:10%
And I think there's many ways
of mitigating the harms of 5G.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.390 align:middle line:10%
And also I think that where 5G
is leading us in the conspiracy

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.490 align:middle line:10%
world is really only a few
degrees away from a Utopian

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:33.290 align:middle line:10%
world.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.900 align:middle line:10%
This is actually maybe
a blessing in disguise.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.060 align:middle line:10%
Because if there's
no stopping 5G,

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.110 align:middle line:10%
you can't run into
the mountains anymore.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.410 align:middle line:84%
The world is blanketed
in 5G and surveillance.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.650 align:middle line:10%
So if you can't escape it,
you have to transcend it.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And so this is actually
the perfect opportunity

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.730 align:middle line:90%
for a mass awakening.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, there was
so much viewer response

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.050 align:middle line:90%
to this incredible show.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.490 align:middle line:90%
It was divided 50-50.

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.020 align:middle line:84%
Some people thought 5G, oh
my god, it's all over for us.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.660 align:middle line:84%
Other people said no,
it's great technology.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're going
to pull some emails

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.828 align:middle line:84%
from some of our
viewers, and I'm

00:04:09.828 --> 00:04:11.120 align:middle line:90%
going to read them to you, Ben.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to react
to some of the things

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.390 align:middle line:90%
that they have to say.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Ben, in our program,
some of our viewers

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.070 align:middle line:84%
thought you were calling
artificial intelligence

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.420 align:middle line:90%
your god.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.260 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at
what you exactly said.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.540 align:middle line:10%
>>STEWART: I'm more
curious about what is

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.978 align:middle line:10%
this technology growing to be.

00:04:28.978 --> 00:04:30.770 align:middle line:10%
Because what I think
it is, if we look back

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.840 align:middle line:10%
to Rudolf Steiner,
who was talking

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.550 align:middle line:10%
about electromagnetic
radiation in 1917,

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.640 align:middle line:10%
he was talking about this thing
called the advent of Ahriman,

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.030 align:middle line:10%
which is a god built
off of technology

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.765 align:middle line:10%
and calculating, very cold.

00:04:45.765 --> 00:04:47.390 align:middle line:10%
And I think that's
what we're building.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.110 align:middle line:10%
We're building an AI god
on a biological Earth.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.375 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ben, what did
you mean by all that?

00:04:54.375 --> 00:04:56.000 align:middle line:10%
>>STEWART: Well, I
mean, really, I just

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.550 align:middle line:10%
have to take it
verbatim with that.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.120 align:middle line:10%
What I said after the Rudolf
Steiner part was we're

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.347 align:middle line:10%
building an artificial god
on a biological planet.

00:05:06.347 --> 00:05:08.180 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
exactly what's happening.

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.790 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why I
say that is because you

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.920 align:middle line:90%
know those salamanders?

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.400 align:middle line:84%
We can find salamanders that are
in caves, and many thousands,

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.370 align:middle line:84%
if not millions of years
ago, they had eyes,

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.680 align:middle line:84%
and then they developed
in complete darkness.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.250 align:middle line:84%
They found a way to adapt
to their new environment.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.950 align:middle line:84%
What I'm saying is
now we're pumping out

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.210 align:middle line:90%
these 5G frequencies.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.370 align:middle line:84%
We're pumping out
electromagnetic radiation

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.020 align:middle line:90%
at an incredible rate.

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.220 align:middle line:90%
We can adapt.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying
that I love this.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.040 align:middle line:84%
I am saying that I don't
know what God's plan is.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.510 align:middle line:84%
But when I say an artificial
god on a biological planet,

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.050 align:middle line:84%
nobody would ever call the
Olympians or the Titans the one

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.490 align:middle line:84%
supreme intelligence
in the universe.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.170 align:middle line:84%
They are the individual,
bickering, fighting gods.

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:55.927 align:middle line:90%
There's a big difference there.

00:05:55.927 --> 00:05:58.010 align:middle line:84%
And so the one reason why
I want to point that out

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.880 align:middle line:84%
is because there were some
commenters on the comment

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.830 align:middle line:84%
board from our
last interview that

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.740 align:middle line:84%
said there's no use in even
trying to meditate our way out

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:08.540 align:middle line:90%
of that.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.610 align:middle line:84%
I guarantee you
those people that

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.430 align:middle line:84%
said meditation is not
the solution have maybe

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.020 align:middle line:84%
tried to meditate, but they've
never had an actual meditative

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.820 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.070 align:middle line:84%
Because if you do,
and you realize

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.250 align:middle line:84%
that this is where all
the solutions come from,

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.400 align:middle line:84%
the infinity within
is where god lies,

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.410 align:middle line:84%
and you need to
wake that god up.

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.260 align:middle line:90%
Is God afraid of 5G?

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.570 align:middle line:84%
Is 5G just the one thing
that's outside of God's hands?

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:34.370 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.270 align:middle line:84%
So the thing is we're cutting
our potential off at the knees

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.880 align:middle line:90%
by saying we believe in god.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.940 align:middle line:84%
We know it's all powerful,
but oh my god, 5G

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.650 align:middle line:90%
is going to kill us all.

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:46.740 align:middle line:90%
We need to wake up.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.470 align:middle line:84%
We're a lot more
powerful than that.

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ben, some
of our viewers

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.940 align:middle line:84%
interpreted that
you said that this

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.510 align:middle line:90%
could be the end of the world.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:55.920 align:middle line:90%
That's not what you said.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:56.720 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: No.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And if I said that, it would
be the end of the world

00:06:59.090 --> 00:06:59.990 align:middle line:90%
as we know it.

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And the world is
always changing,

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:06.290 align:middle line:84%
so tomorrow will be
unlike yesterday.

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:08.670 align:middle line:90%
Here's an example I'll give.

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:12.960 align:middle line:84%
A beautiful, little but naive,
innocent child skipping down

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.000 align:middle line:84%
the road, merrily, without
a care in the world,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.500 align:middle line:84%
not realizing any harm
could ever come of him.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.060 align:middle line:84%
Then that child witnesses
a fatal car accident.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.290 align:middle line:90%
Did the world change?

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:24.430 align:middle line:90%
Did reality change?

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:27.660 align:middle line:84%
Or did that child's
perception change?

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.010 align:middle line:90%
Here's my point.

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:32.080 align:middle line:90%
Most of humanity is asleep.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.390 align:middle line:84%
Advancing technology
is the wake-up call.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:38.290 align:middle line:84%
And if we wake up with
only fear in our hearts,

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:41.470 align:middle line:84%
like I saw on the message
board, if we wake up

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:44.710 align:middle line:84%
with only fear in our hearts,
then that's what will manifest.

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:47.170 align:middle line:84%
If we wake up to our
potential, that's

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:48.730 align:middle line:90%
the future I'm moving into.

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.550 align:middle line:84%
That's why I refuse not to
be optimistic about this.

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.760 align:middle line:84%
Because I know I've seen
what humans are capable of.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.830 align:middle line:84%
I know we're more
powerful than this thing

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:58.810 align:middle line:84%
in the external
world, this illusion

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.000 align:middle line:90%
that we're calling the enemy.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of our viewers
writes, Ben, I'm not afraid,

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:07.030 align:middle line:84%
because I'm willing to face it,
especially since it's already

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:10.100 align:middle line:90%
here, and we can't outrun it.

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.660 align:middle line:84%
It's only logical to me
to learn as much as I can

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.910 align:middle line:84%
on how to avoid the
pitfalls and the benefit

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:17.300 align:middle line:90%
from the advantages.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.420 align:middle line:84%
So why would I not
keep an open mind?

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.870 align:middle line:84%
I admire Ben Stewart's
vast knowledge

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.030 align:middle line:90%
and how he doesn't judge it.

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:28.660 align:middle line:84%
So happy to see the possibility
of the Venus Project coming

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:29.560 align:middle line:90%
to life.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.112 align:middle line:84%
Now, what exactly is
the Venus Project?

00:08:32.112 --> 00:08:33.820 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: The Venus
Project-- and that's

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.950 align:middle line:84%
a great example of
what I'm talking about.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:39.280 align:middle line:84%
The Venus Project was the
brainchild of Jacque Fresco.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.169 align:middle line:90%
He's since passed.

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:45.400 align:middle line:84%
He was in the same thought
camp as Barbara Marx Hubbard,

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.190 align:middle line:84%
as Bucky Fuller, a
lot of these futurists

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:52.060 align:middle line:84%
that saw that technology
is not our enemy.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:55.060 align:middle line:84%
Technology can be our
savior, but the thing

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:58.270 align:middle line:84%
is we need to use
technology in the right way,

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:02.410 align:middle line:84%
and we need to make sure it
doesn't end up in few hands.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:04.083 align:middle line:84%
Because the bottom
line is we know

00:09:04.083 --> 00:09:05.500 align:middle line:84%
that there's people
out there that

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.960 align:middle line:84%
want to use
technology or any tool

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.960 align:middle line:84%
at their disposal
to gain more power.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.510 align:middle line:84%
But there are ways, and
we're seeing it now.

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:17.920 align:middle line:84%
Decentralized, open source,
fully accountable technology

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.580 align:middle line:84%
that is more and more
difficult to be taken over

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:23.480 align:middle line:90%
by an elite group.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.750 align:middle line:84%
Is there an elite group
that's using technology

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:27.070 align:middle line:90%
for nefarious purposes?

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:30.490 align:middle line:84%
I can go on for days about those
people and the technologies

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:31.420 align:middle line:90%
that they're using.

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:33.850 align:middle line:84%
But the Venus Project
is showing you

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:36.280 align:middle line:84%
that technology
is not our enemy.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:39.500 align:middle line:84%
You don't see oil rigs pumping
oil and polluting the planet

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:40.300 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.940 align:middle line:84%
It's humans that are
commanding them to do so.

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:46.870 align:middle line:84%
You don't see 4G
or 5G cell towers

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:50.410 align:middle line:84%
pumping out radiations on their
own, assembling themselves.

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:52.400 align:middle line:90%
No, we command it to do so.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.310 align:middle line:90%
So let's not blame technology.

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:55.750 align:middle line:90%
It's ignorance.

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's our refusal to
level the playing field

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:02.500 align:middle line:84%
and see that the new
human that's emerging

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.740 align:middle line:84%
has to do with this fair
and level playing field,

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:09.790 align:middle line:84%
and technology will be there to
support us if we wake up to it

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:10.700 align:middle line:90%
in the right way.

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.160 align:middle line:90%
So that's why I'm optimistic.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.260 align:middle line:84%
We need to call people
to a higher level,

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.640 align:middle line:84%
not scare ourselves
back into the Stone Age.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ben, one of our
"Beyond Belief" viewers

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.820 align:middle line:84%
writes, this technology
is being hoisted on us

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:25.510 align:middle line:84%
without properly researching
its effects on the human body.

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:30.700 align:middle line:84%
The frequencies for 5G interfere
with the human body functions.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.080 align:middle line:84%
And there are a
number of experts

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:36.100 align:middle line:84%
that I think are more expert
on this than the person being

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.680 align:middle line:84%
interviewed now,
which is you, [LAUGHS]

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:42.230 align:middle line:84%
and that this is
not new technology.

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:43.400 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.450 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: I
couldn't agree more.

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And I want to honor that
this person has probably

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.675 align:middle line:90%
done his homework.

00:10:47.675 --> 00:10:48.550 align:middle line:90%
Here's the one thing.

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:50.050 align:middle line:84%
I'll go back to
some of those people

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:51.760 align:middle line:90%
that I was talking about before.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.120 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Arthur Firstenberg,
Dr. Thomas Cowan,

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.660 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Joseph Mercola,
Dr. Martin Paul.

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:02.020 align:middle line:84%
What's the similarity between
all these people here?

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:03.280 align:middle line:90%
They're scientists.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.390 align:middle line:90%
They're analytical.

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:05.800 align:middle line:90%
They're not mystics.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.320 align:middle line:84%
They probably have
researched consciousness,

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:13.130 align:middle line:84%
and they probably know that
we have great human potential.

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:16.600 align:middle line:84%
But when he says there's experts
that can speak better than I

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.310 align:middle line:90%
could, I couldn't agree more.

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:20.440 align:middle line:84%
I am not the most
well spoken on this.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:24.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm here taking my free time
to speak to the audience

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:28.660 align:middle line:84%
to show that there is a way
in between the ultra scared

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:31.870 align:middle line:84%
and the ultra just give me
whatever, I want to stay asleep

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:33.830 align:middle line:84%
to it, just give me my
technology, my bread,

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:35.230 align:middle line:90%
and my circuses.

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:39.580 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm here to do is to do
what I see nobody else doing.

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:40.630 align:middle line:90%
Even David Icke.

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:41.440 align:middle line:90%
I love him.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.960 align:middle line:84%
Right here on Gaia,
"Escaping the Matrix."

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.450 align:middle line:84%
You watch him talking
about all this technology,

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:48.190 align:middle line:90%
it can be very scary.

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:51.610 align:middle line:84%
But there's one thing that I
see missing from these experts

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:53.080 align:middle line:90%
across the board.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:57.730 align:middle line:84%
None of them are merging
the power of human potential

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:00.070 align:middle line:84%
with what's happening
on the planet right now.

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:01.900 align:middle line:84%
They're either in one
camp or the other.

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:05.410 align:middle line:84%
And some of them
hop from one side

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:07.630 align:middle line:90%
to the other in the same breath.

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:09.320 align:middle line:90%
We need some more examples.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:12.350 align:middle line:84%
We need the correct vision
of where we can go with this.

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:14.500 align:middle line:84%
I refuse to stay in
the fearful side,

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.560 align:middle line:84%
and I refuse to just say, it's
all going to be hunky dory,

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.150 align:middle line:90%
we don't need to focus on it.

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:21.070 align:middle line:90%
This requires our action.

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:22.690 align:middle line:90%
This requires our attention.

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:24.670 align:middle line:84%
But it does not
require our fear.

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:27.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Investigative
mythologist William Henry

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:29.780 align:middle line:84%
has talked about this
divide that could

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.670 align:middle line:90%
happen from the new frequency.

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:36.030 align:middle line:84%
He was at Conscious Life
Expo, and he had this to say.

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:37.710 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAM HENRY: At
some future point,

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:41.760 align:middle line:10%
humanity will be
changed in a moment,

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:45.090 align:middle line:10%
in a twinkling of an
eye, at the last trump.

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:46.740 align:middle line:10%
For the trump will
sound, the dead

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:50.320 align:middle line:10%
will be raised imperishable,
and we shall be changed.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:53.550 align:middle line:10%
This is a future moment that
they're describing here,

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:56.190 align:middle line:10%
when a tone, a wave,
a reverberation--

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:57.960 align:middle line:10%
that's what the
word trump means--

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:01.710 align:middle line:10%
comes over the planet and
begins to transform us.

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:06.360 align:middle line:10%
Some will readily adapt to this
new frequency or vibration,

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.730 align:middle line:10%
others will cower
in fear over it.

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:10.470 align:middle line:10%
They won't be able to handle it.

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:12.700 align:middle line:10%
Many believe we're
in that moment now.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.870 align:middle line:10%
And so Paul is warning
about this coming battle

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:17.413 align:middle line:10%
back in 62 AD.

00:13:17.413 --> 00:13:19.830 align:middle line:10%
And he says, there's only one
way you can get around this.

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:23.400 align:middle line:10%
He says, you've got to put
on the full armor of God.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.170 align:middle line:10%
And he describes
this as including

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:28.740 align:middle line:10%
the crown of salvation, the
breastplate of righteousness,

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:30.750 align:middle line:10%
the belt of truth,
the sandals of peace,

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:33.900 align:middle line:10%
and creating a shield of
faith around your body.

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:37.950 align:middle line:10%
What he's talking about is
augmenting the human body.

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:40.590 align:middle line:10%
He's talking about
putting on armor

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:45.850 align:middle line:10%
to combat a cosmic entity,
these Archons, these powers.

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:47.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think of that, Ben?

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:48.850 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: I love William Henry.

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:49.180 align:middle line:90%
And I think he--

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:49.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's a great guy.

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:50.140 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yes.

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:51.370 align:middle line:90%
I think he puts it perfectly.

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:55.000 align:middle line:84%
I think what he's saying is we
need to augment the human body.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And in 62 AD, they were
talking about a trump, right?

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:02.140 align:middle line:84%
This reverberation, a
sound, a new frequency

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:06.130 align:middle line:84%
that half the population will
be scared of, the other half

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:07.810 align:middle line:90%
will accept readily.

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:09.070 align:middle line:90%
I think it's quite obvious.

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:11.290 align:middle line:84%
If you just look at the
thumbs up and thumbs down

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:13.900 align:middle line:84%
of our last interview,
it's pretty divided down

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:17.260 align:middle line:84%
the middle of people who are
scared and others who are OK,

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:18.530 align:middle line:90%
bring it on.

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:20.380 align:middle line:84%
So here's what I love
about what he says.

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:24.880 align:middle line:84%
This armor that he's talking
about is spiritual in nature.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.610 align:middle line:84%
It's not something that we
need from the outside world.

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:31.420 align:middle line:84%
It's not like we're going to
pray to technology engineers

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.610 align:middle line:84%
to come up with some
Faraday clothing that's

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:35.290 align:middle line:90%
going to protect us from it.

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:39.190 align:middle line:84%
Because that's us
giving our power away.

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:40.960 align:middle line:84%
Mind you, what we're
talking about here

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.620 align:middle line:90%
is not just physical.

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:43.420 align:middle line:90%
It's magical.

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'll get into this
a little bit more.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.550 align:middle line:84%
But we need to put our
spirituality back on.

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:50.560 align:middle line:84%
That's where I think
he's going with this.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.030 align:middle line:90%
He talks about yoga.

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:55.150 align:middle line:84%
He talks about clearing
out our mind of the fear.

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And he talks about doing
the righteous work.

00:14:58.420 --> 00:14:59.870 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't agree more.

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:01.750 align:middle line:84%
The real work that
needs to be done

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:04.120 align:middle line:84%
is all these people that are
blaming the outside world

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.840 align:middle line:84%
for their inner
state of affairs,

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.150 align:middle line:84%
we need to do our
spiritual work at home.

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:09.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ben, one of
our viewers writes,

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:12.250 align:middle line:90%
what do we do to stop it?

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:15.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm not anti-technology
by any means.

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:17.440 align:middle line:84%
But he is literally
saying that we

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.510 align:middle line:90%
have no choice in the matter.

00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:23.200 align:middle line:84%
What about those who want to
live in unison with nature,

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.030 align:middle line:90%
away from technology?

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:26.930 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to a tape.

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:28.440 align:middle line:10%
>>STEWART: There's
no outrunning 5G.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.710 align:middle line:10%
We're entering this
world, no matter what.

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:33.200 align:middle line:10%
It's already happening
in China right now.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.350 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh, in a big way.

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:36.470 align:middle line:10%
As a matter of
fact, Wuhan, China,

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:40.820 align:middle line:10%
where they had problems, it's
fully 5G compatible, isn't it?

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:42.410 align:middle line:10%
>>STEWART: Fully blanketed city.

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:44.720 align:middle line:10%
It's the first fully
blanketed 5G city.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.540 align:middle line:10%
And what that means is so
that phone that you have?

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:48.770 align:middle line:10%
That's the platform.

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:52.070 align:middle line:10%
And in the 4G world, you
can opt out by, let's say,

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:55.040 align:middle line:10%
getting rid of your phone,
running off into the mountains,

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.690 align:middle line:10%
and hiding, right?

00:15:56.690 --> 00:16:00.425 align:middle line:10%
In a 5G world,
you can't opt out.

00:16:00.425 --> 00:16:01.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So when
the viewer talks

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:04.890 align:middle line:84%
about living in unison with
nature, is that possible?

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:06.390 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: It's
absolutely possible.

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:06.710 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:08.543 align:middle line:84%
And I want to touch
base on one other thing,

00:16:08.543 --> 00:16:11.800 align:middle line:84%
because I think this is
happening quite a bit.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.650 align:middle line:84%
She said, I'm
literally saying we

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:14.920 align:middle line:90%
have no choice in the matter.

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.790 align:middle line:84%
But if you actually look at
what I literally said there,

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:21.363 align:middle line:84%
I said, there's no outrunning
5G, because it's already here.

00:16:21.363 --> 00:16:22.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:23.863 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: There's
a difference there.

00:16:23.863 --> 00:16:25.240 align:middle line:90%
Everything is choice.

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:26.190 align:middle line:90%
Everything is choice.

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:27.810 align:middle line:90%
And so is your mindset.

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:30.880 align:middle line:84%
So is the emotion that you
allow to take over your body.

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.070 align:middle line:90%
That's a choice.

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:34.650 align:middle line:84%
My choice is to come
here not in fear,

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:38.250 align:middle line:84%
but to give the audience
that very subtle nuance where

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:40.590 align:middle line:84%
I talk about the
problems, but I refuse

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:42.210 align:middle line:84%
to go buggy-eyed
like Chicken Little,

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:43.770 align:middle line:90%
saying the sky is falling.

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:45.450 align:middle line:84%
That's not what's
happening here.

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:47.910 align:middle line:84%
Again, I still
see trees outside.

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:50.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm allowed to breathe the air.

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:52.110 align:middle line:90%
How do we stop it, she asks?

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:54.600 align:middle line:84%
We stop it by
stopping what we are

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.900 align:middle line:84%
doing to feed the beast
that's growing around us.

00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:00.210 align:middle line:84%
How do we live in
harmony with nature?

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:02.040 align:middle line:84%
For one, you need
to be grateful.

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.680 align:middle line:84%
One thing I see that is lacking
from a lot of the people

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:08.579 align:middle line:84%
that I saw in the comments is
gratitude for what we do have,

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:11.609 align:middle line:84%
and it's hyper-focused on all
the problems that we can see,

00:17:11.609 --> 00:17:14.849 align:middle line:84%
but it's not focusing on the
fact that we want our phones.

00:17:14.849 --> 00:17:15.839 align:middle line:90%
We want to connect.

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:17.349 align:middle line:90%
We want to FaceTime with people.

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:20.190 align:middle line:84%
We want what it's
offering us, we just

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:22.079 align:middle line:84%
don't want any of
the problems from it.

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:25.230 align:middle line:84%
So that very narrow line
that we have to walk,

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:28.930 align:middle line:84%
if you want to walk in unison
with nature, it's still here.

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:29.730 align:middle line:90%
Do it.

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:30.510 align:middle line:90%
Go outside.

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:31.310 align:middle line:90%
Breathe.

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:32.520 align:middle line:90%
Stand on the ground.

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:33.420 align:middle line:90%
Meditate.

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:36.660 align:middle line:84%
Realize that nature is not
just in the outside world.

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:38.937 align:middle line:90%
We are a fractal of nature.

00:17:38.937 --> 00:17:40.770 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't come
into contact with that,

00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:42.870 align:middle line:84%
if we don't wake
up to our power,

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:46.170 align:middle line:84%
meaning realizing that
we are what nature--

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:49.770 align:middle line:84%
we are the gift that
nature has brought about,

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:51.300 align:middle line:84%
then you'll go back
through history,

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.070 align:middle line:84%
and you'll see that there
have been extinction events.

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:55.080 align:middle line:84%
There have been species
that have been wiped off

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.550 align:middle line:90%
the face of the Earth.

00:17:56.550 --> 00:18:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And because we humans didn't
create that, we just say,

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:02.268 align:middle line:90%
that's the natural way about it.

00:18:02.268 --> 00:18:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And we have no
problem setting people

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:06.510 align:middle line:84%
with pacemakers or
bolts and screws

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:07.950 align:middle line:90%
to hold their spine together.

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:10.290 align:middle line:84%
We have no problems with
people wearing glasses.

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:12.360 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes
to electromagnetics,

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.730 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden,
this is anti-nature?

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:17.220 align:middle line:84%
I really think we need
to wake up to the nuances

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:19.410 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking about
and that we're calling in.

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:21.540 align:middle line:84%
How do we live in
harmony with nature?

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:24.330 align:middle line:84%
I do it by being
grateful for what I have.

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:27.410 align:middle line:84%
God didn't give me a memo saying
what to expect in the world.

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:29.100 align:middle line:90%
I could die tomorrow.

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:31.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm grateful for everything
that I have right now.

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.530 align:middle line:84%
I would say to this audience
member, be grateful.

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:35.340 align:middle line:90%
Harness that.

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:37.500 align:middle line:90%
That's the best gift of nature.

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ben, "Beyond
Belief" is seen worldwide.

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And we had one of our
viewers in Africa write us,

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:46.560 align:middle line:84%
"I live in Africa, so I hope it
will be a good while before 5G

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:47.670 align:middle line:90%
comes here.

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:50.880 align:middle line:84%
And the government knows that
phones will be too expensive

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.860 align:middle line:84%
for the average person
here to buy anyway,

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:55.275 align:middle line:84%
so let's hope it
stays that way."

00:18:55.275 --> 00:18:59.070 align:middle line:84%
Ben, is 5G happening only
in the big player countries,

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:02.970 align:middle line:84%
like the US or China, or
is it happening worldwide?

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:06.000 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: You know,
specifically in Africa, China

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.450 align:middle line:84%
and the US are in a race
to retrofit all of Africa

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:12.150 align:middle line:84%
from top to bottom
with 5G technology.

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:14.200 align:middle line:90%
You have the fangs and the bats.

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:18.870 align:middle line:84%
So the fangs is
Facebook, Amazon,

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:24.270 align:middle line:84%
I think that's Netflix,
Google, and then over in China,

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:27.570 align:middle line:84%
you have Baidu,
Alibaba, and Tencent.

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:30.630 align:middle line:84%
All these companies are
retrofitting 5G technology all

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:32.040 align:middle line:90%
over Africa.

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.878 align:middle line:84%
There are places where
it's hard to get,

00:19:33.878 --> 00:19:36.420 align:middle line:84%
but when he's saying that most
people don't have enough money

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:41.340 align:middle line:84%
to buy phones, Samsung is
giving phones away in Africa

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:43.600 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that their
technology proliferates

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:44.400 align:middle line:90%
throughout it.

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:46.463 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: And here's the thing.

00:19:46.463 --> 00:19:47.910 align:middle line:10%
When we think 5G,
we keep thinking

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:50.790 align:middle line:10%
of our old technology,
our tablets, our devices,

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:51.900 align:middle line:10%
our computers.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.640 align:middle line:10%
I want people to
start taking a look

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:58.950 align:middle line:10%
at what's called genetic
drive or gene drive extinction

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:00.180 align:middle line:10%
technology.

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And the Bill and Melinda
Gates Foundation,

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:05.250 align:middle line:84%
a lot of new higher
tech companies,

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:09.000 align:middle line:84%
are pushing out this,
specifically in Africa,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.630 align:middle line:90%
to take away malaria.

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:11.430 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:14.790 align:middle line:84%
So they're coming out with
this gene extinction technology

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:18.060 align:middle line:84%
that's going to make a
certain mosquito or maybe

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:20.320 align:middle line:90%
all mosquitoes die.

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:21.570 align:middle line:90%
They're not able to reproduce.

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:22.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe.

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:23.460 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:23.940 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Maybe--

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:25.898 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But if it
backfires, we're up a creek.

00:20:25.898 --> 00:20:28.650 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well, here's
what I'm curious about

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:31.440 align:middle line:84%
and where I think the
worry could come in.

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.090 align:middle line:84%
If you're
experimenting how do we

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:35.460 align:middle line:84%
delete a gene off the
face of the Earth,

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:36.930 align:middle line:90%
this is how you experiment.

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:40.150 align:middle line:84%
You start first on
the host of malaria.

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:41.550 align:middle line:90%
Malaria is a parasite.

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:42.725 align:middle line:90%
Mosquitoes are the hosts.

00:20:42.725 --> 00:20:43.600 align:middle line:90%
So what are we doing?

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.480 align:middle line:90%
We're wiping out the host.

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.720 align:middle line:90%
What else can you do?

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will it
find another host?

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.430 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: That's one concern.

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And actually, that was put forth
to the Bill and Melinda Gates

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:54.570 align:middle line:90%
Foundation.

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:57.040 align:middle line:84%
Wait a minute, what if malaria
just finds another host.

00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:00.690 align:middle line:84%
Another thing is you
experiment, and you figure out

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:02.040 align:middle line:90%
how to do it on mosquitoes.

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.710 align:middle line:84%
We already know we've
mapped the human genome.

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:07.800 align:middle line:84%
Can you just take this
technology and place it there?

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.020 align:middle line:84%
So I want this person
to very much so start

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:14.970 align:middle line:84%
spreading the word about gene
drive extinction technology

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:16.590 align:middle line:90%
and where technology is headed.

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:19.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying
technology is all peachy.

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:20.530 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of work to do.

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:21.760 align:middle line:90%
We need to wake up.

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And here's why I'm grateful
for what's happening.

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:28.200 align:middle line:84%
There's no time to
stay asleep anymore.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:31.520 align:middle line:84%
There's no time to keep
ignoring our potential.

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:33.180 align:middle line:90%
We need directed action now.

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:35.730 align:middle line:90%
We need to gather our tribe now.

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:37.560 align:middle line:84%
People like Foster
and Kimberly Gamble

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:39.150 align:middle line:84%
who just made the
"Thrive" movie,

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:40.860 align:middle line:84%
we need to connect
with people like that,

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:43.770 align:middle line:84%
join forces with good
people in high places, which

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:46.470 align:middle line:90%
there are many sleeping giants.

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:47.670 align:middle line:90%
We need to wake them up.

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:49.380 align:middle line:90%
And we need to do it with art.

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:52.860 align:middle line:84%
We need to do it with
uplifting and inspiring news.

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:55.290 align:middle line:84%
We need to do it with
the very technology,

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:58.260 align:middle line:84%
like 5G, that we've
built, we paid for,

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:00.520 align:middle line:84%
and we allowed to
come into existence.

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.730 align:middle line:84%
We need to hijack
the technology,

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:04.350 align:middle line:90%
not cower in fear over it.

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:05.160 align:middle line:90%
It's here.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:05.960 align:middle line:90%
Use it.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.470 align:middle line:90%
Do something good with it.

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:10.163 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
Internet of Things?

00:22:10.163 --> 00:22:12.330 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: The Internet of
Things is the smart grid.

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:16.140 align:middle line:84%
And I would implore everybody
to go to David Icke's show

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:18.570 align:middle line:90%
on Gaia, "Escaping the Matrix."

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And he's talking
about the smart grid.

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:22.518 align:middle line:90%
So everything's becoming smart.

00:22:22.518 --> 00:22:24.810 align:middle line:84%
It's not just your phones,
your tablets, your computers

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:25.610 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:28.110 align:middle line:84%
Your car, your toaster,
your refrigerator,

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:30.780 align:middle line:84%
eventually, it'll be your
glasses, and then an ocular

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:33.390 align:middle line:90%
implant, a cochlear implant.

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:35.850 align:middle line:84%
There's already
smart pacemakers that

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:39.390 align:middle line:84%
are testifying against the
people whose bodies they're in.

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:41.370 align:middle line:84%
There was a guy in
Youngstown, Ohio,

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:45.330 align:middle line:84%
that he set a fire
himself, and then

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:46.920 align:middle line:84%
the authorities that
came, they said,

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.110 align:middle line:84%
this looks like the fire
was set in many places,

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:51.120 align:middle line:84%
but he's not
testifying, so let's

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:53.130 align:middle line:84%
go to the data company
that harvests data

00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:54.330 align:middle line:90%
from his pacemaker.

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And they were able to use that
to discern that this person set

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:00.000 align:middle line:90%
fire to his own house.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.100 align:middle line:84%
So we're living in
a new world now.

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:04.470 align:middle line:84%
And basically, the
Internet of Things

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:07.140 align:middle line:84%
is all of your devices
talking to one another

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:10.000 align:middle line:84%
without humans having
to proliferate the data.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.860 align:middle line:84%
So this is the dawn of how
information arrives at AI,

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:17.820 align:middle line:84%
and AI can get more intelligence
without human interference.

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:20.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to thank all
our viewers for writing in.

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:23.265 align:middle line:84%
And we've had our
questions for Ben, there.

00:23:23.265 --> 00:23:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to talk with him
a little bit about some of this.

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:27.750 align:middle line:90%
What is nano dust, anyway?

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:28.785 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:23:28.785 --> 00:23:31.650 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Nano dust
and nanotechnology, this

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:35.040 align:middle line:84%
is something that many people
believe are in chem trails.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of people that
say chem trails don't exist.

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:38.850 align:middle line:90%
They're just contrails.

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And you can tell there's a
distinction between them.

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:45.930 align:middle line:84%
But nanotechnology is
technology that is so small

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:47.380 align:middle line:90%
that you could breathe it in.

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.200 align:middle line:90%
It could be in your food supply.

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.765 align:middle line:84%
And in some way, it could
be injected into your body

00:23:51.765 --> 00:23:52.565 align:middle line:90%
somehow.

00:23:52.565 --> 00:23:53.365 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Somehow.

00:23:53.365 --> 00:23:56.190 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: It can replicate
itself like cells.

00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And you'll hear Barbara Marx
Hubbard on the Legacy series

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:02.350 align:middle line:84%
on Gaia saying this is
also a way of the future.

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:04.780 align:middle line:84%
But in the wrong
hands, what can it do?

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:06.390 align:middle line:90%
It can delete a gene.

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:08.520 align:middle line:84%
It can make you think
certain thoughts.

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:11.340 align:middle line:84%
There's also deep brain
machine interfaces

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:15.092 align:middle line:84%
that can be injected into
your brain to, in a sense,

00:24:15.092 --> 00:24:17.550 align:middle line:84%
cause you to have thoughts that
you wouldn't have naturally

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:18.350 align:middle line:90%
had.

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And I believe this is
actually a real threat.

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:22.620 align:middle line:90%
I'll leave you with this.

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:25.320 align:middle line:84%
Microsoft put out
an article saying

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:28.140 align:middle line:84%
that they have a way of
mining cryptocurrency

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:32.280 align:middle line:84%
directly from your cells,
from the infrared emissions

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:36.360 align:middle line:84%
from your cells, to use as
energy to mine cryptocurrency.

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.160 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
are like, they

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.982 align:middle line:84%
don't say what
technology that is

00:24:39.982 --> 00:24:42.330 align:middle line:84%
that actually mines
that infrared energy

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:43.320 align:middle line:90%
from your cells.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:44.848 align:middle line:90%
I believe it's nano dust.

00:24:44.848 --> 00:24:46.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you brought
up Barbara Marx Hubbard.

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:50.060 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at
what she has to say.

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:53.690 align:middle line:10%
BARBARA MARX HUBBARD: One of my
favorite futurists and authors

00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:55.890 align:middle line:10%
is Jerry Glenn.

00:24:55.890 --> 00:25:01.400 align:middle line:10%
And in a book he wrote
on conscious technology,

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:05.060 align:middle line:10%
he identified a pathway forward.

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:10.370 align:middle line:10%
And he said, if the mystic, a
spiritually motivated person,

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:14.120 align:middle line:10%
joins forces with
a technocrat who

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:19.230 align:middle line:10%
understands the enormity of
the powers given to humanity.

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:24.470 align:middle line:10%
That combination of the mystical
and the technical capabilities

00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:26.960 align:middle line:10%
will lead to a new civilization.

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:31.580 align:middle line:10%
And he called it a conscious
technocratic civilization.

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:35.120 align:middle line:10%
And I'm calling it even
deeper, a new species.

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:37.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A new species.

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:38.990 align:middle line:90%
Is that conceivable?

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:39.990 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: I believe so.

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:41.900 align:middle line:84%
I believe we've done
it throughout history.

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:45.440 align:middle line:84%
I kind of think that's actually
the magic of planet Earth,

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.490 align:middle line:90%
of Pachamama.

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:49.670 align:middle line:84%
It's always coming up
with newness, novelty,

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:52.310 align:middle line:84%
ways of growing and
learning, shedding the old,

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:54.320 align:middle line:90%
so we can learn from the new.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.840 align:middle line:84%
You see, the thing is a lot
of people love Barbara Marx

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:59.540 align:middle line:84%
Hubbard and the way that she
brings her information there.

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:00.620 align:middle line:90%
But if you watch that--

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:01.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She's got a
soothing part of her, right?

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:03.762 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: She's got
a great way about her.

00:26:03.762 --> 00:26:06.240 align:middle line:84%
But if you watch that
entire series, she's saying,

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.390 align:middle line:90%
I can't wait for nanotechnology.

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:11.360 align:middle line:84%
I can't wait for
advancing technology.

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:14.820 align:middle line:84%
This whole idea about AI merging
with human consciousness,

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:16.440 align:middle line:90%
this is the way of the future.

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:19.160 align:middle line:84%
So I'm wondering where
the audience that

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:22.580 align:middle line:84%
were commenting on our
last interview is on that.

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:25.880 align:middle line:84%
I implore them, go watch
the way she speaks about it.

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:29.660 align:middle line:84%
Because she could probably do
it better justice than I could,

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:32.960 align:middle line:84%
but she's saying right
there, if you listen to that,

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.630 align:middle line:84%
David Icke might say,
well, that's transhumanism.

00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:37.160 align:middle line:90%
That's being a cyborg.

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:40.590 align:middle line:84%
That's blazing into a future
that we have no control over.

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:43.790 align:middle line:84%
She says in that very
series there have always

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:45.020 align:middle line:90%
been extinction events.

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:47.083 align:middle line:84%
There's always the
passing of old species

00:26:47.083 --> 00:26:48.500 align:middle line:84%
and the coming of
the new species.

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:49.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there
will be more to come.

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:50.750 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: There's
always more to come.

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And this is because we can't
conceive of God's plan.

00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:57.200 align:middle line:84%
We simply step into it with
either gratitude or fear.

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the fourth
industrial revolution,

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.640 align:middle line:84%
and what does that
have to do with this?

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.807 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Basically, there's
industrial revolutions

00:27:03.807 --> 00:27:04.970 align:middle line:90%
that interrupt the economy.

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:05.990 align:middle line:90%
It interrupts civilization.

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:07.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In a good
way or a bad way?

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:10.280 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well, I--
again, I don't know if good

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:12.950 align:middle line:84%
and bad can really be placed
on it, because a lot of people

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:15.500 align:middle line:84%
say bad, and then a
lot of people say good.

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:18.890 align:middle line:84%
So technology is
constantly changing the way

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:20.600 align:middle line:90%
we interface with reality.

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:23.750 align:middle line:84%
It's been doing that for
quite a long time now.

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:25.700 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
ways you can look at it

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:28.610 align:middle line:84%
and say it's not doing
well for the planet.

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And there's other people
saying that it's not

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:32.390 align:middle line:84%
the technology that's
doing that, it's

00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:35.780 align:middle line:84%
humans' use of the
tools called technology.

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:38.630 align:middle line:84%
Fourth industrial revolution
is being called fourth

00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:42.860 align:middle line:84%
by Klaus Schwab and the
World Economic Forum as a way

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:44.630 align:middle line:90%
to usher in technology.

00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And there's many
different guises

00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:49.490 align:middle line:84%
under which we will usher in
this technology for people

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:51.378 align:middle line:84%
who want it and for
others who don't want it.

00:27:51.378 --> 00:27:52.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She's pretty dramatic.

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:55.370 align:middle line:84%
But she does it in a
soothing way, doesn't she?

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:56.490 align:middle line:90%
The way she talks?

00:27:56.490 --> 00:27:57.290 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yes.

00:27:57.290 --> 00:27:59.030 align:middle line:84%
Barbara Marx Hubbard
is incredible.

00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:02.870 align:middle line:84%
She has a way about her that
shows you that she's not

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:04.760 align:middle line:90%
afraid of the future to come.

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:06.240 align:middle line:90%
She talks about the issues.

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:07.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you?

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:07.940 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Am I afraid?

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:08.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:09.740 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: I don't
use fear as a tool.

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:10.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't.

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:10.970 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Why?

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've
noticed that in you.

00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:12.850 align:middle line:90%
You don't.

00:28:12.850 --> 00:28:14.930 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: What
would that lead to,

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:17.420 align:middle line:84%
if I decided to come here
buggy-eyed and telling

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:18.410 align:middle line:90%
everybody we're doomed?

00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:19.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Panic.

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:19.960 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right.

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is is I know
where manifestation comes from.

00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:24.410 align:middle line:90%
And it's not out here, George.

00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:25.653 align:middle line:90%
It's always in here.

00:28:25.653 --> 00:28:26.570 align:middle line:90%
So I'll tell you what.

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:30.140 align:middle line:84%
I only ever-- nobody,
nothing is allowed

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:33.320 align:middle line:84%
to make me go into panic
mode except for myself,

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:34.610 align:middle line:90%
and I refuse to do it.

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:36.560 align:middle line:84%
Because that's not
the way we manifest.

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:39.200 align:middle line:84%
I have love for the audience,
even the ones that I believe

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.210 align:middle line:90%
are misled and confused.

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:42.990 align:middle line:90%
This is the way forward.

00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:44.210 align:middle line:90%
This is the way forward.

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:47.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you had a chance to
talk to George Orwell, author

00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:52.280 align:middle line:84%
of "1984," today, what would
you be talking to him about?

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:55.490 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: I'd say your
predictions were scarily

00:28:55.490 --> 00:29:00.590 align:middle line:84%
accurate, and I would say
the only thing you missed out

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:05.870 align:middle line:84%
on was the ending, where
human potential wins out.

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:07.797 align:middle line:84%
Why would you create
anything other than that?

00:29:07.797 --> 00:29:10.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He thought it was
doom and gloom for all of us,

00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:10.760 align:middle line:90%
didn't he?

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:11.560 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yes.

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:12.860 align:middle line:90%
So there's Orwellian.

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:14.300 align:middle line:90%
There's 1984.

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:15.557 align:middle line:90%
There's a brave new world.

00:29:15.557 --> 00:29:17.390 align:middle line:84%
There's all these--
there's a bunch of books

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:20.732 align:middle line:84%
that talk about a doom and
gloom dystopian future.

00:29:20.732 --> 00:29:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
a few of them that

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:25.160 align:middle line:84%
are saying how this is
what a Utopian future is.

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:29.090 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorites is talking
about somebody who goes,

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:30.920 align:middle line:84%
I think, a thousand
years in the future.

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:33.990 align:middle line:84%
He sees where
technology could go,

00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:36.690 align:middle line:84%
and then he can't live
in that Utopian future.

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:37.710 align:middle line:90%
He has to be sent back.

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:38.510 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:41.810 align:middle line:84%
Because he needs to tell the
new story to the people who

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:43.160 align:middle line:90%
don't believe it yet.

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:44.990 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not saying
I'm from the future.

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:46.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying any
of those things.

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:47.600 align:middle line:90%
Here's what I'm saying.

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:52.010 align:middle line:84%
I know what creates goodness in
the future, and it's not fear.

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:55.520 align:middle line:84%
I know what creates a
healthy path forward.

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's by illustrating
the problems.

00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:58.710 align:middle line:90%
It's not by ignoring it.

00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:01.340 align:middle line:84%
I know too many people that are
just new agey, and they say,

00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:03.240 align:middle line:84%
swim in love and light,
and you'll be fine.

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.040 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:06.260 align:middle line:84%
You have to-- if you're in
the middle of the desert,

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:07.635 align:middle line:84%
and you don't know
where you are,

00:30:07.635 --> 00:30:09.260 align:middle line:84%
but you know where
you want to go,

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:12.410 align:middle line:84%
you need an accurate reference
point to know where you're at.

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:14.930 align:middle line:84%
We are in a point
in time in history

00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:16.700 align:middle line:90%
where all hands on deck.

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:18.170 align:middle line:90%
Could this go south?

00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:20.390 align:middle line:84%
It's going south
in many new ways.

00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And we can get into
many of those new ways

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:26.180 align:middle line:84%
today, with dark winter
and the great reset,

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:29.120 align:middle line:84%
but I refuse to believe
that that word, magic,

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:32.870 align:middle line:84%
by a form of elite
sorcerers at the top

00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:35.840 align:middle line:84%
that knows that words
are what hypnotize us,

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:39.140 align:middle line:84%
and they know that they need
our consent for it to go down

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:41.870 align:middle line:84%
that path, I refuse to
fall into that trap.

00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:42.830 align:middle line:90%
We win.

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:44.030 align:middle line:90%
We win this.

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:46.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ben, we're in really
strange times these days.

00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:48.980 align:middle line:84%
What did you mean
by dark winter?

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:51.930 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: If you listen to
Joe Biden, he said it twice.

00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:54.230 align:middle line:84%
He was like, we're about
to go into a dark winter,

00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:55.470 align:middle line:90%
a dark winter.

00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And he said it twice
for effect, but also

00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:59.900 align:middle line:84%
because this is the
basis of word magic.

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And I don't use
that term lightly.

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:04.170 align:middle line:84%
This is magic, what
we're dealing with here.

00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And as much as we try and
say, oh, it's just science,

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:08.090 align:middle line:90%
listen to Arthur C. Clarke.

00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:10.820 align:middle line:84%
Any sufficiently
advanced technology

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:12.920 align:middle line:90%
is indistinguishable from magic.

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:14.850 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
dealing with here.

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:19.220 align:middle line:84%
So not only does he say
that, but I think Dr. Price,

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:21.620 align:middle line:84%
I think is his name-- he's a
vaccine expert that was just

00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:23.210 align:middle line:90%
ousted out of office--

00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:26.300 align:middle line:84%
is saying we're about to enter
the darkest winter in history.

00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:28.550 align:middle line:84%
News anchors galore
from around the world

00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:30.620 align:middle line:84%
are saying we are in
for the darkest winter.

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:31.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, they
love saying that, too.

00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:33.200 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: They love saying
it because you know what?

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.150 align:middle line:84%
Most news today
is all about what

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:37.070 align:middle line:84%
Barbara Marx Hubbard
calls break down

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:38.690 align:middle line:90%
news, not breakthrough news.

00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:41.990 align:middle line:84%
So if you actually look
at what dark winter is,

00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:45.060 align:middle line:84%
it's a form of word magic,
and people are falling for it.

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:48.500 align:middle line:84%
So I'm here to say it's not
going to be a dark winter.

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:50.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this
the great reset?

00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: I think great
resets happen every single time

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:55.820 align:middle line:84%
technology advances
to a point where

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:59.090 align:middle line:84%
we realize our old models
of economy and civilization

00:31:59.090 --> 00:32:00.750 align:middle line:90%
don't work anymore.

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:05.120 align:middle line:84%
So the great reset, what is the
impetus for the great reset?

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:06.080 align:middle line:90%
Pandemic.

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:08.160 align:middle line:90%
Right now, it's pandemic.

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:09.770 align:middle line:84%
What happens when
there's pandemic?

00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:11.600 align:middle line:90%
Well, we need this control grid.

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:14.930 align:middle line:84%
We need to use technology
to track everybody.

00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:16.610 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember
after September 11,

00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:19.670 align:middle line:84%
a month later, there was the
Patriot Act, over a thousand

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:20.720 align:middle line:90%
pages, perfectly written?

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:20.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And that color scheme they
used to tell us about terror,

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:25.940 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't stand that, Ben.

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:29.450 align:middle line:84%
Condition green,
condition red, look out.

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:31.200 align:middle line:84%
Scared the living
daylights out of people.

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.000 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
look at it, there's

00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:36.830 align:middle line:84%
no way they wrote those thousand
words in one month perfectly

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:38.483 align:middle line:90%
and then passed it.

00:32:38.483 --> 00:32:39.650 align:middle line:90%
They wouldn't have had that.

00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:40.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were
working on that.

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:42.060 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: They were working
on it for a long time.

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:43.518 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is
is if you actually

00:32:43.518 --> 00:32:46.400 align:middle line:84%
look at what
happened October 18,

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:50.900 align:middle line:84%
2019, two months before
pandemic, there was

00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:52.970 align:middle line:90%
this thing called Event 201.

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:58.100 align:middle line:84%
Everyone across the board,
all these global agencies,

00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:00.170 align:middle line:84%
came together and
said, what would

00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:02.750 align:middle line:84%
happen if a coronavirus
outbreak happened,

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:04.578 align:middle line:90%
and they went through--

00:33:04.578 --> 00:33:05.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they predicted it.

00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:07.550 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Two months
before it actually happened.

00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:08.630 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen?

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:10.850 align:middle line:90%
To me, it's not by mistake.

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:13.730 align:middle line:84%
This is called the fine print
of a spiritual contract.

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:15.560 align:middle line:90%
They need to tell us.

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.570 align:middle line:84%
That way, when they
say, well, guys,

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:18.740 align:middle line:90%
do you want the technology?

00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:19.910 align:middle line:90%
Problem, reaction, solution.

00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:22.352 align:middle line:84%
Like David Icke says,
you create the problem,

00:33:22.352 --> 00:33:23.810 align:middle line:84%
and then you have
a solution that's

00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:25.080 align:middle line:90%
perfect for that problem.

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:25.880 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:29.120 align:middle line:84%
Because the problem itself
was invented specifically

00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:31.520 align:middle line:84%
for this solution
to be ushered in.

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:33.770 align:middle line:84%
That's what the fourth
industrial revolution

00:33:33.770 --> 00:33:36.772 align:middle line:84%
and the great reset is supposed
to do, usher in the technology.

00:33:36.772 --> 00:33:39.230 align:middle line:84%
People aren't going to ask for
it if there's not a problem.

00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:40.220 align:middle line:90%
What's the problem?

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:41.240 align:middle line:90%
Pandemic.

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:42.590 align:middle line:90%
Now people are scared.

00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:45.000 align:middle line:84%
Now people are asking
for the technology.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.130 align:middle line:84%
So what do we have to do to make
sure this is not a dark winter?

00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:51.950 align:middle line:84%
We hijack it with
revolutionary art.

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:54.200 align:middle line:84%
We're all-hands-on-deck
right now.

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:57.320 align:middle line:84%
We hijack the technology that
we built in the first place.

00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:59.810 align:middle line:84%
We use the technology,
the infrastructure,

00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:02.240 align:middle line:84%
for exactly what it's
there for, to connect

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:04.190 align:middle line:90%
with the tribe that's present.

00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:05.000 align:middle line:90%
We're here.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.120 align:middle line:84%
We have all the
resources we need.

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:09.820 align:middle line:84%
We don't need some alien group
to come down and save us.

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:11.380 align:middle line:90%
We have what we need.

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:12.940 align:middle line:90%
What we need to do is wake up.

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:14.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Will we wake up?

00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:16.179 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: I believe we do.

00:34:16.179 --> 00:34:17.050 align:middle line:90%
I believe we do.

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:21.139 align:middle line:84%
I have no doubt in my mind that
we are capable of waking up.

00:34:21.139 --> 00:34:23.199 align:middle line:84%
And here's why I'm not
scared of what's to come.

00:34:23.199 --> 00:34:24.100 align:middle line:90%
Is it scary?

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:28.600 align:middle line:84%
Is the dark winter and all
these sorcery-style words,

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:30.070 align:middle line:90%
is that scary to me?

00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:30.880 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:33.470 align:middle line:84%
But is it possible people
can fall into that trap?

00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:34.270 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:35.587 align:middle line:90%
So why am I here?

00:34:35.587 --> 00:34:38.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm here to spread the word so
we do wake up in the right way.

00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:40.378 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're a great
messenger, a great messenger.

00:34:40.378 --> 00:34:45.395 align:middle line:84%
Can we wake up at the right
time, or could it be too late?

00:34:45.395 --> 00:34:47.270 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: There's no
such thing as too late.

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And I say this in a
very specific way.

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:51.639 align:middle line:84%
Could it get a lot
darker because we

00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:53.710 align:middle line:84%
refuse to wake up
to our power, and we

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:55.150 align:middle line:90%
keep blaming the outside world?

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:56.230 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:57.910 align:middle line:90%
Might it get a lot darker?

00:34:57.910 --> 00:35:00.700 align:middle line:84%
If nobody wakes up, if
everybody's like, nope,

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:04.180 align:middle line:84%
there has to be some external
agency beyond me that

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:07.030 align:middle line:84%
comes in and saves me, then it
might get a little bit darker.

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:08.530 align:middle line:90%
But here's the thing.

00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:10.810 align:middle line:84%
It will not get
darker for everybody

00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:13.460 align:middle line:84%
across the planet in
the same exact way.

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:15.250 align:middle line:84%
So the people who
live in fear, they're

00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:18.940 align:middle line:84%
going to manifest the worst
of this timeline to come.

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:20.920 align:middle line:84%
The people who refuse
to live in fear

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:24.190 align:middle line:84%
are going to manifest the
best of that timeline to come.

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:25.990 align:middle line:84%
Do we have a lot of
work ahead of us?

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:27.370 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:29.890 align:middle line:90%
Am I here to do God's work?

00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:31.000 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.820 align:middle line:84%
Am I here simply because
I want to inherit

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:35.660 align:middle line:90%
a paradise that I did not earn?

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:36.460 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:38.500 align:middle line:90%
That's not what I came here for.

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:41.560 align:middle line:84%
Gratitude gives me
the right, the power,

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:44.740 align:middle line:84%
and everything I need to do
what I need to on this planet.

00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:46.610 align:middle line:84%
I may not know what
tomorrow brings,

00:35:46.610 --> 00:35:48.250 align:middle line:84%
but I know what
I'm bringing to it.

00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:50.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ben, aren't
our elected officials

00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:52.790 align:middle line:90%
trying to instill fear in us?

00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:55.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everywhere
you look, there's

00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:58.810 align:middle line:84%
something to scare your
living daylights out of you.

00:35:58.810 --> 00:35:59.800 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yes, yes.

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:04.060 align:middle line:84%
Fear is one of the oldest
tried and true tactics

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:05.470 align:middle line:90%
to corral people.

00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And here's where I'm going to
get a little mystical on you,

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:10.210 align:middle line:90%
George.

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:14.110 align:middle line:84%
Ego, in a collective
sense, loves control.

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:16.570 align:middle line:84%
We hate not knowing what
tomorrow is going to bring.

00:36:16.570 --> 00:36:20.680 align:middle line:84%
We're more scared of
the unknown future

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:23.887 align:middle line:84%
than of tyrannical forces that
we are completely aware of.

00:36:23.887 --> 00:36:24.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That you can see.

00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:25.840 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right.

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:30.100 align:middle line:84%
So fear is the best way to
predict people's outcomes.

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:31.810 align:middle line:84%
You know exactly
how people are going

00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:34.060 align:middle line:90%
to react when fear is present.

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:36.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we need
to start working now

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.680 align:middle line:90%
on facing fear within.

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:40.138 align:middle line:84%
If we don't face
the fear within,

00:36:40.138 --> 00:36:42.430 align:middle line:84%
we're never going to be able
to face it on the outside.

00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:45.540 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, can you blame
people for being scared?

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:46.830 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: I don't use blame.

00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:48.540 align:middle line:90%
Here's what I say.

00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:50.070 align:middle line:90%
Fear is a tool.

00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And it can be an activator,
but if you sit inside

00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:54.660 align:middle line:90%
that, it's supposed to--

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:55.920 align:middle line:90%
adrenaline, for instance.

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:58.020 align:middle line:84%
If a saber tooth tiger
is coming to get you,

00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:01.050 align:middle line:84%
adrenaline was there
evolutionarily to get you out

00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:02.010 align:middle line:90%
of Dodge.

00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:04.885 align:middle line:84%
But now, if you're scared,
and you're sitting down,

00:37:04.885 --> 00:37:06.510 align:middle line:84%
and you're not moving
your body, you're

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:08.670 align:middle line:84%
just going to swim
in that feeling.

00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:10.410 align:middle line:90%
So use fear.

00:37:10.410 --> 00:37:12.150 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to
live in fear, use

00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:15.940 align:middle line:84%
fear as a catalyst to propel
you into your solutions,

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:18.000 align:middle line:84%
propel you into your
human potential.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.090 align:middle line:84%
If you don't, there's only
one person you can blame.

00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:22.680 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not going to blame.

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:25.800 align:middle line:84%
I have love for
everybody out there,

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:29.200 align:middle line:84%
even the ones who don't know
how to bring that potential out

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:30.000 align:middle line:90%
from within.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.800 align:middle line:84%
I have love, and I will
hold space for their growth.

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And if they want to connect
with me personally, go

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:37.440 align:middle line:84%
to my website, connect
with me personally.

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:39.360 align:middle line:90%
I will give you free advice.

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:42.540 align:middle line:84%
I will connect with you, even
on the phone, to show you

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:44.850 align:middle line:90%
this is not the end of humanity.

00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:47.020 align:middle line:84%
This is the beginning
of something new.

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:50.070 align:middle line:84%
But it's only going to be
a good thing if we step up.

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:53.970 align:middle line:84%
We are where Christ is risen,
if we're going to get biblical.

00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:56.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if we
step up to the plate

00:37:56.370 --> 00:37:59.550 align:middle line:84%
and change the way we
live, what happens?

00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:01.110 align:middle line:90%
What's the future for us?

00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:03.420 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: If we
step up to the plate,

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:07.760 align:middle line:84%
then we will come face
to face in the same way

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:10.640 align:middle line:84%
if you go through, let's
say, an ayahuasca experience,

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:14.120 align:middle line:84%
or if you have to face your ego
in some meditative experience.

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:15.770 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
have to come face

00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:18.830 align:middle line:84%
to face with your shadow and all
those things that have held you

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:20.300 align:middle line:90%
back from your potential.

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:22.590 align:middle line:84%
If you don't, you're never
going to get past it,

00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:24.410 align:middle line:84%
and you'll keep blaming
the outside world

00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:26.090 align:middle line:90%
for your inner state of affairs.

00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:30.420 align:middle line:84%
But if we choose to face that
fear, and you get past it,

00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:33.140 align:middle line:84%
you'll realize that we
were always the solution,

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:35.080 align:middle line:84%
and the solution
was always present.

00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:37.200 align:middle line:84%
We just weren't
awoken to it yet.

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:40.400 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I keep saying,
wake up to your power.

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.560 align:middle line:84%
Stop giving so much
of your power away.

00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:47.420 align:middle line:84%
Don't consent to this silly
great reset and dark winter

00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:48.810 align:middle line:90%
that's supposedly going to come.

00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:50.120 align:middle line:90%
Make it a great winter.

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:51.860 align:middle line:90%
Make it a beautiful reset.

00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:53.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we do
it as an individual,

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:55.970 align:middle line:84%
or do we need the masses
to do it together?

00:38:55.970 --> 00:38:58.040 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: It has to
start individually.

00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:01.100 align:middle line:84%
Because we're great at
sniffing out whether people

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:02.630 align:middle line:90%
are being disingenuous or not.

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:03.710 align:middle line:90%
We're great at that.

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And if we're all
gathering in large groups,

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:08.750 align:middle line:84%
pretending that we're all
very excited about the future

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:11.390 align:middle line:84%
to come, we'll be able
to tell that nobody

00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:13.160 align:middle line:90%
has any real solutions.

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:15.500 align:middle line:90%
When you see a guru--

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:17.570 align:middle line:84%
and a guru that is
completely enlightened,

00:39:17.570 --> 00:39:19.670 align:middle line:90%
they see reality for what it is.

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And you say, what
about dark forces?

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:23.990 align:middle line:84%
Do they go buggy-eyed
and start telling you

00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:25.880 align:middle line:84%
how the world is
coming to an end?

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:26.810 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:29.720 align:middle line:84%
They come from the solution
in the manner of speaking,

00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:32.900 align:middle line:84%
in the way their
body language speaks.

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:34.070 align:middle line:90%
They're not scared.

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:36.530 align:middle line:10%
That's how they speak
about darkness in a way

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:38.630 align:middle line:10%
that they know we overcome.

00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:40.112 align:middle line:90%
And we shall overcome.

00:39:40.112 --> 00:39:41.570 align:middle line:84%
But it's only going
to happen if it

00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:43.280 align:middle line:90%
starts on an individual level.

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:44.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ben, we
started this program

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:49.040 align:middle line:84%
talking about the reaction
to 5G as it continues.

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:51.860 align:middle line:84%
Can they end up
going to 10G one day?

00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:54.020 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how far does it go?

00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:56.360 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: China's
already working on 6G.

00:39:56.360 --> 00:40:03.080 align:middle line:84%
So when we get caught up on the
number letter hypnosis, then

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:06.800 align:middle line:84%
we keep reading things online
and proving to ourselves,

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:11.600 align:middle line:84%
proving to our intellect, that
all that stuff is reality.

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:13.340 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, we're
going to realize

00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:16.370 align:middle line:84%
that there's alien technology
on this planet right now

00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:18.110 align:middle line:90%
that's being reverse engineered.

00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of our
technology right now,

00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:21.960 align:middle line:90%
how did it come together?

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:24.618 align:middle line:84%
It's not just the
increase in technology.

00:40:24.618 --> 00:40:26.660 align:middle line:84%
It's not just that bell
curve that we're hitting.

00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:28.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We were helped
and pushed a little bit.

00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:29.592 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: We were
helped and pushed.

00:40:29.592 --> 00:40:32.120 align:middle line:90%
And I believe that at the top--

00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:33.830 align:middle line:84%
the people who are
in fear, there's

00:40:33.830 --> 00:40:36.495 align:middle line:84%
this guy named Clare Graves,
and he has spiral dynamics.

00:40:36.495 --> 00:40:37.370 align:middle line:90%
And it's this ladder.

00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And he says, left-right
politics and this divisive kind

00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:43.280 align:middle line:84%
of news, that's on rung
three of the ladder.

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:46.970 align:middle line:84%
When you climb higher, you
realize that we're all together

00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:48.500 align:middle line:90%
on Spaceship Earth.

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And all the technology
that is here

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:54.170 align:middle line:90%
can be good if we wake up to it.

00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:55.430 align:middle line:90%
But they're just tools.

00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:57.020 align:middle line:84%
You can kill someone
with a hammer,

00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:59.000 align:middle line:84%
or you can build
somebody a home.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.600 align:middle line:84%
What I'm asking people to do is
stop disempowering themselves

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:05.780 align:middle line:84%
by saying the outside world
is driving our future.

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:08.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and you
just said if we wake up.

00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:09.986 align:middle line:90%
What if we don't?

00:41:09.986 --> 00:41:10.786 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:41:10.786 --> 00:41:12.520 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: You know what?

00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:15.950 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for pointing that out.

00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:19.790 align:middle line:84%
Historically, 100% of
the people never wake up.

00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:21.810 align:middle line:90%
Some people always do.

00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:24.950 align:middle line:90%
So here's what I have to say.

00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:26.690 align:middle line:90%
The tribe is gathering.

00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:28.910 align:middle line:90%
The right people are waking up.

00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:31.297 align:middle line:84%
How many people were involved
in the American Revolution?

00:41:31.297 --> 00:41:32.097 align:middle line:90%
Do you know?

00:41:32.097 --> 00:41:34.310 align:middle line:84%
What percentage of the
American population?

00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:34.655 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Small.

00:41:34.655 --> 00:41:35.455 align:middle line:90%
Very small.

00:41:35.455 --> 00:41:36.950 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: 4% or less.

00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:38.390 align:middle line:90%
4% or less.

00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:39.320 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:42.650 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the other 96% would
have caused more harm

00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:44.630 align:middle line:84%
if they didn't feel
it within their hearts

00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:46.490 align:middle line:90%
that they should interject.

00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:48.890 align:middle line:84%
So maybe they're supposed
to stay where they're at.

00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:52.190 align:middle line:84%
And the 4% of people who
are willing to stand up

00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:54.350 align:middle line:84%
to exactly what's
happening right now,

00:41:54.350 --> 00:41:56.930 align:middle line:84%
like myself, like Foster
and Kimberly Gamble,

00:41:56.930 --> 00:42:00.110 align:middle line:84%
like the Barbara Marx
Hubbards, God rest her soul,

00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:03.140 align:middle line:84%
when we stand up, we
are already awoken,

00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:05.720 align:middle line:84%
and we are doing our
best through technology,

00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:07.530 align:middle line:84%
like the internet, to
wake up more people.

00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:08.330 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:42:08.330 --> 00:42:10.340 align:middle line:84%
Critical mass is right
around the corner.

00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:13.100 align:middle line:84%
That's why I'm confident
that we do wake up.

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:15.890 align:middle line:84%
Maybe 100% of the people
don't, but we're all

00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:18.310 align:middle line:84%
at different levels on
the evolutionary awakening

00:42:18.310 --> 00:42:19.110 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:21.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we wake up
sooner than later, Ben?

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:22.640 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: I see it.

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:23.750 align:middle line:90%
I see it.

00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:25.880 align:middle line:84%
That bell curve
that we're hitting,

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:28.460 align:middle line:84%
the next 10 years,
George, technology

00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:31.760 align:middle line:84%
is going to advance faster than
it has in the past 100, maybe

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:33.320 align:middle line:90%
the past 1,000.

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:36.650 align:middle line:84%
So in the next 10 years, people
are going to get more scared.

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:39.320 align:middle line:84%
They're going to start looking
elsewhere than mainstream

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:40.835 align:middle line:90%
media and current politics--

00:42:40.835 --> 00:42:41.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They have to.

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:42.470 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: The
left-right paradigm.

00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:44.137 align:middle line:84%
They're going to start
asking questions.

00:42:44.137 --> 00:42:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And that word, quest,
is going to lead them

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:48.260 align:middle line:90%
into uncomfortable territory.

00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:51.650 align:middle line:90%
Into conspiracy, into mysticism.

00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:52.880 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:56.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm grateful and very excited
for people to actually start

00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:57.590 align:middle line:90%
asking those questions.

00:42:57.590 --> 00:42:58.880 align:middle line:90%
Because that's how we wake up.

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:01.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you say to some
parents watching the show right

00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:03.110 align:middle line:84%
now that have little
children, and they're

00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:06.350 align:middle line:84%
concerned about the
kids' lives and futures?

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:08.330 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Try and
go to wired internet.

00:43:08.330 --> 00:43:10.700 align:middle line:90%
Turn off the internet at night.

00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:13.550 align:middle line:84%
Think about Faraday
cloaking your bed.

00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:15.710 align:middle line:84%
Give your children
enough magnesium,

00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:18.387 align:middle line:84%
because that'll take care of a
laundry list of health issues.

00:43:18.387 --> 00:43:19.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:21.800 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Iodine,
niacin, step on the Earth.

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:23.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: D3, put it in there.

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:24.260 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yes.

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:24.500 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:25.790 align:middle line:90%
Vitamin D3.

00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:28.790 align:middle line:10%
The thing is just
research health.

00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:30.620 align:middle line:10%
If you actually
do what we've been

00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:32.870 align:middle line:10%
told to do with health,
if we actually do it,

00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:35.430 align:middle line:10%
not just talk about it,
but if we actually do it,

00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:39.200 align:middle line:10%
you'll realize that all that
laundry list of health effects

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:42.720 align:middle line:10%
that might affect kids, it
may not affect your kid.

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:43.520 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:46.460 align:middle line:84%
Because you're doing the right
things to mitigate the harm.

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:49.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying I love all
this technology that's

00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:50.210 align:middle line:90%
coming through.

00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:53.060 align:middle line:84%
What I am saying is
there is a tidal wave.

00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:55.070 align:middle line:84%
And there's these things
called surfboards.

00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:57.950 align:middle line:84%
We can either surf the wave,
or we can get swallowed by it.

00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:59.677 align:middle line:90%
I choose to be the former.

00:43:59.677 --> 00:44:01.760 align:middle line:84%
