[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:11.976 --> 00:00:19.188 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.188 --> 00:00:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.510 align:middle line:10%
Bonni McCliss with us, an
intuitive Akashic psychic

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.170 align:middle line:10%
and a hypnotherapist.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.710 align:middle line:10%
Now, she utilizes
the Akashic records

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.990 align:middle line:10%
to help others transcend
their limiting belief.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.422 align:middle line:90%
You're one of a kind, Bonni.

00:00:33.422 --> 00:00:34.380 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the program.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.750 align:middle line:90%
>>BONNI MCCLISS: Thank you.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.220 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for having me back.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm excited to be here.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.055 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we had
a lot of great response

00:00:39.055 --> 00:00:40.200 align:middle line:90%
on your first visit.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.420 align:middle line:90%
They said, bring her back.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.220 align:middle line:90%
Bring her back.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.678 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: I think
people were just

00:00:43.678 --> 00:00:45.920 align:middle line:90%
ready to hear how to evolve.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:46.720 align:middle line:90%
We're ready.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.160 align:middle line:90%
This is our time.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What got you
into this metamorphosis

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.805 align:middle line:90%
to evolve the way you have?

00:00:51.805 --> 00:00:52.930 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Oh, my goodness.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.230 align:middle line:10%
I didn't have a fighting chance.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.240 align:middle line:10%
As a little girl,
out the gate, I

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.190 align:middle line:10%
was communicating
with other beings,

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.750 align:middle line:10%
hearing all of these
dictations come over me right

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.660 align:middle line:10%
from the beginning.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.140 align:middle line:84%
So I don't really
know anything any

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.310 align:middle line:90%
different than being this way.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.910 align:middle line:10%
So I'm just doing
my best to continue

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.710 align:middle line:10%
to be that vessel
and that channel

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.830 align:middle line:10%
to bring through
tools and information

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.220 align:middle line:10%
to help us move forward.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did your parents know
this was happening to you?

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: They didn't
know what to think, George.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.290 align:middle line:90%
And that's fair.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.630 align:middle line:84%
It was a lot of just things
that nobody could explain.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.920 align:middle line:84%
A lot of it was just chalked
up to imaginary friends,

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.040 align:middle line:90%
that kind of stuff.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And they became really
worried about me

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.870 align:middle line:90%
as I grew up still talking.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.933 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As they should when
they don't know what's going on.

00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:42.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Especially
if you're talking to air

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.830 align:middle line:84%
or having a full-blown
conversation.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.920 align:middle line:84%
People tend to fear what
they don't understand,

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.940 align:middle line:90%
as we all know.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.140 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, it was a
rough road fighting

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.240 align:middle line:90%
to keep this true nature alive.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.850 align:middle line:84%
And I've lost it a couple
of times along the way.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.060 align:middle line:84%
But what's your purpose
is your purpose.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's always going to call
you back one way or the other.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.389 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you got into it
in a big way now, haven't you?

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:10.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yeah.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Akashic
Records, what are they?

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: So the
Akashic Records to me,

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.360 align:middle line:84%
it's such a great question,
because I think a lot of people

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.800 align:middle line:84%
when they hear Akashic Records,
they think about this book

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.000 align:middle line:90%
far off in the cosmos.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.830 align:middle line:90%
And that's not what it means.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.450 align:middle line:90%
That's not what it is alone.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.420 align:middle line:84%
It's more of a field
of consciousness,

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.860 align:middle line:84%
an all pervading energy that's
everywhere you can even imagine.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.540 align:middle line:84%
So I like personally to think
about it as our other brain.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.780 align:middle line:84%
We have a physical
brain and cognition.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.830 align:middle line:84%
The Akashic Records
is our spiritual brain

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.890 align:middle line:84%
and our map to all
that we've been

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.240 align:middle line:84%
or who we could
be in the future.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So who is transcribing
your record into the Akashic

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.390 align:middle line:90%
Records?

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: It's so many
different light beings, so

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.660 align:middle line:84%
many future beings, so many
people informing the past.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it literally is
this collective database

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.910 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.000 align:middle line:84%
So that's the mother
lode question.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.880 align:middle line:90%
Who is the big informers?

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.860 align:middle line:84%
I have a couple of ideas of
how this has really come to be.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.620 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's about each
person and their trajectory

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.370 align:middle line:90%
and what they're here to do.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.810 align:middle line:84%
They tend to attract
or triangulate

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.940 align:middle line:84%
with different
teachers, like I did.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.130 align:middle line:84%
Different astral beings that
have methodology and tools

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.230 align:middle line:84%
for that person to carry
forward their souls.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So does the Akashic
Records track everything

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.340 align:middle line:90%
you've done in your life?

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Everything.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:45.530 align:middle line:90%
Everything, everything.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.460 align:middle line:84%
Everything, everywhere it
keeps as this database.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.460 align:middle line:90%
It's also like a big pattern.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.520 align:middle line:84%
And to me, there's always
patterns within patterns.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
it's all connected.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.350 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, everything goes into
the cloud, the Akashic Records.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do you think they
were created in the first place?

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: I think
this is really

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.350 align:middle line:84%
there are many different
levels of Akashic consciousness

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.010 align:middle line:90%
or these Akashic Records.

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.860 align:middle line:84%
Some people believe
that it's all mental,

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.930 align:middle line:84%
so all thoughts and
actions or experiences

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.089 align:middle line:90%
are loaded into this database.

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:24.950 align:middle line:84%
But honestly, it's even
much more than that.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.700 align:middle line:84%
It's the map system
of how we are going

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.840 align:middle line:90%
to evolve as a human species.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think it also carries
all of the information

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.370 align:middle line:84%
for all sentient beings in
their track of evolution.

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had heard that
the Akashic Records can

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.240 align:middle line:90%
be used to heal too.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: They absolutely can.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And healing is a really
interesting point

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.810 align:middle line:90%
for when we incarnate.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.390 align:middle line:84%
I think when it
comes to healing,

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.070 align:middle line:84%
sometimes, we're suffering,
or we have disease,

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.500 align:middle line:84%
or there's an imbalance
because we've lost our way.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.920 align:middle line:84%
We don't remember the
truth of who we are.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And so this disharmonic
state of consciousness

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.350 align:middle line:84%
sets in creating
disease and suffering.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And the Akashic
Records can help us

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.380 align:middle line:84%
to see where our blind spots
are, where we're creating

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.400 align:middle line:90%
suffering that is needless.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And I also think
that some people

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.260 align:middle line:84%
incarnate to go through
these types of sufferings.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.960 align:middle line:84%
It's written in
their records to have

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.440 align:middle line:84%
disease or certain
awful events take place.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.170 align:middle line:84%
And again, the
Akashic Records can

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:37.300 align:middle line:84%
help there too, because they
can inform the why, the depth,

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.610 align:middle line:90%
the purpose to the pain.

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And just that knowledge
alone, I think,

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.510 align:middle line:84%
is very restoring to the
person walking through that.

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you read
the Akashic Records?

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: I do.

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:49.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For everybody?

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:50.663 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: For everyone.

00:05:50.663 --> 00:05:51.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hide my book.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:52.663 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Hide your book.

00:05:52.663 --> 00:05:57.070 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] It's a system of
a resonance and vibration.

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:01.290 align:middle line:84%
So for me, I can hardly
help it sometimes

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:06.850 align:middle line:84%
just by hearing sound currents,
different vibrational spectrums,

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.740 align:middle line:84%
it brings forward imagery
and information, kind

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.900 align:middle line:84%
of like we went through
the Dewey Decimal System

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:18.060 align:middle line:84%
through sound, pulled your
card, and all this information

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:23.510 align:middle line:84%
of karma and potential path just
comes up as an instinct of mine.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:24.980 align:middle line:90%
Many people can do this.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.730 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, I think it's
a human birthright

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:31.430 align:middle line:84%
to be able to participate
with these Akashic Records.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:32.960 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's the point.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.620 align:middle line:84%
It's not something that's
meant for just one or two

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.520 align:middle line:90%
people or a smattering.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.200 align:middle line:84%
We're all supposed to live
in conscious connection

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.890 align:middle line:90%
to these maps.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:48.340 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be as hard
as we've had to go this far.

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, the records, of
course, talk about your past

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.170 align:middle line:90%
and the things you've done.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:56.970 align:middle line:90%
Does it also look at the future?

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:57.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: It does.

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:01.520 align:middle line:84%
So we live in a
holographic universe,

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.350 align:middle line:84%
and so infinite amounts of
timelines and parallel lives.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And every intention
and action that we take

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.650 align:middle line:90%
creates these forks in the path.

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:16.730 align:middle line:84%
And the Akashic Records accounts
for all of that, all of it.

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:21.890 align:middle line:84%
So yes, it's known for all of
this information from the past,

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:26.350 align:middle line:84%
but I think it's greater
usage maybe is to teach us

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:29.710 align:middle line:84%
how to evolve going
forward, which

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:32.710 align:middle line:84%
is a really interesting
thing to look at,

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:35.320 align:middle line:84%
because if you take
the Akashic Records,

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.960 align:middle line:90%
it exists in space, not time.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.350 align:middle line:84%
So when people are looking for
what did I do in my past lives,

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:44.680 align:middle line:84%
a lot of time people
will see future lives

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.870 align:middle line:84%
or different
timelines, and they're

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:50.060 align:middle line:84%
confused while they're being
taken all over the place.

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people, Bonni,
access their own Akashic

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.800 align:middle line:90%
Records?

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Honestly,
George, through intention,

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:59.140 align:middle line:84%
through the will to
want to know more

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:03.890 align:middle line:84%
about their soul's purpose and
the societal collective purpose.

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:07.730 align:middle line:84%
So it starts with the
will to learn and to know.

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And there are specific keys
or, I guess, you could say,

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:14.660 align:middle line:84%
tools that you can
utilize to really,

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.600 align:middle line:84%
really track your
own record system

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.205 align:middle line:84%
and know what your
soul's purpose is.

00:08:19.205 --> 00:08:20.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:23.085 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are special ways
to access your records?

00:08:23.085 --> 00:08:23.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: There are.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.100 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
there are ways for you

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.360 align:middle line:90%
to commit in your lifestyle.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.990 align:middle line:84%
There are things
for you to do or not

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:37.340 align:middle line:84%
do that help you arrive in
some kind of harmonic synthesis

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:42.159 align:middle line:84%
so that you're constantly
being engaged or dictated to

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:45.830 align:middle line:84%
on this path of where
you're designed to go.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:48.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is it so important
to access your records?

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:51.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: At this
time and day and age,

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:57.220 align:middle line:84%
we can't get by with just trying
to throw a dart at the board.

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:01.150 align:middle line:84%
Everything we do
has to be radically

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:05.990 align:middle line:84%
intentional and communicative
with these higher worlds,

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:08.480 align:middle line:84%
or we're just going to
keep breeding more chaos.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:13.030 align:middle line:84%
So now is this time of
this phenomenal shift where

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:15.760 align:middle line:84%
it's really the sign of
our times to stay connected

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.730 align:middle line:84%
so that we know how
to proceed and how

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:20.740 align:middle line:84%
to make the best
of this incarnation

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:24.230 align:middle line:84%
and add to those
people around us.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:27.885 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's really the
best tool in our toolbox.

00:09:27.885 --> 00:09:29.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now,
there are five keys

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:30.510 align:middle line:90%
to access your records, right?

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:31.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yes.

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:31.483 align:middle line:90%


00:09:31.483 --> 00:09:32.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
you get into that?

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:33.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yes.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.500 align:middle line:84%
And these keys have
been given to me

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:39.050 align:middle line:84%
over the course of the
past decade and a half.

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And each one was given to me
to experience and feel out

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:46.550 align:middle line:84%
so that I could learn it and
then, of course, teach it.

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:51.130 align:middle line:84%
So the five keys to accessing
this Akashic consciousness map

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:56.540 align:middle line:84%
system is one, learning
how to surrender and not

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:59.390 align:middle line:84%
be attached to outcome,
because, a lot of times

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:02.660 align:middle line:84%
we don't understand
what our soul is gaining

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:06.270 align:middle line:84%
or what it's looking for in this
incarnated and purpose-driven

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:07.070 align:middle line:90%
life.

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:11.180 align:middle line:84%
So we have that reptilian
mind, that more localized brain

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.850 align:middle line:84%
setting that has its
own plan, but our soul

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:15.000 align:middle line:90%
has a different one.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.170 align:middle line:84%
So learning how to not attach
to outcome and surrender

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:21.860 align:middle line:84%
is the first key that I
was told was necessary.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:26.120 align:middle line:84%
The next to really go
hand in hand and that's

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:30.836 align:middle line:84%
retraining yourself
to be OK in stillness.

00:10:30.836 --> 00:10:32.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What does that mean?

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: To just sit still
for 30 seconds to a minute.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:39.230 align:middle line:84%
Because if you've ever tried
to sit perfectly still,

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:42.830 align:middle line:84%
most people have almost
an anxiety reaction.

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:45.080 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they're just
that's not what society

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:49.880 align:middle line:84%
has presented for us as a model
of how to evolve as being human.

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.850 align:middle line:84%
They teach us to go,
go, go, go and have

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:56.850 align:middle line:90%
these multitasked lifestyles.

00:10:56.850 --> 00:11:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And so we almost have
to indefinitely retrain

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:08.090 align:middle line:84%
ourselves to bypass that more
baseline cognition through being

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:12.980 align:middle line:84%
radically still, which will
lead us into the real mother

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:18.862 align:middle line:84%
lode of connection points into
the ultimate present moment.

00:11:18.862 --> 00:11:20.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's number three?

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:22.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: That is-- I
think we're on third.

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:23.372 align:middle line:90%
That's number three.

00:11:23.372 --> 00:11:25.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm keeping
track of you, Bonni.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:25.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Good.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.330 align:middle line:84%
Being present in the
moment it opens a portal

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.210 align:middle line:90%
into the Akashic records.

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:35.240 align:middle line:84%
It allows you to
interact by communicating

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.760 align:middle line:90%
with space and no longer time.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.460 align:middle line:84%
It allows you to track
whatever your experience is

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:45.780 align:middle line:84%
more deeply, which is
really important to prepare

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.470 align:middle line:84%
to hold the Akashic Records,
this kind of fascinating depth

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:49.270 align:middle line:90%
training.

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:50.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
number four be?

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:53.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: So four is
your intentionality.

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And they don't just
say set an intention,

00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:01.500 align:middle line:84%
they say purify your
intention, meaning

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.950 align:middle line:84%
get to the base of what
your soul is telling

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:07.440 align:middle line:90%
you is your incarnated purpose.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:11.040 align:middle line:84%
Find what is really
driving your heart

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:14.330 align:middle line:84%
instead of what you think
you need to do to survive.

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:17.400 align:middle line:84%
So aligning with that
core purpose of your own

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:21.960 align:middle line:84%
incarnated Akashic map system,
purifying your intention

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:23.940 align:middle line:90%
for life at large.

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:27.480 align:middle line:84%
And that will lead you to the
very last key that is sometimes

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.790 align:middle line:90%
the scariest thing to do.

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:32.980 align:middle line:84%
Once you're aligned and you're
clear with your purpose,

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:36.960 align:middle line:84%
let go and allow your life
to take it from there.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:41.160 align:middle line:84%
They call this key the
nonmutation of nature.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And that means don't
get in your own way.

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.365 align:middle line:84%
If you've set things in
motion, you don't understand--

00:12:46.365 --> 00:12:48.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because a lot of
people do get in their own way.

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:49.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: They do.

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:53.880 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't make sense why life
gives you these crazy twists

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:57.370 align:middle line:84%
and turns that you
weren't really expecting.

00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:00.100 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, let go and
trust your life.

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.350 align:middle line:84%
So if you can do
those five things,

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:04.710 align:middle line:84%
you're practically
living in the heart

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:07.090 align:middle line:84%
of an Akashic
consciousness essence.

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:10.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, why is it
important to access the records?

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:12.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Because of
where we're going, George.

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:15.670 align:middle line:84%
Our whole solar system is
going through an upgrade.

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:16.510 align:middle line:90%
We're evolving.

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:18.160 align:middle line:90%
We're evolving fast.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.100 align:middle line:84%
We're also picking up
on different frequencies

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.530 align:middle line:84%
coming off of Andromeda,
our neighboring galaxy.

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:26.310 align:middle line:84%
So everything around
us is oscillating

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:28.510 align:middle line:90%
faster and at different rates.

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:30.630 align:middle line:84%
The magnetic field,
that's giving away.

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:33.880 align:middle line:84%
The Earth's core
rotation is slowing down.

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.650 align:middle line:90%
Our environment on Earth--

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:37.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
bizarre all by itself.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: All by itself.

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:43.860 align:middle line:84%
We are going to have to resonate
our base human frequency

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:48.900 align:middle line:84%
at an entirely
different rate of light

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:50.910 align:middle line:90%
to continue to thrive and grow.

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:53.910 align:middle line:84%
So that's why this is
such an important time

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:55.770 align:middle line:90%
during this point on Earth.

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:58.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you call this
a shift in something?

00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: This is the shift.

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:02.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, we are here for the shift.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:04.750 align:middle line:84%
If you are incarnated
at this time,

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:08.220 align:middle line:84%
you are the warrior
chosen to participate

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:10.980 align:middle line:90%
during Earth's greatest shift.

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:14.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think even a better
word than the shift

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:18.780 align:middle line:84%
would be something regarded
as the great return.

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm being
told is that all

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:24.830 align:middle line:84%
of our fragmented
pieces, anybody

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:29.490 align:middle line:84%
we've ever been in any life,
all of the pains and karma

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:33.630 align:middle line:84%
that we've amassed, all of our
talents and gifts, all of it

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:36.620 align:middle line:84%
is closing in like an
accordion coming back.

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:39.480 align:middle line:84%
All of you is coming
back to you at once,

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.940 align:middle line:84%
which is creating a
lot of mental disturbia

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:45.430 align:middle line:84%
in people, emotional
imbalances, confusion.

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:47.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you woke
up George tomorrow

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:50.880 align:middle line:84%
and you were all that
you've ever been,

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you'd probably feel
like you had some split

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:54.952 align:middle line:90%
personalities going on there.

00:14:54.952 --> 00:14:56.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm a Gemini anyway.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Oh, well, you need to
be teaching us how to do this.

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:03.210 align:middle line:84%
So I think if
that's happening, we

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:06.570 align:middle line:84%
need to have ways to
integrate this process

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:12.180 align:middle line:84%
and solve the greatest mystery
of our time, how to be whole.

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:16.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At what age should
you teach kids or people

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:18.060 align:middle line:90%
your Akashic Records?

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:19.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: From day 1.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:19.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: From day 1.

00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:22.020 align:middle line:90%
This is the human--

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:24.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As you did?

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Absolutely.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:29.610 align:middle line:84%
I think this is maybe the
biggest conspiracy of our time

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:34.150 align:middle line:84%
is really dumbing down what
the human potential really is.

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:36.130 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is our birthright.

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:41.280 align:middle line:84%
This is our oxygen and our
understanding, our life map,

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:44.920 align:middle line:84%
and what we're here to do again,
individually and collectively.

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.730 align:middle line:84%
So you can't start
too soon teaching

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:53.250 align:middle line:84%
kids stillness and presence
and trust of their own life

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:58.320 align:middle line:84%
and reversing the societal
message of perform

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.660 align:middle line:90%
and go and go fast.

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:03.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bonni, what are
ancient mystery schools?

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:05.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: The ancient
mystery schools

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:07.960 align:middle line:84%
knew all about the
Akashic Records.

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.470 align:middle line:84%
And they also knew
about this thing

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:13.290 align:middle line:84%
that we regard now
as the universal laws

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:16.040 align:middle line:90%
or high laws of nature.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And this really goes hand
in hand of the things

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:22.990 align:middle line:84%
that we need to
adapt and relearn.

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:28.100 align:middle line:84%
It's in every single spiritual
sector and body of teachings,

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:32.350 align:middle line:84%
from the Egyptians to the Greeks
to the hermetic philosophies

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:33.650 align:middle line:90%
to the Mayans.

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:36.890 align:middle line:84%
These mystery schools
taught these laws of nature.

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And again, they knew how to
connect with this Akashic field.

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And when they did
that, they were

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:48.040 align:middle line:84%
able to bend energy and
resonance of the universe

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.370 align:middle line:90%
to their will.

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:51.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would you
do on a regular basis

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:54.975 align:middle line:84%
to tune you up for
the Akashic Records?

00:16:54.975 --> 00:16:58.010 align:middle line:90%


00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:00.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: On a
regular basis, I would

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:03.942 align:middle line:84%
start to go through
a detox of the mind.

00:17:03.942 --> 00:17:05.109 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do you do that?

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:06.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Catch
yourself when you're

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:10.430 align:middle line:84%
in fear thinking or
rotational thinking,

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:13.710 align:middle line:84%
really work to cultivate
a mindfulness practice.

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:19.230 align:middle line:84%
Because until you move the
ego aside or the fear aside,

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:23.599 align:middle line:84%
you can't co-create with these
high resonances of the universe

00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:26.869 align:middle line:84%
or these higher planes
of the Akashic field.

00:17:26.869 --> 00:17:28.600 align:middle line:90%
They can't coexist.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:32.330 align:middle line:84%
So as we start to
make room and move out

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:34.910 align:middle line:90%
all of our internal baggage--

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:37.910 align:middle line:84%
and George, that is
clearly a lot harder

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:39.810 align:middle line:90%
than I'm making it sound.

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of ways
to go about doing that.

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:49.370 align:middle line:84%
But we can't skip that step
of presence and stillness

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:54.020 align:middle line:84%
because it's like that old
aphorism, when the student is

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:56.360 align:middle line:90%
ready, the teacher will appear.

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And the god, so to speak,
or our higher beings

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:02.250 align:middle line:84%
of light, higher
species are watching

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:07.680 align:middle line:84%
for who among us has that
container ready to receive Intel

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.290 align:middle line:90%
about how to move forward.

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:12.510 align:middle line:84%
In fact, my astral
teachers talk about humans

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:16.540 align:middle line:84%
coming into what they
regard as an avataric state,

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:19.570 align:middle line:84%
much like you found
in the Egyptian times

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:22.320 align:middle line:84%
this deification process
that they would speak of.

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:25.500 align:middle line:84%
We're destined for that,
again, because the Earth

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.910 align:middle line:84%
is shifting, again, like it
was thousands of years ago.

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:31.770 align:middle line:84%
The veil is becoming
extremely thin,

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:36.030 align:middle line:84%
and we have this resonance,
this field of energies

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:40.140 align:middle line:84%
that we now can work with that
wasn't necessarily present to us

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:41.900 align:middle line:90%
even 10 years ago.

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:44.670 align:middle line:84%
So we need to know
how to ride that wave

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:48.582 align:middle line:84%
and tap into that one
true universal signal.

00:18:48.582 --> 00:18:50.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We all go
through a moment

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:52.990 align:middle line:84%
of reflection of our lives,
what it could or should have.

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:53.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Yeah.

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:54.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why did I do that?

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:56.460 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my gosh.

00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:01.657 align:middle line:84%
How important is all of that
accessing for these records?

00:19:01.657 --> 00:19:03.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: I think
you need to go back

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.280 align:middle line:84%
to that purification
of intention.

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:10.330 align:middle line:84%
Again, a lot of our regret comes
from fear or shame or guilt,

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:12.730 align:middle line:84%
which is natural
human experience.

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:17.040 align:middle line:84%
But that is one of the
lowest resonant energy banks

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.700 align:middle line:90%
that we have here on Earth.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:21.810 align:middle line:84%
It is unavoidable,
but it's not something

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:26.560 align:middle line:84%
that we can hold simultaneously
through our ascension.

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:28.710 align:middle line:84%
There's something that
the ancient beings

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:32.470 align:middle line:84%
or ancient ancestors spoke
about called the ouroboros.

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:33.270 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:35.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are those the
laws of the universe?

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:36.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: It's the
laws of the universe.

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:39.490 align:middle line:90%
It's the snake eating its tail.

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And you've seen it
in Egyptian archives

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:44.680 align:middle line:84%
representing death,
birth, and renewal.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And you've seen it a lot with
the Mayan civilizations as well.

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:50.080 align:middle line:90%
And it means a lot of things.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.110 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
greatest teachings

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:54.480 align:middle line:84%
that is important
for us to understand

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:58.920 align:middle line:84%
is they spoke and worked
on where we were going

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.850 align:middle line:90%
to go as a future species.

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:02.760 align:middle line:84%
So the Mayans were
sitting around talking

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:07.200 align:middle line:84%
about our timeline
thousands of years

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.830 align:middle line:84%
long after they're
going to be gone.

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:12.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, have you thought about
your grandchildren that will be

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.700 align:middle line:90%
here in 20,000 years?

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:14.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Always.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:15.300 align:middle line:90%
Constantly.

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:17.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: [LAUGHS]
Most people don't.

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:20.350 align:middle line:84%
Their job was to
focus on the future.

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:25.140 align:middle line:84%
Our job is to focus on
the past, to unearth

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:28.240 align:middle line:84%
those ancient teachings
of the mystery school,

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:30.990 align:middle line:84%
to unearth those
protocols of tapping

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:32.800 align:middle line:90%
into the signals of nature.

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And if you look
at it completely,

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:39.420 align:middle line:84%
it's creating that
perfect centrifugal force

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:41.500 align:middle line:90%
and that union of wisdom.

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And we're co-collaborating
now as creators to be on time

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:50.770 align:middle line:84%
as we hold each side of
the polarized forces.

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:54.070 align:middle line:84%
So it is absolutely about
going back to our history.

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bonni, these
ancient laws of the universe,

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:58.383 align:middle line:90%
who made them?

00:20:58.383 --> 00:21:00.300 align:middle line:10%
>>MCCLISS: The jury's
out on that one, George.

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:04.630 align:middle line:10%
Some people believe that it
was the hermetical philosophy,

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:05.430 align:middle line:10%
Hermes.

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:07.860 align:middle line:84%
Some people believe that
it goes all the way back

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:09.490 align:middle line:90%
to the creator gods.

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:13.690 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the consciousness
of the universe's itself.

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:15.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they calling us?

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:17.580 align:middle line:90%
Come back, come back.

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:20.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: They're
calling us to evolve.

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:21.160 align:middle line:90%
They are calling us.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.430 align:middle line:84%
If you think about
it, it's interesting.

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:28.240 align:middle line:84%
All of our neighboring galaxies
can't ascend without us.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:31.960 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like a train, and
the engine trying to go forward,

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:35.250 align:middle line:84%
and the caboose is just
really staggering behind.

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:39.940 align:middle line:84%
They can only go as far as
we can progress and evolve.

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what
is creating so much

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.140 align:middle line:90%
in the world of ET contact.

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:48.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they have a lot at
stake for our evolving species.

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what's really
coming into light now as we

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:55.540 align:middle line:90%
focus on our ancient ancestors.

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:57.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are people
learning from this?

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: They
don't have a choice.

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:03.110 align:middle line:84%
I think we're learning
just through the field

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:05.940 align:middle line:84%
this information is
in mass consciousness.

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:09.300 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's picking up
on little pieces of this.

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:12.840 align:middle line:84%
I think what's really the most
important focus of our time too

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:16.590 align:middle line:84%
is to not get caught
up in polarization.

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:18.300 align:middle line:84%
That happens to be
one of the laws.

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:22.590 align:middle line:84%
The laws of polarity are
really at play right now.

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think when we look
at this high universal law,

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:29.820 align:middle line:84%
it's about integrating the
two hemispheres of ourselves,

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:31.550 align:middle line:84%
maybe the masculine
or the feminine,

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:34.230 align:middle line:84%
or the left or the
right brain, who knows?

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:37.070 align:middle line:84%
But it's about this
internal integration

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:40.130 align:middle line:84%
that we're really externalizing,
and you're seeing that happen in

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:45.350 align:middle line:84%
develop in all kinds of war,
and political divide all over.

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bonni, you're
a hypnotherapist.

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:49.010 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:51.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: That is
I'm a bit of a tour

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:55.530 align:middle line:84%
guide for people in alternate
states of consciousness.

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's really the hypnosis
is one of our greatest tools

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:02.550 align:middle line:84%
that we have right now,
because essentially, it

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:05.700 align:middle line:84%
takes us directly to
the Akashic Records

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:09.190 align:middle line:84%
as we enter into these alternate
states of consciousness.

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:10.320 align:middle line:90%
That alone--

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:11.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Directly?

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:12.593 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: It takes us directly.

00:23:12.593 --> 00:23:16.690 align:middle line:84%
It's like a living portal
right into the maps themselves.

00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And again, through
your intentionality,

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:22.900 align:middle line:84%
you can go forward and
backwards and high and sideways.

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:24.510 align:middle line:90%
It's like a game of chess.

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:28.360 align:middle line:84%
That alone is not enough
for this ascension program.

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:29.680 align:middle line:90%
It gives you a glimpse.

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:33.430 align:middle line:84%
It gives you a unit of space
and time and understanding.

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:35.770 align:middle line:84%
But really it's about
our lifestyle shifts.

00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:40.260 align:middle line:84%
So hypnosis, getting
that kind of B12 shot

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:44.280 align:middle line:84%
or that download of purpose,
along with introducing

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:47.040 align:middle line:84%
a lifestyle change with
these universal laws

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.805 align:middle line:84%
will keep you in
constant contact.

00:23:48.805 --> 00:23:50.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why does it
seem that hypnosis

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:54.340 align:middle line:84%
works on people with vices
like stopping the smoke,

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:57.040 align:middle line:84%
stopping the gamble,
and things like that?

00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.740 align:middle line:90%
It works, why?

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:01.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: I think people that
come for hypnosis are truly

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:02.590 align:middle line:90%
ready for their own healing.

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:05.430 align:middle line:84%
I think they've done
the preliminary work

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:07.150 align:middle line:90%
to ready themselves.

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:09.330 align:middle line:84%
And when they reach
hypnosis, all you have to do

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:11.710 align:middle line:84%
is tip them over
the edge, again,

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:14.530 align:middle line:84%
bringing them into this
Akashic consciousness.

00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:18.060 align:middle line:84%
There's answers to where
the imbalance originated

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:19.240 align:middle line:90%
to begin with.

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:23.430 align:middle line:84%
And once you really, truly
see its origin and touch it,

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:24.610 align:middle line:90%
it lets go.

00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:27.630 align:middle line:84%
It takes the blindfold
off of whatever

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:29.020 align:middle line:90%
you've been struggling with.

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And again, it also
can inform your map,

00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:35.530 align:middle line:84%
why you wrote this
into the script.

00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:37.570 align:middle line:90%
So knowledge is power.

00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
the tool that people

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:44.190 align:middle line:84%
that are in need for healing
seek out when they're ready for.

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:46.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it true that
somebody cannot be hypnotized

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:49.180 align:middle line:84%
to do something they
don't want to do?

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:49.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Exactly.

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:52.540 align:middle line:90%
You maintain your control.

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:55.060 align:middle line:84%
Your soul's always
watching over you.

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:59.650 align:middle line:84%
You're always in alignment with
that core truth and intention.

00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:02.230 align:middle line:84%
So nobody can
overthrow your power.

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:05.040 align:middle line:84%
But again, I think it's a
relationship that was also

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:08.070 align:middle line:84%
written in time that
you would come together

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:10.680 align:middle line:84%
with this facilitator
and work through whatever

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:11.860 align:middle line:90%
ties that bind you.

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:14.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
strangest hypnotic regression

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:17.470 align:middle line:84%
you've done where
even you went, whoa,

00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:19.570 align:middle line:90%
what have I tapped into here?

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:21.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: I think the
strangest regressions

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.940 align:middle line:84%
I've gotten into in
my career, definitely

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:26.140 align:middle line:90%
people who have had ET contact.

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:29.028 align:middle line:84%
That's a whole other
ballgame of hypnosis.

00:25:29.028 --> 00:25:30.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Out of the blue?

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:31.060 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Out of the blue.

00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:33.360 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they don't know
it, and they spontaneously

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:34.900 align:middle line:90%
go back to memory.

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:38.940 align:middle line:84%
I've had people start channeling
and through a regression

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:42.450 align:middle line:84%
have other beings just
step in and step through,

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:44.770 align:middle line:84%
and they're in full blown
channeling a message.

00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:49.180 align:middle line:84%
And really the key there is to
honor the space and maintain.

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:54.090 align:middle line:84%
But it really puts the
light on hypnosis as a tool

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:57.540 align:middle line:84%
to take a look and a glimpse
into future timelines

00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:01.050 align:middle line:84%
and access, again,
this archival baseline

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:02.800 align:middle line:90%
of the Akashic consciousness.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What have they said
about their ET relationships?

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:07.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: In the regressions?

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:07.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:11.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: One of the most
phenomenal regressions

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:14.010 align:middle line:84%
I have done with a
woman who continued

00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:16.090 align:middle line:90%
to channel different species.

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:18.840 align:middle line:84%
They had this
unanimous message--

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:21.810 align:middle line:84%
and this was years ago--
that we better prepare.

00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:24.100 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't a doom
and gloom message.

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:26.880 align:middle line:84%
It was of an alignment
with the shift

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:32.130 align:middle line:84%
that we better learn to harness
higher tools in our toolbox.

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:35.440 align:middle line:84%
They would say things
like, shine your light.

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.760 align:middle line:90%
Radiate it out.

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:39.850 align:middle line:84%
Push it out with
great intentionality.

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:42.580 align:middle line:84%
They also said that
over the coming years,

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:45.570 align:middle line:84%
it will be harder
and harder to contact

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:48.630 align:middle line:84%
certain beings from
neighboring galaxies

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:50.280 align:middle line:84%
and that a lot of
our information

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:52.950 align:middle line:84%
will have to come through
the resources of inner Earth

00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:54.750 align:middle line:84%
and those beings,
which I thought was

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:57.100 align:middle line:90%
a pretty phenomenal statement.

00:26:57.100 --> 00:27:00.810 align:middle line:84%
But all of them
together agreed that we

00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:04.890 align:middle line:84%
are in an epoch that's
just about unprecedented.

00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:08.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are the results of
hypnosis permanent or temporary?

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: So the results
of hypnosis are permanent.

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's not necessarily
always a one and done.

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:16.680 align:middle line:84%
You never know how
many sessions it

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:21.090 align:middle line:84%
will take to remove whatever
is binding you or blocking you

00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:23.280 align:middle line:84%
or how many sessions
it will take

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:25.300 align:middle line:90%
to contact your future self.

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:27.610 align:middle line:90%
So it's extremely permanent.

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:32.380 align:middle line:84%
And when you come back, you
don't feel different right away,

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:34.020 align:middle line:84%
but in the coming
weeks, you start

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:37.060 align:middle line:84%
to feel almost a little numb,
George, for a little while--

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:37.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:40.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --because your
foundational structure--

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:44.530 align:middle line:84%
I once did a hypnotic regression
for a celebrity singer,

00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:45.900 align:middle line:90%
a musician.

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And her regression took
her back in this life

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:51.790 align:middle line:84%
where she had a lot of trauma
and abuse from her parents.

00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:54.790 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very
successful regression.

00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:56.575 align:middle line:84%
She remembered all
of this information.

00:27:56.575 --> 00:27:58.200 align:middle line:84%
It came out in the
time that we shared.

00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was she emotional?

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:00.738 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Very, very emotional.

00:28:00.738 --> 00:28:02.280 align:middle line:84%
In hypnosis, we have
something called

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:05.580 align:middle line:84%
abreactivity or abreaction,
where the body will

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:07.855 align:middle line:90%
shake and jerk and gyrate.

00:28:07.855 --> 00:28:08.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they cry?

00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:10.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: They cry.

00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:13.200 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they will jolt
themselves out of hypnosis

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:16.390 align:middle line:84%
depending on how
deep the pain runs.

00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And she was one
of those, George.

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:21.580 align:middle line:84%
She definitely had a
lot of emoting, pain,

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:23.740 align:middle line:84%
and she was really
happy with the results.

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And she called me about
a week later saying,

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:27.520 align:middle line:90%
I can't write music.

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.362 align:middle line:90%
Put it back.

00:28:29.362 --> 00:28:30.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I can't write?

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:31.612 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: I can't write music.

00:28:31.612 --> 00:28:32.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm too calm.

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:34.640 align:middle line:90%
You need to put it back.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that was
an extraordinary point.

00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:39.140 align:middle line:84%
I convinced her to
come back and let's

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:42.780 align:middle line:84%
work on a new foundation
for her higher good.

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:44.340 align:middle line:90%
But it really does that.

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:49.020 align:middle line:84%
It takes away like an old
glove of your existence

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:52.320 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness in some ways
and gives you opportunities

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.400 align:middle line:90%
to reinvent yourself.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:58.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you say,
Bonni, hypnosis accentuates

00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:00.130 align:middle line:90%
one's psychic ability?

00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:02.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Hypnosis
definitely accentuates

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:03.700 align:middle line:90%
one's psychic ability.

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:05.800 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it
even accentuates it,

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:09.970 align:middle line:84%
but it moves the debris
away, the fear, the illusion,

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:14.490 align:middle line:84%
the bindings to allow this
natural birthright of connection

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:18.510 align:middle line:84%
to higher worlds,
the Akashic realms.

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:21.833 align:middle line:84%
And all of that psychic stuff
is just a part of that toolbox.

00:29:21.833 --> 00:29:23.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
been hypnotized?

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:25.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: So many
times, George.

00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:26.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who hypnotizes you?

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:30.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: I went to
school about 16 years ago

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:31.560 align:middle line:90%
to do this professionally.

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:33.820 align:middle line:84%
I started when I
was 10 years old.

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:34.620 align:middle line:90%
I found--

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:35.982 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's remarkable.

00:29:35.982 --> 00:29:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Well,
it was kind of one

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.430 align:middle line:90%
of those lucky circumstances.

00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:41.260 align:middle line:90%
I was living in Nevada.

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And I was of the generation
that your parents just

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:48.050 align:middle line:84%
let you roam the streets and you
eventually came back for supper.

00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:50.030 align:middle line:84%
But I was walking out on
the streets of Nevada,

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:53.960 align:middle line:84%
and I found a tape,
how to stop smoking.

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And I came home, and I put
it in my tape recorder.

00:29:58.020 --> 00:29:59.910 align:middle line:90%
And I loved the guy's voice.

00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:02.970 align:middle line:84%
He just had this
droning quality.

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:06.460 align:middle line:84%
He would just say,
go deeper and deeper.

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And so I loved
that, so I thought

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:10.790 align:middle line:90%
I would try it on my friends.

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:13.850 align:middle line:90%
And I was like 10 or 11.

00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:15.830 align:middle line:84%
And my best
girlfriend came over,

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:17.940 align:middle line:84%
and I said, hey, I
want to hypnotize you.

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:18.740 align:middle line:90%
Lay down.

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:19.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At 10 years old?

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:20.645 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: At 10 years old.

00:30:20.645 --> 00:30:22.100 align:middle line:90%
And we were just playing games.

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And I just mimicked
not the smoking part

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:28.950 align:middle line:90%
but the deeper and deeper.

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:30.560 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know it
at the time, but I

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:32.795 align:middle line:90%
was cultivating this resonance.

00:30:32.795 --> 00:30:34.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you hypnotize her?

00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:35.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: I did.

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:37.410 align:middle line:84%
She went all the
way back to age 2

00:30:37.410 --> 00:30:39.680 align:middle line:84%
where this poor
girl had witnessed

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:40.790 align:middle line:90%
the suicide of her mother.

00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:41.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, god.

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:44.238 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: But had blocked it
out, and no one had told her.

00:30:44.238 --> 00:30:45.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At 2 years old?

00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:47.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: So she
was very emotional.

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:50.130 align:middle line:84%
Her father was called
to come and pick her up.

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:52.940 align:middle line:84%
They were very angry
at me and confused.

00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:55.030 align:middle line:90%
Again, story of my life.

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And I was never allowed
to play with her again.

00:30:57.010 --> 00:30:59.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were 10 years
old when you did this?

00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:02.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: It could
have been 10, 11, 12.

00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:04.690 align:middle line:90%
It was in that bracket of age.

00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:08.285 align:middle line:84%
But I fell in love with
the process at that time.

00:31:08.285 --> 00:31:09.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you
knew it worked.

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:11.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: It worked.

00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:13.920 align:middle line:84%
So I just kept at
it in my own way

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:18.240 align:middle line:84%
until I was professionally
trained as a regressionist

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:19.870 align:middle line:90%
and certified hypnotherapist.

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And they used me as
their guinea pig,

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:25.020 align:middle line:84%
which had a lot of
amazing experiences

00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:28.560 align:middle line:84%
so that I could know what
is possible in this realm

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.010 align:middle line:90%
of altered states.

00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:32.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bonni, tell us some
of the strangest stories

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:33.570 align:middle line:90%
you've heard?

00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:34.930 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: Ever, at large?

00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:36.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ever.

00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:37.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: My gosh.

00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:38.940 align:middle line:90%
George, that is so hard.

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:40.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That you can
say on this program.

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:41.764 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: That I can--

00:31:41.764 --> 00:31:48.660 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] I am an archive
of strange stories.

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:51.540 align:middle line:84%
But I think the strangest
thing that has ever

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:53.640 align:middle line:84%
ultimately happened
to me happened to me

00:31:53.640 --> 00:32:00.420 align:middle line:84%
on March 4 of 2020, where a
being you can call it, ET, you

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:03.368 align:middle line:84%
can call it a light being walked
through the wall of my bedroom.

00:32:03.368 --> 00:32:05.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Walked through
the wall of your bedroom?

00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:07.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Walked through
the wall of my bedroom

00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:13.490 align:middle line:84%
and started discussing with
me the plight for humanity.

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:15.163 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Walking
in or walking out?

00:32:15.163 --> 00:32:17.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: It came right into my
bedroom in the middle of night.

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:20.010 align:middle line:84%
I'd heard some kind of
primal scream, which

00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:22.890 align:middle line:84%
I know in ET
experiences often people

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:25.710 align:middle line:84%
will hear a crash
or an explosion

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:27.840 align:middle line:84%
when they're about
to have an encounter.

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:30.720 align:middle line:84%
And this being walked right
through the side wall or right

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:34.620 align:middle line:84%
through my bedroom wall after
I'd woken up to this primal,

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:37.840 align:middle line:90%
it felt almost tribal scream.

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:40.160 align:middle line:90%
And almost all at once--

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:43.270 align:middle line:84%
it was through telepathic
communication--

00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:48.480 align:middle line:84%
was just giving me all of
these codes for humanity.

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And George, this was about 11
days before COVID was really

00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:56.960 align:middle line:90%
on the Western Americans' mind.

00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And this being said,
there was going

00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:02.250 align:middle line:84%
to be a push of
terror on the planet.

00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And my first instinct
was, what a rude thing

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.380 align:middle line:90%
to say about humanity.

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:08.780 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we're trying.

00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:10.610 align:middle line:84%
And it went on to
say that we were

00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:12.735 align:middle line:84%
going to have to resonate
on different frequencies.

00:33:12.735 --> 00:33:14.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But it was right.

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:15.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: It was right.

00:33:15.150 --> 00:33:19.410 align:middle line:84%
It talked a lot about
Earth's chemical environment.

00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:22.370 align:middle line:84%
It said that we would be
experiencing something

00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:27.260 align:middle line:84%
it regarded as gamma
radiation and through the very

00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:30.980 align:middle line:84%
porous field of the ionosphere,
it would be affecting us.

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:34.400 align:middle line:84%
It said that it would be
affecting the chemical table

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:37.910 align:middle line:84%
almost as if it was creating
a secondary chemical

00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:42.840 align:middle line:84%
table at large, causing almost
like a proton to proton reaction

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:46.670 align:middle line:84%
creating ionized radiation,
which all of that

00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:51.510 align:middle line:84%
is maybe above my head
on a science-based level.

00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:55.100 align:middle line:84%
But I thought it was really
interesting when COVID emerged,

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:59.150 align:middle line:84%
that it was all of this focus
on not being able to breathe.

00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:02.100 align:middle line:84%
So it said a lot more
than that, but a lot of it

00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:05.250 align:middle line:84%
was focused on the shift
and environment of Earth

00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:09.210 align:middle line:84%
and how we're going to have
to resonate at a completely

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:12.070 align:middle line:90%
different harmonic field.

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you look
at your Akashic Records,

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:17.770 align:middle line:84%
many of us in our lifetime
have done something

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:20.480 align:middle line:90%
that we're not too proud of.

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:23.000 align:middle line:84%
Can you erase that
from the book?

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: There are no
accidents, not a single one.

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And although your ego or
your fear or your shame

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:33.510 align:middle line:84%
dictates to you that
something was bad or good,

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:34.715 align:middle line:90%
it's all relevant.

00:34:34.715 --> 00:34:36.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can't
pretend it never happened.

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:37.139 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: You can't.

00:34:37.139 --> 00:34:37.949 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:34:37.949 --> 00:34:38.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is what it is.

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:39.478 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: It's divine.

00:34:39.478 --> 00:34:42.370 align:middle line:84%
It's the human psyche that's
putting labels and judgments

00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:43.170 align:middle line:90%
on it.

00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:47.010 align:middle line:84%
It's actual experience was
bigger than we'll ever know.

00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:50.400 align:middle line:84%
So erasing anything
you've ever done.

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:52.320 align:middle line:84%
We learn from things,
right, George?

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:53.784 align:middle line:90%
We definitely gain traction.

00:34:53.784 --> 00:34:54.909 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're supposed to.

00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:56.367 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: We're
supposed to learn,

00:34:56.367 --> 00:34:59.140 align:middle line:84%
but we don't want to kick
the messenger either.

00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:03.720 align:middle line:84%
You really want to live
in this equanimity state

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:07.560 align:middle line:84%
and this self-compassion
state, because if you don't

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:09.408 align:middle line:84%
have self-compassion,
you can't give it

00:35:09.408 --> 00:35:10.450 align:middle line:90%
to the rest of the world.

00:35:10.450 --> 00:35:14.070 align:middle line:84%
So I wouldn't focus on erasing
anything but just building

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:16.080 align:middle line:90%
on what you've learned.

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:18.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has been one of
the most emotional things you've

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:23.760 align:middle line:84%
done, either with a
client or yourself

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:26.810 align:middle line:84%
by accessing the
Akashic Records?

00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:29.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Some of the
most emotional experiences

00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:36.040 align:middle line:84%
I have ever had is
hitting these field lines

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:40.220 align:middle line:84%
of ancient philosophy
and information,

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:45.640 align:middle line:84%
working and unpacking
philosophies of the Shinto

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:49.270 align:middle line:84%
or philosophies of
ancient hermetics

00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:52.470 align:middle line:90%
or reading the Emerald Tablets.

00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:58.950 align:middle line:84%
It's emotional for me because
I have a simultaneous memory

00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:01.410 align:middle line:90%
of all of this being true.

00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:05.980 align:middle line:84%
A loss and a grieving that
it's not here for everyone.

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's just this
space of disconnect.

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:13.550 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so emotional,
especially when

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:15.690 align:middle line:90%
I see on television and media.

00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:19.110 align:middle line:84%
All of this fear
being projected.

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:19.910 align:middle line:90%
It's rampant.

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:22.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's literally the
cancer of our time.

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:25.820 align:middle line:84%
It's the real epidemic,
especially through television

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:28.130 align:middle line:84%
and media, because it's
going into that theta

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:32.130 align:middle line:84%
state, that hypnotic
state of our being.

00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so emotional
about it and empowered

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:40.910 align:middle line:84%
to continue to create
conscious media and teachings

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:45.260 align:middle line:84%
because yeah, it's what we
need more than anything,

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:47.270 align:middle line:90%
the eradication of fear.

00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:50.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Akashic Records,
it's an incredible book,

00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:50.970 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:54.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: It's everything
you could ever need and more.

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:58.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is detox so
important to our evolution right

00:36:58.340 --> 00:36:59.300 align:middle line:90%
now?

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Detoxing is so
important in all of the ways,

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:04.380 align:middle line:90%
mind, body, and spirit.

00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:06.290 align:middle line:84%
I think our biggest
issue is going

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:09.580 align:middle line:84%
to be the mental crisis,
our emotional health.

00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:12.600 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to have to
really cultivate whatever it

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:15.550 align:middle line:90%
means to us in emotional reset.

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:18.570 align:middle line:84%
One of the ways that you can
go about doing that, believe it

00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:21.540 align:middle line:84%
or not, George, is
creating sound currents

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:24.820 align:middle line:84%
and being intentional
like mantras.

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:27.793 align:middle line:84%
There is an ancient mystery
school teaching as well--

00:37:27.793 --> 00:37:28.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mantras work,

00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:30.220 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLISS: --going over mantra.

00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And what most people
don't know about mantra is

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:36.210 align:middle line:84%
every time you speak
this in your own mind

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:38.400 align:middle line:84%
or with your own
vocal cords, you

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:41.940 align:middle line:84%
are harmonizing with the
resonance of anyone who's ever

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:44.110 align:middle line:90%
spoken that mantra before you.

00:37:44.110 --> 00:37:47.620 align:middle line:84%
So immediately it's
strength in numbers.

00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:51.490 align:middle line:84%
So one of the best things that
we can do is use sound current.

00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:55.550 align:middle line:84%
My guides talk often
about practices

00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:58.880 align:middle line:84%
that they call Singing
the Body Electric

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:01.090 align:middle line:90%
or Singing the Bones Electric.

00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And they say through changing
the harmonic resonance

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:08.030 align:middle line:84%
of our energy field
and our physical body

00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:12.320 align:middle line:84%
can create this kind
of ascension protocol

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:15.510 align:middle line:84%
or de-densify this
physical matter.

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:17.840 align:middle line:84%
So harnessing and
using and working

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:22.010 align:middle line:84%
with these extraordinary
sciences around sound resonance

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:25.345 align:middle line:84%
and vibration, I think will
be the medicine of the future.

00:38:25.345 --> 00:38:26.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bonni,
somebody watching

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:29.960 align:middle line:84%
you right now is probably
trying to reflect

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:33.920 align:middle line:84%
on their life and their
own Akashic Records.

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:36.770 align:middle line:84%
What is the single
most important thing

00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:38.450 align:middle line:90%
they should be doing?

00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:41.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: I have
three single things.

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:44.160 align:middle line:84%
I think there are three things
that could change your life.

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:45.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are they?

00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:48.860 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: First, one would be
listening deeply to the world

00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:52.610 align:middle line:84%
around you, just taking
moments of completely stopping

00:38:52.610 --> 00:38:55.870 align:middle line:84%
in your day and listening
to whatever the birds,

00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:58.620 align:middle line:90%
the traffic, the voices.

00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:02.250 align:middle line:84%
By doing that, you're
accessing the ultimate presence

00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:06.150 align:middle line:84%
of your moment and really
opening that portal

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:08.070 align:middle line:90%
to the Akashic Records.

00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:10.890 align:middle line:84%
The second thing that you can
do that would change your life

00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:16.510 align:middle line:84%
completely is slow down,
walk slower, speak slower.

00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:19.740 align:middle line:84%
The slower that you do
anything, your frequency

00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:22.530 align:middle line:90%
rises and expands.

00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:24.240 align:middle line:84%
The third thing
that I would suggest

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:26.430 align:middle line:84%
to somebody that wanted
to change their life

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:31.110 align:middle line:84%
or get in this amazing alignment
with the Akashic consciousness

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:33.880 align:middle line:90%
is trust your life.

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:35.850 align:middle line:90%
There are no accidents.

00:39:35.850 --> 00:39:39.390 align:middle line:84%
Every moment that you
experience your soul

00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:42.400 align:middle line:84%
has put that in front of
you to walk through it.

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:44.440 align:middle line:90%
So don't live in regret.

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:47.430 align:middle line:84%
Try not to stay in a
puddle of shame and guilt

00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:48.880 align:middle line:90%
if you can help it.

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Everything is by divine
patterning and purpose.

00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:56.140 align:middle line:10%
So if you can maybe play
around with those three things,

00:39:56.140 --> 00:40:00.620 align:middle line:10%
I guarantee you you will see a
radical adjustment to your life.

00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:01.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well said.

00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:03.210 align:middle line:84%
How do people get a
hold of you, Bonni?

00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:04.585 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: So they
can contact me

00:40:04.585 --> 00:40:07.330 align:middle line:84%
through my site,
psychicbonni.com.

00:40:07.330 --> 00:40:10.360 align:middle line:10%
Or they can visit me
at my retreat center,

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:13.330 align:middle line:10%
The Dome in Hot
Springs, Arkansas,

00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:17.080 align:middle line:10%
where we use sound
and resonance healing.

00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And the name of
our retreat center

00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:21.400 align:middle line:84%
is called The Legend
of Greater Things.

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:23.592 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bonni, thanks for
being on "Beyond belief."

00:40:23.592 --> 00:40:25.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLISS: Thank
you for having me.

00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:26.633 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I can't go
back into the past

00:40:26.633 --> 00:40:29.000 align:middle line:84%
and rewrite things
that I've done,

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.550 align:middle line:90%
but I can't control my future.

00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:34.270 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:37.620 align:middle line:90%
