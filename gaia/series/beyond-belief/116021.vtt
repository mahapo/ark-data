or what it was used for.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.960 align:middle line:10%
But Jim believes this site
may contain evidence of a lost

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.044 align:middle line:10%

passageways and crypts
around the country

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.180 align:middle line:10%

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.480 align:middle line:10%
In the Smithsonian
ethnology reports,

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.450 align:middle line:10%
there are 17 accounts of
7-foot and taller skeletons.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.900 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: Finding such
evidence at the Goshen site

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.170 align:middle line:10%

the Vieiras called

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.949 align:middle line:10%

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.055 align:middle line:10%

>>RICK LYNCH: It's been a long

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.465 align:middle line:10%
>>Richard Lynch, he's just
a wealth of information,

00:01:45.465 --> 00:01:46.470 align:middle line:10%
and he's open-minded.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.240 align:middle line:10%
He doesn't really
believe in giants.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.040 align:middle line:10%
But hopefully, we
can find something

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.610 align:middle line:10%
and try to convince him.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.620 align:middle line:10%
>>Gentlemen, these
are our original plans

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.720 align:middle line:10%
of the structure from 1980.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.780 align:middle line:90%
This is the short tunnel.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.000 align:middle line:84%
This is the north tunnel
and then this much longer

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.660 align:middle line:90%
south tunnel.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.600 align:middle line:10%
The old Goshen law was that
the tunnel is 120 feet long,

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.810 align:middle line:10%
but we only got so far
down through there.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.200 align:middle line:10%
Legend has it there's a
room at the end of it.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.140 align:middle line:10%
That part of the theory
permeates everything,

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.520 align:middle line:10%
that there is an
underground room.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.650 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: Up until
now, no one has ever

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.310 align:middle line:10%
been able to prove the
chamber's existence.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.710 align:middle line:10%
But the Vieiras are counting
on their stone masonry

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.494 align:middle line:10%
background and some new
technology to find it.

00:02:36.494 --> 00:02:38.535 align:middle line:10%
>>JIM VIEIRA: Jim Whitall
tried to find a chamber

00:02:38.535 --> 00:02:40.190 align:middle line:10%
and he ended up failing.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.620 align:middle line:10%
Goshen Historical Society,
they tried and failed.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.060 align:middle line:10%
A bunch of farmers
drunk on moonshine,

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.540 align:middle line:10%
they tried and failed.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.712 align:middle line:10%
So we hope to try and
hopefully not fail.

00:02:50.712 --> 00:02:52.170 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY:
Well, what you just

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.440 align:middle line:10%
saw was an excerpt from
the History Channel,

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.830 align:middle line:10%
where Jim Vieira
and his brother Bill

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.770 align:middle line:10%
go hunting for giants, actual
giants, skeletons of giants.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.420 align:middle line:84%
He's also the co-author of
the book, "Giants on Record."

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.650 align:middle line:84%
Wow, they're really
out there, Jim, huh?

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.830 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.330 align:middle line:84%
>>JIM VIEIRA: Thanks
for having me, George.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.330 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, I kind of fell
into this mystery.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.820 align:middle line:10%
I'll give a little background.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.751 align:middle line:90%
I'm a stonemason by trade.

00:03:21.751 --> 00:03:23.375 align:middle line:84%
My brother and I both
studied economics

00:03:23.375 --> 00:03:25.100 align:middle line:84%
at the University
of Massachusetts.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And I've done years of research,
historical detective work,

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.960 align:middle line:84%
trying to make the case
that Native Americans built

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.920 align:middle line:90%
with stone in New England.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.082 align:middle line:84%
And the mainstream theory is
that, for whatever reason,

00:03:37.082 --> 00:03:38.540 align:middle line:84%
that Natives didn't
bill the stone.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.360 align:middle line:84%
Although, all around the
country, including the Ohio

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.280 align:middle line:84%
River Valley, all
down south, there

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.920 align:middle line:84%
were massive stone
wall complexes,

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:54.011 align:middle line:84%
and anthropomorphic forms,
and burial tombs of stone

00:03:54.011 --> 00:03:54.510 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.140 align:middle line:84%
So in New England, you
have these mysterious stone

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.890 align:middle line:84%
chambers, and serpents of stone,
and turtles, and balance rocks.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.160 align:middle line:84%
And I said, let's look
at the historical record.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.600 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at the documents
of the colonists showing up,

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.240 align:middle line:90%
to see if we can verify this.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And many accounts have--
like John Pynchon, 1654,

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.850 align:middle line:84%
showing up in Gungywamp,
Pequot, Connecticut and talking

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.240 align:middle line:84%
about a mysterious stone
chamber that's there.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.727 align:middle line:84%
And so it was verifying that
case, which is only natural.

00:04:22.727 --> 00:04:24.810 align:middle line:84%
Native Americans have been
around in the Northeast

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.950 align:middle line:84%
for about 12,000 years,
often building with stone,

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:29.880 align:middle line:90%
we believe.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.320 align:middle line:84%
But I ran into an account
of an 8-foot skeleton

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.930 align:middle line:84%
with double rows of
teeth in George Sheldon's

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.560 align:middle line:90%
1895 "History."

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 8-foot skeleton?

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.720 align:middle line:84%
>>VIEIRA: A head as
big as a peck basket

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.830 align:middle line:90%
with double rows of teeth.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that Sheldon
was very well-respected.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.340 align:middle line:90%
He was this Mass state senator.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.630 align:middle line:84%
He founded the museum and
a library in Deerfield.

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.430 align:middle line:84%
So I went and I talked to
one of the curators there.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.984 align:middle line:84%
And I said, did you know that
Sheldon talked about this giant

00:04:56.984 --> 00:04:58.400 align:middle line:84%
with double rows
of teeth that was

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.679 align:middle line:84%
unearthed by Henry Mather,
analyzed by Stephen Williams?

00:05:01.679 --> 00:05:03.720 align:middle line:84%
He talked to Stephen
Williams, who taught anatomy

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.150 align:middle line:90%
at Berkshire College.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.000 align:middle line:84%
So I went in and I was given
his archaeological scrapbook

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.990 align:middle line:90%
on the table.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to say was
it was my "Da Vinci Code."

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.570 align:middle line:84%
I really got this
electrical surge.

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a pretty dense dude,
and I knew what was in there.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.000 align:middle line:84%
I open it up, and he
had multiple accounts

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.570 align:middle line:84%
of giant skeletons
being unearthed

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:22.900 align:middle line:90%
with double rows of teeth.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:23.736 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:05:23.736 --> 00:05:25.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VIEIRA: And then
I got together

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.317 align:middle line:84%
with Hugh Newman, Ross
Hamilton, Mikey Hughes,

00:05:27.317 --> 00:05:29.650 align:middle line:84%
these other researchers who
worked with Native Americans

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.310 align:middle line:90%
like Ross did.

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And I found accounts,
and we found

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.560 align:middle line:84%
counts all around the
country, from Catalina Island

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.820 align:middle line:84%
to Martha's Vineyard,
and oftentimes indicating

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.486 align:middle line:84%
double rows of teeth,
which is really strange.

00:05:41.486 --> 00:05:43.110 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
controversy around it.

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.430 align:middle line:90%
We approach it in the show.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.270 align:middle line:90%
Is it the parlance of the time?

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.950 align:middle line:90%
Was it ground down teeth?

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.550 align:middle line:90%
What was it?

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.540 align:middle line:84%
But the moral of the story is,
we've encountered over 1,000

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.760 align:middle line:84%
accounts of 7-foot and taller
skeletons in man-made burial

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:03.070 align:middle line:84%
sites and mounds, 17
7'-plus skeletons indicated

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.170 align:middle line:84%
in the Smithsonian ethnology
reports, noted historians,

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.460 align:middle line:84%
doctors, "New York
Times," on and on and on.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And we're just trying
to make the case

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.770 align:middle line:84%
that it's worthy of
further investigation.

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were they
human-like skeletons?

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:16.173 align:middle line:90%
>>VIEIRA: Yes.

00:06:16.173 --> 00:06:17.275 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:17.275 --> 00:06:18.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just bigger.

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:19.205 align:middle line:90%
>>VIEIRA: Just bigger.

00:06:19.205 --> 00:06:21.350 align:middle line:90%
And there are many theories.

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.271 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting now is we
have new scientific information

00:06:25.271 --> 00:06:25.770 align:middle line:90%
coming out.

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.310 align:middle line:84%
Like the Denisovans,
40,000 years ago,

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.400 align:middle line:84%
in the Siberian cave, they mated
with humans and Neanderthals.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And the only evidence
they have is two teeth

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.810 align:middle line:84%
and a finger bone of a woman
that's very robust, very broad.

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.220 align:middle line:90%
And the tooth is very large.

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And they came from
heidelbergensis.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Heidelbergensis was originally
found, I believe, in 1911.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And they date back from
200,000 to 600,000 years ago.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.620 align:middle line:84%
But there was a strain or
a branch of heidelbergensis

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.140 align:middle line:90%
found in South Africa.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And Professor Lee Berger
claims, or indicates,

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.274 align:middle line:84%
that they were well over
seven feet, oftentimes.

00:07:02.274 --> 00:07:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And they haven't found
a complete femur,

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.200 align:middle line:84%
but they found these
massive joints and femur

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.470 align:middle line:84%
bones that indicate a
population that is enormous.

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And to get back to
my point, Denisovans

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:14.125 align:middle line:90%
came from heidelbergensis.

00:07:14.125 --> 00:07:17.350 align:middle line:84%
They're the ancestors that
interbred with humans.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.566 align:middle line:84%
So we're not just throwing
a crazy theory out there.

00:07:19.566 --> 00:07:20.940 align:middle line:84%
We're bringing in
archaeologists,

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:25.285 align:middle line:84%
anthropologists, skeptics to
try to figure out this mystery.

00:07:25.285 --> 00:07:27.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happened
to these giants?

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:29.590 align:middle line:90%
I mean, where are they?

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:33.020 align:middle line:84%
>>VIEIRA: You see people
with pituitary problems that

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:37.420 align:middle line:84%
represent giants sometimes,
but you see 7-foot tall people.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.060 align:middle line:90%
It's a very good question.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:42.430 align:middle line:84%
I think Ross Hamilton, the
"Godfather of Giantology,

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:43.462 align:middle line:90%
he's on the show.

00:07:43.462 --> 00:07:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And Ross would say, from his
working with Native Americans,

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.490 align:middle line:84%
that there was a royal
class of Native Americans.

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:54.270 align:middle line:84%
And it was interbreeding that
kept this royal class alive.

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And that might be a reason
for the anatomic anomaly

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:59.040 align:middle line:90%
of double rows of teeth.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.790 align:middle line:84%
Also reported were
massive jawbones

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:02.714 align:middle line:84%
that could fit over
the face of the finder.

00:08:02.714 --> 00:08:04.130 align:middle line:84%
So in the United
States, you would

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:06.200 align:middle line:84%
have a royal class that
basically died out,

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.320 align:middle line:90%
unfortunately, along with the--

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.737 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So that's
what happened--

00:08:09.737 --> 00:08:10.944 align:middle line:90%
>>VIEIRA: That is the belief.

00:08:10.944 --> 00:08:11.755 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --extinct.

00:08:11.755 --> 00:08:13.880 align:middle line:84%
>>VIEIRA: What's interesting
is the early explorers

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.580 align:middle line:90%
also said the same thing.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:21.050 align:middle line:84%
John Smith, Lawson, De
Soto, Coronado, Magellan.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:23.830 align:middle line:84%
From Patagonia to
Virginia, they all,

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:27.860 align:middle line:84%
in the 1400s, 1500s, and 1600s,
encountered giant humans.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's strange is
that biblically speaking,

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:35.049 align:middle line:84%
the Bible talks about
the Nephilim, the giants.

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:40.860 align:middle line:84%
And could these creatures,
these beings, have been them?

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.100 align:middle line:84%
>>VIEIRA: We
entertain that theory

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.380 align:middle line:90%
in episode six of our show.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.354 align:middle line:84%
We hook up with LA Marzulli,
who is a friend of mine,

00:08:47.354 --> 00:08:48.270 align:middle line:90%
and he's a researcher.

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:49.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good guy.

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:50.361 align:middle line:90%
>>VIEIRA: He's a real good guy.

00:08:50.361 --> 00:08:51.950 align:middle line:90%
And I don't discount any of it.

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:54.310 align:middle line:84%
I look at the Bible and I
see accounts of six fingers

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:56.450 align:middle line:90%
and six toes, the giant of Gath.

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:59.100 align:middle line:84%
Moses sends out scouts, and
he talks about encountering

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:00.090 align:middle line:90%
giant humans.

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:02.320 align:middle line:84%
We look like grasshoppers
in their sight.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.820 align:middle line:84%
This isn't myths
and fairy tales.

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:09.620 align:middle line:84%
It's hard written evidence
of scouting excursions.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.380 align:middle line:84%
It's a very
interesting prospect.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
petroglyphs all

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.790 align:middle line:84%
around the Southwest with six
fingers and six toe, sometimes

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:17.740 align:middle line:90%
giant size.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:19.149 align:middle line:90%
It's very compelling.

00:09:19.149 --> 00:09:20.190 align:middle line:90%
Where did they come from?

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:21.630 align:middle line:90%
Some would say Atlantis.

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:22.589 align:middle line:90%
Edgar Cayce would say--

00:09:22.589 --> 00:09:23.171 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:09:23.171 --> 00:09:24.700 align:middle line:84%
>>VIEIRA: He has
a specific account

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:27.750 align:middle line:84%
of a Mound Builder in Florida
who was of giant size,

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:34.280 align:middle line:84%
belonging to a race much
larger than modern day humans.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And he says,
specifically in Atlantis,

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:37.620 align:middle line:90%
10- and 12-foot humans existed.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And you could say that's
a lot of nonsense.

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:44.040 align:middle line:84%
But now that haplogroup X
mitochondrial DNA research

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.870 align:middle line:84%
lines up with Cayce's accounts
of where the Atlantean

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:51.170 align:middle line:84%
migrants went 12,000 years
ago-- the Iroquois Indians,

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:53.625 align:middle line:84%
they have 25% of
mitochondrial X1

00:09:53.625 --> 00:09:56.120 align:middle line:90%
DNA-- it's utterly fascinating.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.899 align:middle line:90%


00:09:58.899 --> 00:10:00.190 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to be long-winded.

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:02.170 align:middle line:84%
I'll say, Dennis Stanford
at the Smithsonian

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:04.110 align:middle line:84%
has the Solutrean
hypothesis that

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:08.389 align:middle line:84%
is spawned by this, by artifact
finds, and by the haplogroup X.

00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:10.430 align:middle line:84%
On both sides of the
Atlantic, this is occurring.

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:13.105 align:middle line:84%
And he might have it in reverse,
that you might have refugees

00:10:13.105 --> 00:10:17.649 align:middle line:84%
from a lost colony that
account for this haplogroup X.

00:10:17.649 --> 00:10:19.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, Jim, you
bring up the Smithsonian.

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:22.670 align:middle line:84%
Aren't they the subject
of a lot of controversy?

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:26.990 align:middle line:84%
That they have these
skeletons stored away,

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:29.340 align:middle line:90%
and they're not telling anybody?

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:30.340 align:middle line:90%
>>VIEIRA: Absolutely.

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:35.150 align:middle line:84%
I have learned-- I
started diligent research,

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:37.920 align:middle line:84%
I'll say, just being a
relentless researcher years

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:38.677 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:10:38.677 --> 00:10:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And I've had to burn it all
down and start from scratch.

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:43.960 align:middle line:84%
Because you have the hardened
debunkers on one side

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:48.290 align:middle line:84%
and, I have to say, the true
believers who want to believe,

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:50.150 align:middle line:84%
and they don't apply
logic and reason.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:53.220 align:middle line:84%
And they reiterate
things that aren't true.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:53.970 align:middle line:90%
So I've tried to--

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:54.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That doesn't help.

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:55.170 align:middle line:90%
>>VIEIRA: It doesn't help.

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:56.290 align:middle line:90%
It really doesn't.

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:59.630 align:middle line:84%
There was a reason why
people-- I think they find our,

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:02.370 align:middle line:84%
basically, the way
society is reprehensible,

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.730 align:middle line:90%
the dehumanization of people.

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:08.271 align:middle line:84%
Just there is something amiss
in society and people know it.

00:11:08.271 --> 00:11:10.020 align:middle line:84%
And there are real
conspiracies out there.

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:11.780 align:middle line:90%
There's no question about it.

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:14.900 align:middle line:84%
But oftentimes, things don't
get looked at objectively

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.120 align:middle line:84%
because people, they're
infuriated with the system,

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.060 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:19.572 align:middle line:84%
Then you have
trolls and debunkers

00:11:19.572 --> 00:11:21.530 align:middle line:84%
on the other side, who
aren't objective either,

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:24.520 align:middle line:84%
and don't look at a holistic
approach to these things.

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.650 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to scientists
at the Smithsonian.

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:29.230 align:middle line:84%
I've engaged and am friends
with many anthropologists

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:31.010 align:middle line:84%
and archaeologists
at this point.

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:32.926 align:middle line:84%
And I don't believe in
the present day there's

00:11:32.926 --> 00:11:34.440 align:middle line:90%
some mass conspiracy going on.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.860 align:middle line:84%
I would say, 100 years ago, when
anthropology was being formed,

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:41.060 align:middle line:84%
there were some
particular racist heads

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.250 align:middle line:84%
of the Smithsonian,
like Dr. Hrdlicka.

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:45.950 align:middle line:84%
And he believed in
cranial measurement.

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:49.190 align:middle line:84%
And he had some
nauseating comments

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:52.130 align:middle line:84%
about African Americans
and Native Americans,

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:54.440 align:middle line:84%
and how they were
inferior to whites.

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.840 align:middle line:10%
I believe that the
idea of giant skeletons

00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:02.420 align:middle line:10%
got lumped in with the lost race
theory of who built the mounds.

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:03.420 align:middle line:10%
The Europeans showed up.

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:04.490 align:middle line:10%
They said, these
Native Americans

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:06.090 align:middle line:10%
couldn't have
built these mounds.

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:07.850 align:middle line:90%
It was a lost race.

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:11.830 align:middle line:84%
But we now know it was the
ancestors of Native Americans

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:13.920 align:middle line:84%
that built these
incredible earthen

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.297 align:middle line:90%
pyramids in geometric form.

00:12:15.297 --> 00:12:16.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There's one in Cahokia.

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:18.550 align:middle line:84%
>>VIEIRA: One in
Cahokia, 100-foot high,

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:20.400 align:middle line:84%
with the base larger
than the Great Pyramid

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.500 align:middle line:90%
in Egypt, a four-step pyramid.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:23.250 align:middle line:90%
It's just amazing.

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:24.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
something in that, Jim.

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:25.520 align:middle line:84%
>>VIEIRA: There is
something in that.

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.330 align:middle line:84%
Actually, they found
in 1999, there's

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.280 align:middle line:84%
a stone tomb in the
middle of it, when they

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.092 align:middle line:90%
were supporting the side of it.

00:12:31.092 --> 00:12:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And Greg Little is
a buddy of mine.

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And he's brilliant
and objective,

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:37.600 align:middle line:90%
and he believes the same.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But why the
controversy from Smithsonian?

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:43.090 align:middle line:90%
Why hold back this information?

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:46.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what so
damaging about telling

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:50.355 align:middle line:84%
the world skeletons of
giants roamed this planet.

00:12:50.355 --> 00:12:52.230 align:middle line:84%
>>VIEIRA: Within their
own ethnology reports,

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:55.630 align:middle line:84%
they have 17 accounts of
7-foot and taller skeletons,

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:57.310 align:middle line:90%
sometimes approaching 8-foot.

00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:00.610 align:middle line:10%
Alton, Illinois, 1873, in
the "Twelfth Annual Report,"

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:04.740 align:middle line:10%
I believe, there
was a skull listed

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:09.620 align:middle line:10%
as 36 inches in diameter,
which is outrageous.

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:12.940 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Ironically, in Alton,
didn't that person live--

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:14.830 align:middle line:10%
he had a pituitary problem.

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:16.170 align:middle line:90%
Robert Walden, I think.

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:16.836 align:middle line:90%
>>VIEIRA: Bingo.

00:13:16.836 --> 00:13:17.690 align:middle line:90%
It's funny, yes.

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:19.000 align:middle line:90%
But there were multiple skulls.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.750 align:middle line:84%
They crumbled to dust,
much like other accounts,

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:23.120 align:middle line:90%
because they were so ancient.

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.370 align:middle line:84%
But these skeletons didn't
get up and move around.

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:26.830 align:middle line:90%
They were measured.

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:29.420 align:middle line:84%
There are many reports
of enormous skeletons

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:31.260 align:middle line:84%
being found by the
Smithsonian scientists

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.235 align:middle line:84%
and going to the Smithsonian,
there the controversy.

00:13:34.235 --> 00:13:35.860 align:middle line:84%
That's why people
are asking questions.

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:38.109 align:middle line:84%
Were there some funny business
going on 100 years ago?

00:13:38.109 --> 00:13:39.640 align:middle line:90%
So we know from school.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:40.890 align:middle line:90%
We didn't learn about Cahokia.

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:42.730 align:middle line:84%
We didn't learn
about geometric forms

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:45.080 align:middle line:84%
and how amazing Native
civilizations were.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And this is another remarkable
part of the civilizations,

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:52.310 align:middle line:84%
like enormous kings and queens
buried with pearls, and copper

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:55.480 align:middle line:90%
crowns, and things like that.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:56.450 align:middle line:90%
Look at the NFL now.

00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:57.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm a Patriots fan.

00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:59.824 align:middle line:84%
You get Tom Brady
getting hung out to dry.

00:13:59.824 --> 00:14:01.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're happy
about that, right?

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:02.400 align:middle line:84%
>>VIEIRA: I'm happy
about Judge Berman.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:06.030 align:middle line:84%
>>VIEIRA: But the point is that
the corporations aren't people.

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:07.238 align:middle line:90%
They don't operate like that.

00:14:07.238 --> 00:14:08.819 align:middle line:84%
It's a bunch of lap
dogs and yes-men.

00:14:08.819 --> 00:14:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And even at the highest
levels of the Smithsonian

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:13.690 align:middle line:84%
now, you have figures that
are accepting donations

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:18.160 align:middle line:84%
from the Koch brothers to have
these ridiculous permanent

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.261 align:middle line:84%
installations that basically
are debunking global warming.

00:14:21.261 --> 00:14:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And that got me in
trouble at my TED Talk,

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:23.950 align:middle line:90%
because I went off on a rant.

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:24.825 align:middle line:90%
Because I was pissed.

00:14:24.825 --> 00:14:27.194 align:middle line:84%
I was like, you have
brilliant scientists

00:14:27.194 --> 00:14:28.860 align:middle line:84%
at the Smithsonian
just doing their job.

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And then you have yes-men
allowing this to happen.

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:35.885 align:middle line:90%
So I don't have the answers.

00:14:35.885 --> 00:14:36.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm trying to--

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:38.676 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they're afraid
of something, obviously.

00:14:38.676 --> 00:14:40.530 align:middle line:84%
You don't hide
things unless you're

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:42.360 align:middle line:90%
afraid of the information.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.499 align:middle line:90%
There's no other reason.

00:14:44.499 --> 00:14:45.123 align:middle line:90%
>>VIEIRA: Yeah.

00:14:45.123 --> 00:14:45.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:50.200 align:middle line:84%
Or trying to stick
with manifest destiny.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:53.280 align:middle line:84%
Or there could be
particular theories

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.700 align:middle line:90%
that just want to be met.

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:55.630 align:middle line:90%
It's very compelling.

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:56.546 align:middle line:90%
It's very interesting.

00:14:56.546 --> 00:14:58.610 align:middle line:84%
I will say, on our
show, what I do

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:02.240 align:middle line:84%
is we try to engage
skeptics, and scientists,

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.660 align:middle line:84%
and professionals,
and ask their opinion,

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:07.380 align:middle line:84%
and let's follow the
scientific method.

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And let's bring
science to mystery

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.900 align:middle line:84%
and not just make
crazy theories.

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:11.460 align:middle line:90%
Let's see.

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:13.500 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
compelling stuff going

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.880 align:middle line:84%
on-- hobbits in
Indonesia, Denisovans,

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:17.820 align:middle line:90%
events heidelbergensis.

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:19.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Giants in Afghanistan.

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.320 align:middle line:90%
We've heard that story.

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:20.903 align:middle line:90%
>>VIEIRA: Yes.

00:15:20.903 --> 00:15:25.010 align:middle line:84%
A giant hand axe was found
in 2009 by Oxford scientists,

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:29.630 align:middle line:84%
4 12-inch and longer,
the largest stone axes

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:33.070 align:middle line:84%
ever found at this
dry basin in Africa,

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:35.190 align:middle line:84%
mixed with thousands
of normal-sized tools.

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:37.360 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know
what to make of it.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.470 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean?

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:42.049 align:middle line:84%
There's giant artifacts
all around the globe too.

00:15:42.049 --> 00:15:43.090 align:middle line:90%
There's a million angles.

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:47.550 align:middle line:84%
Mystics like Edgar Cayce, Rudolf
Steiner, the Theosophists,

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:51.710 align:middle line:84%
the Freemasons, the Rosicrucians
all talk about giants.

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:54.100 align:middle line:84%
And there's proof
that Atlantis existed.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:56.680 align:middle line:90%
It's just a wild freak show.

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.119 align:middle line:84%
And I look at myself, and
I like to think of myself

00:15:59.119 --> 00:16:00.285 align:middle line:90%
as objective and reasonable.

00:16:00.285 --> 00:16:01.980 align:middle line:90%
And I've been thrust into this--

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:02.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's not easy, is it?

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:03.310 align:middle line:90%
>>VIEIRA: --"Twilight Zone."

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:05.544 align:middle line:84%
It's not easy, because
I take a lot of hits.

00:16:05.544 --> 00:16:07.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think there
are some of these giants

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:11.150 align:middle line:84%
on the planet today
that maybe we see them

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:13.130 align:middle line:90%
in our daily walks of life?

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:15.320 align:middle line:90%
They're just tall people.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.070 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I've been on airplanes.

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:21.180 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen some guy come in
who could barely stoop down,

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:22.490 align:middle line:90%
he was so tall.

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:25.470 align:middle line:84%
Might they have been
descendants of these people?

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:28.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VIEIRA: You have King
Kamehameha in Hawaii.

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:31.930 align:middle line:84%
He is the king that
took all the islands

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:34.090 align:middle line:90%
and incorporated one kingdom.

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:38.090 align:middle line:84%
He was known to be like
7-foot, maybe 8-foot tall.

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:41.300 align:middle line:84%
He lifted this massive
boulder that is still there.

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:45.770 align:middle line:84%
They have his long
cape that is enormous.

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:48.340 align:middle line:84%
I think there was a royal
class of giant people

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:50.950 align:middle line:84%
that might have been descended
from heidelbergensis,

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:52.570 align:middle line:90%
Denisovans, who knows?

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:54.670 align:middle line:84%
A mystery race that
we haven't found yet.

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:57.530 align:middle line:84%
It's not like bones are lying
all around the place that

00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:59.390 align:middle line:90%
are 50,000 years old.

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:01.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it's very probable.

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And if you talk to
guys like Steve Quayle,

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:05.109 align:middle line:84%
they might tell you a story
about the Solomon Islands.

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:07.230 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY:
Oh, that's right.

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:09.810 align:middle line:90%
I'll interject some science.

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:12.159 align:middle line:84%
Brian Greene did a
4-part special for--

00:17:12.159 --> 00:17:13.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great physicist.

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.369 align:middle line:90%
>>VIEIRA: --PBS, right?

00:17:14.369 --> 00:17:16.440 align:middle line:90%
Theoretical physicist.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.400 align:middle line:84%
"The Edge of the Cosmos,"
I think that it was.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.191 align:middle line:90%
And it's brilliant.

00:17:19.191 --> 00:17:21.890 align:middle line:84%
And it just talks about how
it's basically uniformly

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:25.880 align:middle line:84%
agreed that quantum physicists
tell us that our reality is not

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:29.210 align:middle line:84%
what we think, that time
does not exist like we think,

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:33.650 align:middle line:84%
that this entire universe is a
projection from a source they

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:36.350 align:middle line:84%
can't find within the
realm of time and space.

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:40.360 align:middle line:84%
It's like the really giant
mystery here is something else.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:43.070 align:middle line:84%
There's a holographic
reality to everything,

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:44.710 align:middle line:84%
and you have to look
at these things.

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:47.150 align:middle line:84%
You have to look at the
fabric, the nature of reality

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:49.050 align:middle line:84%
to start to understand
these mysteries.

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:50.970 align:middle line:84%
Who knows about
what is going on?

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:53.000 align:middle line:90%
Multidimensional activity.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.070 align:middle line:84%
I hate to throw something out
there that is not so concrete,

00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:57.890 align:middle line:90%
but we don't know.

00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And we have to bring in science
to answer these questions

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:04.090 align:middle line:84%
and be open-minded
and humble about it.

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:06.175 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could cavemen
have been giants

00:18:06.175 --> 00:18:10.940 align:middle line:84%
as well, those huge,
huge beings that

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:13.727 align:middle line:90%
lived maybe with dinosaurs?

00:18:13.727 --> 00:18:15.060 align:middle line:90%
>>VIEIRA: Another good question.

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:16.830 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely a possibility.

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And you could have
coexisting civilizations

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:22.560 align:middle line:84%
that existed, a more primitive
state and a more advanced

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:25.860 align:middle line:84%
state, just like our current
civilization that is very

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:27.380 align:middle line:90%
advanced, and we have tribes.

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:31.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh my god, you still
have cannibals and tribes

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:32.620 align:middle line:90%
living in tents.

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:34.582 align:middle line:84%
>>VIEIRA: Well, One thing
about oral tradition

00:18:34.582 --> 00:18:36.290 align:middle line:84%
too is that you'll
look around the world,

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:38.846 align:middle line:84%
and indigenous oral tradition
tells the same story.

00:18:38.846 --> 00:18:40.970 align:middle line:84%
They talk about a great
cataclysm, probably 10,000,

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:42.240 align:middle line:90%
12,000 years ago.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.890 align:middle line:90%
They talk about little people.

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:47.760 align:middle line:84%
They talk about giants, and
it's consistent everywhere.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
the floresiensis

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.482 align:middle line:90%
in Indonesia in 2004.

00:18:52.482 --> 00:18:54.340 align:middle line:84%
You have nine beings
that were basically

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:57.130 align:middle line:84%
3-foot tall on the
island of Indonesia.

00:18:57.130 --> 00:19:01.190 align:middle line:84%
And the Ebu Gogo was the
mythical little people

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:05.010 align:middle line:84%
that were pointed to by the
indigenous people of Indonesia.

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:06.896 align:middle line:90%
And this could be them.

00:19:06.896 --> 00:19:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And you have the same
myths and legends.

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:14.790 align:middle line:84%
A comparative mythologist would
say, what do oral traditions

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:16.120 align:middle line:90%
tell us about the past?

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:20.060 align:middle line:84%
Cataclysm, small
people, giants, and it's

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:21.440 align:middle line:90%
like a "Lord of the Rings."

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:24.970 align:middle line:84%
They all tell us that, so
I am open to every angle

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:27.655 align:middle line:90%
and historical accounts too.

00:19:27.655 --> 00:19:30.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were these
giants cannibals, Jim?

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:31.189 align:middle line:90%
I heard that.

00:19:31.189 --> 00:19:32.730 align:middle line:84%
>>VIEIRA: Well, they
talk about that,

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:35.650 align:middle line:84%
like the Karankawa was in
Texas, 6 and 1/2, 7-foot tall

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:36.880 align:middle line:90%
sometimes.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.190 align:middle line:90%
And that's from Wikipedia.

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:41.160 align:middle line:84%
It was well known
that they were huge.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.100 align:middle line:90%
That is a good question.

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:44.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, quite possibly.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:48.350 align:middle line:84%
They've found cannibalistic
activities that

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:50.984 align:middle line:90%
occurred at different places.

00:19:50.984 --> 00:19:53.400 align:middle line:84%
Scientists of the time, when
they uncovered these remains,

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.910 align:middle line:84%
they would find
marrow that gnawed.

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't
survival cannibalism.

00:19:57.790 --> 00:19:59.980 align:middle line:90%
It seemed like a ritual thing.

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:02.670 align:middle line:90%
That is the religious narrative.

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:06.000 align:middle line:84%
There was a malevolent
race of giants, basically.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
David and Goliath.

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:08.870 align:middle line:90%
That's an incredible story.

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:10.665 align:middle line:90%
I think Goliath was a giant.

00:20:10.665 --> 00:20:11.540 align:middle line:90%
>>VIEIRA: Absolutely.

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:14.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Philistine, but
I think he was a giant.

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:14.690 align:middle line:90%
>>VIEIRA: Yes.

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:16.980 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I'd love to get
into a time machine.

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:19.070 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you, there
were Chinese guards

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:21.090 align:middle line:84%
that were noted to be
9- and 10-foot tall,

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:23.320 align:middle line:90%
the giant of Gabara, 9-foot 9.

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:27.360 align:middle line:84%
These are accounts
of living people made

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.520 align:middle line:84%
by the chronicles of the
time throughout history,

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.900 align:middle line:90%
Flavius Josephus.

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:34.220 align:middle line:84%
They talk about not
only bones of these men

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:37.010 align:middle line:84%
of enormous proportions
existing but also

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:41.300 align:middle line:84%
live giants, some
strain of humanity.

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:44.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If they lived,
how far back did they live?

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:50.507 align:middle line:84%
>>VIEIRA: I would say,
as far back as humans.

00:20:50.507 --> 00:20:52.340 align:middle line:84%
That's what science is
trying to figure out.

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:53.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Hundreds of
thousands of years?

00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:56.285 align:middle line:84%
>>VIEIRA: Hundreds of thousands
of years ago, absolutely.

00:20:56.285 --> 00:20:57.820 align:middle line:90%


00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:02.000 align:middle line:84%
It's really on science now to
keep coming up with new finds

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.740 align:middle line:84%
and to analyze them
and to see is there--

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:07.790 align:middle line:84%
we just found Denisovans
a couple of years ago.

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:09.500 align:middle line:90%
It's like, wow.

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:12.010 align:middle line:84%
Oversized finger bone,
a very large tooth--

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:13.750 align:middle line:90%
we cover that in the show.

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:17.510 align:middle line:84%
Interbreeding with Neanderthals
and humans in a cave in Siberia

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:19.160 align:middle line:90%
at least 40,000 years ago.

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:22.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They constantly
are finding new species

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:26.550 align:middle line:90%
of ancient humans and mankind.

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:30.290 align:middle line:84%
Have we ever found any
children's skeletons

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:32.330 align:middle line:90%
of what would have been giants?

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:33.275 align:middle line:90%
>>VIEIRA: Listed, yes.

00:21:33.275 --> 00:21:35.800 align:middle line:90%


00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:38.080 align:middle line:84%
That's a problematic
thing a lot of these bones

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:41.160 align:middle line:84%
are repatriated in the United
States because of NAGPRA laws.

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.742 align:middle line:84%
Understandably, they
go back in the ground.

00:21:43.742 --> 00:21:45.450 align:middle line:84%
But then you have like
Kennewick Man, who

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:47.460 align:middle line:90%
was contested by native tribes.

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:48.980 align:middle line:90%
And it looks like he came from--

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:49.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was he a giant?

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:50.930 align:middle line:90%
>>VIEIRA: No, he wasn't a giant.

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:52.305 align:middle line:84%
He was a little
oversized, maybe.

00:21:52.305 --> 00:21:54.450 align:middle line:90%
I think he was 5'10", 5'8".

00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:58.020 align:middle line:84%
But he shows characteristics
of the ancient Polynesians

00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:01.900 align:middle line:84%
and Japanese, And the question
is, where did Native Americans

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:02.650 align:middle line:90%
come from?

00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of-- it's
a real hot button topic.

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:08.020 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
racist people who

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:10.010 align:middle line:90%
are trying to claim otherwise.

00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:14.310 align:middle line:84%
So it's a real-- you
must tread carefully.

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:18.009 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, my take is I just
want the truth to come out.

00:22:18.009 --> 00:22:19.050 align:middle line:90%
Where did they come from?

00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:21.170 align:middle line:84%
Were there migrations
from the Pacific?

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:23.540 align:middle line:84%
Were there migrations from
a continent in the Atlantic?

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:27.050 align:middle line:84%
Were there giant people involved
in these migrations that

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:30.790 align:middle line:84%
made it here that were viewed
as the builders of society,

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:33.540 align:middle line:84%
the temple priests
from a lost continent?

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:34.040 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:37.400 align:middle line:84%
Native oral tradition
speaks of that sometimes.

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.980 align:middle line:90%
But you've got to be careful.

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:40.900 align:middle line:90%
We want science to decide this.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:44.990 align:middle line:84%
And Native Americans have really
got the short end of the stick,

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:47.005 align:middle line:90%
and terribly so.

00:22:47.005 --> 00:22:51.074 align:middle line:84%
And it's just ended up we're
in a really contentious time

00:22:51.074 --> 00:22:52.490 align:middle line:84%
trying to figure
these things out.

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:54.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm just trying to be
objective and reasonable.

00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:55.831 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's
amazing though to me,

00:22:55.831 --> 00:22:57.900 align:middle line:90%
Jim, is what happened to them?

00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:59.030 align:middle line:90%
Where did they go?

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:00.840 align:middle line:90%
How did they die off?

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:01.750 align:middle line:90%
Because they're gone.

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:03.580 align:middle line:90%
>>VIEIRA: Yes.

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could they have
been extraterrestrials,

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:07.690 align:middle line:84%
and they just all
picked up and left?

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:08.770 align:middle line:90%
What happened to them?

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:10.530 align:middle line:90%
>>VIEIRA: Another good point.

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:11.630 align:middle line:90%
Where do humans come from?

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:14.220 align:middle line:90%
Where's the missing link?

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.210 align:middle line:90%
Genetic intervention.

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:18.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm not an Anunnaki
guy, but you look

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:22.510 align:middle line:90%
at these different theories.

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:25.080 align:middle line:84%
It's perfectly reasonable
to investigate where

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.620 align:middle line:90%
humans came from genetically.

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:30.405 align:middle line:84%
Were we genetically created and
seeded and put on this planet?

00:23:30.405 --> 00:23:33.520 align:middle line:84%
And humans are a species
that needs to be quarantined.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:36.630 align:middle line:84%
What we've done to the planet,
and the way we've, like I said,

00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:40.307 align:middle line:84%
dehumanized, and the lack of
empathy, and things like this--

00:23:40.307 --> 00:23:41.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's crazy.

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:42.098 align:middle line:90%
>>VIEIRA: --it's crazy.

00:23:42.098 --> 00:23:43.650 align:middle line:90%
So is that just evolution?

00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:44.510 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't seem so.

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:49.300 align:middle line:84%
It's like we're a slave species,
like theoretically in minds,

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:50.070 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And now we're just--
there's probably

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:56.040 align:middle line:84%
some intelligent species
that's like, this strain has

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:58.730 align:middle line:84%
to be quarantined till
it gets its act together.

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have
stories of giants,

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:03.970 align:middle line:84%
but we have also stories
of little people,

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:06.270 align:middle line:90%
very small people.

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:09.680 align:middle line:84%
This planet must have had
an abundance of everything.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.610 align:middle line:84%
>>VIEIRA: Cayce and
Steiner both talk

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:14.145 align:middle line:84%
about that, the mystics
about little people existing

00:24:14.145 --> 00:24:16.020 align:middle line:84%
on Atlantis too, which
is another curve ball.

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:17.840 align:middle line:84%
It's like, why would
they just make that up?

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:18.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.590 align:middle line:10%
>>VIEIRA: And then
like Lewis and Clark,

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:21.506 align:middle line:10%
you have all the Native--
I'll quickly say it.

00:24:21.506 --> 00:24:24.690 align:middle line:10%
Ross Hamilton, he worked
with Vine Deloria, who

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:26.720 align:middle line:10%
wrote "Red Earth, White Lies."

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.640 align:middle line:90%
He was the Lakota Elder.

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:29.360 align:middle line:90%
He was brilliant.

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.400 align:middle line:90%
He was friends with Velikovsky.

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.800 align:middle line:84%
He had a different
version of reality

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.030 align:middle line:90%
than mainstream science does.

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:39.660 align:middle line:84%
And he got together
the native elders

00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:42.182 align:middle line:84%
to have a conference about
giants and little people.

00:24:42.182 --> 00:24:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And he said the oral
tradition of little people

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:45.630 align:middle line:90%
was much stronger.

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:48.770 align:middle line:84%
Lewis and Clark went out and
met with the Native tribes,

00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:52.140 align:middle line:84%
and they were afraid to go
to Spirit Mountain in South

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:55.120 align:middle line:84%
Dakota, because of the legends
of the malevolent little

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:57.550 align:middle line:84%
people, who would basically
kill you with poison darts.

00:24:57.550 --> 00:24:59.990 align:middle line:84%
So he went up there
armed with a bunch of--

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:01.697 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How small were they?

00:25:01.697 --> 00:25:02.530 align:middle line:90%
>>VIEIRA: Like this.

00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:03.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 2 feet, maybe.

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:05.040 align:middle line:90%
>>VIEIRA: 2 and 3 feet.

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:06.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Fully
proportioned little people.

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:08.665 align:middle line:84%
>>VIEIRA: And that's
all these Native tribes.

00:25:08.665 --> 00:25:11.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, go out and live
outdoors for like six months

00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:12.970 align:middle line:90%
and see how tough it is.

00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:14.850 align:middle line:84%
These people were
tied to the land.

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:16.450 align:middle line:84%
They were tied to
the understanding

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:18.350 align:middle line:90%
of the cycles of nature.

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And they were tied to an
oral tradition that would not

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:27.020 align:middle line:84%
be filled with erroneous
literature or content,

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:28.305 align:middle line:90%
for lack of a better word.

00:25:28.305 --> 00:25:29.680 align:middle line:84%
So they're telling
these stories,

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.070 align:middle line:84%
and they're terrified
to go to this place.

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And Lewis and Clark went
up there to investigate.

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:38.896 align:middle line:84%
It's just fascinating that
you have these people saying

00:25:38.896 --> 00:25:39.520 align:middle line:90%
the same thing.

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:40.811 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All around the planet.

00:25:40.811 --> 00:25:41.480 align:middle line:90%
What a planet.

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:42.855 align:middle line:84%
>>VIEIRA: What a
planet, exactly.

00:25:42.855 --> 00:25:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And that is like-- talk
to a quantum physicist.

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:47.150 align:middle line:90%
Talk to a geneticist.

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:48.700 align:middle line:90%
Talk to an anthropologist.

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, get
them off the record,

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:54.780 align:middle line:84%
and they'll all say,
what a strange planet.

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:57.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do I
think that someplace

00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:03.644 align:middle line:84%
in some multimillionaire's house
there are skeletons of giants?

00:26:03.644 --> 00:26:04.310 align:middle line:90%
>>VIEIRA: Bingo.

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:06.760 align:middle line:84%
I bet you there's an Illuminati
freak with a 12-foot giant.

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:07.185 align:middle line:90%
I swear.

00:26:07.185 --> 00:26:07.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, absolutely.

00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:08.984 align:middle line:84%
>>VIEIRA: Yes,
I'm with you, man.

00:26:08.984 --> 00:26:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And you could say,
show me the proof.

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:12.940 align:middle line:84%
My gut-- when you're an
investigator, when you're

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:15.450 align:middle line:84%
a detective, like if you're
a good cop, you're up at 3:00

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:16.420 align:middle line:90%
in the morning.

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:18.000 align:middle line:90%
You just follow your gut.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.120 align:middle line:84%
And the universe
is never so lazy

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.830 align:middle line:90%
to have coincidences everywhere.

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:24.260 align:middle line:84%
And you keep following,
and you use your intuition.

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And you're open-minded,
and you take

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:27.220 align:middle line:90%
in everybody's information.

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:30.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't care if they're
religious-minded or

00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:31.670 align:middle line:90%
conspiracy-minded.

00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:32.980 align:middle line:90%
You take it all in.

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:35.790 align:middle line:84%
And you do your homework,
and you go with your gut.

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And my gut tells me that--
that this is a reality,

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:41.042 align:middle line:84%
and there is a 12-foot
skeleton-- I'm telling you.

00:26:41.042 --> 00:26:42.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In somebody's house.

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:43.120 align:middle line:90%
>>VIEIRA: I really feel so.

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:45.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he has
parties, and all his friends

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:47.070 align:middle line:90%
see it, and everything.

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:49.340 align:middle line:90%
"Eyes Wide Shut"--

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:50.270 align:middle line:90%
>>VIEIRA: Bingo.

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:50.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --all over again.

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:53.218 align:middle line:84%
>>VIEIRA: And my buddy, Hugh
Newman-- you know Hugh-- we've

00:26:53.218 --> 00:26:54.310 align:middle line:90%
co-authored this book.

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And we've put together-- I've
met my match in obsessive,

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:01.310 align:middle line:90%
driven researcher in Hugh.

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:01.940 align:middle line:90%
And he's great.

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:02.770 align:middle line:90%
He's brilliant.

00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:04.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What drives you?

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:06.150 align:middle line:90%
>>VIEIRA: What drives me?

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:11.000 align:middle line:84%
In the show, we've been
contacted by so many people.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.870 align:middle line:84%
Mothers who said,
I love your show.

00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:17.820 align:middle line:84%
I could sit down with my son and
watch it and not be offended.

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:19.980 align:middle line:90%
You show care for other people.

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:23.295 align:middle line:84%
You show camaraderie,
humility, respect.

00:27:23.295 --> 00:27:25.420 align:middle line:84%
You bring in professionals
that are really engaged.

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:26.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you're
a good guy, Jim.

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:28.470 align:middle line:90%
You're a good guy.

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:31.470 align:middle line:84%
>>VIEIRA: I like to try to
follow a moral code where

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:33.017 align:middle line:84%
you're kind and
you're thoughtful.

00:27:33.017 --> 00:27:34.100 align:middle line:90%
And people watch our show.

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:35.920 align:middle line:84%
There's no destruction
of the environment.

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.400 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing crazy going on.

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.240 align:middle line:84%
We spend all our
time researching

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.970 align:middle line:90%
in libraries and caves.

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
sense of adventure,

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:45.920 align:middle line:84%
and there's a sense
of drive that we all

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.030 align:middle line:90%
share something the same.

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:51.357 align:middle line:84%
Let's figure these mysteries
out, and let's not be arrogant.

00:27:51.357 --> 00:27:52.440 align:middle line:90%
Let's make it interesting.

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you love
doing what you're doing.

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:55.280 align:middle line:90%
>>VIEIRA: Well, I do.

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.884 align:middle line:90%
I love doing stone work.

00:27:56.884 --> 00:27:58.300 align:middle line:84%
On the weekends,
if I wasn't here,

00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:01.060 align:middle line:84%
I'd be building a 14-foot
stone tower in the woods,

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:03.170 align:middle line:90%
or I'd be doing some research.

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:05.139 align:middle line:84%
And I try to convey
that to people.

00:28:05.139 --> 00:28:06.680 align:middle line:84%
You obviously love
doing what you do,

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:07.805 align:middle line:90%
and you're brilliant at it.

00:28:07.805 --> 00:28:11.985 align:middle line:84%
So it's just like that
is the cure for humanity

00:28:11.985 --> 00:28:15.040 align:middle line:84%
is do what your love in
the face of all rejection.

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:16.554 align:middle line:90%
And we want to convey that.

00:28:16.554 --> 00:28:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And people have
taken shots at us,

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:18.980 align:middle line:84%
like you guys are
our of you're mind.

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:20.604 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, I'm just
making a case that's

00:28:20.604 --> 00:28:22.005 align:middle line:84%
worthy of further
investigation--

00:28:22.005 --> 00:28:23.255 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a great mystery.

00:28:23.255 --> 00:28:24.588 align:middle line:90%
>>VIEIRA: It is a great mystery.

00:28:24.588 --> 00:28:30.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I don't know if we
were able to officially reveal

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:32.770 align:middle line:84%
that this planet
had giants roaming

00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:35.930 align:middle line:84%
on it, what the humankind
significance would be.

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:37.280 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what would people say?

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:38.770 align:middle line:90%
How would they react?

00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:41.130 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be a common
denominator somewhere.

00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:46.080 align:middle line:84%
There's something somewhere that
these beings, these giants that

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:50.100 align:middle line:84%
roamed this planet, had
something very special about.

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:53.710 align:middle line:84%
There's something I can't
put my finger on yet.

00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:55.450 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
you've theorized that,

00:28:55.450 --> 00:28:57.540 align:middle line:84%
whether they were,
as we talked about,

00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:03.090 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial creatures,
or they were truly biblical

00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:04.820 align:middle line:90%
from the fallen angels.

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:08.692 align:middle line:84%
But there's something there
that I can't find yet.

00:29:08.692 --> 00:29:10.400 align:middle line:84%
>>VIEIRA: I think in
Snowden's documents,

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:13.965 align:middle line:84%
I think the president of
Iran was talking about 8-

00:29:13.965 --> 00:29:17.220 align:middle line:90%
and 9-foot humanoids existing.

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if it was
based on the Snowden material,

00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:22.250 align:middle line:84%
but I'll say that
Karen Hudes, I think

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:25.189 align:middle line:84%
her name was, former
counsel at the World Bank,

00:29:25.189 --> 00:29:26.855 align:middle line:84%
gave all this
whistleblower information.

00:29:26.855 --> 00:29:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And within it, she talked about
beings with elongated skulls

00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:33.920 align:middle line:84%
who go back to the Ice Age
are in control of the banking

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:37.540 align:middle line:90%
system and the Vatican.

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:38.720 align:middle line:90%
She actually said that.

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:41.109 align:middle line:84%
She was a former lead
counsel, and she came out

00:29:41.109 --> 00:29:41.900 align:middle line:90%
as a whistleblower.

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:42.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's dramatic.

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:43.616 align:middle line:90%
>>VIEIRA: Right?

00:29:43.616 --> 00:29:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And you have to look at what
is going on on this planet.

00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:48.129 align:middle line:90%
What does skull elongation--

00:29:48.129 --> 00:29:48.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All about?

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:49.628 align:middle line:90%
>>VIEIRA: --mean?

00:29:49.628 --> 00:29:50.470 align:middle line:90%
All about, right?

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:52.220 align:middle line:84%
I talked to a lot of
anthropologists and--

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:54.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now those aren't
giants, though, are they?

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.930 align:middle line:84%
>>VIEIRA: A lot of them
in the United States,

00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:57.660 align:middle line:84%
in the anatomic
anomalies chapter,

00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:01.120 align:middle line:84%
they were a giant
with elongated skulls.

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:02.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like 7-, 8-foot tall?

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:03.043 align:middle line:90%
>>VIEIRA: Yes.

00:30:03.043 --> 00:30:04.540 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sometimes more than that.

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And you have many
accounts of this.

00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:09.490 align:middle line:84%
What is going on with
skull elongation?

00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:13.580 align:middle line:84%
What happened cataclysmically
12,000, 15,000 years ago?

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:17.520 align:middle line:84%
Was it like Graham Hancock
says, like a mass hypnosis,

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:20.880 align:middle line:84%
or a mass-- like we all
have PTSD, basically,

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:21.690 align:middle line:90%
from this event.

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And if quantum
physicists are correct,

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:29.910 align:middle line:84%
we are creating our
reality collectively.

00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:32.180 align:middle line:84%
Basically, with the contents,
the software programing

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:35.400 align:middle line:84%
with the mind, we look at a star
20 billion light years away.

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:39.200 align:middle line:84%
We change it at the subatomical
level by looking at it.

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.080 align:middle line:84%
Is that because it's
changing out there

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:42.920 align:middle line:84%
or because it's coming
from the projector?

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:44.730 align:middle line:90%
It's coming from the projector.

00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:47.320 align:middle line:84%
So we are a species
with amnesia,

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.190 align:middle line:84%
and we're kind of
stumbling around the dark,

00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:50.430 align:middle line:90%
trying to figure out.

00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:53.070 align:middle line:84%
And I'll also say, all
throughout history, we

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:53.760 align:middle line:90%
have been wrong.

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.870 align:middle line:84%
Every civilization has
been predominantly wrong

00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:57.010 align:middle line:90%
with their theories.

00:30:57.010 --> 00:30:58.080 align:middle line:90%
What do we have wrong?

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:01.010 align:middle line:84%
Why are we so arrogant to think
that a vast majority of what

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:02.990 align:middle line:90%
we think is true is not.

00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:06.170 align:middle line:84%
The Clovis barrier falls,
new finds all the time,

00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:07.760 align:middle line:84%
it's worthy of
further investigation.

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.510 align:middle line:84%
You should not be
chastised because you're

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:10.520 align:middle line:90%
asking these questions.

00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:11.500 align:middle line:90%
Something is amiss.

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:14.502 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These beings with
the elongated skulls look

00:31:14.502 --> 00:31:15.252 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial--

00:31:15.252 --> 00:31:15.880 align:middle line:90%
>>VIEIRA: They do.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:16.588 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --to me.

00:31:16.588 --> 00:31:17.250 align:middle line:90%
Don't they?

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:20.370 align:middle line:10%
>>VIEIRA: Sonora,
Mexico, three years ago--

00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:24.370 align:middle line:10%
we were going to visit there,
the lost city of giants.

00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:26.940 align:middle line:10%
We talked to Carlos Hayes,
the son of Paxson Hayes,

00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:28.670 align:middle line:10%
the great explorer of the '30s.

00:31:28.670 --> 00:31:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And we have pictures
of him with a giant--

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:32.830 align:middle line:84%
it's all in the book--
a giant mummified head

00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:35.930 align:middle line:84%
in a gourd, bundled burials
of 7 and 1/2 foot mummies.

00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:36.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're talking
that big, aren't we?

00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:37.210 align:middle line:90%
>>VIEIRA: Yes.

00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:37.770 align:middle line:90%
It was huge.

00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:40.290 align:middle line:84%
And we talked to Carlos,
and he said his dad,

00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:42.140 align:middle line:84%
once he started reporting
these giant finds,

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:45.430 align:middle line:84%
he was friends with the Yaqui
Indians, he lost his funding.

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:47.260 align:middle line:84%
But they found 13
skulls out of I

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:49.060 align:middle line:84%
think like 24 a
couple years ago.

00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:50.210 align:middle line:90%
And they're wild-looking.

00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:53.600 align:middle line:84%
They look alien-- in
the Sonora region also.

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.930 align:middle line:84%
If you ask Brian Forest,
if you ask LA Marzulli--

00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:58.221 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to speak for
them, brilliant researchers--

00:31:58.221 --> 00:32:00.835 align:middle line:84%
they would probably say that--
and Steve Quayle-- skull

00:32:00.835 --> 00:32:03.539 align:middle line:84%
elongation, giant people,
and megalithic structures

00:32:03.539 --> 00:32:05.080 align:middle line:84%
have something to
do with each other.

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:06.496 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yes,
they're all related.

00:32:06.496 --> 00:32:08.490 align:middle line:84%
>>VIEIRA: Being a
stonemason, I'll tell you.

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:11.120 align:middle line:84%
From that perspective,
there is no way

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:14.560 align:middle line:84%
that the societies that
were purported to build

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:17.290 align:middle line:84%
certain things like the
Great Pyramid, the walls

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:19.970 align:middle line:84%
of Sacsayhuaman, the
stuff at Pumapunku,

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:21.520 align:middle line:90%
no way they could pull that off.

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:24.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
you're a stonemason.

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:27.070 align:middle line:84%
You've got that
kind of experience.

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:30.410 align:middle line:84%
The pyramids of
Egypt, I believe were

00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:33.380 align:middle line:84%
done with some kind of
extraterrestrial help

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:36.690 align:middle line:84%
or something to move
those blocks into place.

00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:41.550 align:middle line:84%
But I've always wondered if
we had massive-sized giants

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:48.110 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, where to them
they were like a smaller scale

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:51.860 align:middle line:84%
block would be to us
today, and that maybe they

00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:55.300 align:middle line:84%
were 20 feet tall, and
it was easy for them

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:56.532 align:middle line:90%
to move these blocks around.

00:32:56.532 --> 00:32:57.240 align:middle line:90%
It that possible?

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.948 align:middle line:84%
>>VIEIRA: It's a
fascinating possibility.

00:32:58.948 --> 00:33:01.240 align:middle line:84%
The earliest rendition
of Stonehenge--

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:03.660 align:middle line:84%
I think it's in the
Tapestry, in like AD 1200--

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:07.940 align:middle line:84%
shows Merlin with a giant,
with a normal-sized person

00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:08.895 align:middle line:90%
building Stonehenge.

00:33:08.895 --> 00:33:09.770 align:middle line:90%
Now, Hugh found that.

00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:13.630 align:middle line:84%
It's in the book, in his
"Fee-Fi-Fo-Fum" introduction.

00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:17.681 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very-- I would
say, oral history of Egypt

00:33:17.681 --> 00:33:18.680 align:middle line:90%
would talk about giants.

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:21.630 align:middle line:84%
They would talk about
a sunken continent

00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:23.850 align:middle line:84%
to the west, not the
east, in the Atlantic.

00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:27.200 align:middle line:84%
They would probably
line up with this idea.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:27.700 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:28.750 align:middle line:90%
Something's going on.

00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:29.820 align:middle line:90%
You see Christopher Dunn.

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:31.680 align:middle line:84%
You see "The Revelation
of the Pyramids,"

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:34.310 align:middle line:84%
the special I just
watched again last night.

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:35.690 align:middle line:90%
Somethings going on with that.

00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:37.480 align:middle line:84%
You cannot pull
off those angles.

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:42.450 align:middle line:84%
You cannot pull off-- it was
basically ground zero for a map

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:44.960 align:middle line:84%
that represented the
circumference of the Earth

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:49.880 align:middle line:84%
and so many other things,
the speed of light,

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:51.020 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:51.910 align:middle line:90%
It really looks like.

00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:55.130 align:middle line:90%


00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Why are the most sophisticated,
largest stone structures

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:00.861 align:middle line:90%
on the planet always the oldest?

00:34:00.861 --> 00:34:02.485 align:middle line:84%
Shouldn't it go in
the other direction?

00:34:02.485 --> 00:34:03.401 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:34:03.401 --> 00:34:07.570 align:middle line:84%
Is there in your opinion,
Jim, a sophisticated plan

00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:11.179 align:middle line:84%
to suppress information,
to keep it hidden?

00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:13.070 align:middle line:90%
>>VIEIRA: I think so.

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:16.060 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, I know
so many professionals.

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:17.230 align:middle line:90%
You get to a point, though.

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:19.980 align:middle line:84%
If there was some
spectacular find in current,

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:21.600 align:middle line:90%
in real time, quite possibly.

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:22.440 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:24.227 align:middle line:90%
That's definitely a possibility.

00:34:24.227 --> 00:34:25.310 align:middle line:90%
It could be another thing.

00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:28.840 align:middle line:84%
It could be just, like I said,
a species with amnesia, where we

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:30.219 align:middle line:90%
keep the truth from ourselves.

00:34:30.219 --> 00:34:33.300 align:middle line:84%
We keep it out of grasp,
because it keeps going,

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:35.280 align:middle line:90%
and it seems like right there.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.620 align:middle line:84%
We have basically
every form of proof

00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:41.900 align:middle line:84%
that giants existed, except more
skeletal evidence, like boom.

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:43.440 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at
the whole story,

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:45.639 align:middle line:84%
it's like it's all
pointing to that reality.

00:34:45.639 --> 00:34:47.659 align:middle line:90%
It's the oddest thing.

00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:51.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why can't we get
anthropologists to come forward

00:34:51.850 --> 00:34:53.309 align:middle line:90%
and say this stuff?

00:34:53.309 --> 00:34:55.850 align:middle line:84%
>>VIEIRA: I think because they
have to be cautious by nature.

00:34:55.850 --> 00:34:56.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
they afraid of?

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:59.256 align:middle line:84%
>>VIEIRA: I don't think-- well,
I would say it's more of a

00:34:59.256 --> 00:35:01.730 align:middle line:84%
there are things like--
you get into this area,

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:04.110 align:middle line:84%
like we had Todd Disotell
on, who's a really nice guy.

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:05.760 align:middle line:90%
He's really, really bright.

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:06.762 align:middle line:90%
And he'd speculate.

00:35:06.762 --> 00:35:08.470 align:middle line:84%
He's like, I'm a
physical anthropologist.

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:09.780 align:middle line:90%
I need physical proof.

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And I would say, well,
from a historical detective

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:13.660 align:middle line:90%
standpoint, look at this.

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:15.480 align:middle line:84%
And he really-- that's
just not his thing.

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:17.521 align:middle line:84%
You could get a different
kind of anthropologist,

00:35:17.521 --> 00:35:20.410 align:middle line:84%
like a social anthropologist,
to look at it.

00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:24.250 align:middle line:84%
I would say that they
have to be cautious.

00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:25.930 align:middle line:84%
They get into these
realms, and they

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:28.960 align:middle line:84%
get mixed up sometimes
with ideas that

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.270 align:middle line:90%
are considered pseudoscience.

00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe they won't
advance in their careers.

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:34.157 align:middle line:90%
They won't get funding.

00:35:34.157 --> 00:35:35.740 align:middle line:84%
There's definitely
an academic filter.

00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:36.739 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're scared.

00:35:36.739 --> 00:35:39.140 align:middle line:84%
There's a reason they're
scared about something.

00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:40.915 align:middle line:84%
>>VIEIRA: You don't want to
get into this realm of where

00:35:40.915 --> 00:35:42.540 align:middle line:84%
you just can objectively
talk about it.

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think it would
be a great discovery.

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:44.970 align:middle line:90%
>>VIEIRA: Of course.

00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:46.511 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because if
they came forward

00:35:46.511 --> 00:35:50.640 align:middle line:84%
with one of these skeletons
there put together.

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:51.266 align:middle line:90%
>>VIEIRA: Yeah.

00:35:51.266 --> 00:35:52.931 align:middle line:84%
I hear stories all
the time, and they're

00:35:52.931 --> 00:35:55.250 align:middle line:84%
infuriating when they don't
lead to physical evidence.

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:57.710 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like you.

00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:59.250 align:middle line:90%
I want answers.

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:01.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't give a rat's
ass about what it is.

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.760 align:middle line:84%
I just want the
truth of the matter,

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:07.320 align:middle line:84%
and let's figure out what it
is by bringing science in.

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:10.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you ever going to
stop doing what you're doing?

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:12.480 align:middle line:90%
>>VIEIRA: No, I would say--

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because you
are all over the place.

00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:19.100 align:middle line:84%
>>VIEIRA: What my gut tells
me is that I the continent

00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:20.440 align:middle line:90%
of Atlantis existed.

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:23.230 align:middle line:84%
I've read through so much
of the Cayce readings

00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:24.900 align:middle line:90%
and Plato's stuff.

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:30.190 align:middle line:84%
Like the Indian-- the old text
of the continent of India,

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:33.830 align:middle line:84%
Indian people talk about the
continent of an Atlantis.

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:35.380 align:middle line:84%
They just give it
a different name.

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:36.480 align:middle line:90%
It isn't all just Plato.

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:38.646 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there might
have been giants there too.

00:36:38.646 --> 00:36:39.690 align:middle line:90%
>>VIEIRA: Yes, exactly.

00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:42.780 align:middle line:84%
So I really feel
there was a mystery,

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:46.020 align:middle line:84%
that there were the lost Hall of
Records talked about by Cayce.

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:47.770 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you, I
looked-- he was basically

00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:51.030 align:middle line:84%
a healer who just started
talking about these past lives

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:52.160 align:middle line:90%
of people.

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:55.540 align:middle line:84%
The internal consistency
of the 14,000 readings,

00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:58.225 align:middle line:84%
25 million words of the Cayce
material is mind-blowing.

00:36:58.225 --> 00:36:58.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is.

00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:00.270 align:middle line:84%
>>VIEIRA: A skeptic can
pick a couple holes--

00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:01.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And extremely accurate.

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:02.820 align:middle line:84%
>>VIEIRA: Extremely
accurate, right?

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:04.040 align:middle line:90%
And what does my gut tell me?

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:07.060 align:middle line:84%
My intuition must
count for something.

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think we all share
all holographic reality,

00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:09.810 align:middle line:90%
once again.

00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think that, for me, is
the greatest "Indiana Jones"

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:16.860 align:middle line:84%
quest is to find the lost
continent of Atlantis.

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And, at the very least,
I will maybe free people

00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:24.169 align:middle line:90%
from the idea of being trapped.

00:37:24.169 --> 00:37:25.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, do I catch a lot of heat?

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:29.199 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people take-- people
personally insult me, which

00:37:29.199 --> 00:37:30.490 align:middle line:90%
where I'm from, that's go time.

00:37:30.490 --> 00:37:30.860 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:31.568 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They do?

00:37:31.568 --> 00:37:32.840 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:37.695 align:middle line:84%
>>VIEIRA: Because they
feel that I'm engaged

00:37:37.695 --> 00:37:39.620 align:middle line:90%
in wild speculation, maybe.

00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:41.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're a researcher.

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:42.162 align:middle line:90%
You're hunting for answers.

00:37:42.162 --> 00:37:42.870 align:middle line:90%
>>VIEIRA: I know.

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:43.370 align:middle line:90%
I know, man.

00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:45.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why put
somebody like that down?

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:48.100 align:middle line:84%
>>VIEIRA: Because--
not Todd Disotell.

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:48.850 align:middle line:90%
He's a great guy.

00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:50.000 align:middle line:90%
He's a skeptic.

that is how they get a hit.

00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:21.880 align:middle line:90%
That is their thing.

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:24.620 align:middle line:84%
It's dopamine hitting the brain
to really ridicule someone,

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:26.124 align:middle line:90%
to pick apart their arguments.

00:38:26.124 --> 00:38:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
bloggers who do that.

00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And then they have followers,
and then they kind of share

00:38:30.970 --> 00:38:33.610 align:middle line:90%
this glee of demeaning someone.

00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:35.390 align:middle line:90%

00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:45.880 align:middle line:84%
And you could say, show me

That's what my gut tells me.

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And it also tells me
that Atlantis existed.

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And you're like,
who is this dude?

00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:56.482 align:middle line:84%
He's a stonemason, he studied

I just know as an investigator.

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:04.850 align:middle line:84%
Like if there were a murder, I
would want a detective like me

00:39:04.850 --> 00:39:05.952 align:middle line:90%
on the scene.

00:39:05.952 --> 00:39:07.910 align:middle line:84%
Not because, oh, I'm so
brilliant, or whatever.

00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:10.640 align:middle line:84%
I just have that
drive to figure out.

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And I swear, I do
have that objectivity.

00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:14.390 align:middle line:84%

came from Sayre, Pennsylvania,

of the skull, people keep
replaying that on the internet.

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:23.250 align:middle line:90%
We debunked that whole thing.

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:26.110 align:middle line:90%
We debunked many other accounts.

00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:29.662 align:middle line:84%
We're being objective, and we're
trying to honestly figure out

00:39:29.662 --> 00:39:30.370 align:middle line:90%
what is going on.

It's not just like, eh, you
might not find anything.

explain all these Smithsonian

00:40:04.074 --> 00:40:04.990 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't measure?

Is that what you've got?

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:06.680 align:middle line:90%
That's your game?

they have human artifacts

all around them?

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:12.410 align:middle line:90%
The other side is pretty weak.

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:15.970 align:middle line:10%

in every manner of historical

00:40:21.515 --> 00:40:25.340 align:middle line:10%
there were skeletons over 7
feet from Martha's Vineyard,

Mismeasurement, mastodon
bones, disarticulation,

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:44.121 align:middle line:84%
pituitary disorders,
mismeasurements.

what would that be?

It sounds weird.

00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:13.380 align:middle line:84%
But if we found records that
indicated that there was a lost

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:16.590 align:middle line:84%
civilization, that they had the
same conflicts of basically,

00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:18.660 align:middle line:84%
you would say, good
and evil, service

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:20.810 align:middle line:84%
to others versus
service to the self,

00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:23.090 align:middle line:84%
and they disintegrated
because of these conflicts,

00:41:23.090 --> 00:41:24.660 align:middle line:84%
and we had information
about that,

00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:27.136 align:middle line:84%
people would take a look
back, just take a step back.

00:41:27.136 --> 00:41:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And they would look at
the systems of control

00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:31.920 align:middle line:84%
in our society, and say,
it has to be different.

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:35.460 align:middle line:84%
We're going off a freaking
cliff with overpopulation,

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:39.460 align:middle line:84%
with the way humans are
treated, with the way

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:40.672 align:middle line:90%
there's corporate control.

00:41:40.672 --> 00:41:41.630 align:middle line:90%
How do we do it better?

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:42.740 align:middle line:90%
How do we be kinder?

00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:45.030 align:middle line:84%
How do we have respect
for all life forms?

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:46.900 align:middle line:90%
You get involved in a war.

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:52.314 align:middle line:90%
go to the pound to get a cat.

00:41:52.314 --> 00:41:53.730 align:middle line:84%
I have to send my
friend to do it,

00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:55.240 align:middle line:84%
because it breaks
my heart so much.

00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:56.370 align:middle line:90%
It breaks my heart.

00:41:56.370 --> 00:41:58.620 align:middle line:10%
And it's just like there are
so many humans like that,

00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:01.150 align:middle line:10%
that possess this empathy
and compassion, that

00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:02.460 align:middle line:10%
want a different world.

So how can that get done?

00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:05.730 align:middle line:10%
Maybe through
displaying that there

00:42:05.730 --> 00:42:08.480 align:middle line:10%
was a civilization that,
in part, did it right

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:10.460 align:middle line:10%
and is facing what we are.

00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:12.490 align:middle line:84%
