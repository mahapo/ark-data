>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.890 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and we have
an amazing program for you.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.280 align:middle line:90%
Paul Selig is with us.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.850 align:middle line:90%
He's a spiritual channeler.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:27.850 align:middle line:90%
And what does that mean?

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.300 align:middle line:90%
Well, we'll get into that.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.640 align:middle line:84%
But I want you to take a
little look at who he is.

>>PAUL SELIG: I hear.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm a clairaudient
and I'm an empath.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.808 align:middle line:84%
So I hear things
and I feel things.

00:00:45.808 --> 00:00:49.430 align:middle line:90%


00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.620 align:middle line:84%
I use the word
channel because it's

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.070 align:middle line:84%
the word that seems to be the
most appropriate to what I do.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.230 align:middle line:90%


00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.740 align:middle line:90%
Some people call me a medium.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And to the extent
that I'm operating

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.640 align:middle line:84%
as a medium between two
levels of consciousness,

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.870 align:middle line:90%
that's appropriate.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.167 align:middle line:84%
But channel is the word that
I'm most comfortable with.

documentary done on Paul's life

several years ago.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.810 align:middle line:90%
Paul, welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SELIG: Thanks for having me.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:29.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
about the little dog.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:30.660 align:middle line:10%

She's gone.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.353 align:middle line:10%
I haven't seen her
for a couple years.

00:01:34.353 --> 00:01:34.500 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh no.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.370 align:middle line:10%
>>SELIG: She passed.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.657 align:middle line:10%
But she was great.

00:01:36.657 --> 00:01:38.240 align:middle line:84%
And she actually
loved the channeling.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.906 align:middle line:84%
She used to sit in
my lap when I'd work,

00:01:39.906 --> 00:01:41.781 align:middle line:84%
and she'd go knock right
out into the energy.

>>NOORY: She was sweet.

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:44.113 align:middle line:90%
How old was she when she passed?

00:01:44.113 --> 00:01:45.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SELIG: She was 12
when she went, yeah.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, that's kind
of young for a small dog,

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:48.330 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SELIG: Yeah well
she was a rescue.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.195 align:middle line:90%
She could have been 100.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, who knows?

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.480 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.300 align:middle line:84%
Well good for you
for doing that, too.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.004 align:middle line:90%
You saved a soul.

00:01:56.004 --> 00:01:56.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SELIG: Ah, thanks.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've been
a spiritual channeler

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.201 align:middle line:90%
and empath for how long now?

00:02:00.201 --> 00:02:01.700 align:middle line:84%
And how did that
all happen for you?

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.620 align:middle line:10%
>>SELIG: Well you know
I'm a clairaudient,

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.410 align:middle line:10%
and channeling is the way the
clairaudience works with me.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.790 align:middle line:10%
I opened up psychically
when I was in my mid 20s.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.802 align:middle line:90%
Or, I began to open up.

00:02:12.802 --> 00:02:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't believe
in any of this stuff

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.870 align:middle line:84%
really before it
started to happen.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And I studied a form
of energy healing

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.260 align:middle line:90%
when I was in my early 30s.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.550 align:middle line:10%
And I found that when I
had my hands on people,

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.880 align:middle line:10%
I could hear things for them.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.390 align:middle line:10%
So if I had my
head on your chest

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.840 align:middle line:10%
and I heard the name Mark, I
learned to say, who's Mark?

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And you'd say, oh that's my
brother, my father, my son.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.580 align:middle line:84%
And as people began to
validate the information,

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.190 align:middle line:84%
I began to trust
what was coming more.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.410 align:middle line:90%
And the channel began to open.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.510 align:middle line:90%
So I say that I'm like a radio.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm channeling
I'm attuned to a broadcast

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.710 align:middle line:84%
from a higher level and my
guides are coming through.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.970 align:middle line:84%
If I'm tuned into you, you're
the station that I'm playing,

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.930 align:middle line:84%
and I'm hearing
you telepathically,

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.060 align:middle line:84%
or the people that
you ask about.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
tune in to someone?

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:58.736 align:middle line:90%
>>SELIG: By intention.

00:02:58.736 --> 00:03:00.080 align:middle line:90%
You know, I use the full name.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.130 align:middle line:90%
I like the full name.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.360 align:middle line:84%
That works for me, because
there's a real resonance to it.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.400 align:middle line:84%
So for example if
Jane Smith comes to me

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.740 align:middle line:84%
and I tune into Jane
Smith through the name,

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.370 align:middle line:90%
I get all of Jane Smith.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.560 align:middle line:84%
If Jane Smith was married
to a guy named Clark, where

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.560 align:middle line:84%
she was traumatized and
she dropped the name Clark,

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.200 align:middle line:84%
a whole piece of her actually
will come through to me

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.860 align:middle line:90%
through Jane Clark Smith.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.600 align:middle line:84%
So I use the whole name,
because different parts of us

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.250 align:middle line:84%
develop and sort of have
experiences at different times

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.240 align:middle line:90%
that I can tune into.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.060 align:middle line:84%
But it's not a lot
different than, say,

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.090 align:middle line:84%
a psychic who would hold your
watch and get the vibration.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And get that feeling.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SELIG: I'm just using the
name as what I step into.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.510 align:middle line:84%
But I'm actually stepping
into you when I'm reading.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.040 align:middle line:90%
So I sort of become you.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.232 align:middle line:84%
It's not like I'm just
sort of tuning into you

00:03:47.232 --> 00:03:48.690 align:middle line:84%
and seeing what I
can see and hear.

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.060 align:middle line:84%
I actually first
become you, and then

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.876 align:middle line:84%
as you, I feel what's
going on, or you're

00:03:53.876 --> 00:03:55.250 align:middle line:84%
going to tell me
what's going on.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.130 align:middle line:84%
And then when you ask about
people, I step into them,

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.910 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes I start
to resemble them.

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of like
being a human switchboard.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.280 align:middle line:84%
That's the best way
to look at what I do.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When people come to
you, Paul, what do they want?

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.167 align:middle line:90%
What are they asking for?

00:04:08.167 --> 00:04:09.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SELIG: You know,
it can be anything.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.639 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some people
come for business

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:13.680 align:middle line:84%
and they want to know what
the board of directors

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.720 align:middle line:90%
is going to do.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.310 align:middle line:84%
But most people are
coming because they're

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.790 align:middle line:84%
at a time in their life where
they're knowing that there's

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.539 align:middle line:84%
something that's
not working well,

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:23.830 align:middle line:90%
and they don't know what it is.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.380 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not the guy to go
to for your lucky numbers.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't think the guides that
I work with could care less.

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.360 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yeah, you're not going
to give us Powerball, are they?

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SELIG: They're not
going to give us numbers.

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.284 align:middle line:84%
No, they're not
going to do that.

00:04:32.284 --> 00:04:35.250 align:middle line:84%
But they will say
why you are stuck,

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.470 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps where
that part of you that

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.480 align:middle line:84%
is unable to move, or
fix a relationship,

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.960 align:middle line:84%
or have a relationship,
was created.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And then go to that time, and
then move the energy from it.

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.240 align:middle line:84%
So for example I
get like, moms who

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.840 align:middle line:84%
are estranged from
their kids, or couples

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.190 align:middle line:84%
that are in
transition, or people

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.880 align:middle line:84%
that are living a life that
makes no sense to them anymore,

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.220 align:middle line:84%
even though they were doing
exactly what they thought

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.520 align:middle line:90%
that they were supposed to do.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.061 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're like
a counselor too.

00:05:03.061 --> 00:05:04.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SELIG: Well in a
way, but I'm not.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm listening to them, so
there's an aspect of them

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.650 align:middle line:84%
that's actually at a higher
level that is telling me,

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.180 align:middle line:84%
you know, what's
really going on.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.930 align:middle line:84%
So you can come in saying,
wow, it's so great to meet you.

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm so happy, my
life is so great.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And I close my eyes
I tune into you.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.560 align:middle line:90%
And you're furious.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.970 align:middle line:90%
And I feel the fury.

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.911 align:middle line:84%
And then I ask what
the fury is about.

00:05:26.911 --> 00:05:27.910 align:middle line:90%
And I'll usually get it.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.412 align:middle line:84%
I'll say, boy, you're really
angry at your husband.

00:05:30.412 --> 00:05:32.120 align:middle line:84%
You know, and they'll
go, oh no, I'm not.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.813 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But they know they are.

00:05:32.813 --> 00:05:33.979 align:middle line:90%
>>SELIG: They know they are.

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And then I tune into the husband
and I start to look like them,

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.280 align:middle line:90%
and then their jaw drops.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And then they begin to
trust it and we sort of

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.366 align:middle line:84%
go into the conversation that's
happening at a higher level.

00:05:44.366 --> 00:05:45.740 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not a
counselor, you know.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.040 align:middle line:90%
I don't I don't claim that.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.860 align:middle line:90%
But my guides are pretty good.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.770 align:middle line:84%
And they actually
know more than I do,

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.850 align:middle line:84%
and they'll usually come through
to support people in what they

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:56.535 align:middle line:90%
need to evolve through.

00:05:56.535 --> 00:05:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And that would be the
better use of the word.

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.130 align:middle line:84%
Because my guides
don't fix people.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:01.830 align:middle line:84%
They say it's not
about fixing things,

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.550 align:middle line:84%
it's about becoming who we
truly are in a higher way

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:06.900 align:middle line:90%
and expressing that.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.950 align:middle line:84%
And then our life
gets to reflect it.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:12.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you deal more, Paul,
with the living or the dead?

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SELIG: You know, I'm
odd in that I'm known

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.120 align:middle line:90%
as a medium for the living.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.150 align:middle line:84%
Now the living are operating
on a station like a broadcast

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.880 align:middle line:84%
band, a bandwidth that I can
access very, very easily.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.950 align:middle line:84%
It's somewhat rare for me not
to be able to hear somebody.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes when I tune into
somebody and I can't hear them,

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.020 align:middle line:84%
that's because they're
completely blocked

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.790 align:middle line:84%
and they're refusing
to be heard.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:37.190 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't happen a lot.

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.960 align:middle line:84%
People who have crossed,
I can tune into them.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.270 align:middle line:84%
But I'll feel them, or begin
to take on their demeanor

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.510 align:middle line:84%
as they were when
they were alive.

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:47.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's like I'm not
operating in time.

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.020 align:middle line:84%
If they want to come
through with a message,

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.550 align:middle line:90%
perhaps they will.

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And that happens
with some frequency.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.240 align:middle line:84%
But I don't call myself
a spiritual channel.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And their work is primarily
with people who have crossed.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.160 align:middle line:84%
What I am able to do,
which is odd, I think,

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.130 align:middle line:84%
is hear people
that have no voice.

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.900 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they've
lost-- I mean, I

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.060 align:middle line:84%
tune in to people with
Alzheimer's perhaps,

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:13.360 align:middle line:90%
for their kids.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.520 align:middle line:84%
Or, I've read very
effectively for people

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.780 align:middle line:84%
that have, frankly,
been in comas,

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.300 align:middle line:90%
or have locked-in syndrome.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SELIG: And I can feel them.

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.240 align:middle line:90%
I become them, you see.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.070 align:middle line:90%
And then I feel as them.

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:27.780 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that I
could do any of this

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.329 align:middle line:90%
until I was doing it.

00:07:29.329 --> 00:07:30.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
aware of what you're

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:32.540 align:middle line:90%
doing when you're doing it?

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:35.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SELIG: Well you know,
I am, but I also often

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:36.750 align:middle line:90%
don't know what's going on.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:41.760 align:middle line:84%
So I was filmed reading
for a mother who

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.160 align:middle line:90%
had a kid with cerebral palsy.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.270 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know that the
kid had cerebral palsy.

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.100 align:middle line:84%
I just knew the
kid had a problem.

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And so I tuned into
the kid by name,

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.790 align:middle line:84%
and I actually sort of took
on all of his symptoms.

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:55.050 align:middle line:90%
I lost my hearing in one ear.

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:57.175 align:middle line:84%
So I was on camera
saying, is he deaf?

00:07:57.175 --> 00:07:59.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm deaf, what's going on?

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.730 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
hitting myself, but I

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.860 align:middle line:90%
didn't know what the cause was.

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:06.660 align:middle line:84%
All he kept saying
was, you can't hear me,

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:07.560 align:middle line:90%
you can't hear me.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying to this mother,
he's saying, you can't hear me.

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:11.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And is he there?

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:13.242 align:middle line:84%
>>SELIG: No, he's
off in Connecticut.

00:08:13.242 --> 00:08:14.200 align:middle line:90%
I've never met the kid.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.450 align:middle line:84%
I just had the mother
in front of me.

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And the mother's
saying, I can hear him.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:21.710 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't know what the hell
was going on for some time

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:22.770 align:middle line:90%
into the reading.

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:25.920 align:middle line:84%
But I sort of somatized,
or became, him.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.620 align:middle line:90%
So I know what's going on.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:31.000 align:middle line:10%
But I don't know
necessarily the causation.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.970 align:middle line:84%
So if I tune in to you, and I
feel that you're really hurt,

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:37.710 align:middle line:84%
I can tune in to
you and maybe you

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:39.360 align:middle line:90%
will tell me why you're hurt.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.559 align:middle line:90%
Or, maybe I'll feel that.

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:42.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying, boy
you're really hurt.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And this seems to be around
a collection of people,

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.860 align:middle line:84%
and you're defending yourself
and your reputation from them.

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:50.080 align:middle line:90%
And you'll go, yep.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And then we can go into
the specifics psychically,

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:54.790 align:middle line:84%
and then I can move into
the different people

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:57.944 align:middle line:84%
and help you sort of understand
what's going on in your world.

00:08:57.944 --> 00:08:59.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sure, I
was going to say,

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:04.030 align:middle line:84%
once you reveal to them what's
going on, what's the next step?

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:05.370 align:middle line:90%
How do you fix that?

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SELIG: Well again,
it's not fixing.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:08.320 align:middle line:90%
It's about understanding it.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SELIG: And I think
once it's understood,

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:12.780 align:middle line:90%
it really can be remedied.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:13.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On both sides?

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:16.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SELIG: Well this is
what's interesting.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm reading the person
who's coming to me.

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm hearing them and
hearing what the problem is.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:24.890 align:middle line:84%
But I may also hear from
them, at a higher level, what

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:27.900 align:middle line:84%
they need that they're not
getting, that they may not even

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.130 align:middle line:90%
be in touch with.

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:30.920 align:middle line:84%
And when I go to
the other person

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.180 align:middle line:84%
I may hear a very,
very different story.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:37.060 align:middle line:84%
So for example, the
spouse may be saying,

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:39.150 align:middle line:90%
I just need to be respected.

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:40.840 align:middle line:90%
You're just not respecting me.

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.160 align:middle line:84%
Nothing that I do
is ever good enough.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And then the other partner is
going, oh my God, that's true.

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And then we can
sort of negotiate.

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Now the funny thing that
happens sometimes when I work

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:53.920 align:middle line:84%
is that the other person,
who I've never met,

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.440 align:middle line:84%
who's not in the
room, I can feel

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.549 align:middle line:84%
them begin to shift as
well at a higher level.

00:09:59.549 --> 00:10:01.340 align:middle line:84%
So by the end of the
reading they're going,

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.780 align:middle line:84%
OK I'm going to
try it differently.

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:06.920 align:middle line:84%
Now I don't know because I
don't go home with these people

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.270 align:middle line:90%
and find out how it plays out.

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:09.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:10.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SELIG: I do get
the reports back.

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:12.940 align:middle line:84%
But I think that what's
actually happening

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:15.860 align:middle line:84%
is that we're all in
communication at a higher

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:16.710 align:middle line:90%
level.

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:18.380 align:middle line:84%
So even the person
that's not there--

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.280 align:middle line:84%
because I'm not a
psychic spy, I don't

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:23.330 align:middle line:84%
say that I do that--
I am in conversation

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.460 align:middle line:90%
with people on a higher level.

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And I can tune in to people,
either a personality level,

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:32.300 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps at the time
a problem was created.

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.810 align:middle line:84%
I remember once I
read for a woman.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:35.720 align:middle line:90%
She's a lovely woman.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.300 align:middle line:90%
She was on the phone.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.924 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
what she looked like.

00:10:37.924 --> 00:10:40.900 align:middle line:84%
But I tuned in to her and
this divorce that she had,

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.230 align:middle line:84%
and I said it was
literally a hit and run.

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:45.740 align:middle line:84%
I said you're lying by
the side of the road

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.335 align:middle line:84%
and you haven't gotten up
for the last four years.

00:10:48.335 --> 00:10:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And it was like-- I don't
remember how long it was.

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:52.392 align:middle line:84%
But she said, exactly
right, for four years--

00:10:52.392 --> 00:10:53.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She knew that.

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:54.599 align:middle line:90%
>>SELIG: Yeah, for four years.

00:10:54.599 --> 00:10:56.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean you know, the
spouse hadn't told her.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:57.930 align:middle line:90%
It came out of the blue.

00:10:57.930 --> 00:10:59.054 align:middle line:90%
She was served with papers.

00:10:59.054 --> 00:11:02.490 align:middle line:84%
Her life was completely, you
know, transformed by somebody

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:03.290 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:06.240 align:middle line:84%
But the realization that
she couldn't move on,

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.780 align:middle line:84%
or couldn't move forward,
and what was really going on,

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:12.520 align:middle line:84%
and the dynamic that
it wasn't about her,

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:16.610 align:middle line:84%
or why he did what he did, was
hopefully liberating for her

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:19.230 align:middle line:84%
to make the changes in her
life that she needed to.

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:20.950 align:middle line:84%
You know how some
people know who

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:22.910 align:middle line:84%
is on the phone when
the phone rings?

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:25.010 align:middle line:84%
I think that's because
whoever is calling

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:27.810 align:middle line:84%
you is in your space
already saying, here I am,

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:28.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm calling you.

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And they're imagining
if you're home

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.230 align:middle line:90%
and about to pick up the phone.

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:34.390 align:middle line:84%
At a higher level,
we're always talking.

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:37.210 align:middle line:84%
We just don't
always know we are.

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:41.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many people are
really aboveboard with you

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.385 align:middle line:90%
when you talk to them?

00:11:43.385 --> 00:11:45.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SELIG: Are really
aboveboard in terms

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:46.099 align:middle line:90%
of what they really want?

00:11:46.099 --> 00:11:47.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's inside of them?

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:48.600 align:middle line:90%
I mean, do they admit it?

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.780 align:middle line:84%
If you say to somebody,
for example, you really

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:55.650 align:middle line:84%
are hurting, are
they open with you?

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:57.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SELIG: Yeah, most of them are.

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there is not
a desire to protect.

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:02.309 align:middle line:84%
You know, I do a lot of
workshops where my guides come

00:12:02.309 --> 00:12:04.100 align:middle line:84%
through in channel,
but people come through

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:05.700 align:middle line:90%
with their questions.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And I'll read them this way
publicly in front of a hundred

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.270 align:middle line:90%
people or something.

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:13.490 align:middle line:84%
And you know, my guides
are respectful about what

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:16.010 align:middle line:90%
they'll do in a public way.

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And I don't expect that person
to air out their dirty laundry

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:19.660 align:middle line:90%
in public.

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:21.160 align:middle line:90%
There's no need to.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:25.800 align:middle line:84%
But in a one on one, you
know, session, why not?

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And truthfully I always say,
if it doesn't feel right,

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:29.660 align:middle line:90%
don't work with it.

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:30.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Don't do it.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.462 align:middle line:90%
>>SELIG: Stay in your own power.

00:12:31.462 --> 00:12:32.670 align:middle line:90%
I don't want anybody's power.

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:34.122 align:middle line:84%
I'm completely
uninterested in it.

00:12:34.122 --> 00:12:35.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well I've
got a question for you

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:38.860 align:middle line:84%
on video, Paul, so
let's take a look.

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: When
it comes to kind

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:47.270 align:middle line:84%
of connecting with our-- those
who come before, our ancestors,

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:52.240 align:middle line:84%
and being able to
ask them questions,

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.750 align:middle line:84%
I would ask you
whether you think

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:58.640 align:middle line:84%
that those answers are kind of
contained within us already?

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:02.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, are we all connected
to our ancestors in this way,

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:05.210 align:middle line:90%
in this kind of like, DNA way?

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:09.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, does information, do you
think, get passed on from life

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:11.160 align:middle line:90%
to life like, in a genetic way?

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.130 align:middle line:90%
Is there genetic memory?

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:18.180 align:middle line:84%
These questions that we might
pose our dear and departed

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:21.325 align:middle line:84%
ones, are they actually
contained within us?

00:13:21.325 --> 00:13:23.731 align:middle line:90%


00:13:23.731 --> 00:13:25.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: OK now I'm
not quite so sure what

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.720 align:middle line:84%
he was trying to ask
you, but it sounds

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:32.030 align:middle line:84%
like he wants to know if there's
a connection between the living

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:32.830 align:middle line:90%
and the dead?

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:33.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SELIG: Well yeah, there is.

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's not the
way that I work.

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:37.280 align:middle line:84%
My guides who I
work with, they say,

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:40.600 align:middle line:84%
some of us and been in
bodies, some of us haven't.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:44.420 align:middle line:84%
But I also hear
him saying, are we

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:46.430 align:middle line:84%
being supported by
people on the other side?

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:47.650 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:50.620 align:middle line:84%
But also, do we hold the
memory from other lifetimes?

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:52.450 align:middle line:90%
And I actually feel that we do.

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:54.480 align:middle line:84%
Now I also feel
though, that if you're

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.520 align:middle line:84%
having an issue
in this lifetime--

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:59.231 align:middle line:84%
and I have plenty of my own
that may have been created

00:13:59.231 --> 00:14:00.980 align:middle line:84%
at another time--
they're going to come up

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:02.180 align:middle line:90%
now to be dealt with.

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.620 align:middle line:84%
So I don't spend a
lot of time digging.

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And you know occasionally, on
reading for somebody and all

00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:10.650 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden, I'm seeing
them wearing clothing

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:13.110 align:middle line:84%
from another time,
I go OK, here we go.

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:15.040 align:middle line:84%
But that's a rare
occurrence for me,

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.760 align:middle line:84%
because the here and
now is really, I think,

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.340 align:middle line:90%
where things are dealt with.

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:24.310 align:middle line:84%
I think it's fun to go
diving into all that stuff,

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:27.570 align:middle line:84%
and it can be very beneficial
for somebody who's opening up.

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:29.880 align:middle line:84%
But I also think it can
take us out of the moment.

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.796 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It can be
dangerous too, couldn't it?

00:14:31.796 --> 00:14:37.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SELIG: Well I mean, I think
anything can be dangerous,

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:39.980 align:middle line:84%
depending on how
you attend to it.

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:42.240 align:middle line:84%
You know, I shouldn't
be eating sugar,

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:43.860 align:middle line:90%
because I get stoned from it.

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.270 align:middle line:84%
I love it, but I shouldn't
be getting stoned because--

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:46.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not
that good for you.

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SELIG: And it's
not good for you.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:50.070 align:middle line:84%
But when I'm checked
out of my body, which

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:52.060 align:middle line:84%
isn't a good thing
for me to do, I

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:54.664 align:middle line:84%
can then hook into
lower energies.

00:14:54.664 --> 00:14:55.830 align:middle line:90%
And I don't want to do that.

00:14:55.830 --> 00:15:00.050 align:middle line:84%
To do my work, I've got
to stay pretty clean.

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:02.930 align:middle line:90%
So is it dangerous?

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:06.090 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking to use
spirituality as a way

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:09.630 align:middle line:90%
to escape your life, yes.

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:11.760 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking to
spirituality to teach you

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:17.210 align:middle line:84%
about your life and actually
that life is much more amazing

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:20.170 align:middle line:84%
than we assume it to be,
it can be very valuable.

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:23.350 align:middle line:84%
So anything can be
used in any way.

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
like Edgar Cayce

00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:30.500 align:middle line:84%
in that you go into a trance
state to pick up information?

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SELIG: You know
I've been compared

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:36.920 align:middle line:84%
to Cayce only in that my guides
dictate books through me.

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:39.784 align:middle line:84%
And I literally sit in
a chair, close my eyes.

00:15:39.784 --> 00:15:41.200 align:middle line:84%
There's a phone,
there is somebody

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:44.140 align:middle line:84%
in Berkeley taking notes,
but everything is recorded.

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And my guides dictate
the entire books

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:49.340 align:middle line:84%
that are then transcribed and
published without editing.

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:50.810 align:middle line:90%
So like, I don't write anything.

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:52.960 align:middle line:84%
So there is now four
of these in print

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.540 align:middle line:90%
which are spiritual teachings.

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:57.087 align:middle line:84%
And I really just sit
there and it comes through.

00:15:57.087 --> 00:15:58.545 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It just
comes through you.

00:15:58.545 --> 00:15:59.880 align:middle line:84%
You're an automatic
writer, basically.

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:00.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SELIG: It's nonstop.

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:02.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm taking
dictation, truthfully.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:02.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:04.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SELIG: It's interesting to me.

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And Cayce brought through
an enormous amount of work.

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:10.040 align:middle line:84%
But so have others
that came before him.

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:11.610 align:middle line:90%
I actually don't go into trance.

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:16.550 align:middle line:84%
I do go into a trance, but
I'm a conscious channel.

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:18.040 align:middle line:90%
So I'm not in a deep trance.

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:21.330 align:middle line:84%
I do remember what's
coming through,

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:22.460 align:middle line:90%
but at different levels.

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.090 align:middle line:90%
So I like to put it this way.

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:26.660 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like, right now
I'm in the driver's seat.

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:28.470 align:middle line:90%
We're having a conversation.

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:31.350 align:middle line:84%
If the guides come
through sort of casually,

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:34.090 align:middle line:84%
they might be sitting next to me
and saying, bah, bah, bah, bah,

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:34.420 align:middle line:90%
bah.

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:36.080 align:middle line:90%
And I'll just sort of repeat it.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.540 align:middle line:84%
When I'm really
working, when I'm

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:40.820 align:middle line:84%
doing a lecture or
a workshop, when

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:42.460 align:middle line:84%
they're doing a
book through me, I

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:44.660 align:middle line:84%
climb into the back
seat of the car.

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:47.160 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I'm hanging
over the front seat,

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:48.720 align:middle line:84%
because I don't
trust what's going on

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.386 align:middle line:84%
and I want to make
sure everything's OK.

00:16:50.386 --> 00:16:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And I really do question
all of the information that

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.550 align:middle line:90%
comes through me as it comes.

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:58.800 align:middle line:84%
If something so far out
that I can't conceive of it,

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.520 align:middle line:84%
I have to sort of say,
hey, wait a minute.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And then they really
do have to say OK,

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:05.940 align:middle line:84%
and then unpack the
teaching for me.

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.579 align:middle line:84%
And this stuff ends
up in the books,

00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:10.440 align:middle line:84%
because I interrupt the
book dictations frequently.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:13.250 align:middle line:84%
Other times-- and these
are my favorite times--

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:14.950 align:middle line:84%
I climb into the
back seat of the car,

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:16.700 align:middle line:84%
and it's like I'm
reading a magazine.

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:19.015 align:middle line:90%
And they're just talking.

00:17:19.015 --> 00:17:19.890 align:middle line:90%
Remember being a kid?

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:22.099 align:middle line:84%
Your parents are in the front
seat, you're in the back seat.

00:17:22.099 --> 00:17:24.609 align:middle line:84%
You're sort of listening to
what they're talking about--

00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:25.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're in
a different world.

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.344 align:middle line:84%
>>SELIG: That's what
it is at its best.

00:17:27.344 --> 00:17:28.780 align:middle line:90%
And I love being in that place.

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And then I love sort
of seeing or hearing

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:35.290 align:middle line:84%
what's come out, because the
teachings-- which are really

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:37.910 align:middle line:84%
progressing in ways that
are extraordinary to me,

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:40.340 align:middle line:84%
because they're really going
to places that I'm not that

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:42.820 align:middle line:84%
comfortable with,
in terms of how

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:48.250 align:middle line:84%
we're all co-creating reality--
you know, it's fascinating.

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.629 align:middle line:84%
But if I'm listening
too closely,

00:17:50.629 --> 00:17:52.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to stop it, because
I'm going to get nervous.

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:56.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're with the
spiritual channeler Paul Selig.

00:17:56.060 --> 00:18:00.650 align:middle line:84%
Paul, the guides that you
tap into, who are they?

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:02.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SELIG: Well you know,
they're only called the guides.

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:03.950 align:middle line:90%
I call them the guides.

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:05.366 align:middle line:84%
And they're only
called the guides

00:18:05.366 --> 00:18:06.990 align:middle line:84%
because my ex, when
my ex found out I

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:09.100 align:middle line:84%
could do this, used to
say, ask the guides this.

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:09.955 align:middle line:90%
Ask the guides that.

00:18:09.955 --> 00:18:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's how
they got the name.

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And people say, oh,
Paul and the guides.

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:16.460 align:middle line:90%
They say that they're teachers.

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:19.540 align:middle line:84%
They've used the term "ascended
masters" in the first book.

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:21.870 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps because I
had some uncomfortability

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:25.980 align:middle line:84%
with that term, they don't
use it frequently anymore.

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.360 align:middle line:84%
But there is a name that
they've come through with,

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:31.220 align:middle line:84%
and it's been consistent
for many years.

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:33.440 align:middle line:90%
And they don't announce it much.

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And I was always surprised in
a workshop when they would say,

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:39.109 align:middle line:90%
we are, or I am.

00:18:39.109 --> 00:18:40.650 align:middle line:84%
But it's usually
the collective "we."

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's this Melchizedek,
which is really a priesthood.

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:45.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:48.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SELIG: And the only reason I'm
mentioning it now is in the new

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:51.530 align:middle line:84%
book, I was quite surprised--
"The Book Of Mastery"--

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:53.370 align:middle line:84%
they said, if you want
to call us something,

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:55.050 align:middle line:90%
you can call us this.

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:57.100 align:middle line:90%
And I went OK, they've said it.

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.520 align:middle line:84%
They're outing
themselves at this level.

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.720 align:middle line:84%
The challenge that I
have with the names,

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:05.820 align:middle line:84%
truthfully, is I think that
we like to attach things

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:07.490 align:middle line:90%
to names, sort of ego stuff.

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:08.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:10.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SELIG: So when I was first
getting interested in all

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:13.500 align:middle line:84%
this work, and I
live in Manhattan,

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.490 align:middle line:84%
and I would hear things
like, well there's

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:17.482 align:middle line:84%
an archangel Michael,
and Michael's channeling

00:19:17.482 --> 00:19:18.440 align:middle line:90%
on the Upper West Side.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.660 align:middle line:84%
But Gabriel's
channeling in Brooklyn,

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.660 align:middle line:84%
and you really want
to go see Gabriel.

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking,
this is kind of crazy.

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.920 align:middle line:10%
It's kind of like, who's
the rock star of the minute?

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:27.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SELIG: And truthfully
you know, truth is truth.

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:31.610 align:middle line:90%
Truth is truth.

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:35.790 align:middle line:84%
Truth can come through in the
form that it comes through me

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:38.320 align:middle line:90%
and how I'm being worked with.

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.890 align:middle line:84%
It can come through somebody
else who is not a channel.

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:44.250 align:middle line:84%
But finally, truth
has its own resonance.

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:45.930 align:middle line:90%
And you know it.

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:48.320 align:middle line:84%
When I'm doing this
stuff-- which I still

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:52.000 align:middle line:84%
think it's kind of nuts and
far out-- but I show up again

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.045 align:middle line:90%
and again and again.

00:19:53.045 --> 00:19:53.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But it happens.

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:54.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SELIG: It happens.

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And when it's happening,
I can't deny it.

00:19:56.910 --> 00:20:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And I can't deny how accurate
it's been in many ways.

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And no matter how, you know,
articulate I may be-- I

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:07.010 align:middle line:84%
mean I was a college
teacher for 25 years.

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:08.550 align:middle line:90%
I just left that whole life.

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:10.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I bet you were
a great college teacher.

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:11.591 align:middle line:90%
>>SELIG: You know, I was.

00:20:11.591 --> 00:20:12.770 align:middle line:90%
I loved it.

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:14.850 align:middle line:84%
Actually I loved
every minute of it.

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:15.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You would make
your course interesting.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.439 align:middle line:90%
I could tell right now.

00:20:16.439 --> 00:20:17.238 align:middle line:90%
>>SELIG: Thanks.

00:20:17.238 --> 00:20:18.470 align:middle line:90%
You know, I had a great time.

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:19.700 align:middle line:90%
I had a great time.

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:23.790 align:middle line:84%
But also it was the best
part of me that came forth.

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And I feel in retrospect
that I was being prepared

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:28.810 align:middle line:90%
for some of what I do now.

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:30.570 align:middle line:90%
I learned how to hold a room.

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:33.000 align:middle line:84%
I learned how to show up and
not be frightened of talking,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:33.800 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.450 align:middle line:84%
There were things
that I learned.

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:38.070 align:middle line:90%
I used to teach playwriting.

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:40.310 align:middle line:84%
And the funny thing
was, I used to teach

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:45.360 align:middle line:84%
Aristotle, which really, I
read one thing by Aristotle.

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:48.820 align:middle line:84%
That's the one thing I was told
I had to teach in this course.

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:51.180 align:middle line:84%
But what he did do
was talk about why

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:53.010 align:middle line:90%
people do what they do.

00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And it actually
gave me a vocabulary

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:58.140 align:middle line:84%
to be able to talk
to people about life.

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:00.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was he the
student of Plato?

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:00.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SELIG: Yeah.

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:01.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:01.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote a book
called "The Poetics."

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:04.616 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they got
him with hemlock, right?

00:21:04.616 --> 00:21:05.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SELIG: You know, probably.

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:08.310 align:middle line:84%
Everybody seems to have
been gotten with something,

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:10.170 align:middle line:90%
one time or another.

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:12.400 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know
what I was saying,

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:15.750 align:middle line:84%
but I don't remember
what I was saying.

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:19.879 align:middle line:84%
I interrupted myself by
saying I was a teacher.

00:21:19.879 --> 00:21:21.170 align:middle line:90%
So what was the question prior?

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:24.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we were dealing
with the ability of tapping

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:26.080 align:middle line:90%
into who these guides were?

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:27.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SELIG: Oh, who they are.

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:30.876 align:middle line:84%
Truth is truth, no matter
what form it comes in.

00:21:30.876 --> 00:21:32.500 align:middle line:84%
There's actually a
quote from the woman

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.246 align:middle line:84%
who channeled a course in
miracles, Helen Schucman.

00:21:35.246 --> 00:21:37.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'm actually not a
student of the course.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.160 align:middle line:84%
I tried to read it
once, and it was

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.060 align:middle line:90%
very beautiful, but very dense.

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:44.164 align:middle line:84%
And I actually don't
read spiritual stuff,

00:21:44.164 --> 00:21:46.080 align:middle line:84%
partially because I want
to keep the channel--

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:46.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Keep it open.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:47.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SELIG: --keep it
clean, you know?

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.340 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to be reading
physics, because my guides

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:50.640 align:middle line:90%
are talking about that stuff.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:54.570 align:middle line:84%
But I don't because I let
their vocabulary work with me.

00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:57.000 align:middle line:84%
But she said something about
what she did that I loved.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.160 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you know,
I don't believe it,

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.140 align:middle line:90%
but I know it's true.

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:02.170 align:middle line:90%
And that's how I feel.

00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:03.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's the way it is.

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:04.508 align:middle line:84%
>>SELIG: That's
just the way it is.

00:22:04.508 --> 00:22:05.540 align:middle line:90%
It's happening.

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And if it's happening,
it's possible.

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:09.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean it shouldn't
be possible that I

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:14.200 align:middle line:84%
can step into somebody's
child or wife or husband

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:17.960 align:middle line:84%
and become them in a way
that they might recognize.

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.150 align:middle line:84%
What it shows me
is that we're not

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:22.620 align:middle line:84%
just this body, and
frankly, that we really

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:24.860 align:middle line:90%
are always in communication.

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:26.830 align:middle line:90%
As an empath, I'm porous.

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:30.540 align:middle line:84%
You know, for whatever
reasons, I can feel.

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And I have language that
comes with a feeling.

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm working psychically
or clairaudiently, I'm hearing.

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:39.480 align:middle line:90%
But I'm hearing differently.

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.920 align:middle line:90%
My ears aren't even used.

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:44.080 align:middle line:84%
It's really another
voice fills the head,

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:46.644 align:middle line:84%
you know, and sort of
pushes my consciousness

00:22:46.644 --> 00:22:47.810 align:middle line:90%
to the back seat of the car.

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:49.740 align:middle line:90%
And they say, OK, here we go.

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:51.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well let's go
out to our roving cam

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:54.519 align:middle line:84%
and get another
question for Paul.

00:22:54.519 --> 00:22:56.060 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Paul,
my question for you

00:22:56.060 --> 00:23:03.290 align:middle line:84%
would be how do you find a
balance between this world

00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:04.430 align:middle line:90%
and the afterlife?

00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:07.700 align:middle line:84%
I know when you can kind
of tap into other realms,

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.310 align:middle line:84%
it's easy to get
a little flighty.

00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:11.370 align:middle line:84%
And so my question
would be, how do you

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:15.370 align:middle line:84%
maintain that balance
and that grounding?

00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:17.759 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
maintain that balance?

00:23:17.759 --> 00:23:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SELIG: Well the first
thing I want to say

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:23.250 align:middle line:84%
is that I don't think
of myself as special.

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:25.670 align:middle line:90%
And I'm very aware of that.

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:27.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm this guy that
has some ability.

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:29.590 align:middle line:90%
And I show up for it.

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And I seem to be being very
well-supported in some ways

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:37.120 align:middle line:90%
by the guides that I work with.

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.450 align:middle line:84%
I have a different
experience, perhaps,

00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:42.410 align:middle line:90%
than other people of feeling.

00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:44.620 align:middle line:84%
But I actually think
that what I do,

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:47.580 align:middle line:84%
we're all capable of at
one level or another.

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:51.510 align:middle line:84%
We live in a world where we were
told these things don't exist.

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And because we were told
that, we buy into it.

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And then we we're
depriving ourselves

00:23:57.550 --> 00:24:00.040 align:middle line:84%
of a level of experience
that's accessible.

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:02.510 align:middle line:84%
You know, I do this in my
workshops all the time.

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:04.311 align:middle line:84%
I have people tune
into each other.

00:24:04.311 --> 00:24:05.560 align:middle line:90%
Everybody can feel the energy.

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:06.680 align:middle line:90%
You can feel it.

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:07.480 align:middle line:90%
It's palpable.

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:07.785 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can feel it.

00:24:07.785 --> 00:24:08.585 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:24:08.585 --> 00:24:09.540 align:middle line:90%
And it's positive.

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:10.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SELIG: It's very positive.

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:13.270 align:middle line:84%
But because you can
feel it yourself,

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:15.480 align:middle line:84%
you have your own
experience of it.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:20.160 align:middle line:84%
So for me, I'll tell you
what's hard for me, truthfully.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.230 align:middle line:90%
I don't like crowds.

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:23.350 align:middle line:90%
I don't like anything loud.

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:26.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm very content to be at home.

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:28.450 align:middle line:84%
When somebody is
angry with me, I

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:30.810 align:middle line:84%
can often feel it,
although I don't know

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:32.910 align:middle line:90%
who's angry, which isn't fun.

00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:33.840 align:middle line:90%
It's mostly talking.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, ever hear,
you know, your ears

00:24:44.349 --> 00:24:46.640 align:middle line:84%
But when somebody is speaking
something about me that's

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:49.330 align:middle line:84%
not so good, I literally
feel like I've got somebody

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:50.420 align:middle line:90%

somebody is pissed.

And then it passes.

And usually I'll be able to
find out who it is or clear it.

00:24:58.321 --> 00:25:00.570 align:middle line:84%

It doesn't happen much
anymore by the way,

00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:23.070 align:middle line:84%
and there's a reason
for it, because I'm

00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:25.370 align:middle line:90%
learning not to care so much.

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:27.565 align:middle line:90%

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:35.700 align:middle line:90%
I was channeling on a show.

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And I was heavier than
I am now, and rocking

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.190 align:middle line:84%
back and forth in
a chair, whispering

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:41.190 align:middle line:90%
and repeating to myself.

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:42.710 align:middle line:90%
I looked like a lunatic.

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And all of these three-minute
clips were all over YouTube

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:47.270 align:middle line:90%
with me.

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:50.330 align:middle line:84%
And it had these headlines
like, Paul Selig Channeling

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:51.590 align:middle line:90%
on ET Realities.

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:55.150 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh brother, I
could feel the judgement.

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:56.430 align:middle line:90%
I went to bed for two days.

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:58.820 align:middle line:90%
I could feel it all, physically.

00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And I said to the
guides, you know

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.410 align:middle line:84%
if you want me to
do this work, why

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:03.880 align:middle line:90%
are you letting this happen?

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:04.900 align:middle line:90%
And their response--

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:05.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're killing me!

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:06.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SELIG: Pretty much.

00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And their response was, as long
as you care what people think,

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.400 align:middle line:90%
it's going to be an issue.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And truthfully what had happened
was, I had a glass to the wall.

00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:17.030 align:middle line:84%
I was dying to know
what everybody thought.

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:17.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh no.

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:19.186 align:middle line:90%

00:26:19.186 --> 00:26:20.060 align:middle line:90%

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:22.386 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know
that then, you know?

00:26:22.386 --> 00:26:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's the
challenge, I think--

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:27.330 align:middle line:84%
to go back to the
viewer's question--

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:33.610 align:middle line:84%
is I can't pride
myself in sensitivity.

00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:35.380 align:middle line:90%
We're all sensitive.

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:40.450 align:middle line:84%
But I can sort of realize that
if something's impacting me,

00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:42.190 align:middle line:84%
it tends to mean
there's something

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:43.480 align:middle line:90%
that I need to be working on.

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.220 align:middle line:90%
So it's always an opportunity.

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:48.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have an

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:52.054 align:middle line:84%
I've heard you go

00:26:52.054 --> 00:26:52.970 align:middle line:90%
Can you do it at will?

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:54.880 align:middle line:90%
Can we do it now?

>>SELIG: I can do it at will.

00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:59.310 align:middle line:10%
I mean, you know, I once did a
book signing and somebody said,

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:01.310 align:middle line:10%
will you channel the
guides at the book signing?

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:03.101 align:middle line:84%
And the guides came
through, and they said,

00:27:03.101 --> 00:27:04.450 align:middle line:90%
we are not the entertainment.

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And that was the end
of what they did.

00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:06.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was it.

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:08.606 align:middle line:84%

do is they'll come through

00:27:08.606 --> 00:27:12.100 align:middle line:84%
and they'll answer questions
that I can answer, you know?

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:13.344 align:middle line:90%
So yes, I mean, we're ready.

that we are separate--

are separate-- still
here-- still here?

Not really-- not really.

question for the guides.

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:48.210 align:middle line:90%
Can you foretell the future?

And if you can, what's
at stake for us?

Everything's at stake for you--

if you can realize yourself--

00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:59.960 align:middle line:84%
if you can realize
yourself-- as what you truly

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:02.370 align:middle line:90%

important teaching-- now

this is a very
important teaching.

Where you stand

you stand right now-- where any
of you stand-- where any of you

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:14.090 align:middle line:84%
stand-- is at a
moment of reckoning--

00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:17.150 align:middle line:84%
is at a moment of reckoning--
and a reckoning is--

00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:22.110 align:middle line:84%
and a reckoning is-- a facing of
oneself-- a facing of oneself--

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:25.930 align:middle line:84%

you claim things in fear--

00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:40.250 align:middle line:10%
you will hold a

00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:44.710 align:middle line:10%
hold a reality-- that conforms
to that-- conforms to that.

00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:46.410 align:middle line:10%
And as we like to
say-- and as we

00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:50.380 align:middle line:10%
like to say-- the action of
fear-- the action of fear--

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:53.440 align:middle line:10%
is to claim more fear--
is to claim more fear.

The moment mankind realizes
herself-- the moment mankind

because your investment
in what you've had--

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:27.210 align:middle line:84%
and your need to replicate

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:29.360 align:middle line:84%

>>NOORY: Now Paul, are
you aware of what's going

00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:13.850 align:middle line:90%
on when you're doing that.

00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:15.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SELIG: Yes.

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:16.595 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it
exhausting for you?

00:34:16.595 --> 00:34:17.636 align:middle line:90%
>>SELIG: Not necessarily.

00:34:17.636 --> 00:34:23.042 align:middle line:90%


00:34:23.042 --> 00:34:24.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm trying to
think about out how

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:26.830 align:middle line:90%
to describe what it feels like.

00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And whoever it
had a British accent.

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:33.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SELIG: Yeah, that's been
that way since the second book

00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:34.500 align:middle line:90%
was channeled.

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And I was fairly
appalled when it started.

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:41.909 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know-- and
truthfully some days I'm

00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:46.389 align:middle line:84%
still not entirely sure--
if the accent wasn't

00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:50.589 align:middle line:84%
created to create the
distinction between Paul

00:34:50.589 --> 00:34:51.389 align:middle line:90%
and that.

00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:54.540 align:middle line:84%
But I used to say,
you know, oh I

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:56.360 align:middle line:84%
like it when the
guide with the accent

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:59.870 align:middle line:84%
comes through, because the
language would always flow.

00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And when the language
flowed, I would trust it

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:05.920 align:middle line:90%
and recede even farther.

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:09.060 align:middle line:84%
Now the second book
that I channeled,

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:11.620 align:middle line:84%
because the recordings
exist, there's

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:15.510 align:middle line:84%
an accent that sort of flies
across the British Isles.

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:17.236 align:middle line:84%
I'm going, what
the heck is this?

00:35:17.236 --> 00:35:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And the poor woman on the phone
didn't know what to make of it.

00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:22.670 align:middle line:84%
One day it was like, high
Edinburgh, and the next day

00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:23.470 align:middle line:90%
it was like, Welsh.

00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:25.010 align:middle line:90%
She's going, what is this?

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:26.870 align:middle line:90%
And then it landed.

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:29.397 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
what to make of it.

00:35:29.397 --> 00:35:31.480 align:middle line:84%
But then I went and looked
back at the transcripts

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:32.980 align:middle line:90%
from prior books.

00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:34.690 align:middle line:84%
There was one prior
book, but there

00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:36.790 align:middle line:90%
were lectures preceding that.

00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And the cadence and the syntax
of the sentences is unchanged.

00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:43.270 align:middle line:84%
So the guides have
always said things like,

00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:44.860 align:middle line:90%
you and your fellows.

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:48.270 align:middle line:84%
Now I've never said your
fellows about a gang

00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:50.640 align:middle line:84%
of people in my life, nor
do I think I ever would.

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:53.650 align:middle line:90%
It's just not my vocabulary.

00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:55.760 align:middle line:84%
So the vocabulary
that they work with

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:59.670 align:middle line:84%
seems extraordinarily
consistent with the accent

00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:01.220 align:middle line:90%
that comes through.

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:05.460 align:middle line:84%
But it also allows me--
and there are other voices,

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:07.840 align:middle line:84%
or expressions of
the voice-- they all

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:12.410 align:middle line:84%
seem to have the accent
or a variation of it.

00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:17.420 align:middle line:84%
The woman who has been on the
phone for all of the books

00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:19.270 align:middle line:84%
was convinced, and
may still be-- we

00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:21.740 align:middle line:84%
haven't talked about it
for a very long time--

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:23.620 align:middle line:84%
that I was channeling
an Indian who was

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:26.350 align:middle line:90%
schooled in the British system.

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:28.370 align:middle line:90%
I don't experience that at all.

00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:32.002 align:middle line:84%
But I actually once did
hear-- it was on YouTube.

00:36:32.002 --> 00:36:33.460 align:middle line:84%
I was like, cleaning
the apartment,

00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:34.950 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden
I heard what I

00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:38.170 align:middle line:84%
thought was my guide
speaking, because I understood

00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:39.930 align:middle line:90%
the cadence and the language.

00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And I went, and it was actually
Krishna Murti had shown up.

00:36:43.690 --> 00:36:46.727 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, wow,
that's really comparable.

00:36:46.727 --> 00:36:47.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same voice?

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:48.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SELIG: Very similar.

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.271 align:middle line:84%
But do I think I'm
channeling Krishnamurti?

00:36:50.271 --> 00:36:51.600 align:middle line:90%
No, I don't, you know.

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:53.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Would they tell you?

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:54.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SELIG: Probably they would.

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:57.420 align:middle line:84%
But I have to say, if
there's information

00:36:57.420 --> 00:37:00.410 align:middle line:84%
that I'm going to
balk at or run from,

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:04.660 align:middle line:84%
they have been rather
careful, you know.

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:09.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I show up for these book
sessions, dictation sessions,

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:12.760 align:middle line:84%
not knowing the chapter, or
what's going to come next.

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And I do workshops where
I literally sit down

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:19.967 align:middle line:84%
before a lot of people, close
my eyes, and this comes through.

00:37:19.967 --> 00:37:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what
they're going to talk about.

00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:26.515 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the message
they really want us to know.

00:37:26.515 --> 00:37:28.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SELIG: (ALTERNATING
VOICES) Who the hell you are.

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:29.270 align:middle line:90%
And that's from them.

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:31.740 align:middle line:84%
Who the hell you really are--
who the hell you really are.

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:34.241 align:middle line:84%
You are not what you think--
and you are not what you think.

00:37:34.241 --> 00:37:35.040 align:middle line:90%
Period.

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And they're saying, period.
(NORMAL VOICE) So who we are.

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:41.370 align:middle line:84%
They're saying the divine self
is the truth of who we are.

00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:43.290 align:middle line:84%
They've said, you
know, we're operating

00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:45.680 align:middle line:90%
in a personality structure.

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And we think we're our
stuff, we're our job titles.

00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:54.240 align:middle line:84%
We think we're how we are
relating to our society.

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:55.400 align:middle line:90%
But that's not who we are.

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:58.200 align:middle line:84%
The eternal self,
or the divine self,

00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:01.590 align:middle line:84%
they've called it the
Christ itself as well--

00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:03.770 align:middle line:84%
and their definition
of Christ has always

00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:06.230 align:middle line:84%
been the aspect of
the creator that can

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:08.260 align:middle line:90%
be realized in material form.

00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:11.070 align:middle line:84%
It's the divine self, or
the inner spark, whatever.

00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:11.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:14.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SELIG: But they say that
that's the truth of who we are.

00:38:14.350 --> 00:38:17.440 align:middle line:84%
And what that
aspect of us wishes

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:21.360 align:middle line:84%
is to be expressed
as and through us.

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And when I work with people,
that's the experience.

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:28.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean you really do get
to witness somebody else

00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:29.990 align:middle line:84%
and the world in a
very different way.

00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:32.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you ever ask
them specific questions

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:36.170 align:middle line:90%
that you want answered?

00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SELIG: I could,
and I don't enough.

00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:44.880 align:middle line:84%
Once in awhile I'll have a
friend take a list, or somebody

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:46.630 align:middle line:90%
that I work with that helps me.

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:49.380 align:middle line:84%
They'll say, OK I'm going to
ask your guides about this one.

00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And the guides will
happily come through.

00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:55.100 align:middle line:84%
It's challenging for me
to channel for myself,

00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:59.010 align:middle line:84%
because I have an
investment in an outcome.

00:38:59.010 --> 00:38:59.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:02.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SELIG: And that's my ego
and that's all that stuff.

00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:04.628 align:middle line:84%
And that's why a lot of psychics
won't read for themselves.

00:39:04.628 --> 00:39:08.240 align:middle line:84%
But I will say what
they're very good with.

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:10.740 align:middle line:84%
They're very good with
supporting me and not

00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:13.050 align:middle line:90%
making choices based in fear.

00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And they have said,
and I think they

00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:16.340 align:middle line:84%
said it here, you know
the action of fear

00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:17.530 align:middle line:90%
is to claim more fear.

00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:20.170 align:middle line:84%
And they say, if you look
at every choice you've ever

00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:23.880 align:middle line:84%
made in your life that you made
in fear, see what it got you.

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And you'll you probably see
you got a whole bunch more

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:27.320 align:middle line:90%
fear back.

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:30.640 align:middle line:84%
So they're wonderful counselors
for me in the moment,

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:32.950 align:middle line:84%
but their teaching
is of the moment.

00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:35.910 align:middle line:84%
They say, you can only
know who you are now.

00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:37.500 align:middle line:90%
We can only be now.

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:39.060 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is really it.

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:41.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they ever
get upset with you?

00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:43.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SELIG: Yes, as
a matter of fact.

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:43.890 align:middle line:90%
It's in the books.

00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:45.250 align:middle line:90%
They do.

00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:49.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that
it's upset, really.

00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:52.360 align:middle line:90%
I feel love from them.

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:55.940 align:middle line:84%
But I'm also rather happy
when they sort of put me

00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:56.740 align:middle line:90%
in my place.

00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:58.950 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a relief for
me, because it helps me

00:39:58.950 --> 00:40:01.560 align:middle line:90%
to trust what's coming through.

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:04.820 align:middle line:84%
So if I say something like,
say, in a book dictation, as it

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:07.260 align:middle line:90%
happens, I have a question.

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:08.520 align:middle line:90%
I have a hard time with this.

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:10.790 align:middle line:84%
And they say, we will
take your question later.

00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:12.320 align:middle line:90%
We are teaching.

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:15.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually really happy,
because I'll shut up and let

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:16.360 align:middle line:90%
it come through.

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:17.810 align:middle line:90%
So I like it.

00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:20.010 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I'm
channeling and I start

00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:23.730 align:middle line:84%
to predict where I think they're
going to go, like for example,

00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:26.290 align:middle line:84%
if I were to say to
you, it was the night

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:29.471 align:middle line:84%
before you'd want to fill
in like, Christmas, right?

00:40:29.471 --> 00:40:30.720 align:middle line:90%
Now that would be the obvious.

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:34.200 align:middle line:84%
So if I hear a sentence and I
think I know where it's going,

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:38.000 align:middle line:84%
they'll usually change the word
on me, just to throw me off,

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.620 align:middle line:84%
so that I'm being reminded that
they're driving in the car.

00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:44.280 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Is it always that
same voice that I just

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:46.210 align:middle line:10%
heard that comes through?

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:49.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SELIG: It has been
when I do groups

00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:51.580 align:middle line:84%
and when I do the
book dictations.

00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:54.980 align:middle line:84%
Only recently-- and I'm really
going to say very recently--

00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:58.880 align:middle line:84%
I was channeling in
Portland, Oregon last week,

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:02.730 align:middle line:84%
and I was working in
New York City yesterday,

00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:05.870 align:middle line:84%
and I had been noticing
another voice coming through.

00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:07.880 align:middle line:90%
It's a richer baritone.

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:11.500 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't feel
quite as-- you know,

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:15.220 align:middle line:84%
I have a friend who's a medium,
who I respect enormously.

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And she sees my
guides and things.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh yes there's
like that Dumbledore guide,

00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:21.370 align:middle line:90%
is how she sees him.

00:41:21.370 --> 00:41:22.950 align:middle line:90%
And I'm fine with that.

00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:25.090 align:middle line:84%
This other one feels
rather different.

00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:30.010 align:middle line:90%
He feels younger and-

00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:30.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: More modern?

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:32.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SELIG: No, he doesn't
feel more modern.

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:34.490 align:middle line:90%
They don't feel modern.

00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:35.940 align:middle line:90%
And truthfully the language--

00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:37.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They sound
like they're 1800s.

00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:39.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SELIG: Well, or prior.

00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:40.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or, prior.

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:42.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SELIG: I mean, the
one that I've seen

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:46.620 align:middle line:84%
was dressed with a hat that I've
never seen before in my life.

00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:48.425 align:middle line:84%
It was like those
things you wear

00:41:48.425 --> 00:41:50.810 align:middle line:84%
at graduation with the
peaked cap but it went up.

00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And there was a thing
at the top of it.

00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:54.762 align:middle line:84%
And he was amazing,
with this long beard,

00:41:54.762 --> 00:41:55.720 align:middle line:90%
he was a beautiful man.

00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:57.350 align:middle line:90%
Truly, beautiful eyes.

00:41:57.350 --> 00:41:58.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 1600s?

00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:58.950 align:middle line:90%
1500s?

00:41:58.950 --> 00:42:00.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SELIG: I don't know.

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:01.610 align:middle line:90%
I think we're going way back.

00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:02.901 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Way back even further.

00:42:02.901 --> 00:42:04.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SELIG: I do, I
really do think that.

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:08.140 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's
also a collective.

00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:10.464 align:middle line:84%
So who knows who's
part of the group.

00:42:10.464 --> 00:42:11.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fascinating.

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:15.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SELIG: But I do know that
they used the word internet once

00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:18.766 align:middle line:84%
in a teaching, and I
still don't trust it.

00:42:18.766 --> 00:42:19.890 align:middle line:90%
Like, I was like, internet?

00:42:19.890 --> 00:42:20.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where did
that come from?

00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:21.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SELIG: Yeah!

00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:24.740 align:middle line:10%
But for the most part,
they talk about telegraphs

00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:25.700 align:middle line:10%
and steamships.

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:28.114 align:middle line:10%
And they still call
my computer a TV.

00:42:28.114 --> 00:42:30.030 align:middle line:84%
So if I go, am I going
to hear from so and so?

00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:31.680 align:middle line:90%
They'll say, yes, on the TV.

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:32.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, that's
what they call it.

00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:33.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SELIG: Which
means, it's a screen.

00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:35.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
get a hold of you how?

00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:37.090 align:middle line:84%
Do they track you
on your website?

00:42:37.090 --> 00:42:38.810 align:middle line:10%
>>SELIG: You know
it's just my name,

00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:40.920 align:middle line:10%

That's how people find me.

being on "Beyond Belief."

you for having me.

00:42:47.410 --> 00:42:50.060 align:middle line:84%

several people today.
