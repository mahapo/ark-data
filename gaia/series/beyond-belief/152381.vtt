>>GEORGE NOORY: And welcome
back to this edition

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.280 align:middle line:90%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.270 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory,
and in this show

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.990 align:middle line:10%
we're going to be talking about
psychic mediums, the ability

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.130 align:middle line:10%
to communicate
with the other side

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.610 align:middle line:10%
and to do some
incredible things.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.560 align:middle line:84%
Our special guest
is Marla Frees.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.700 align:middle line:84%
Marla is called the
American psychic.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.930 align:middle line:90%
How did you get that phrase?

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.740 align:middle line:10%
>>MARLA FREES: Well, it's
the title of my book,

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.330 align:middle line:10%
so I decided that--

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.440 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That makes sense.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.940 align:middle line:10%
And I think the whole thing
about being an American psychic

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.560 align:middle line:10%
is we come from this incredible
heartland, at least I do.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.210 align:middle line:90%
I come from Pennsylvania.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I come from Detroit.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.920 align:middle line:90%
Same thing.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.720 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Yeah.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.350 align:middle line:84%
So it's the
heartland of America.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think that there's
something about my growing up

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.600 align:middle line:84%
that makes me the
heartland conversation.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're all
born with this ability.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.580 align:middle line:90%
Some people develop it.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.590 align:middle line:90%
Other people do not.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.600 align:middle line:90%
How did this happen for you?

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.190 align:middle line:10%
>>FREES: Well, I
think that part of it

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.690 align:middle line:10%
was the incredible growing
up in Pennsylvania.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.520 align:middle line:10%
Some of it was
challenging, and some of it

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.610 align:middle line:10%
was really wonderful, being in
the woods, being with animals,

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.230 align:middle line:10%
being with sentient beings.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.990 align:middle line:84%
But I think that it
was the challenging

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.930 align:middle line:84%
trauma that made my
hypersensitivities really

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:37.800 align:middle line:90%
aware.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Marla, is intuition
the same as being psychic?

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And by that I mean, if you get
these feelings, oh my gosh,

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.790 align:middle line:84%
I shouldn't be doing this
today, or I shouldn't

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.800 align:middle line:84%
sit at this
intersection, and then

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.620 align:middle line:84%
the car goes right through
it, you could have been hit--

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.762 align:middle line:90%
is that being psychic?

00:01:53.762 --> 00:01:54.720 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Oh, certainly.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And actually, that's
why I call myself,

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.550 align:middle line:84%
in the title of
the book, psychic.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's all
psychic functioning.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.850 align:middle line:84%
Empathic work, intuition,
it's all psychic functioning.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.470 align:middle line:90%
And yes, and we all have it.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.539 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't want to
skirt around the issue.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.140 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a terminology
that some people don't like

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.614 align:middle line:84%
or that has sort of a
negative connotation to it.

00:02:15.614 --> 00:02:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And I intend to change
that because I've

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.530 align:middle line:84%
done a lot of work, through
the science of this,

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.120 align:middle line:84%
to actually understand
psychic functioning.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.930 align:middle line:84%
So when you have
a thought process,

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.020 align:middle line:84%
when you have a feeling,
it's absolutely imperative

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.580 align:middle line:90%
to pay attention to it.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me about
your work with the dead.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.960 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: I see, hear, feel
information that comes

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.324 align:middle line:90%
from the deceased loved ones.

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:39.240 align:middle line:90%
So it can be anything.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You see dead people.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.180 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, you
know, it's funny.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.888 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The sixth
sense, the little boy.

00:02:43.888 --> 00:02:45.120 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: I'm not like that.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.849 align:middle line:84%
It's not that I see shadows or
I actually see the dead person.

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And we all have our
different skills.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.940 align:middle line:84%
Each psychic medium
has their own skill.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.410 align:middle line:84%
Mine happens to be a thin
sliced moment of emotions.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I go blind
to my present circumstances

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.220 align:middle line:84%
when they want me to
see something for you.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.600 align:middle line:84%
They bilocate me to some
memory or even your own house

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.450 align:middle line:84%
to give me
information about you.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So they contact you.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.912 align:middle line:84%
Do they sometimes
bother you too much?

00:03:14.912 --> 00:03:15.870 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: You know what?

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.560 align:middle line:84%
I think that's possibly how
we learn to train ourselves

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.260 align:middle line:84%
through this, George, because
when it started for me,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.530 align:middle line:90%
that's exactly how it started.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.250 align:middle line:90%
I was given information.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, where
is this coming from?

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.320 align:middle line:90%
And I paid attention to it.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were in
an exercise course

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.000 align:middle line:84%
when you had this
feeling about some woman.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.890 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.934 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: OK.

00:03:39.934 --> 00:03:40.810 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.090 align:middle line:84%
- I get real emotional
when I look at you,

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.930 align:middle line:84%
and I actually feel
a father figure.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.820 align:middle line:90%
Has your father passed?

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.240 align:middle line:90%
- Yes, my father did pass.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.040 align:middle line:90%
- OK.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.650 align:middle line:84%
He really wants to come
through and talk to you.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.150 align:middle line:84%
That's what was
happening when I was

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.740 align:middle line:90%
standing beside you in class.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.400 align:middle line:84%
I could feel this overwhelming,
I want her to know,

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.510 align:middle line:84%
and I saw this man, and I
knew he was your father.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And it was a deep
connection, but a separation,

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.200 align:middle line:90%
whether you even knew him.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.220 align:middle line:90%
Did you know him?

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.030 align:middle line:90%
- No.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.830 align:middle line:90%
- OK.

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.339 align:middle line:84%
So that's even more significant
because here he is, he's dead,

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:20.659 align:middle line:84%
he finds me and
wants to talk to you.

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:21.459 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.115 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you just approach
her at this exercise class?

00:04:24.115 --> 00:04:25.990 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, you know,
it was being filmed.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.750 align:middle line:84%
So I basically said, well,
I'm going to walk in here,

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.510 align:middle line:84%
and whoever I feel
the strongest to,

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.820 align:middle line:84%
we need to pull her
to be close to me.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what happened.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did that lady react
to you beyond what we just saw?

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.910 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, it was a
process for her to take--

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.366 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You looked emotional.

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:44.815 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: I was.

00:04:44.815 --> 00:04:46.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, almost
like you were crying.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:47.710 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Well, here's the thing.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.876 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you tear up
during some of these things?

00:04:49.876 --> 00:04:51.730 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, I
can feel the love

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.510 align:middle line:84%
and the emotion that's coming
through the deceased loved one.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
actually no reason

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.320 align:middle line:84%
to do this work,
George, unless--

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.440 align:middle line:90%
it is about love.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.470 align:middle line:90%
It's about the connection.

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.930 align:middle line:84%
Apparently this
gentleman had not even

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.000 align:middle line:90%
seen her daughter for years.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.900 align:middle line:90%
They had no connection.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.110 align:middle line:84%
So for him to come
in and need to make

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.140 align:middle line:84%
some form of communication with
her, that was the whole point.

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.090 align:middle line:90%
That's the love.

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.500 align:middle line:90%
And I could feel that.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.160 align:middle line:84%
I often feel the deceased's
emotions, whether it's upset,

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.400 align:middle line:84%
whether it's-- and it's
usually profound love.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this a curse
or a blessing for you?

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.620 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Oh, I think
it's the greatest

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.030 align:middle line:90%
thing that ever happened to me.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you've had no
negative undertones with this.

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.930 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, I've worked
for law enforcement,

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.180 align:middle line:84%
and people ask me about
those cases all the time.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's
giving a voice

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.120 align:middle line:90%
to somebody who needs a voice.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's helpful
to law enforcement officers.

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.193 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, tell
me how that works.

00:05:50.193 --> 00:05:52.450 align:middle line:84%
What does a law enforcement
person want with you?

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.824 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, I think that
they're at their last resort.

00:05:54.824 --> 00:05:57.370 align:middle line:84%
That's when they bring us
in because it's usually

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:58.656 align:middle line:90%
a cold case that I'll work on.

00:05:58.656 --> 00:06:01.030 align:middle line:84%
They don't have anything to
lose, so they'll bring me in.

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.980 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's information
about the actual case,

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.250 align:middle line:84%
it's a trajectory
of information.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.800 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's a map or
something that I can draw.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.260 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes it
literally is communicating

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.400 align:middle line:90%
with a deceased loved one.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had
heard, in some cases,

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.760 align:middle line:84%
where the psychic is so tuned
in that they told the police

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.970 align:middle line:84%
things only that the murderer
would know, for example.

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And that gets the psychic
looked at as a possible suspect.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.110 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, yeah, we have
to be careful about that, sure.

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.810 align:middle line:84%
I have a story in my book
that's really great about that.

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.380 align:middle line:84%
I was shooting a pilot, and I
literally went into a situation

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.460 align:middle line:84%
where I actually became the
perpetrator for a moment.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.040 align:middle line:84%
And I was working with a
detective, and I said, listen,

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.930 align:middle line:84%
I can feel myself
as the perpetrator.

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.690 align:middle line:84%
That means the
perpetrator's passed on.

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:49.240 align:middle line:84%
So interrogate me like
you would if you were

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.740 align:middle line:90%
talking to the perpetrator.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.840 align:middle line:90%
And through me, I--

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.460 align:middle line:90%
well, the perpetrator and I--

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.020 align:middle line:90%
drew a map.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And we took that
map and we actually

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.370 align:middle line:90%
put it on a map of Los Angeles.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.920 align:middle line:84%
This was in Orange
Grove, California.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.270 align:middle line:90%
Garden Grove, excuse me.

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And the lines were
the freeways, the star

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.580 align:middle line:84%
was actually the murder
that we were working on.

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.730 align:middle line:84%
And the other elements
were of the other rapes,

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.552 align:middle line:84%
and not necessarily murders
that were in that area.

00:07:15.552 --> 00:07:17.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to
come back to your work

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.370 align:middle line:90%
here in just a second.

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:22.060 align:middle line:84%
But when you get contacted
from the other side,

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.590 align:middle line:90%
where are they, generally?

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:26.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I look at it in
terms of dimensional things.

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.450 align:middle line:90%
But where are they?

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:30.387 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, and
where am I, too,

00:07:30.387 --> 00:07:32.470 align:middle line:84%
because that's always
curious, because I'm always,

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:35.200 align:middle line:84%
like, why are you
picking me in the shower?

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.550 align:middle line:84%
Why am I in a cab and you're
needing to talk to me now?

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:40.120 align:middle line:84%
So the information
is coming in and I

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.940 align:middle line:84%
could be talking to somebody on
the phone in a couple of hours.

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:44.950 align:middle line:84%
Or somebody could be
seeing me in person.

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:48.110 align:middle line:84%
But I do think it's a
dimension it's information.

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:51.010 align:middle line:90%
So they're coming to me.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:53.170 align:middle line:90%
Is the intention of love?

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:55.810 align:middle line:84%
I have the intention,
when I work with somebody,

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:59.624 align:middle line:84%
to give them the most important
information for their life.

00:07:59.624 --> 00:08:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's about
a deceased loved one,

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.180 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes it's just
straight psychic information,

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:06.700 align:middle line:84%
you know, what's going on
in your health, your career,

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.170 align:middle line:90%
your relationships.

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:11.630 align:middle line:84%
But when a deceased loved one
wants to make a connection,

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:13.420 align:middle line:90%
it comes in on a love--

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:15.280 align:middle line:90%
it's like a love filament.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.970 align:middle line:84%
It's a fiber optic
filament of love.

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:21.452 align:middle line:84%
And it connects to me, and
they use me almost like a--

00:08:21.452 --> 00:08:22.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you
feel it instantly?

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:25.510 align:middle line:84%
Is it like a burst of
energy that hits you?

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, it's certainly
a different personality.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.450 align:middle line:84%
You know, I can often
get up in the morning,

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:33.799 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just trying
to live my life.

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden
I'm craving something

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:39.130 align:middle line:84%
that I normally don't
eat, or I get fastidious

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:41.260 align:middle line:84%
and I'm cleaning up
something that I usually

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.110 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't clean up, although it's
probably good for me to do it.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:46.030 align:middle line:84%
I actually make
notes about that,

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:49.510 align:middle line:84%
because I write information
down before I even

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:51.670 align:middle line:90%
get on the phone with someone.

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And it could be about
a deceased loved one

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:57.682 align:middle line:84%
or it could be about something
that that person's doing

00:08:57.682 --> 00:08:59.140 align:middle line:84%
that they need to
change, they need

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:00.500 align:middle line:90%
to alter in their own life.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you accept the fact
that there's a heaven and hell?

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:05.450 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, let's
put it this way.

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:09.210 align:middle line:84%
I think that we create our
own heaven and our own hell.

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's my experience from
learning this from the deceased

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:16.600 align:middle line:84%
that the deceased,
when they cross over,

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.420 align:middle line:84%
have an opportunity
to see their lives,

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:23.110 align:middle line:84%
what they've done here,
the good and the bad.

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And they have to come
to some sort of--

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:28.150 align:middle line:84%
well, they have to find
some way to process

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:29.990 align:middle line:90%
that inside themselves.

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:32.500 align:middle line:84%
I have been in
situations where I've

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:36.910 align:middle line:84%
met people who have been stuck
and that needed to be released,

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:37.900 align:middle line:90%
moved on.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And I've also met
people that are

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:44.450 align:middle line:84%
in such joy and such inspiration
that they're doing their

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:47.480 align:middle line:84%
very best to try and
help us know that they're

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.580 align:middle line:84%
in a great space,
that they're fabulous,

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:53.630 align:middle line:84%
and that they're wonderful,
and that they're in heaven.

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:56.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you pick up
little voices in your head

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.590 align:middle line:90%
when they first contact you?

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:00.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how do you know
this is really happening?

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.660 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, you know, I
have enough experience now

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:03.890 align:middle line:90%
to decipher what it is.

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:07.340 align:middle line:84%
But when it first started,
it was really interesting

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:11.630 align:middle line:84%
because I had been exploring
the psychic elements of my life,

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:12.440 align:middle line:90%
hearing a voice.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.150 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it was
a voice when I was

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:16.610 align:middle line:84%
14 years old that
saved me from a very

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:18.710 align:middle line:90%
serious accident with my horse.

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:22.280 align:middle line:84%
That voice came in clear
and told me to do something

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:25.250 align:middle line:84%
that I was not prepared for,
basically said, put your feet

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:27.656 align:middle line:90%
in those stirrups and hang on.

00:10:27.656 --> 00:10:29.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And had you not,
what would have happened?

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.150 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, I could
have slammed into a wall--

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:33.275 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Cracked your head.

00:10:33.275 --> 00:10:34.850 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: I could
have died easily.

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:35.837 align:middle line:90%
So that voice--

00:10:35.837 --> 00:10:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But how do you know
that's not your inner self?

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:39.878 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, I didn't
know at the time.

00:10:39.878 --> 00:10:42.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, at the time I was
very ensconced in the church

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:44.300 align:middle line:90%
and I thought it was Jesus.

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.040 align:middle line:84%
It didn't matter
exactly what it was.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.690 align:middle line:90%
It was something that saved me.

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:51.830 align:middle line:84%
And the consciousness of
Christ, or whatever came into me

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:55.520 align:middle line:84%
at that moment, saved
me at that moment.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:59.120 align:middle line:84%
But that voice that was telling
me things, or my own intuition,

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.000 align:middle line:84%
whatever you want to call
it, I was growing myself

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.050 align:middle line:90%
through that.

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:06.860 align:middle line:84%
When it came to the deceased
loved one, different story.

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:11.180 align:middle line:84%
Personality, emotional,
intentionality, very different

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:14.499 align:middle line:84%
from that guiding voice that I
had had growing up as a child.

00:11:14.499 --> 00:11:16.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've always
wondered, Marla,

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.320 align:middle line:84%
if we have a mechanism
within our self,

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:23.180 align:middle line:84%
though, almost like radar
or something that somehow

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:28.220 align:middle line:84%
addresses these subconscious
things like your horse

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:31.790 align:middle line:84%
accident, like my almost
car accident, when something

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:34.340 align:middle line:84%
told me, don't go through
the intersection, George.

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And I've got a
green light, right?

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:38.090 align:middle line:84%
I've got people
behind me, and I've

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:40.570 align:middle line:84%
got something in my head
saying don't go through,

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:41.660 align:middle line:90%
don't go through.

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:42.920 align:middle line:90%
So I stopped.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.170 align:middle line:90%
I got people honking behind me.

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:49.250 align:middle line:84%
When I stopped, some guy
comes through his red light.

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.080 align:middle line:90%
He would have broadsided me.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.060 align:middle line:84%
God knows what would
have happened to me.

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:57.280 align:middle line:84%
But that moment that
I stopped, I was safe.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.500 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what did that.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm thinking
maybe, do we have,

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:05.500 align:middle line:84%
like some insects have this
ability to shoot signals out

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:06.520 align:middle line:90%
and stuff?

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:09.350 align:middle line:90%
Is that what's happening?

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:12.310 align:middle line:84%
Or are we really getting
help from the other side?

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:14.270 align:middle line:84%
Was there somebody
from the other side,

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:18.470 align:middle line:84%
my guardian angel, somebody
who told me that in my head?

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:19.270 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Right.

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:21.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, we can also think
about the higher self.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.220 align:middle line:84%
You've heard of the
oversoul or the higher self.

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:26.020 align:middle line:90%
That, too, along with--

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:28.990 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes it's a
belief system about angels.

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:31.030 align:middle line:90%
To me it's consciousness.

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:32.874 align:middle line:10%
Whatever the consciousness is--

00:12:32.874 --> 00:12:34.540 align:middle line:10%
you know, I've been
studying and working

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:38.170 align:middle line:10%
with Tom Campbell, the physicist
and consciousness expert.

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:41.260 align:middle line:10%
And I've learned to use
the terminology larger

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:42.700 align:middle line:10%
consciousness
system, because it's

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.790 align:middle line:10%
great PR for God and
Jesus, because everything

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:48.880 align:middle line:10%
in this consciousness that
has come to us to assist us

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:52.720 align:middle line:10%
is from a greater consciousness
that is incredibly benevolent.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we have
something to do here, George,

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:59.050 align:middle line:84%
and we are interested
in all the aspects

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:01.150 align:middle line:90%
about this psychic functioning.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:05.560 align:middle line:84%
The subconscious, the
angels, the loved ones

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:06.890 align:middle line:90%
who want to come in.

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:10.420 align:middle line:84%
This is what we're interested
in, along with other energies

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:14.080 align:middle line:84%
that want to help us, want
to give us information.

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.550 align:middle line:90%
It's all consciousness.

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:17.412 align:middle line:90%
It's to help us grow up.

00:13:17.412 --> 00:13:19.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I saw a movie
with John Travolta

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.820 align:middle line:84%
where he got zapped by
lightning, almost killed him.

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And once he awakened, he was
really psychic and tuned in.

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:28.020 align:middle line:90%
That trauma works, doesn't it?

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:28.870 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Absolutely.

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:30.850 align:middle line:84%
When I told you
about the incident

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:33.980 align:middle line:84%
when I was 14 years old
when the voice came to me,

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.910 align:middle line:84%
I literally did get off that
horse, and I did hit my head,

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:41.140 align:middle line:84%
and that's when a lot of the
voice and connection happened.

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.240 align:middle line:84%
But oh my god, there
have been instances

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.010 align:middle line:90%
after instances about this.

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And in the second half of
my book, "American Psychic,"

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:52.090 align:middle line:84%
the point is when I am
stalked by an individual,

00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:55.330 align:middle line:84%
that antenna blew
out of my head,

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.550 align:middle line:84%
and that's when all this
stuff started coming in.

00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:00.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why does
trauma do this?

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.930 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: I think that
fear has two sides to it.

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:07.230 align:middle line:84%
Fear can make us more
aware and open us up,

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:09.270 align:middle line:90%
or it can shut us down.

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think with me,
I was like looking,

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:15.480 align:middle line:84%
asking, praying,
intentioning, meditating.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.550 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to be able to see.

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:19.230 align:middle line:84%
I needed to see
to get myself out

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:21.810 align:middle line:84%
of the situation
instead of cloistering

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:24.630 align:middle line:90%
myself or medicating myself.

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very
interesting aspect

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:29.160 align:middle line:84%
about medication
within our society,

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:33.060 align:middle line:84%
because I do believe that our
sensitivities and our traumas

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:35.130 align:middle line:84%
are what people are
trying to medicate.

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:38.940 align:middle line:10%
And if we can find a way to
help people understand and heal

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:42.810 align:middle line:10%
this emotional depravity
from their childhood, or even

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:45.720 align:middle line:10%
an event, or even a
war, then perhaps people

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.090 align:middle line:10%
don't come back and
need to be medicated

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:52.920 align:middle line:10%
by opioids or any kind
of substance like that.

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:55.110 align:middle line:84%
I think it is in the
psychic functioning

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:58.050 align:middle line:84%
that we need help being
able to translate it.

00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:00.210 align:middle line:84%
We need to also take
the booga booga out

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:03.480 align:middle line:84%
of it, so that it is literally
psychic functioning that

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.340 align:middle line:84%
is something that
we all do and that

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:08.330 align:middle line:84%
has no negative
connotation with it.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:10.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were
talking about your work

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:14.894 align:middle line:84%
with law enforcement in
homicides, in cases like that.

00:15:14.894 --> 00:15:15.768 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:15:15.768 --> 00:15:17.280 align:middle line:90%
- OK.

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:20.720 align:middle line:84%
Listen, my frame of reference
as a psychic profiler

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:24.110 align:middle line:84%
is, if I'm in the car right
here, I'm feeling things,

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:25.850 align:middle line:90%
so I'm going to step out.

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:29.090 align:middle line:10%
If there was sexual assault,
which there may have been,

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:32.330 align:middle line:10%
she doesn't want her family
to have to relive that.

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:37.040 align:middle line:84%
I know that she sat
here for hours dead.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.660 align:middle line:84%
So after the altercation,
nobody found her.

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:41.540 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my neck.

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.210 align:middle line:84%
Every time I step
back into this car,

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:45.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm assuming that
the car's here.

00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:47.610 align:middle line:84%
It's like pulling
right in there.

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:49.130 align:middle line:90%
It's like pulling.

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:52.250 align:middle line:84%
So when she comes in
and comes to this plane

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:54.470 align:middle line:84%
or comes to the frequency
of being living,

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:58.430 align:middle line:84%
she allows herself in
me to feel the feelings

00:15:58.430 --> 00:15:59.750 align:middle line:90%
of what happened to her.

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:02.300 align:middle line:84%
My throat is starting
to tighten up.

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:07.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting tight on my throat
like I'm losing my voice.

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:09.470 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:11.520 align:middle line:84%
This isn't what she
planned for her life.

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.870 align:middle line:84%
This is not how she
wanted to end her life.

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:17.450 align:middle line:84%
This is not, of course,
what she wanted her family

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:18.720 align:middle line:90%
to be left with.

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:19.520 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened there?

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:24.800 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, she was picked
up and taken to that spot,

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:27.170 align:middle line:84%
and she was raped and
murdered and she was choked.

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:29.970 align:middle line:90%
And I believe that--

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:34.110 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember if she
broke her neck at that point.

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:36.350 align:middle line:84%
But that's what happened
in the back of the car.

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:38.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what did
police need from you?

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:40.223 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, it needed
to be corroborated.

00:16:40.223 --> 00:16:42.320 align:middle line:90%
This was actually a cold case.

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And the one that I was talking
about, stepping in and becoming

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:47.360 align:middle line:84%
that perpetrator and
drawing that map, that

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:50.930 align:middle line:90%
was also part of this program.

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:56.930 align:middle line:84%
This victim allowed
her story to be used.

00:16:56.930 --> 00:17:00.640 align:middle line:84%
This particular pilot
did not hit the air,

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.580 align:middle line:84%
but it was transformational
for the family members

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:06.240 align:middle line:84%
because the family members
were also worked with.

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, what's curious
about this, George,

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:11.440 align:middle line:84%
is that when I stepped
onto that area,

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.480 align:middle line:84%
that car was not
there, of course.

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.970 align:middle line:84%
It was just the area
that it happened.

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:19.700 align:middle line:84%
So information lives
in these places,

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:21.069 align:middle line:90%
whether it's in an object--

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:24.430 align:middle line:84%
you can go to a place
where a murder was.

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:27.369 align:middle line:84%
And there's some element
inside of my system

00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:29.290 align:middle line:90%
that can hook into this.

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And I actually went through
that process with her.

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:34.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you remote viewing?

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:39.340 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: On some levels we
are when I'm doing this work.

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:42.940 align:middle line:84%
I think that it's
past information,

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:44.920 align:middle line:84%
it's present
information, and it's

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:47.560 align:middle line:90%
also precognition, in some way.

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:52.240 align:middle line:84%
The remote viewing is, if
I'm not going to the place,

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.400 align:middle line:90%
I can see it sometimes.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.850 align:middle line:84%
I can bilocate there and see
sort of what's happening.

00:17:57.850 --> 00:18:01.420 align:middle line:84%
But actually going to the site,
that's a whole other thing.

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:06.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you sometimes,
Marla see the perpetrator?

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:08.150 align:middle line:84%
Do you sometimes
see, for example,

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:11.500 align:middle line:84%
in her case, the
person who killed her?

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:14.740 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, I did do a
sketch of that individual.

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:17.140 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know exactly
what happened with that.

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:19.390 align:middle line:84%
And part of the process of
working for law enforcement

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:21.730 align:middle line:84%
is giving people information,
and you don't always

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:24.010 align:middle line:90%
get the feedback.

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:28.930 align:middle line:84%
I've worked cases that have
gone on to be successful.

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:31.150 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you
don't know exactly what

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:32.540 align:middle line:90%
happened at the end.

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And there are cases, like
I worked that OJ case.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.650 align:middle line:10%
And what happened-- I
mean, we all sort of

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:41.230 align:middle line:10%
knew what happened
in that situation.

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:44.710 align:middle line:84%
But we have no
justice, necessarily,

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:46.120 align:middle line:90%
the way that we want.

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:49.900 align:middle line:84%
Justice, the way a spiritual
conversation is, is there's

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:52.000 align:middle line:84%
something had to
happen where he was not

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.070 align:middle line:90%
prosecuted at that time.

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:57.130 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's the
sense of the DNA had

00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:58.360 align:middle line:90%
to be collected differently.

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:00.190 align:middle line:90%
That's when CSI was developed.

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And also, domestic violence
was changed all over the world

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:04.162 align:middle line:90%
because of that case.

00:19:04.162 --> 00:19:05.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
you tapping into?

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:10.630 align:middle line:84%
Are you tapping into the victim
who relays this story to you?

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:14.810 align:middle line:84%
Or are you sometimes
tapping into the perpetrator

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:16.075 align:middle line:90%
through his or her eyes?

00:19:16.075 --> 00:19:18.322 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Yes, sometimes
that's the way it is.

00:19:18.322 --> 00:19:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And there have been
cases that I've

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:22.120 align:middle line:84%
worked on through the
perpetrator's eyes, most

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.127 align:middle line:90%
definitely.

00:19:23.127 --> 00:19:24.460 align:middle line:90%
And that's part of the element--

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:27.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's scary,
don't you think, for you

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:33.190 align:middle line:84%
to be able to be visualizing
what some murderer is actually

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:34.480 align:middle line:90%
doing through his eyes?

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, I actually am
protected in that way, George.

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:40.090 align:middle line:84%
I feel that I get
to a certain point,

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:41.800 align:middle line:84%
and it's really
about the intention

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.330 align:middle line:84%
of why I'm there
in the first place,

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:46.600 align:middle line:84%
to give law enforcement
some piece of information.

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.222 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes-- I mean, look,
they always ask psychics,

00:19:49.222 --> 00:19:51.430 align:middle line:84%
you know, well, why aren't
you giving us the lottery?

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:53.810 align:middle line:84%
Or why aren't you
saying it's John Smith?

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:57.580 align:middle line:84%
There's a trajectory to
this that is not up to us.

00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:59.560 align:middle line:84%
There is some form
of information,

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:04.880 align:middle line:84%
or a time about this, George,
that is not under our control.

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:08.006 align:middle line:84%
I'm given the information that
I'm seeing, that I'm hearing.

00:20:08.006 --> 00:20:08.880 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I do.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.290 align:middle line:84%
That's my job when
I work those cases.

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:13.900 align:middle line:84%

>>FREES: Well, it might not be
that it's not getting it right.

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:23.660 align:middle line:84%
It might be that the
information is not enough

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.940 align:middle line:90%
for them to do their job.

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:30.080 align:middle line:84%
There was a case with the Cal
Poly student, Kristin Smart.

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.330 align:middle line:10%
There were a number of us
that all worked on that.

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:34.310 align:middle line:84%
And this is when I was
first in the field,

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:37.370 align:middle line:84%
literally in the field
looking for various things

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:41.420 align:middle line:84%
about the murder, looking
for the body, whatever.

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:43.520 align:middle line:90%
We all sort of know--

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:46.130 align:middle line:84%
we all know who
the perpetrator is,

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:48.500 align:middle line:84%
and we can't do a
darn thing about it.

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:50.927 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's got to be
frustrating, very frustrating.

00:20:50.927 --> 00:20:53.510 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, we have to trust
that this larger consciousness

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:55.550 align:middle line:84%

this information that's

working with us,
this god source,

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:01.940 align:middle line:84%
is possibly helping
the family members.

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:05.460 align:middle line:84%
The victim is maybe doing
something from the other side.

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:06.260 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:09.260 align:middle line:84%
We just have to trust that
whatever information we get

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:10.912 align:middle line:90%
is basically the best we can do.

>>NOORY: Well, how do you know
that you're being contacted?

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:15.630 align:middle line:84%
What is happening to you
when this is happening?

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:16.430 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: All right.

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:17.630 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you an
example of this.

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:19.990 align:middle line:84%
You know what you did for
breakfast this morning, right?

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I didn't have any.

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:21.410 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: OK.

00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:23.820 align:middle line:84%
You know how you got up and
you went into the shower,

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:24.680 align:middle line:90%
or you made a call.

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.110 align:middle line:84%
You can have that information
in your brain, right?

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:28.943 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, that's
how it happens for me,

00:21:28.943 --> 00:21:30.500 align:middle line:90%
but it's not my information.

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:31.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, oh.

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:32.260 align:middle line:90%
This is interesting.

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:33.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you know,
you can tell it's not.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:34.240 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Yes.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:36.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, oh, I'm
being shown this.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:37.300 align:middle line:90%
Hmm.

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:38.100 align:middle line:90%
Write that down.

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:40.100 align:middle line:84%

confusing sometimes?

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:41.510 align:middle line:10%

>>FREES: Yeah.

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:49.640 align:middle line:10%
Well, I still learn
how to do that.

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.120 align:middle line:90%
We're all in a learning process.

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.764 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm constantly learning.

>>NOORY: What would
you say, for you,

00:21:56.911 --> 00:21:58.910 align:middle line:84%
has been your most
compelling case

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:02.290 align:middle line:90%
that you've had to deal with?

00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:04.740 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, actually,
it was one of my first.

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And it actually opened up the
investigation to go forward

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.050 align:middle line:90%
and to try an individual.

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:11.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened?

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:12.309 align:middle line:90%
What was that story?

00:22:12.309 --> 00:22:14.850 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, actually, it was
a friend of mine from college

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:17.010 align:middle line:84%
who said, well, I heard
you turned into some sort

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:18.060 align:middle line:90%
of psychic or something.

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:20.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm very interested in
taking a look at this murder.

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:23.430 align:middle line:84%
And he brought me a
crime scene photo.

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And I held it, and I immediately
bilocated to a field.

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:32.670 align:middle line:84%
It was at nighttime, and I
could see that I was this girl.

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:35.400 align:middle line:84%
I looked down and I could see
the dress that I was wearing.

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And I looked up and I recognized
the man who was talking to me.

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:42.590 align:middle line:90%
He was a friend of mine.

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:45.250 align:middle line:90%
And he turned and he hit me.

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:46.426 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He hit you?

00:22:46.426 --> 00:22:47.800 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, he
hit the victim.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:48.660 align:middle line:90%
He hit me.

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And my immediate response
was, why did you do that?

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And I gave the information
to the gentleman

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:56.730 align:middle line:90%
who brought me the photo.

00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:58.500 align:middle line:84%
This is also in the
book, by the way.

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.750 align:middle line:90%
He gave it to--

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:03.510 align:middle line:84%
actually, he gave it to
an investigative reporter,

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:05.250 align:middle line:84%
and the investigative
reporter took it

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:07.410 align:middle line:84%
in because they were
not so sure what

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:10.200 align:middle line:84%
would happen if a psychic
gave him that information.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:13.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There have been all
kinds of sources, I guess,

different planes of existence.

00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:19.470 align:middle line:90%

- Researchers have tied Maria
Orsick to a secret society

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:25.020 align:middle line:90%
called the Vril.

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:28.530 align:middle line:84%
This society performed exercises
to awaken what the ancients

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:30.990 align:middle line:90%
referred to as chi.

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:33.900 align:middle line:84%
The legend of Maria
suggests that one night she

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:36.120 align:middle line:84%
was channeling for a
group of social elite

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:39.660 align:middle line:84%
when an otherworldly being
came through and claimed he was

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:42.420 align:middle line:90%
from the star system Aldebaran.

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:43.800 align:middle line:90%
He had a message.

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.260 align:middle line:84%
Maria, still in a
trance, began writing

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:48.480 align:middle line:84%
in a mysterious
language and drawing

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.643 align:middle line:90%

>>FREES: Well, actually, when
I go to the Monroe Institute,

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.910 align:middle line:10%
this is part of the work
that is done there for me.

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:08.010 align:middle line:10%
When I said I like
to continue to train,

00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:12.610 align:middle line:10%
I go to the largest place of
education that you can for--

00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:14.360 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's been
around for a long time.

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:15.900 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Yeah,
expanded awareness,

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:18.010 align:middle line:84%
without the use of
drugs, by the way.

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:19.290 align:middle line:90%
So this is where I go.

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:22.620 align:middle line:84%
And there are programs where
we are literally accessing

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:24.420 align:middle line:90%
other consciousnesses.

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And I put a little
recorder on me.

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:30.330 align:middle line:84%
I basically download what
I hear and sometimes there

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:32.220 align:middle line:90%
are drawings along with that.

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:35.040 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not making any
claims as to somebody coming

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:37.470 align:middle line:90%
from a particular star system.

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:39.800 align:middle line:84%
But I have been in
communication with that.

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.510 align:middle line:84%
Actually, there's something
going on right now.

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:45.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm involved in a project
with a partner of mine.

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:46.470 align:middle line:90%
And we have a--

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:49.230 align:middle line:84%
I guess we'd have to call
it a cosmic consciousness

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:52.140 align:middle line:84%
project, which is
basically photographs

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:54.275 align:middle line:90%
from celestial objects.

00:24:54.275 --> 00:24:55.150 align:middle line:90%

>>FREES: And we're
getting information.

00:24:56.775 --> 00:24:58.500 align:middle line:84%
Seems as though
there is information

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:02.110 align:middle line:84%
in that light that is coming
in the form of photographs.

00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:04.456 align:middle line:84%
And we're having it
looked at by all sorts

00:25:04.456 --> 00:25:06.080 align:middle line:84%
of different scientists
and physicists.

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
intrigued by this so far?

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:09.750 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Oh, absolutely.

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:13.080 align:middle line:84%
It has expanded the
idea of consciousness

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:18.120 align:middle line:84%
into the consciousness from
the stars and planets giving us

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.320 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:21.590 align:middle line:84%
And it literally
is changing people.

00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:24.090 align:middle line:84%
We're not the only people that
are taking these photographs.

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:26.130 align:middle line:84%
We're actually having
other people take them

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:29.037 align:middle line:84%
and would love to come in and
talk about this another time.

00:25:29.037 --> 00:25:30.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely, yeah.

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:34.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, we talked about
angelic intervention as well.

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:37.020 align:middle line:84%
How would you
categorize that compared

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:39.030 align:middle line:90%
to contacts from the dead?

00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:40.600 align:middle line:84%
What are the angelic
interventions?

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:41.400 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.858 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well,
sometimes people who

00:25:42.858 --> 00:25:45.720 align:middle line:84%
have had these
interventions, it's for them.

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.370 align:middle line:90%
They actually feel it.

00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:49.500 align:middle line:84%
It's to give them
another awareness

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:53.120 align:middle line:84%
that there's more to this
physical matter reality

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.390 align:middle line:90%
than we know.

00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And if they are
connected to a belief

00:25:56.100 --> 00:26:01.230 align:middle line:84%
system about angels or
other entities like that,

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:02.870 align:middle line:90%
then that's for them.

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:05.386 align:middle line:84%
It's to help them
understand something.

00:26:05.386 --> 00:26:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And when they can share
it with other people,

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:09.270 align:middle line:90%
then it gives rise to more--

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:10.710 align:middle line:90%
it's about lowering our entropy.

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:13.320 align:middle line:84%
It's about removing
the chaos of what's

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:15.660 align:middle line:84%
going on in our
world and our fear

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:18.210 align:middle line:84%
and coming back into love,
being heart-centered.

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:22.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you learning from
these entities personally?

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:23.700 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Absolutely.

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:28.560 align:middle line:84%
I feel that the dead have taught
me so much about compassion

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:29.880 align:middle line:90%
and forgiveness.

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
been the trajectory

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:35.430 align:middle line:84%
of possibly why I ended up doing
this work in the first place,

00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:38.040 align:middle line:90%
because it literally is.

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.240 align:middle line:90%
It's healing.

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:43.740 align:middle line:84%
It's healing the dysfunction
that I came in as a child with.

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:49.050 align:middle line:84%
It's healing the elements of
all the pain and the trauma.

00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:51.810 align:middle line:84%
It's moving through
our consciousness

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:55.320 align:middle line:84%
and finding more love not just
for others, but ourselves,

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:57.270 align:middle line:90%
which is absolutely crucial.

00:26:57.270 --> 00:27:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's in the forgiveness
of those people that wound us,

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:03.270 align:middle line:84%
and the dead, my goodness,
the conversations that they've

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:05.589 align:middle line:84%
come in with have
been extraordinary.

00:27:05.589 --> 00:27:07.380 align:middle line:84%

>>FREES: Oh, my goodness, yes.

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:13.570 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like sitting in
the middle of tennis balls.

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:15.570 align:middle line:84%
I've got this person here
and that person there.

00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:16.450 align:middle line:90%
It's family.

00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:18.690 align:middle line:84%
I love doing groups
where everybody

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:21.420 align:middle line:84%
gets to hear the information
that's coming in.

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:22.830 align:middle line:90%

>>NOORY: Are they wowed by
all of this, these people?

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:27.210 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: I think they're moved.

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:30.250 align:middle line:84%

their awareness, George.

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:42.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, any time somebody has
their own experience of it,

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:43.620 align:middle line:90%
it changes them.

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:47.150 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes sitting with me and
people who are my friends,

00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:49.050 align:middle line:84%
the longer they spend
more time with me,

00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:52.180 align:middle line:84%
the more psychic and aware
they become themselves.

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
this is where we are.

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:57.630 align:middle line:84%
Being involved in this
work, as we have been,

00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:00.090 align:middle line:84%
as long as we have
been doing this,

00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:03.870 align:middle line:84%

psychic, how would you

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:11.260 align:middle line:84%
compare to the psychic

00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:12.060 align:middle line:90%

00:28:16.404 --> 00:28:17.820 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, how
about language?

00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:18.780 align:middle line:90%
That's one thing.

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:20.490 align:middle line:84%
Although language
is interesting.

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:21.990 align:middle line:84%
When you are in a
different country,

00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:24.090 align:middle line:84%
and I don't speak
the language, I

00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:26.730 align:middle line:84%
can feel the information
coming through,

00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:28.410 align:middle line:90%
and they will show me things.

00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:33.450 align:middle line:84%
But I think the aspect of being
American is truly very special.

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:39.030 align:middle line:84%
How we were, how we came here,
and also why we came here.

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:42.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, let's go back to
before we were even born.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.800 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to the
emotional DNA that

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.450 align:middle line:90%
made us choose this lifetime.

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:47.370 align:middle line:84%
That's a whole
other conversation.

00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Why we're here in
America, what are

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:53.210 align:middle line:84%
we to do here, how we
have influenced worlds,

00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:57.020 align:middle line:84%
how we have been certain
leaders in various things.

00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's sort of
changing right now.

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:03.260 align:middle line:84%
We're all in a process of
finding responsibility inside

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:05.240 align:middle line:90%
of ourselves, as well as truth.

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's crucial that
other people understand

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.440 align:middle line:90%
their own psychic abilities.

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:13.700 align:middle line:84%
These abilities that we
have all been blessed with

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:18.410 align:middle line:84%
didn't just stop when the
Bible stopped being written.

00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:20.270 align:middle line:84%
These things, the
prophecy, the vision,

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:22.522 align:middle line:84%

birthright all along.

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:35.660 align:middle line:84%
They've reincarnated and
they don't come back.

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:36.360 align:middle line:90%
They don't communicate with you.

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:37.651 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Well, it's more like--

00:29:37.651 --> 00:29:42.610 align:middle line:84%
let's look at it in a scientific
way of accessing data.

00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:47.730 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm accessing someone's
information, and all

00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:50.700 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden it stops,
and I no longer

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:52.830 align:middle line:84%
access that
information for people,

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:55.120 align:middle line:90%
it's often about reincarnation.

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:56.790 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes people
on the other side

00:29:56.790 --> 00:30:01.710 align:middle line:84%
stay in that incarnation, for
some reason, for a long time.

00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:04.610 align:middle line:84%
I've accessed all the way
back to Catherine the Great.

- Many people believe in
some form of reincarnation.

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:39.120 align:middle line:10%
The concept dates back to 800
BC and the Hindu Upanishads.

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:42.600 align:middle line:84%
Beginning in India, the belief
that some essential part

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:46.110 align:middle line:84%
of ourselves may return
after death to a new body,

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:49.950 align:middle line:84%
is now being examined by some
scientists as another way

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:52.290 align:middle line:84%
to prove the survival
of consciousness.

that I stood up and told
everybody in the group what

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:22.680 align:middle line:90%
had happened to me.

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:26.760 align:middle line:84%

>>FREES: Yeah.

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:35.790 align:middle line:84%
I sort of begrudgingly
said, OK, OK.

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:38.850 align:middle line:84%
But there were aspects of
that that were so profound.

00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't on this
Earth when I saw this.

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:48.050 align:middle line:84%
I was above the Earth in
some sort of structure.

00:31:48.050 --> 00:31:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And I was standing
on a precipice,

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:53.090 align:middle line:84%
and I was shown
North America, and I

00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:58.100 align:middle line:84%
was told where I had
to go and pole light.

00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:01.690 align:middle line:84%

crap, I got to go back.

00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:03.080 align:middle line:90%
I got to go back.

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:04.040 align:middle line:90%
And it was dramatic.

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:05.450 align:middle line:90%
It changed everything.

going to the Monroe Institute.

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:32.880 align:middle line:84%
I also have lots of friends
within this world who

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:35.960 align:middle line:84%
have written many, many books

00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:43.160 align:middle line:84%
who have a resonance
that is heart-centered,

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:45.590 align:middle line:84%
because unless it's
heart-centered,

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:47.930 align:middle line:84%
the intention is
going to be off.

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:49.340 align:middle line:90%
It's just the way it happens.

00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:54.920 align:middle line:84%
I really feel that it's because
of my desire to help others,

00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:57.500 align:middle line:84%
because of what I had
to go through myself,

00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:00.624 align:middle line:84%

need you to talk to
so-and-so, I actually

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:39.560 align:middle line:84%
will get the help of possibly
one of my students or someone

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:42.230 align:middle line:84%
else to help me
process that so they

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:45.470 align:middle line:84%
can hold the space because I
happen to know the history.

00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:47.150 align:middle line:84%
But if I bring someone
else in to do it,

00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:49.020 align:middle line:84%
they don't know
anything about it.

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:50.600 align:middle line:84%
So I will give them
the opportunity

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:52.400 align:middle line:90%
to help work this out for me.

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:55.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Marla, do the dead
visit us in our dream state?

00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:57.440 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Oh, yes, absolutely.

00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:00.170 align:middle line:84%
I think it's one of the most
crucial places for people

00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:02.510 align:middle line:90%
to get that information.

00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And possibly it's
because there's

00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:10.969 align:middle line:84%
so much dogma around some of the
organized religion situations

00:34:10.969 --> 00:34:13.190 align:middle line:84%
that people don't
feel safe unless they

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:16.790 align:middle line:84%
are seeing a deceased
loved one in a dream state.

00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:20.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has technology
helped what you do at all?

00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:23.630 align:middle line:84%
Do you use technology
in your field?

00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:26.449 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, I think the
technology of brain entrainment

00:34:26.449 --> 00:34:28.473 align:middle line:90%
is really important.

00:34:28.473 --> 00:34:30.889 align:middle line:10%
And you know, Tom Campbell,
who I've been working with, he

00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:33.170 align:middle line:10%
and Dennis Mennerich
and Bob Monroe

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:35.480 align:middle line:10%
are the ones that developed
the hemisync program,

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:36.780 align:middle line:10%
the binaural beats.

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:38.780 align:middle line:10%
And I think that balancing
brainwave frequencies

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:39.739 align:middle line:10%
is crucial.

00:34:39.739 --> 00:34:41.750 align:middle line:10%
But one of the key
things about that is--

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:44.030 align:middle line:10%
and this is one of the
things I love about Monroe--

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:47.420 align:middle line:10%
it's a structured environment
for people to feel safe,

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:50.300 align:middle line:10%
and they have other
facilitators working with them.

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:52.219 align:middle line:84%
I think that when people
do this on their own

00:34:52.219 --> 00:34:53.780 align:middle line:84%
and start playing
around with it,

00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:55.639 align:middle line:90%
they really do need assistance.

00:34:55.639 --> 00:34:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And I've sat in circles and
been invited to do this.

00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:04.310 align:middle line:84%
So the whole second half of
the book that I have written

00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:07.490 align:middle line:84%
is basically this insight
because I didn't grow up

00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:09.170 align:middle line:90%
talking to dead people.

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:11.440 align:middle line:84%
It literally is
the remote viewers.

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:13.280 align:middle line:84%
Lyn Buchanan, I
trained with him.

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:15.330 align:middle line:10%
He literally is the
one that makes--

00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:16.580 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: He's one of the best.

00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:18.770 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: And he made sense
of this for me, George.

00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:19.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:21.210 align:middle line:90%
And he doesn't put people down.

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:23.340 align:middle line:90%
And he encourages you.

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:24.140 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Yeah.

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:25.550 align:middle line:90%
Oh, absolutely.

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:27.980 align:middle line:84%
And he was an
aspect of my father

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:31.250 align:middle line:84%
that I really, really
needed; that military man

00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:34.550 align:middle line:84%
who wanted to do
something with his life

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:36.730 align:middle line:84%
that he couldn't when
my father came back.

00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:38.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Now how does this work?

00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:40.020 align:middle line:90%
How does it happen?

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:41.660 align:middle line:84%
How are you able to
contact the dead?

00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:43.470 align:middle line:84%
How are they able
to contact you?

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:48.020 align:middle line:84%
How are people able to have
precognition and intuition?

00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:53.020 align:middle line:84%
What is it, in your opinion,
that we're tapping into?

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:57.490 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: I think it's the brain
functioning and the frequency

00:35:57.490 --> 00:35:59.440 align:middle line:90%
and the intention.

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:04.960 align:middle line:84%
I think that it's consciousness
trying to manifest through us.

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And it takes time, but
it takes awareness.

00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:13.510 align:middle line:84%
If we're bankers and we start
having these experiences,

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:16.210 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be freaked out,
like something's happening

00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:17.010 align:middle line:90%
to me.

00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:20.380 align:middle line:84%
We have lots of fear around
how people perceive us.

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:25.480 align:middle line:84%
So if something happens to
us when we get to grow up,

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:28.180 align:middle line:84%
and it's whether we're going to
take that opportunity or not.

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:29.710 align:middle line:84%
I was hit over the
head, basically.

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:30.670 align:middle line:90%
I had to do this.

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:31.753 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: RIght, literally.

00:36:31.753 --> 00:36:33.590 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Yeah, in
many different ways.

00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:36.850 align:middle line:84%
So I had to find ways
to get myself help.

00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is what happens,
I think, to people.

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:41.830 align:middle line:84%
Something shifts, and
it's usually loss.

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:44.210 align:middle line:84%
It can be a deceased
loved one that they lose.

00:36:44.210 --> 00:36:45.010 align:middle line:90%
It can be money.

00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:46.480 align:middle line:90%
It can be a relationship.

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:49.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, my book starts off
with the end of my marriage,

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.340 align:middle line:84%
because that was a whoa, here
I am a psychic, and you know,

00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:53.140 align:middle line:90%
this happens.

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:54.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
see that coming?

00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:55.596 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Well, I was warned.

00:36:55.596 --> 00:36:58.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, sometimes,
though, as psychics,

00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:02.170 align:middle line:90%
you cannot work for yourself.

00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:04.975 align:middle line:84%
It works for other
folks and other people,

00:37:04.975 --> 00:37:07.342 align:middle line:84%
but it's too close to
you for some reason.

00:37:07.342 --> 00:37:08.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You needed
another psychic

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:10.050 align:middle line:90%
to tell you what was going on.

00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:11.680 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, let's
put it this way.

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:13.660 align:middle line:90%
I was warned.

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:16.510 align:middle line:84%
I was warned a number
of different times,

00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:19.210 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't want to even look.

00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:21.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, who wants
their marriage to end?

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:23.050 align:middle line:84%
Who wants to look
over their shoulder

00:37:23.050 --> 00:37:24.430 align:middle line:90%
and really see what's going on?

00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:27.000 align:middle line:84%
Who wants to take
responsibility for the fact

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.130 align:middle line:84%
that I was not
honoring my own self?

00:37:30.130 --> 00:37:31.540 align:middle line:90%
And that's kind of what happens.

00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:32.470 align:middle line:90%
But it's true.

00:37:32.470 --> 00:37:33.270 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:36.067 align:middle line:84%
I seek the assistance of
astrologers sometimes,

00:37:36.067 --> 00:37:37.150 align:middle line:90%
as well as other psychics.

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:38.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you still learning?

00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:40.750 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Absolutely.

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:41.990 align:middle line:90%
It's crucial.

00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:43.320 align:middle line:90%
It's fundamental.

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, my
theory is we are all

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:47.980 align:middle line:90%
connected, all connected.

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:49.120 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Me too.

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:49.960 align:middle line:90%
I believe that.

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:51.335 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
how this happens.

00:37:51.335 --> 00:37:53.180 align:middle line:84%
That's how we pick
up these things.

00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:55.710 align:middle line:84%
>>FREES: Well, you ask
about the learning.

00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:59.350 align:middle line:84%
I'd just been a part of this
applied pre-cognition program

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:03.100 align:middle line:84%
where we're using psychic
functioning and remote viewing

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:07.270 align:middle line:84%
to work in the stock market
and to check out finances

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:09.250 align:middle line:84%
and how to wager
and all of that.

00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:11.874 align:middle line:84%
And that was something that
I never even thought of.

00:38:11.874 --> 00:38:13.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let me know how
it works out for you.

00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:15.060 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Well, it's possible.

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:15.860 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:19.640 align:middle line:10%
I was just in Vegas doing
this with Marty Rosenblatt.

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:20.440 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah.

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:21.440 align:middle line:10%
Marty's good at that.

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:22.180 align:middle line:10%
>>FREES: And Lyn
Buchanan was there

00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:23.410 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Was he successful?

00:38:23.410 --> 00:38:23.710 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Yes.

00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:25.251 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was a whole
group of people,

00:38:25.251 --> 00:38:26.890 align:middle line:84%
and we were all
quite successful.

00:38:26.890 --> 00:38:30.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've also noticed one
thing about things like Vegas.

00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:35.740 align:middle line:84%
You must go into it with
a very upbeat attitude.

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:39.730 align:middle line:84%
If you go into it
with negativity

00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:43.510 align:middle line:84%
that I'm going to lose, this
isn't going to work out,

00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:45.430 align:middle line:84%
I guess you could do
that in anything in life.

00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:47.200 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to happen.

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:49.900 align:middle line:10%
>>FREES: Well, we're protected
from that because we're

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:52.330 align:middle line:10%
actually-- we're not
going down to a table

00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:54.980 align:middle line:10%
and we're trying to assess
the cards or anything.

00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:55.960 align:middle line:90%
It's not like that.

00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:59.590 align:middle line:84%
We're actually remote viewing
the photo site feedback

00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:02.020 align:middle line:90%
for the winner.

00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:04.990 align:middle line:10%
And so we're just
doing a regular target.

00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:06.520 align:middle line:10%
What's interesting
about it, though,

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:09.550 align:middle line:10%
is that the photo site,
it comes in an envelope.

00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:12.700 align:middle line:84%
There's two pictures and it
says yes or no on the back.

00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:17.960 align:middle line:84%
But the envelope hasn't even
been chosen until after we're

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:19.750 align:middle line:90%
finished doing our session.

00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:21.772 align:middle line:84%
It's remarkable of
this pre-cognition,

00:39:21.772 --> 00:39:22.730 align:middle line:90%
what our brains can do.

00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:23.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It works.

00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:24.330 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Yeah.

00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:26.950 align:middle line:84%
But if I was watching the
game that I was betting on,

00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:28.206 align:middle line:90%
it would be no, no, no.

00:39:28.206 --> 00:39:29.080 align:middle line:90%
And I'd be emotional.

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:31.090 align:middle line:84%
No, come on,
Yankees, go, go, go.

00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:32.670 align:middle line:84%
This way I don't
have to do that.

00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:33.610 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating.

00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:35.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
find you, Marla?

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:36.850 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Marlafrees.com.

00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:38.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And Marla, thanks
for being on "Beyond Belief."

00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:39.320 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Thank you, George.

00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've
been a true delight.

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:41.440 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Thank you.

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:43.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How to be
an American psychic.

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:44.010 align:middle line:90%
Marla Frees.

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:46.135 align:middle line:84%
That's what she's done
since she was a little girl,

00:39:46.135 --> 00:39:48.910 align:middle line:84%
and she's going to
continue doing it well
