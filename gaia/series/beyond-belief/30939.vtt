good to see you her every once

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.870 align:middle line:90%
in a while in the flesh.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.090 align:middle line:84%

and people were simply

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.206 align:middle line:90%

you in the audience,

>> NOORY: How about that?

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.250 align:middle line:84%
So have you always been
interested in numbers,

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.782 align:middle line:84%
even when you were
a little girl?

00:01:39.782 --> 00:01:40.990 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: It's interesting.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.590 align:middle line:84%
When I was a little girl, I had
a dream about numbers, George,

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.200 align:middle line:90%
for real.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.590 align:middle line:84%
They were ghosts when I
was learning the ABCs,

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.360 align:middle line:84%
and they were chasing
me in the house.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And yes, I literally
ran upstairs,

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.690 align:middle line:84%
the ABCs are chasing
me, they're chasing me.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And my dad's like,
what are you talking--

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.950 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Like the alphabet--

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:54.290 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: --about?

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.970 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: --soup thing.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:55.803 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: Exactly.

00:01:55.803 --> 00:01:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And ABC became 1, 2,
3 through the door.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.690 align:middle line:90%
I remember that.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.900 align:middle line:84%
Now I didn't know I'd
be a numerologist later.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.380 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know how
significant numbers would be.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.360 align:middle line:84%
But to me, that
was the beginning.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.290 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Numbers.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.104 align:middle line:84%
You have talked with us
about how they started.

00:02:10.104 --> 00:02:12.750 align:middle line:84%
It goes all the way back
almost to the beginning

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.750 align:middle line:90%
of mankind, Pythagorism.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:14.930 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: That's right.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:15.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.320 align:middle line:84%
Pythagoras was the
creator of the system.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.234 align:middle line:84%
Most of you know him
through geometry.

00:02:19.234 --> 00:02:20.650 align:middle line:84%
Clap if you know
Pythagoras' name.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:21.910 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE APPLAUDING]

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.071 align:middle line:90%
Whether you succeeded or failed.

00:02:25.071 --> 00:02:27.070 align:middle line:84%
The funny thing is I
didn't do well in geometry,

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.830 align:middle line:90%
but we know his name from that.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.420 align:middle line:84%
But he was also
known for harmonics.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And what he did was
deal with music,

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.310 align:middle line:84%
and he helped us
understand that you

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.140 align:middle line:84%
could be with certain
chords that sounded lousy.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.970 align:middle line:84%
You know when you hear
bad music, George?

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:40.340 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.340 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: Chances are
those are toxic numbers.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.200 align:middle line:84%
But then certain
numbers come together,

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.650 align:middle line:90%
and it sounds beautiful.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's the
same as human beings.

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.030 align:middle line:90%
So this does go back.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.850 align:middle line:84%
He was a philosopher, he was a
theorist, and he had followers.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting,
nothing he said

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.670 align:middle line:90%
was written down by him.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.450 align:middle line:84%
It was his followers
who wrote about it.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.760 align:middle line:90%
But that's what's exciting.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.200 align:middle line:90%
This goes back 2,500 years.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.662 align:middle line:84%
And it's very lovely,
because it's specific.

00:03:04.662 --> 00:03:05.850 align:middle line:90%
You can see it.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.604 align:middle line:90%
It is not hocus pocus.

00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:09.270 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: When we get
into the numbers--

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.769 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to show you some
of these numbers and have you

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:14.760 align:middle line:84%
explain what they mean and
then talk about our life path

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.170 align:middle line:84%
numbers and the
force and all that--

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.740 align:middle line:84%
but are they the
same for everybody?

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.370 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody is
born on a certain day

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.660 align:middle line:84%
and the other person is
born on the same day,

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.529 align:middle line:84%
are they generally the
same kind of people?

00:03:28.529 --> 00:03:30.820 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: Well, here's
another thing Pythagoras said.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.600 align:middle line:84%
He attached traits
to each number.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.980 align:middle line:90%
He called them characteristics.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.760 align:middle line:84%
But he said there are strengths
and weaknesses, meaning

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.519 align:middle line:84%
you can live in a positive
side of it or negative.

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:41.060 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.170 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: So you could meet
someone born the same day,

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.330 align:middle line:84%
and they're embracing the
positive or negative side

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.280 align:middle line:84%
of the energy, so they
feel differently to you.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.030 align:middle line:84%
But if they meet each
other, it's instant.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.821 align:middle line:84%
When someone's born on
the same day as you,

00:03:51.821 --> 00:03:53.160 align:middle line:90%
you have instant something's up.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.690 align:middle line:90%
Who are you?

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:54.480 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.532 align:middle line:90%
And that's vibration.

00:03:55.532 --> 00:03:57.990 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Glynis has talked
about in the past of people who

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.787 align:middle line:90%
have had surgeries.

00:03:58.787 --> 00:03:59.620 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: Oh, yes.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.330 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: She has talked
them out of specific dates.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.860 align:middle line:84%
When people get married, she's
recommended certain dates

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:06.830 align:middle line:90%
for people.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And you're pretty darn stringent
about those dates with people.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.180 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: I am adamant.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a
thing called dates

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.950 align:middle line:84%
that have duality
in them, and that

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.810 align:middle line:84%
means the date's not going
to feel quite right you.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.540 align:middle line:84%
I happen to know
you're a 7 life path.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.720 align:middle line:84%
There are certain dates
that are great for you.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.425 align:middle line:90%
When you burned your mouth--

00:04:25.425 --> 00:04:26.500 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Ugh.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.374 align:middle line:90%
Ouch.

00:04:27.374 --> 00:04:29.790 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: --that bad story,
that was a toxic date to you

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:30.373 align:middle line:90%
in numerology.

00:04:30.373 --> 00:04:32.555 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Why
didn't you call me?

00:04:32.555 --> 00:04:34.930 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: And you know what
the message is, by the way?

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.250 align:middle line:84%
When you know that,
knowledge is power.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.624 align:middle line:84%
It's just enough to go I'm
going to proceed with caution.

00:04:38.624 --> 00:04:40.620 align:middle line:84%
But since you said you
ate something and burned

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.364 align:middle line:84%
your mouth, how would
you know that that

00:04:42.364 --> 00:04:43.280 align:middle line:90%
was going to hurt you?

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.310 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Let me
mention the story.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.660 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: Yes, please.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.480 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And then you can tell
me how the numbers affected

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.080 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.170 align:middle line:84%
Normally when I get
off Coast to Coast,

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.860 align:middle line:84%
it's in the very wee
hours of the morning,

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.220 align:middle line:90%
and I don't eat a lot.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.900 align:middle line:84%
So I'm constantly
watching what I'm doing.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.580 align:middle line:84%
I wanted a whole wheat
sandwich with turkey on it.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And so I went by our
convenience store

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.330 align:middle line:84%
at 2:30, 3 o'clock in
the morning Pacific time,

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:07.800 align:middle line:90%
and they were all out.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.190 align:middle line:90%
I was frustrated.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.250 align:middle line:84%
So I'm saying, my
gosh, I'm starving.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.150 align:middle line:90%
What am I going to eat?

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:18.340 align:middle line:84%
I see a package of frozen pizza
rolls, these little tiny ones.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.150 align:middle line:90%
And so I take it home.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.350 align:middle line:90%
I read the instructions.

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:22.450 align:middle line:90%
It said microwave it.

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.540 align:middle line:90%
It says make sure it's cool.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.000 align:middle line:90%
I took it out of the microwave.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.130 align:middle line:84%
I touched it, it was cool, and
I popped the thing in my mouth.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.940 align:middle line:84%
I bit into this, Glynis, and
it was like eating molten lava.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.023 align:middle line:90%
It was unbelievable.

00:05:36.023 --> 00:05:37.500 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: That
is so upsetting.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.490 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I didn't
swallow the thing.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:40.155 align:middle line:90%
It was so--

00:05:40.155 --> 00:05:40.540 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: Thank goodness.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:41.600 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: --hot.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.740 align:middle line:90%
I just went blech.

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor in emergency
said had I swallowed it,

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.193 align:middle line:84%
he would have been
operating on me.

00:05:50.193 --> 00:05:52.693 align:middle line:84%
My radio career would have been
[HIGH-PITCHED VOICE] welcome

00:05:52.693 --> 00:05:53.992 align:middle line:90%
to Coast to Coast.

00:05:53.992 --> 00:05:55.200 align:middle line:90%
It would have been like that.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.783 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: It would
have been tragic.

00:05:56.783 --> 00:06:00.340 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So the skin fell off
the roof of my mouth within

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.175 align:middle line:90%
a couple hours.

00:06:01.175 --> 00:06:01.460 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: Yeah.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:02.668 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I couldn't swallow.

00:06:02.668 --> 00:06:04.300 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't sleep
all night because I

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.675 align:middle line:84%
thought I was
going to suffocate.

00:06:05.675 --> 00:06:07.470 align:middle line:84%
It was one of the
worst feelings.

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.080 align:middle line:84%
But are you saying
that had I popped

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.755 align:middle line:84%
that in my mouth
on a different day,

00:06:11.755 --> 00:06:13.649 align:middle line:90%
it would have worked for me?

00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: You would have
just been cautious, you see?

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.140 align:middle line:84%
Now let me tell you,
there's something

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.556 align:middle line:84%
very powerful in
what he's saying.

00:06:18.556 --> 00:06:20.000 align:middle line:90%
Because what month was that?

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.310 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That was November 27.

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.566 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: So you're just about
to get out of the year 2012,

00:06:26.566 --> 00:06:28.480 align:middle line:90%
because we had one month to go.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.520 align:middle line:84%
Now 2012, when you break
down-- because that's

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.630 align:middle line:84%
a world number, George-- 2
plus 0 plus 1 plus 2 is 5.

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.050 align:middle line:84%
5 promotes drama and
unnecessary chaos.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.470 align:middle line:84%
So I said the closer we
got to the end of it,

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:40.680 align:middle line:90%
the worse it would be.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.450 align:middle line:84%
For you, a radio
broadcaster, to be

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.672 align:middle line:84%
in jeopardy of
losing your voice,

00:06:45.672 --> 00:06:47.130 align:middle line:84%
like had you
swallowed it you would

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:48.270 align:middle line:84%
have had some
irreparable damage.

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:49.130 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Would have been done.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:50.430 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: But you stopped it.

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:52.870 align:middle line:84%
So my point is, yes,
that does matter.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.472 align:middle line:84%
If I were George
Noory at that time,

00:06:54.472 --> 00:06:56.680 align:middle line:84%
I would've thought, OK,
wait, today is a caution day.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.220 align:middle line:84%
I really haven't
had that before.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.409 align:middle line:90%
What do I know, number one.

00:06:59.409 --> 00:07:00.950 align:middle line:84%
And maybe I would
have just proceeded

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:02.380 align:middle line:84%
with caution more
that whole day.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:02.921 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:07:02.921 --> 00:07:05.210 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: And also as
we headed in December.

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:07.190 align:middle line:84%
Look at the things that
happened last year.

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:08.790 align:middle line:84%
Because I think it's important
when you look at a new year,

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:10.140 align:middle line:84%
you better look at
what just happened.

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:10.764 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:07:10.764 --> 00:07:12.970 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: Well, last year
you go back to January,

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:15.437 align:middle line:84%
remember when the
cruise ship capsized?

00:07:15.437 --> 00:07:16.020 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yes.

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.090 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: Because the
captain thought, ooh,

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:17.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get
closer to shore.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What a
disaster that was.

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.220 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: And then he gets
off the cruise ship while other

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:22.780 align:middle line:84%
people still aren't
off the boat?

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.070 align:middle line:90%
That was just disgusting.

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:26.710 align:middle line:84%
But it happened in the
drama year of five.

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:29.264 align:middle line:84%
Then in February, we
lost Whitney Houston.

00:07:29.264 --> 00:07:30.555 align:middle line:90%
That was shocking to everybody.

00:07:30.555 --> 00:07:31.320 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sad story.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.470 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: Then we kept
having these sex scandals.

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.910 align:middle line:84%
Now remember, the dark
side of 5 is escaping,

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:38.040 align:middle line:84%
drugs, alcohol,
sex, rock and roll.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.480 align:middle line:90%
We saw all of that last year.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.410 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Not with me.

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:42.790 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: You were reporting.

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:44.514 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's what
keeps you safe.

00:07:44.514 --> 00:07:45.180 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:45.680 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:46.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm too busy working--

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:46.781 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: Yeah.

00:07:46.781 --> 00:07:48.320 align:middle line:84%
You read their scandal, you're
like, I'm not going to do that.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.570 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: --and eating
frozen pizza rolls.

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.280 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: But the thing is
you're not going to let this

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:52.863 align:middle line:90%
happen to you.

00:07:52.863 --> 00:07:53.620 align:middle line:90%
But we did see it.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.600 align:middle line:84%
We saw the Secret
Service get in trouble.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.590 align:middle line:90%
Then we saw Benghazi.

00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:00.550 align:middle line:84%
9/11 comes along, our
ambassador gets killed.

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:02.450 align:middle line:84%
This is the first
time in 30 years

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:04.200 align:middle line:90%
an ambassador has been killed.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.860 align:middle line:90%
But what do we focus on?

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.680 align:middle line:90%
Patraeus and his sex scandal.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.180 align:middle line:84%
So instead of getting to the
bottom of what really happened,

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.190 align:middle line:84%
we're still stuck
in the sex scandal.

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.620 align:middle line:84%
That, to me, was what the
year of five was about.

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.020 align:middle line:84%
It made us look at things we
didn't necessarily want to.

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:18.020 align:middle line:90%
We didn't have a choice.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.780 align:middle line:84%
Here's another example,
Hurricane Sandy.

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.210 align:middle line:84%
Hurricane Sandy was
devastating, but so was

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:28.490 align:middle line:84%
the elementary shooting,
Sandy Hook Elementary School.

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:31.031 align:middle line:84%
Of course I had to look
at the name Sandy, George.

00:08:31.031 --> 00:08:32.530 align:middle line:84%
Because you're like,
OK, people kept

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:33.990 align:middle line:84%
writing me, Glynis, what
about the name Sandy?

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:34.559 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean?

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It was weird.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:35.980 align:middle line:90%
The whole thing was weird.

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:37.271 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: It was devastating.

00:08:37.271 --> 00:08:37.919 align:middle line:90%
But guess what?

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:39.500 align:middle line:84%
When you break down
its numerology--

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.150 align:middle line:84%
because each letter
has a number.

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:42.740 align:middle line:84%
That's the Pythagoras
number system

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.660 align:middle line:90%
as well-- it was the number 9.

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:47.224 align:middle line:84%
And the 9 is the humanitarian
and selflessness.

00:08:47.224 --> 00:08:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And if you think
about it, George,

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.200 align:middle line:84%
when Hurricane Sandy
happened and those shootings,

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.120 align:middle line:90%
didn't we all step up to help?

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.150 align:middle line:90%
Who was not affected?

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:55.605 align:middle line:84%
You do not have to live
in their neighborhood.

00:08:55.605 --> 00:08:56.160 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.230 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: You're
like, where do I go?

00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:58.150 align:middle line:90%
Who I give money to?

00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:59.441 align:middle line:90%
Should I fly out and help them?

00:08:59.441 --> 00:09:00.320 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Like 9/11.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:00.740 align:middle line:90%
Same thing.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:01.310 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: Yes.

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:01.870 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:02.550 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:04.690 align:middle line:90%
So my point is I like that.

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:07.190 align:middle line:84%
I like knowing that there's
a message in energy.

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:09.214 align:middle line:84%
And even the date
that that happened,

00:09:09.214 --> 00:09:10.880 align:middle line:84%
that shooting, people
were like, Glynis,

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.630 align:middle line:90%
could we have foreseen that?

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:14.624 align:middle line:90%
Well, here's how that works.

00:09:14.624 --> 00:09:17.040 align:middle line:84%
When I talk about the calendar
that you were talking about

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.110 align:middle line:84%
and I say that was
a sunny day for you,

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:22.110 align:middle line:84%
sunny day is a symbol I
use when it's a good day.

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:24.520 align:middle line:84%
Sun with a cloud means
it could be good for you.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:25.880 align:middle line:90%
Don't count on someone else.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Caution means you don't take
something out of the microwave

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:32.830 align:middle line:84%
and eat it that you've never had
before at 2:30 in the morning.

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:34.330 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But it
said cool to touch.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:35.540 align:middle line:90%
It was cool to touch.

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: But my point
is that's a caution day.

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:40.630 align:middle line:84%
Those symbols, that particular
day that that happened,

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:43.145 align:middle line:84%
it was not a sunny day
symbol for any life path

00:09:43.145 --> 00:09:43.770 align:middle line:90%
number, George.

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:44.400 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Aha.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.390 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: Now
think about that.

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And once we heard
about the shooting, who

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.380 align:middle line:90%
was not depressed?

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.500 align:middle line:90%
These were little children.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.360 align:middle line:84%
When an adult gets
shot, even though it's

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.440 align:middle line:84%
bad news you kind of go, well, I
don't know what happened there.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.580 align:middle line:90%
But with little kids--

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:56.120 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Devastating.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:56.930 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: --they're
just innocent,

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:58.120 align:middle line:90%
and right before Christmas.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.855 align:middle line:90%
So that was the year five.

00:09:59.855 --> 00:10:00.980 align:middle line:90%
Luckily, we're out of that.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.396 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, we're going
to get into some of the things

00:10:03.396 --> 00:10:07.460 align:middle line:84%
that are going to be facing
us in 2013 and the years ahead

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:08.110 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to talk with you
about some of these numbers.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:14.900 align:middle line:84%
For people at home at
any time, is there a way

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:17.670 align:middle line:84%
that they can say I want
to see what my day's going

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:19.520 align:middle line:90%
to be like before it starts--

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:19.830 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: Absolutely.

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:20.913 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: --by the number?

00:10:20.913 --> 00:10:21.660 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: Yes.

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:22.710 align:middle line:90%
I'll say it again.

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:25.320 align:middle line:84%
If you learn the basic numbers--
and certainly I've written

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.490 align:middle line:84%
"Glynis has Your Number,"
"Love by the Numbers"--

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:30.970 align:middle line:84%
I have a numerology calendar
that every single day has

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:34.321 align:middle line:84%
a symbol next to your life path
to tell you what kind of day it

00:10:34.321 --> 00:10:34.820 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:35.940 align:middle line:90%
So they could learn that.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And if they were to
study numerology,

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:40.190 align:middle line:84%
they could start
knowing, oh, this day

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:42.360 align:middle line:84%
has conflict in it for
me, or this is a great day

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.404 align:middle line:90%
to make a move.

00:10:43.404 --> 00:10:44.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'll give you
another example.

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.000 align:middle line:84%
Last year when Barack
Obama won, remember

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.664 align:middle line:90%
how tight that election was?

00:10:48.664 --> 00:10:49.330 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.520 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Top pundits
couldn't call that election,

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.370 align:middle line:84%
right up to the second we
finally heard it was Obama.

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:55.650 align:middle line:90%
I could see that in numbers.

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:57.810 align:middle line:84%
What I saw was the
month of October

00:10:57.810 --> 00:10:59.540 align:middle line:90%
was excellent for Romney.

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.910 align:middle line:84%
But the month that mattered,
which was November,

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:04.110 align:middle line:84%
put Barack Obama in a
personal month of 1--

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:04.700 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And he
just zoomed, yeah.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:05.991 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: --which was to win.

00:11:05.991 --> 00:11:08.400 align:middle line:84%
It means doing whatever
you can to win, and he did.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And the actual day
was a sunny day symbol

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:15.670 align:middle line:84%
for Obama but sunny with
this cloud for Romney.

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:18.830 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: If you were advising
the president at the time,

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:21.940 align:middle line:84%
would you have said, this is
going to be a good day for you?

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.440 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: Well, honestly, I
would have advised him when he

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.430 align:middle line:84%
did Colorado, because when he
spoke here it was as if he was

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:28.240 align:middle line:90%
sleeping.

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.380 align:middle line:84%
People talked about what
happened to that guy.

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:31.130 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:33.550 align:middle line:84%
That was a perfect day
in numerology for Romney.

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:34.590 align:middle line:90%
It was the sun symbol.

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:35.590 align:middle line:90%
And I laughed to myself.

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:38.020 align:middle line:84%
I thought the stars have
aligned for Mitt Romney.

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:40.245 align:middle line:84%
He's going to be on fire
tonight, and he was.

00:11:40.245 --> 00:11:41.120 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And he was.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:41.530 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: Everyone
talked about him.

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:43.800 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Let's take some
questions in the audience

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.150 align:middle line:84%
for the Numbers
Lady, Glynis McCants.

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:48.080 align:middle line:90%
Who's got a question for Glynis?

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.270 align:middle line:90%
Come on, don't be shy.

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:51.000 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir, right over here.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah, I'm curious,
if someone's born on a leap

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.810 align:middle line:84%
year does that
affect their numbers?

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:57.260 align:middle line:90%
Does it throw things off?

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:58.960 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: It
absolutely doesn't.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.459 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
you've got to know.

00:12:00.459 --> 00:12:04.230 align:middle line:84%
When you're born, that
day did count that time.

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:05.940 align:middle line:84%
It may not show up
the following year,

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:07.870 align:middle line:84%
but you know that
your numerology

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:10.050 align:middle line:90%
comes from that particular day.

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:12.240 align:middle line:84%
Pythagoras believed
that when we're born,

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.410 align:middle line:84%
we come through with
a certain sound.

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:17.150 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to look at those
numbers, the original numbers,

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:18.500 align:middle line:90%
to get the answer.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:19.480 align:middle line:90%
So it does not matter.

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.480 align:middle line:84%
It's just a bummer that
sometimes it's not there

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.330 align:middle line:90%
for you, right?

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:23.080 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.050 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: But they're
actually lovely numbers.

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:26.530 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Sometimes when people
are born on the leap day,

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:31.900 align:middle line:84%
if they're 32 years
old, are they really 8?

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:33.370 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:35.995 align:middle line:84%
How do you celebrate a birthday
if you're born on a certain day

00:12:35.995 --> 00:12:37.690 align:middle line:90%
and that day is not there?

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:39.080 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: Right.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.280 align:middle line:84%
That's what I think
is so odd about that.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.140 align:middle line:84%
But in truth you're
celebrating the energy.

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:45.224 align:middle line:90%
And what do you do?

00:12:45.224 --> 00:12:46.140 align:middle line:90%
Is that your birthday?

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:46.530 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: No, no.

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:47.380 align:middle line:90%
I was just curious about that.

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:48.980 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: Someone you know,
do you know what they wind up

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:49.240 align:middle line:90%
doing?

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:49.720 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: No.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.000 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: They
probably get very drunk

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.020 align:middle line:90%
because they're so upset.

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:53.520 align:middle line:84%
They're like, they
took my birthday.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.310 align:middle line:84%
My husband always
says, what are they

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:56.851 align:middle line:84%
going to do, take
away your birthday?

00:12:56.851 --> 00:12:58.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, well, I guess
for those people--

00:12:58.850 --> 00:12:58.940 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:00.610 align:middle line:84%
Speaking of your
husband, Charlie,

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:04.390 align:middle line:84%
you've got to tell us really
quickly this incredible story

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:05.300 align:middle line:90%
how you met him.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:05.966 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: Yes.

00:13:05.966 --> 00:13:08.430 align:middle line:84%
What happened was I kept
giving you guys advice

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:09.862 align:middle line:84%
and helping you
find your partner.

00:13:09.862 --> 00:13:11.070 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, wait a second.

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:12.700 align:middle line:90%
What about me?

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.210 align:middle line:90%
So I finally did a dating site.

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And I said, numerologist
looking for a man who's

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:18.320 align:middle line:90%
really got my number.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:21.885 align:middle line:84%
Some men applied, and then
wonderful Charles St. Denny

00:13:21.885 --> 00:13:23.510 align:middle line:84%
Youngblood-- how do
you beat that name?

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:24.670 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Had the right numbers.

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:25.450 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: Isn't
that beautiful?

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:26.533 align:middle line:90%
Shows up with the numbers.

00:13:26.533 --> 00:13:27.280 align:middle line:90%
I run the chart.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.946 align:middle line:84%
And what's cute, George, when we
were dating-- because you can't

00:13:29.946 --> 00:13:31.380 align:middle line:84%
let a man know
that he's the one.

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:35.157 align:middle line:84%
That scares a man-- I wrote
my husband in his pictures.

00:13:35.157 --> 00:13:37.240 align:middle line:84%
So we went on a date once,
and he saw my computer.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And I had to hide that, because
I didn't want to scare the guy.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.942 align:middle line:84%
But we've been
together 10 years now.

00:13:41.942 --> 00:13:43.066 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's fantastic.

00:13:43.066 --> 00:13:44.960 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: And
anybody who knows us--

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.630 align:middle line:90%
now we are best friends.

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:48.432 align:middle line:90%
We have amazing chemistry.

00:13:48.432 --> 00:13:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And you've known
it the whole time,

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:52.330 align:middle line:84%
because you kind of were there
when I was doing the dating.

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:53.295 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I watched that
whole metamorphosis.

00:13:53.295 --> 00:13:54.360 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: And as
a matter of fact,

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.445 align:middle line:84%
you were there right
before I got married.

00:13:56.445 --> 00:13:58.028 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because I got
married New Years.

00:13:58.028 --> 00:14:00.247 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I actually gave
Charlie the numbers to fill

00:14:00.247 --> 00:14:01.740 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.710 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: You're
like, check it out.

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:04.730 align:middle line:90%
See what's there.

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:06.622 align:middle line:84%
But the point is
it's a true story,

00:14:06.622 --> 00:14:09.080 align:middle line:84%
and that's what inspired me to
write "Love By the Numbers."

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.310 align:middle line:84%
And I've had now,
George, over 2,000 people

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:12.860 align:middle line:90%
get married from my book.

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:13.315 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Isn't that fantastic?

00:14:13.315 --> 00:14:14.398 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: It's exciting.

00:14:14.398 --> 00:14:17.130 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And I bet the
incidence of survival

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:19.495 align:middle line:84%
in a marriage is higher
with your numbers--

00:14:19.495 --> 00:14:20.200 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: Yes.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.705 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: --than if they
had just met someplace.

00:14:21.705 --> 00:14:22.390 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: Well, you know why?

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:23.810 align:middle line:84%
Because they end up
writing me saying,

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:25.851 align:middle line:84%
Glynis-- now they don't
even talk about the name.

00:14:25.851 --> 00:14:28.540 align:middle line:84%
They're like, my husband the
4 upset my daughter the 5

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.420 align:middle line:90%
and really pissed me off, the 6.

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And I just laugh because
I get what they mean.

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:34.440 align:middle line:84%
But that's the
language you end up

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.390 align:middle line:90%
speaking when you read my book.

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:38.407 align:middle line:90%
I did simplify it.

00:14:38.407 --> 00:14:40.365 align:middle line:84%
There are numerologists
out there who are like,

00:14:40.365 --> 00:14:41.470 align:middle line:90%
she keeps it so simple.

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:42.870 align:middle line:90%
That was deliberate.

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:45.550 align:middle line:84%
I did it because I wanted
us to apply it to our life.

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:48.282 align:middle line:84%
And you're right, it
has saved marriages.

00:14:48.282 --> 00:14:50.490 align:middle line:84%
There's a chapter called
"Should You Take His Name?".

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:53.352 align:middle line:84%
I've had married women--
because when you get divorced,

00:14:53.352 --> 00:14:54.810 align:middle line:84%
they say, well,
when I married her,

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:57.040 align:middle line:84%
she totally changed--
they take the name back

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.100 align:middle line:84%
to the maiden name and
improve their marriage.

00:14:59.100 --> 00:14:59.510 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:14:59.510 --> 00:14:59.830 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: See?

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:00.720 align:middle line:90%
It's all vibration.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.000 align:middle line:90%
It's all chemistry.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:02.720 align:middle line:90%
So you bet.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:03.290 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's a good point.

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:04.873 align:middle line:84%
And "Love By the
Numbers," by the way,

00:15:04.873 --> 00:15:06.960 align:middle line:84%
you walk around with
it as a single guy,

But I'd like to ask a question.

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:24.940 align:middle line:84%
You talked about people
born on the same day that

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:27.670 align:middle line:90%
have same vibrations.

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:29.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm sitting here
with my twin brother,

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.044 align:middle line:84%
and I was just wondering--
because a lot of things

00:15:32.044 --> 00:15:33.960 align:middle line:84%
that we've had happened
in life, we've kind of

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.390 align:middle line:84%
had some of the
same, but we also

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:36.681 align:middle line:90%
have a lot of different things.

00:15:36.681 --> 00:15:38.846 align:middle line:90%

How did you pick your position?

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:53.560 align:middle line:84%
Remember, when you're
twins, even though there's

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:56.374 align:middle line:84%
that special bond, you
want your individualism.

And let me tell you
where that comes in.

00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.960 align:middle line:90%
The name has three numbers.

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.190 align:middle line:84%
So your name, that's three
different vibrations.

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:03.810 align:middle line:90%
That's what makes you different.

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:06.640 align:middle line:84%
But your actual birth numbers
being exactly the same,

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:08.370 align:middle line:90%
that means connected forever.

You could have been born years
later but still the same day,

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:14.230 align:middle line:90%
and that would matter.

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:16.070 align:middle line:90%

when you do Coast to Coast

in the snuggle of
your house, you've

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.080 align:middle line:84%

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:49.690 align:middle line:84%
First of all, you
are very sensitive.

You've got that 2.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.900 align:middle line:84%

how strong you are,

>> MCCANTS: OK.

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:26.450 align:middle line:90%
So you got June 4.

00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:29.580 align:middle line:84%
And how I do this is there are
three numbers in a birthdate.

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:32.369 align:middle line:84%
You take your month and date
to get your attitude number.

00:19:32.369 --> 00:19:32.910 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:36.700 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: So in your case,
6 plus 4 is 10, 1 plus 0 is 1.

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:39.750 align:middle line:84%
That means you strive to
be number one, George.

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:41.170 align:middle line:90%
Nobody has to make you.

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:41.430 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's like this.

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:42.180 align:middle line:90%
That's a 1.

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:42.500 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: That's George.

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:42.915 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: There I am.

00:19:42.915 --> 00:19:43.330 align:middle line:90%

00:19:44.413 --> 00:19:45.880 align:middle line:84%
And no one has to
do that for you.

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:46.630 align:middle line:90%
You push yourself.

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:46.930 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I do.

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:48.640 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: You're
like, what's next?

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.730 align:middle line:90%
It's a multitasking energy.

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's I just want to make
sure we're getting it done.

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And if something
is not finished,

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.500 align:middle line:84%
you're not
comfortable with that.

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.260 align:middle line:90%
So that's your attitude number.

00:19:58.260 --> 00:19:59.770 align:middle line:90%
You were born on a 4 day.

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:02.130 align:middle line:90%
The 4 means seeking knowledge.

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:04.370 align:middle line:84%
The more you learn,
the happier you are.

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:07.330 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I just want to
learn whatever's out there.

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:10.010 align:middle line:84%
Aha moments is what
makes you live.

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:11.910 align:middle line:84%

will keep you young.

always been that way?

Inquisitive, even as a kid.

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:16.840 align:middle line:84%
I would say when you
were a little kid you

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.360 align:middle line:84%
had to be the kid who
said, well, what's that?

What's that?

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:19.500 align:middle line:90%
What's that?

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:20.930 align:middle line:84%
One of those little
toddlers who walked

00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:22.520 align:middle line:84%
around wanting to know
what everything is.

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:24.770 align:middle line:84%
I will bet your family would
have said that were true.

If I see a burned out light
bulb somewhere at a restaurant

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:34.416 align:middle line:84%
or something, I'll call
the manager over and go,

Now let me tell you
this is the big numbers.

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:54.554 align:middle line:84%
You take your
birthday, 6/4/1950,

across and reduce it

>> MCCANTS: True.

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:25.925 align:middle line:84%
But here's what's
fun about the 7.

00:21:25.925 --> 00:21:28.677 align:middle line:84%
7's have to find their
spiritual base to believe in.

It's not uncommon for them
to feel burned by religion

00:21:30.885 --> 00:21:33.020 align:middle line:84%
and go, OK, I don't
want organized religion,

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:34.750 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to
find some answer.

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:37.737 align:middle line:84%
But every time you get
something that feels like truth,

00:21:37.737 --> 00:21:39.320 align:middle line:84%
you want to hang out
with that person.

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:40.880 align:middle line:90%
That's when your ears are open.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:41.380 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:44.092 align:middle line:84%
But otherwise, you mentally
leave the building George.

00:21:44.092 --> 00:21:45.050 align:middle line:90%

You're like, whoo, see ya.

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:47.847 align:middle line:90%

But they don't know.

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:49.870 align:middle line:84%

My biggest nightmare on the

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:55.750 align:middle line:84%
is if somebody says,
sadly four people

died in this plane crash.

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not listening
to them and you go,

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:01.240 align:middle line:84%
so how many people died
in the plane crash?

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:08.100 align:middle line:84%
But the number 7 also has
a love of nature's beauty,

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:10.330 align:middle line:84%
the ocean, mountains,
plants, flowers.

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:12.480 align:middle line:84%
All of nature's beauty
speaks to your soul.

And the water-- again, if you
get to tropical places that

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:18.830 align:middle line:84%
can calm you down,
help you get relaxed.

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:40.600 align:middle line:84%
It's available for
you to play with.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.060 align:middle line:84%
This stuff is the
basics of numerology,

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:44.340 align:middle line:90%
but it's so much fun.

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:46.167 align:middle line:84%
Because once you know
everyone's number,

00:23:46.167 --> 00:23:48.000 align:middle line:84%
you have more of a sense
of them right away.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:48.910 align:middle line:90%
It's like, ooh, 1--

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:49.520 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Now here's
the question, Glynis.

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:50.769 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: --ooh, you're a 2.

00:23:50.769 --> 00:23:52.670 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: How does it work?

00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:55.570 align:middle line:84%
How does a number
determine your life path

00:23:55.570 --> 00:23:57.230 align:middle line:90%
and what you do in your life?

00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: Well, again,
this goes back to Pythagoras

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:03.930 align:middle line:84%
himself, because he talked
about the mystique of numbers,

00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:04.860 align:middle line:90%
numbers in general.

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:07.290 align:middle line:84%
He's the one who decided
there is something to this.

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:10.060 align:middle line:84%
When they talk about the
universe and communication,

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:11.401 align:middle line:90%
it's always mathematics.

00:24:11.401 --> 00:24:13.900 align:middle line:84%
When they break it down, it's
always something mathematical.

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:16.300 align:middle line:84%
So to say, why
does it work, to me

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:17.910 align:middle line:84%
that's like when
someone says, well,

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:19.210 align:middle line:90%
how do you know there's a God?

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, I've had
miracles that came true,

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:22.980 align:middle line:90%
so I could testify.

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:26.054 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you spend your
life's work, as what I do,

00:24:26.054 --> 00:24:28.220 align:middle line:84%
running numbers all the
time, and it's always right,

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:29.500 align:middle line:90%
that's all I need to know.

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:32.490 align:middle line:84%
So I don't always have to go
why does it work as much as what

00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:34.180 align:middle line:90%
a blessing that it does work.

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:35.590 align:middle line:90%
Because here's the thing.

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:38.046 align:middle line:84%
We have a deal called
numerology blueprint.

00:24:38.046 --> 00:24:38.920 align:middle line:90%
You have one, George.

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:39.450 align:middle line:90%
I have one.

00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:40.770 align:middle line:90%
Everyone in the audience does.

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:43.110 align:middle line:84%
There are three numbers
that are your name,

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:44.420 align:middle line:90%
three numbers in your birthday.

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:46.530 align:middle line:84%
Those six numbers
tell us who you are.

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:47.060 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They
are what they are.

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:47.930 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: They
are what they are.

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:49.846 align:middle line:84%
And if you can understand
someone's blueprint,

00:24:49.846 --> 00:24:52.430 align:middle line:84%
even if they're not like
you, your understanding

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:53.500 align:middle line:90%
can make you friends.

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:54.890 align:middle line:90%
You can do better in business.

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:56.920 align:middle line:90%
Everything's better.

00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:59.432 align:middle line:84%
It's a type of knowledge
that is so powerful

00:24:59.432 --> 00:25:01.390 align:middle line:84%
to help you understand
the people in your life.

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:03.360 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How does it
compare to astrology?

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.500 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: Well, astrology
is also wonderful.

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:08.902 align:middle line:84%
But I find this cuts to
the chase more quickly.

00:25:08.902 --> 00:25:10.860 align:middle line:84%
Because if I say to you,
hey, what's your name?

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:11.710 align:middle line:90%
What's your birthday?

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:13.160 align:middle line:84%
I didn't say to you,
where were you born?

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:14.266 align:middle line:90%
What time were you born?

00:25:14.266 --> 00:25:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And so many people
don't know what time

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:16.730 align:middle line:90%
they were born, by the way.

00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:17.860 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: No, they don't.

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:20.270 align:middle line:84%
I had to look on my birth
certificate to find out.

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:22.555 align:middle line:84%
I was born at 10:00-ish
in the morning.

00:25:22.555 --> 00:25:23.640 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.982 align:middle line:84%
I was born in my parents'
house, by the way.

00:25:25.982 --> 00:25:27.690 align:middle line:84%
Because my mother had
11 kids and decided

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:28.420 align:middle line:90%
to have me at lunch.

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And she literally had
me at a lunch break.

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:31.782 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: She was a
work-at-home person, right?

00:25:31.782 --> 00:25:33.790 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: She said, you've
got an hour to deliver.

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:34.890 align:middle line:90%
She just popped me out.

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:35.860 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:38.890 align:middle line:84%
But going to this astrologer,
do you know what he said to me?

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:41.077 align:middle line:84%
His name is Chakrapani,
famous astrologer.

00:25:41.077 --> 00:25:42.660 align:middle line:84%
The minute he met
me, he goes, there's

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:43.950 align:middle line:84%
no way you were born
when you were born.

00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:45.033 align:middle line:90%
I go, what are you saying?

00:25:45.033 --> 00:25:46.819 align:middle line:84%
He goes, you're
not these numbers.

00:25:46.819 --> 00:25:47.610 align:middle line:90%
Forget the numbers.

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:49.279 align:middle line:90%
You are not what I see here.

00:25:49.279 --> 00:25:50.570 align:middle line:90%
This is not what I would think.

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:52.060 align:middle line:84%
Now how interesting
is that, George?

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:52.350 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:54.475 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: So what I like
about numerology, again,

00:25:54.475 --> 00:25:57.070 align:middle line:84%
all you need-- birth
certificate name is important,

00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:58.630 align:middle line:84%
because it gives
you your destiny.

00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:01.720 align:middle line:84%
But the name you go by
right now is the vibration

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:03.040 align:middle line:90%
you put out right now.

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:03.350 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:04.250 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: That's
why it's important.

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:06.980 align:middle line:84%
Like George Noory, what is
your birth certificate name?

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:08.705 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: George Ralph Noory.

00:26:08.705 --> 00:26:09.330 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: OK.

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:09.913 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Shh.

00:26:09.913 --> 00:26:10.850 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:12.420 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: Ah, but
you know what's funny?

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:14.253 align:middle line:84%
It's either the name
you go by or that name,

00:26:14.253 --> 00:26:18.410 align:middle line:84%
but you have the power
numbers 1, 8, 9 in there.

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:21.010 align:middle line:84%
Think of numerology as an
onion with lots of layers.

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:22.430 align:middle line:90%
It's fun to know the layer.

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:23.510 align:middle line:90%
Keep peeling.

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:24.260 align:middle line:90%
Keep peeling.

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:28.820 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Glynis, before I tell
everyone the story about this

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:34.996 align:middle line:84%
8, you need to tell us why the
8 is important and what it does.

00:26:34.996 --> 00:26:37.120 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: When you look
at the basics of numbers,

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.890 align:middle line:84%
each number has
a simple message.

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:41.170 align:middle line:84%
The number 8
represents financial.

00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:42.710 align:middle line:90%
It's like financial security.

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:44.730 align:middle line:90%
It's the number for prosperity.

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:46.900 align:middle line:84%
So a good example of
that is the Chinese

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:49.410 align:middle line:90%
are obsessed with the number 8.

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:51.860 align:middle line:84%
They'll pick addresses--
I'm in Pasadena.

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:53.290 align:middle line:90%
There's one called 888.

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:54.659 align:middle line:90%
That's the address they bought.

00:26:54.659 --> 00:26:56.450 align:middle line:84%
They're are always
looking for that number.

00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's not uncommon,
for people who know this,

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:02.040 align:middle line:84%
to have an 8 above their
cash register at a restaurant

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:04.000 align:middle line:90%
to encourage prosperity.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.910 align:middle line:90%
So it's a symbol of money.

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And you and I had
that discussion.

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about
the possibility

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:12.520 align:middle line:84%
of putting that 8 in your
wallet to encourage income.

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:13.650 align:middle line:90%
And then what happened?

00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:14.640 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.680 align:middle line:90%
Boom, things happened.

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:17.590 align:middle line:90%
Well, you know what?

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:20.590 align:middle line:84%
I had someone who did
exactly what Glynis had said,

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:23.700 align:middle line:84%
and that's put the
8 in his wallet.

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:25.814 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it
has ramifications.

00:27:25.814 --> 00:27:27.980 align:middle line:84%
This isn't the story I want
to tell you in a second,

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:29.860 align:middle line:90%
but this one was fascinating.

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:35.860 align:middle line:84%
He said, George, I
got $200,000 a week

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:38.770 align:middle line:90%
after I put the 8 in my wallet.

00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:40.440 align:middle line:90%
Here's the downside.

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:43.260 align:middle line:84%
He said, I got it
because my dad died.

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:45.600 align:middle line:84%
And so it does have these
up and downs, doesn't it?

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.641 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: And this is
what I would say to that.

00:27:47.641 --> 00:27:50.090 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to do--
that 8 in your wallet's

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:52.140 align:middle line:84%
not going to speed
up dad's death.

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:54.185 align:middle line:84%
It is synchronization
with the universe.

00:27:54.185 --> 00:27:54.680 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:55.900 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: You put
the 8 in your wallet.

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:57.637 align:middle line:84%
You're like, I really
welcome prosperity.

00:27:57.637 --> 00:27:59.470 align:middle line:84%
And you don't know where
it's going to come.

00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:01.350 align:middle line:84%
But I get phone
calls from people--

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:03.640 align:middle line:84%
and I'm talking
every week, George.

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:05.564 align:middle line:84%
Again, the Coast
to Coast crowd is

00:28:05.564 --> 00:28:07.980 align:middle line:84%
obsessed with that number,
because they have fun with it--

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:10.650 align:middle line:84%
but they'll say, put it in
my wallet, I got a raise.

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:11.970 align:middle line:90%
One gal put it in her wallet.

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:14.680 align:middle line:84%
Two days later her manager walks
in, I want to give you a raise.

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:15.120 align:middle line:90%
She was like--

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:15.620 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:16.200 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: --I didn't
even ask for it.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.090 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's amazing
how this works.

00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:18.506 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: But
going back to him,

00:28:18.506 --> 00:28:22.332 align:middle line:84%
it is scary when suddenly
we have a windfall

00:28:22.332 --> 00:28:23.540 align:middle line:90%
and it's someone passed away.

00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:23.860 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yes.

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:25.901 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: But honestly,
that has nothing to do.

00:28:25.901 --> 00:28:27.950 align:middle line:84%
The number 8 itself does
have lessons attached.

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:29.660 align:middle line:90%
You are correct in saying that.

00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:31.452 align:middle line:84%
If you're going after
money just for money,

00:28:31.452 --> 00:28:32.659 align:middle line:90%
you're not going to be happy.

00:28:32.659 --> 00:28:34.060 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Here's
a case in point.

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:37.700 align:middle line:84%
After one of your shows with
me, I went to a local restaurant

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:40.960 align:middle line:84%
in Los Angeles the next day,
which is close by my studio

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:41.720 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And the fellow who was
working there, older guy,

00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:45.320 align:middle line:90%
he's a former actor.

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.920 align:middle line:90%
His name is George.

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:49.960 align:middle line:90%
And he loves going to casinos.

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, George, I
want you to do something.

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.050 align:middle line:90%
Let's do a little experiment.

00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:56.860 align:middle line:84%
I want you to put
an 8 in your wallet.

00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:58.080 align:middle line:90%
And he said, what?

00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And I said, just doodle
an 8 on a napkin,

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:04.140 align:middle line:84%
fold it up, put it in your
wallet, go to the casino.

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:05.110 align:middle line:90%
Let's see what happens.

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:06.270 align:middle line:90%
He said, all right.

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:07.720 align:middle line:90%
I will.

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:09.300 align:middle line:84%
I come back about
three days later.

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:12.700 align:middle line:84%
He's been to one of the
local casinos in California.

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:18.900 align:middle line:84%
He said, George, you won't
believe this, but I won $2,000.

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:21.940 align:middle line:84%
I never win $2,000
on the slot machines.

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:22.940 align:middle line:90%
I won.

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:25.010 align:middle line:90%
I had this 8 in my pocket.

00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:26.270 align:middle line:90%
And I said, great, George.

00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:30.350 align:middle line:84%
Unbeknownst to me, he was
going back the next day

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:32.440 align:middle line:90%
because he wanted more.

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:34.490 align:middle line:90%
It didn't work.

00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:36.400 align:middle line:84%
There's a lesson here
I want you to tell us.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:40.280 align:middle line:84%
Because when I came back that
day, he was all depressed.

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:41.780 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what's wrong?

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:43.700 align:middle line:90%
He said, the 8 doesn't work.

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:45.516 align:middle line:84%
I said, George, of
course it works.

00:29:45.516 --> 00:29:46.640 align:middle line:90%
You just told me it worked.

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:50.400 align:middle line:84%
He says, no, I went back
and lost the $2,000.

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:51.531 align:middle line:90%
What did he do wrong?

00:29:51.531 --> 00:29:53.530 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: Well, the
first thing I want to say,

00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:57.672 align:middle line:84%
and this is so true, what we
believe is what we manifest.

00:29:57.672 --> 00:29:59.880 align:middle line:84%
Remember, he first said,
I've never done that before.

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:01.200 align:middle line:90%
It's never happened.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.557 align:middle line:84%
So his brain went back to
make sure he was right.

00:30:03.557 --> 00:30:04.140 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yep.

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:04.973 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: You see?

00:30:04.973 --> 00:30:06.500 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't believe
the good luck.

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:07.460 align:middle line:90%
It can't be real.

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:09.100 align:middle line:90%
Let's go make sure it wasn't.

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:12.845 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is
some people go 8 crazy.

00:30:12.845 --> 00:30:13.845 align:middle line:90%
They put 8's everywhere.

00:30:13.845 --> 00:30:14.530 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Greed.

00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:15.238 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: Yeah.

00:30:15.238 --> 00:30:15.990 align:middle line:90%
It's total greed.

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:17.580 align:middle line:84%
They become obsessed
with just money.

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And I told you, that will
never be what makes you happy.

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:22.810 align:middle line:84%
I cover that in the
book too about careers.

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:25.880 align:middle line:84%
If you do what you're here to
do, the money will follow you.

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:26.990 align:middle line:90%
It will follow you.

00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And I say that's
because God put you

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:30.510 align:middle line:84%
on a planet that
costs money, so he's

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:32.510 align:middle line:84%
got to have a plan
for you to make some.

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:35.980 align:middle line:84%
But the idea of just winning
money, to me that's so-- that's

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:36.950 align:middle line:90%
not what this is about.

00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:40.000 align:middle line:84%
This is about manifesting, like
going after that career dream

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.560 align:middle line:84%
by the numbers and
doing incredibly well.

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:43.810 align:middle line:90%
That's what I want for people.

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:46.290 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I was going to
take this home with me today.

00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:47.081 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:30:47.081 --> 00:30:48.600 align:middle line:84%
I guess I'll just
keep it right--

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:49.490 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: You can let
it stay on the table.

00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:49.920 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: --there.

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.510 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: I do want to talk
about something real quick

00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:52.790 align:middle line:90%
called personal year cycles.

00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:53.623 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

00:30:53.623 --> 00:30:56.220 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: Because it
happened when 2013 hit.

00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to say quickly
what is happening with 2013.

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:01.740 align:middle line:90%
2 plus 0 plus 1 plus 3 is 6.

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:04.204 align:middle line:90%
6 is about family, George.

00:31:04.204 --> 00:31:05.120 align:middle line:90%
How about your family?

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:08.032 align:middle line:84%
What's happening with
your son and everything?

00:31:08.032 --> 00:31:08.990 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Typical life.

00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:10.060 align:middle line:90%
I've had ups and downs.

00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:11.966 align:middle line:90%
He had his job in Las Vegas.

00:31:11.966 --> 00:31:12.715 align:middle line:90%
He didn't like it.

00:31:12.715 --> 00:31:13.700 align:middle line:90%
He quit.

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:15.140 align:middle line:90%
He moved back to St. Louis.

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:16.830 align:middle line:84%
They're living in
my house there.

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:16.970 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: OK.

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:17.650 align:middle line:90%
Does he have kids?

00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:18.650 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: He's got two kids.

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:19.950 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: Because
that's what this is about.

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:21.030 align:middle line:84%
It's about looking
at your family,

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:22.690 align:middle line:84%
getting back to your children,
getting back to the basics.

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:24.150 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But he just got
rehired again, and he's happy.

00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:24.645 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: Good.

00:31:24.645 --> 00:31:25.910 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Things are going well.

00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:26.585 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: And listen to this.

00:31:26.585 --> 00:31:28.160 align:middle line:84%
The year of 5, for
those people who

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:31.040 align:middle line:84%
struggled or felt like they
just couldn't get a break,

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:32.470 align:middle line:90%
they get their breaks this year.

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:35.730 align:middle line:84%
This is a really much
calmer cycle for all of us.

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And when people say, Glynis,
it was just going so fast

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:41.340 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't make things
happen, this year it's slower.

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:42.950 align:middle line:90%
You get your life back.

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:44.520 align:middle line:84%
If it was black and
white last year,

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:45.990 align:middle line:90%
it's living color this year.

00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:47.160 align:middle line:90%
So I like that part of it.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.970 align:middle line:84%
But it's also very immediate
in terms of justice.

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:52.230 align:middle line:84%
If something happens
that's not right,

00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:54.240 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
justice pretty quickly.

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:56.420 align:middle line:84%
Now personal year
cycle, I'm going

00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:58.170 align:middle line:90%
to use you as the example.

00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:00.380 align:middle line:84%
When I said you were
born 6/4 and that

00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:04.660 align:middle line:84%
was the number 1 that was
your attitude number, 1 plus 6

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:06.060 align:middle line:84%
puts you in your
cycle this year.

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:06.601 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:32:06.601 --> 00:32:08.030 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: 1 plus 6 is 7.

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:09.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, George, you're
a 7 life path.

00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:13.340 align:middle line:84%
When your personal year cycle
is the same as your life path,

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:14.196 align:middle line:90%
it's your time.

00:32:14.196 --> 00:32:15.070 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: This is it?

00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:16.278 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: This is it, baby.

00:32:16.278 --> 00:32:18.811 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have to
put an 8 in your pocket,

00:32:18.811 --> 00:32:20.560 align:middle line:84%
because this really
is your turning point.

00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:23.170 align:middle line:84%
Now you have to decide,
what brings me the most joy?

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:24.930 align:middle line:84%
Where do I want
to spend my time?

00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:25.580 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:28.267 align:middle line:84%
Instead of feeling like
you've wasted time or spending

00:32:28.267 --> 00:32:30.350 align:middle line:84%
time with people you don't
really want to be with,

00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:32.420 align:middle line:84%
this is the year to go, no,
I'm going to do it my way.

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:33.820 align:middle line:90%
And you know what else, George?

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:35.715 align:middle line:90%
It's an observation time.

00:32:35.715 --> 00:32:38.340 align:middle line:84%
Even though you're with people,
you have this ability to really

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:41.240 align:middle line:84%
step back and decide, what
do I want and what don't?

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And is that guy
authentic or not?

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:45.489 align:middle line:84%
You're hearing things
clearly this year.

00:32:45.489 --> 00:32:46.780 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What about next year?

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:47.530 align:middle line:90%
What happens then?

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:49.485 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: Well,
then you shift to 8.

00:32:49.485 --> 00:32:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you, I'm
going to define it for them.

00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:53.811 align:middle line:84%
Because every one of you
has gone into a new cycle.

00:32:53.811 --> 00:32:55.310 align:middle line:84%
So just think in
your mind right now

00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:57.060 align:middle line:84%
your month and
day, break it down

00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:58.790 align:middle line:84%
to one digit, whatever
that might be.

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:00.360 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
quickly you in the red.

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:01.290 align:middle line:90%
What's your birthday?

00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:02.090 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: February 6.

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:02.340 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: OK.

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:03.110 align:middle line:90%
February 6.

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:04.920 align:middle line:90%
2 plus 6 is 8.

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.500 align:middle line:90%
Add it to the world number.

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:07.820 align:middle line:90%
8 plus 6 is 14.

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:09.240 align:middle line:90%
1 plus 4 is 5.

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:11.960 align:middle line:90%
5 means its movement for you.

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:13.355 align:middle line:90%
Did you feel stagnant last year?

00:33:13.355 --> 00:33:15.230 align:middle line:84%
Did it feel like it
wasn't happening for you?

00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:15.570 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:17.361 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: Now it's
like get up and do it.

00:33:17.361 --> 00:33:18.350 align:middle line:90%
Don't think about it.

00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:19.850 align:middle line:84%
The message in the
cycle of 5, it's

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:21.977 align:middle line:84%
about travel if you
can-- if you can get out

00:33:21.977 --> 00:33:24.310 align:middle line:84%
of your regular environment,
it'd be real good for you--

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:26.840 align:middle line:84%
and also taking care
of your physical self,

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:29.930 align:middle line:84%
not taking care of everyone
else, taking care of you.

00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:31.427 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't that feel nice?

00:33:31.427 --> 00:33:32.010 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yes.

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:33.260 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: That's your cycle.

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:35.940 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And Glynis is going to
talk with more about your life

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:38.180 align:middle line:84%
in just a moment here
on "Beyond Belief,"

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:40.930 align:middle line:90%
which is truly fascinating.

00:33:40.930 --> 00:33:45.630 align:middle line:84%
When you wrote "Love
By the Numbers,"

00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:48.960 align:middle line:84%
what response did you have
after you were on our program

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:52.695 align:middle line:84%
and after people realized that
there's something out there?

00:33:52.695 --> 00:33:54.570 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: I'll tell
you what's interesting.

00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:57.350 align:middle line:84%
Some people have
been hurt in love,

00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:59.260 align:middle line:84%
and they're just
afraid to do it again.

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:01.760 align:middle line:84%
So when a book's called "Love
By the Numbers," they're like,

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:02.660 align:middle line:90%
oh, I've done that.

00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:04.040 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:05.130 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: It's
like, no, you haven't.

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:06.630 align:middle line:84%
And they're like,
I don't want love.

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:08.000 align:middle line:90%
I said, yes, you do.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.659 align:middle line:90%
But you want healthy love.

00:34:09.659 --> 00:34:11.830 align:middle line:90%
You don't want toxic love.

00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:15.010 align:middle line:84%
A relationship should be
a get to, not a have to.

00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:17.330 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm with
Charlie, it's a get to.

00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:18.500 align:middle line:90%
We get to hang out.

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:20.320 align:middle line:84%
We're not together all the
time, because you can't be.

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:20.739 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You can't be.

00:34:20.739 --> 00:34:21.020 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: No.

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:21.659 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You can't
smother each other.

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:23.409 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: That's a
horrible thing to do.

00:34:23.409 --> 00:34:25.780 align:middle line:84%
More importantly, if you
are living a good life,

00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:26.860 align:middle line:90%
you're both busy.

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:29.120 align:middle line:84%
Then when you come together,
you get to talk about it,

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:31.219 align:middle line:84%
and you have fun and
good communication.

00:34:31.219 --> 00:34:32.820 align:middle line:90%
So that is what I did.

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:35.120 align:middle line:84%
I explained to them don't
think about the past

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:36.300 align:middle line:90%
except for one reason.

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:37.550 align:middle line:90%
Look at your pattern.

00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:40.397 align:middle line:84%
George, one woman, been
married three times.

00:34:40.397 --> 00:34:42.230 align:middle line:84%
When she was a little
girl, her father left.

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:43.530 align:middle line:90%
She was three years old.

00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:47.030 align:middle line:84%
Turns out these three men
had the exact same numerology

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:50.639 align:middle line:84%
blueprint, and I mean all
six numbers, as her father.

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:51.920 align:middle line:90%
So subconsciously she kept--

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:52.179 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's in--

00:34:52.179 --> 00:34:52.580 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: --attracting them.

00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:52.870 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: --her system.

00:34:52.870 --> 00:34:54.203 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: It's in your system.

00:34:54.203 --> 00:34:56.290 align:middle line:84%
You don't know what it is,
but you're drawn to it.

00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:58.505 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm pointing out
the patterns, she's like,

00:34:58.505 --> 00:34:59.615 align:middle line:84%
but I don't care
about my father.

00:34:59.615 --> 00:35:00.820 align:middle line:90%
He left me when I was three.

00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:02.320 align:middle line:90%
I said your subconscious does.

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:03.030 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah, it sure does.

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:04.696 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: Well, she
broke the pattern.

00:35:04.696 --> 00:35:07.070 align:middle line:84%
That, by the way, was 15
years ago when that happened.

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:07.750 align:middle line:90%
She's married.

00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:08.690 align:middle line:90%
She's been happily married.

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:10.773 align:middle line:84%
The numbers are nothing
like her father's pattern.

00:35:10.773 --> 00:35:13.520 align:middle line:84%
But how would she know it if
she couldn't see it to break it?

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:13.790 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:14.580 align:middle line:84%
You got to put it
right out there.

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:15.920 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: You've got to
see the numbers to know

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:16.280 align:middle line:90%
what's real.

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:18.150 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Let's take some more
questions for you, Glynis,

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:19.010 align:middle line:90%
from the audience.

00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:19.510 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir.

00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:24.134 align:middle line:84%
Let's start with you, for Glynis
McCants, the Numbers Lady.

00:35:24.134 --> 00:35:24.800 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm wondering if you could
talk about master numbers

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:28.632 align:middle line:90%
and what makes them so special.

00:35:28.632 --> 00:35:30.340 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: I'm glad
you brought them up.

00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:32.375 align:middle line:84%
Because I was sitting
with George, and I'm like,

00:35:32.375 --> 00:35:33.130 align:middle line:84%
we've got to talk about
the master numbers.

00:35:33.130 --> 00:35:33.950 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And what's
a master number?

00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:35.366 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: Well,
here's the deal.

00:35:35.366 --> 00:35:38.300 align:middle line:84%
First of all, in your audience,
born the 11th or the 22nd,

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:39.240 align:middle line:90%
raise your hand.

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:41.370 align:middle line:90%
Born the 11th or the 22nd.

00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:42.810 align:middle line:90%
So you've got no master numbers.

00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:43.922 align:middle line:90%
I love this crowd.

00:35:43.922 --> 00:35:45.380 align:middle line:84%
I like when they're
not that smart.

00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:46.290 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Next group.

00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:48.320 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: It makes me happy.

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:49.320 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, no.

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.040 align:middle line:90%
But it's true.

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:53.100 align:middle line:84%
People born the
11th or the 22nd--

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:54.716 align:middle line:84%
or if you're a whole
birthday before,

00:35:54.716 --> 00:35:55.840 align:middle line:90%
I talk about that number 2.

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:59.470 align:middle line:84%
Let's say there's
an 11 or the 22.

00:35:59.470 --> 00:36:03.521 align:middle line:84%
There's also the master number
33, the master number 44.

00:36:03.521 --> 00:36:04.020 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:05.130 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Oh, I'm 33.

00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:06.050 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: Well, there you go.

00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:07.300 align:middle line:90%
So you know that about you.

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:08.846 align:middle line:84%
But all it means--
first of all, it

00:36:08.846 --> 00:36:10.470 align:middle line:84%
means you're
hypercritical of yourself.

00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:12.020 align:middle line:90%
It's not lovely.

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:14.320 align:middle line:84%
Because when you think you
have to master something,

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:16.500 align:middle line:84%
George, do you realize you
always think you come up short?

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:16.930 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:18.846 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: I cannot
tell you how many people,

00:36:18.846 --> 00:36:20.540 align:middle line:84%
famous people
who've passed away,

00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:22.980 align:middle line:84%
have the master number and
never thought they were great.

00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:23.800 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:25.550 align:middle line:84%
So what I teach in my
book, and the reason

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:28.600 align:middle line:84%
I talk-- I call that the
highest frequency numbers.

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:30.590 align:middle line:84%
They're power
numbers, aren't they?

00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:32.280 align:middle line:84%
I talk about the
lower frequency.

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:34.460 align:middle line:84%
If I say 11, when
I talk about 2 I'm

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:36.064 align:middle line:90%
saying take it easy on yourself.

00:36:36.064 --> 00:36:37.730 align:middle line:84%
You already know
you're a master number.

00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:39.180 align:middle line:84%
You're already called
to master your life.

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:41.596 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at the number
2, it's about having a heart

00:36:41.596 --> 00:36:43.660 align:middle line:84%
and having love and
getting affection

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:45.960 align:middle line:84%
from the people in your life
instead of feeling alone.

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:48.084 align:middle line:84%
Because master number 11
means now matter how good,

00:36:48.084 --> 00:36:49.060 align:middle line:90%
not good enough.

00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:50.820 align:middle line:90%
You're too self-critical.

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:52.124 align:middle line:90%
The 22 is very cerebral.

00:36:52.124 --> 00:36:54.040 align:middle line:84%
Jack Nicholson is one
of my favorite examples.

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:56.420 align:middle line:90%
Same with Clint Eastwood.

00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:57.290 align:middle line:90%
They've got the 22.

00:36:57.290 --> 00:36:58.750 align:middle line:90%
Don't you see it in them?

00:36:58.750 --> 00:37:01.520 align:middle line:84%
These men are intense and smart,
and they never stop going.

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:04.220 align:middle line:84%
But what I would hope
for them, do you relax?

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And so if we look at that
number 22, which is also a 4,

00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:08.660 align:middle line:90%
are you taking care of family?

00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:10.785 align:middle line:84%
Are you spending time with
the people in your life?

00:37:10.785 --> 00:37:13.920 align:middle line:84%
Or are you only working on
your goal, to master your life?

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:15.347 align:middle line:90%
So that's what it means.

00:37:15.347 --> 00:37:16.680 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You've got to balance.

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:16.850 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: Yeah.

00:37:16.850 --> 00:37:18.290 align:middle line:84%
You got to find
the balance, yes.

00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:18.440 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: How about some more?

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:19.390 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: But I do
cover that in the books.

00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:20.170 align:middle line:90%
I want you to know that.

00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:20.535 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

00:37:20.535 --> 00:37:21.150 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you.

00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:22.840 align:middle line:90%
Right here.

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:26.030 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: How do you
help a kid that's had--

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:29.790 align:middle line:84%
my daughter has had
some problems with, say,

00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:30.900 align:middle line:90%
sexual abuse with her dad.

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:34.160 align:middle line:84%
How do you help them heal
through numbers or something

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:34.660 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:35.534 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: Oh, yeah.

00:37:35.534 --> 00:37:38.410 align:middle line:84%
It's all about-- Listen,
when you understand

00:37:38.410 --> 00:37:40.380 align:middle line:84%
what your numbers
are, then you can

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:43.010 align:middle line:84%
study what's the dark
side of the numbers.

00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:45.760 align:middle line:84%
I even created a CD called
"Healing by the Numbers"

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.900 align:middle line:84%
to help us leave that
negative thought.

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:49.530 align:middle line:84%
Because once you
feel depressed, you

00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:51.690 align:middle line:84%
can fall deeper into
that rabbit hole,

00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:53.070 align:middle line:90%
and I stop you from doing that.

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:54.740 align:middle line:90%
You know what causes pain?

00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:57.690 align:middle line:84%
When we worry about yesterday
or what's in store tomorrow.

00:37:57.690 --> 00:37:58.020 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:37:58.020 --> 00:37:59.460 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: If you're in
the moment, you're happy.

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.293 align:middle line:84%
So when you tell me
your daughter's in pain,

00:38:01.293 --> 00:38:02.970 align:middle line:90%
she's still living in the past.

00:38:02.970 --> 00:38:05.178 align:middle line:84%
So the only way to get happy
is to get in the moment,

00:38:05.178 --> 00:38:06.554 align:middle line:84%
and I do cover
that in the books.

00:38:06.554 --> 00:38:08.011 align:middle line:84%
So I would suggest
"Glynis Has Your

00:38:08.011 --> 00:38:09.140 align:middle line:90%
Number," the original book.

00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:11.660 align:middle line:84%
I talk about healing by
the numbers and to help

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:13.570 align:middle line:84%
her get in the moment
so she can be happy

00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:16.120 align:middle line:84%
instead of feeling
like a victim forever.

00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:17.970 align:middle line:90%
You don't want that for her.

00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:19.880 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And what do
you recommend she does?

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:20.690 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: Affirmations.

00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:21.080 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:23.163 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: When you start
affirming the positive,

00:38:23.163 --> 00:38:24.700 align:middle line:90%

I thought of the number
5 and the number 8.

00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:09.950 align:middle line:84%
Because when a 5 gets hurt,
sometimes they become a martyr.

And when an 8 gets hurt, it
can be the victim number.

then they run a company

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:03.020 align:middle line:84%
But 12/12/12 was good,
because when you broke it

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:05.700 align:middle line:84%
down all the numbers
in the actual date

00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:08.050 align:middle line:84%

That's what it means.

00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:16.270 align:middle line:84%
When numbers line up nicely

today's a good day.

Now that's funny.

00:43:59.890 --> 00:44:02.290 align:middle line:84%
I have to say, just in
terms of doing this show,

00:44:02.290 --> 00:44:04.810 align:middle line:84%
this would be considered a
sunny day symbol for her,

00:44:04.810 --> 00:44:06.580 align:middle line:84%

called on twice.

00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:07.990 align:middle line:90%

00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:08.580 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: How about that?

00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:09.070 align:middle line:90%
That is good.

00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:09.695 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: OK.

00:44:09.695 --> 00:44:13.042 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing I would do is
I'd look at your birth numbers,

00:44:13.042 --> 00:44:14.500 align:middle line:84%
because they're
the most revealing.

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:16.833 align:middle line:84%
And what you didn't know about
you, when I asked earlier

00:44:16.833 --> 00:44:19.980 align:middle line:84%
about master numbers, 11
or 22, your whole birthday

00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:22.590 align:middle line:84%
does become the
master number 11.

00:44:22.590 --> 00:44:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And so the other
thing people need

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:28.010 align:middle line:84%
to understand about the master
number, it does not go away.

00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:29.260 align:middle line:90%
It's always going to be there.

00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:31.120 align:middle line:84%
You've got the 11
no matter what.

00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:33.800 align:middle line:84%
But when I say high frequency,
lower frequency, the energy

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:37.462 align:middle line:84%
of 2 is a part of you, which
means you're very sensitive--

00:44:37.462 --> 00:44:38.170 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:44:38.170 --> 00:44:40.255 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: --and
you get hurt easily.

00:44:40.255 --> 00:44:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And you don't want
to, by the way.

00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:42.700 align:middle line:90%
You want to be tough.

00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:44.700 align:middle line:84%
It's like, no, I'm going
to be strong this time.

00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:46.710 align:middle line:84%
The next thing you
know, you're crushed.

00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:48.559 align:middle line:90%
It's like, I'm hurting again.

00:44:48.559 --> 00:44:50.225 align:middle line:84%
Now what's nice about
your birth numbers

00:44:50.225 --> 00:44:53.090 align:middle line:90%
is you have 8, 6, and 11.

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:54.620 align:middle line:90%
That's all compatible.

00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:57.550 align:middle line:84%
The energy knows itself, meaning
what you see is what you get.

00:44:57.550 --> 00:44:59.170 align:middle line:84%
You don't play games, and
that's what hurts you.

00:44:59.170 --> 00:45:00.090 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: No, I don't.

00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:00.270 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: Right.

00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:01.990 align:middle line:84%
But that's what hurts
you about others.

00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:04.050 align:middle line:84%
They act one way and
turn out to be another.

00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:04.320 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:06.403 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: And that causes
you great frustration.

00:45:06.403 --> 00:45:08.352 align:middle line:84%
It's like, please
don't do that to me.

00:45:08.352 --> 00:45:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And my analogy-- do
you have kids or not?

00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:10.520 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: One.

00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:11.144 align:middle line:90%

well be this big for you.

He should be romper room.

You don't see the
adult in the child.

00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:20.520 align:middle line:90%
You do not.

00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:22.690 align:middle line:84%
Now my analogy is f someone
fell in a well and said,

00:45:22.690 --> 00:45:23.440 align:middle line:90%
could you help me?

00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:25.122 align:middle line:84%

say, what's wrong?

that for him every single time.

by the way-- she
was born on a 6.

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:41.040 align:middle line:84%
She's got the energy
that this one has.

00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:41.540 align:middle line:90%
You see it.

00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:42.130 align:middle line:90%

00:45:42.130 --> 00:45:44.280 align:middle line:84%

learn is boundaries.

You need to learn that
not only do I give a lot,

I need to receive, too.

00:45:48.884 --> 00:45:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And what happens with you
when someone gives to you,

00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:51.890 align:middle line:90%
sometimes you panic.

00:45:51.890 --> 00:45:53.552 align:middle line:84%
You're like, do I
owe you something?

It's not as comfortable
for you to receive.

00:45:56.580 --> 00:45:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And then 8 attitude means you
want to learn it your way.

telling you how to do it.

did I play before

00:47:24.408 --> 00:47:27.282 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: But the point
is you overthink it.

00:47:27.282 --> 00:47:29.490 align:middle line:84%
Remember I said, no matter
how good, not good enough.

00:47:29.490 --> 00:47:32.560 align:middle line:84%
So even if you do write,
even without what happened,

00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:35.092 align:middle line:84%
the breakup, it's
hard for you to settle

00:47:35.092 --> 00:47:36.050 align:middle line:90%
on what you've written.

00:47:36.050 --> 00:47:37.440 align:middle line:90%
It's like, is that good enough?

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:38.600 align:middle line:90%
Is it what I meant?

00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:40.100 align:middle line:90%
The perfect word.

00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:41.410 align:middle line:90%
Stop perfection.

00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:42.932 align:middle line:90%
Put on the Nikes and just do it.

00:47:42.932 --> 00:47:45.140 align:middle line:84%
Then you'll get it done,
and it will be a great book.

00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:47.020 align:middle line:84%

00:47:56.863 --> 00:47:58.688 align:middle line:90%

something on you, April,

00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:07.414 align:middle line:90%
for one sec, OK?

00:48:07.414 --> 00:48:08.080 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:10.840 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: I just want
to see if I can do this.

00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:14.290 align:middle line:84%
What I'm doing, George, real
quick is her name numbers.

00:48:14.290 --> 00:48:15.282 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:48:15.282 --> 00:48:16.770 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: Yeah.

00:48:16.770 --> 00:48:19.116 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You're like a
psychologist, aren't you?

00:48:19.116 --> 00:48:20.490 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: By
the numbers, yeah.

00:48:20.490 --> 00:48:22.889 align:middle line:84%
Well, and this is
such a good tool.

00:48:22.889 --> 00:48:24.930 align:middle line:84%
That's why, by the way,
the first book was called

00:48:24.930 --> 00:48:27.230 align:middle line:84%
"Glynis Has Your Number,"
because I would read

00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:30.000 align:middle line:84%
numerology books, and I
never got those specifics

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.330 align:middle line:90%
to the degree I give them.

00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:33.580 align:middle line:84%
When people read my book,
they think they can do this.

00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:35.570 align:middle line:84%
They're like, Glynis, I
read people with your book,

00:48:35.570 --> 00:48:36.590 align:middle line:90%
and I dazzled the room.

00:48:36.590 --> 00:48:38.257 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, well,
you read my book,

00:48:38.257 --> 00:48:39.340 align:middle line:90%
and you read out of there.

00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:40.895 align:middle line:84%
But eventually,
when people say, I

00:48:40.895 --> 00:48:42.270 align:middle line:84%
want to be a
numerologist, I say,

00:48:42.270 --> 00:48:44.320 align:middle line:84%
if you can come up with
some unique breakthroughs

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:45.545 align:middle line:90%
in the science, go for it.

00:48:45.545 --> 00:48:46.170 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:48.900 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: But don't just
repeat what people do.

00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:50.450 align:middle line:84%
Put your own
footprints in the sand.

00:48:50.450 --> 00:48:51.540 align:middle line:90%
What do they say?

00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:53.530 align:middle line:84%
If you do what
someone else does,

00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:55.270 align:middle line:84%
you leave no
footprints in the sand?

00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:57.990 align:middle line:84%
We all want to make sure
we're leaving a footprint,

00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:58.710 align:middle line:90%
and so do you.

00:48:58.710 --> 00:49:00.320 align:middle line:90%
I know that's true about you.

00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:02.270 align:middle line:84%
So what do I see
in your numerology?

00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:03.580 align:middle line:90%
Say your birthday.

00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:05.337 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: 8/24/93.

00:49:05.337 --> 00:49:06.170 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: 8/24/93.

00:49:06.170 --> 00:49:08.950 align:middle line:90%


00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:12.705 align:middle line:84%
The first thing I want to
say is you get indecision.

00:49:12.705 --> 00:49:14.830 align:middle line:84%
It's like you came through
with so many gift ideas,

00:49:14.830 --> 00:49:16.230 align:middle line:84%
so many ways to go,
sometimes you just

00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:17.750 align:middle line:84%
don't know which
way to go at all.

00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:18.140 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:19.806 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: That's
your attitude number.

00:49:19.806 --> 00:49:21.070 align:middle line:90%
It's the number 5.

00:49:21.070 --> 00:49:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And it can be, if you're not
careful, jack of all trades,

00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:26.270 align:middle line:90%
master of none.

00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:28.550 align:middle line:84%
And you want to make
sure that's not you.

00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:31.230 align:middle line:84%
Your birth numbers,
though, are a blessing,

00:49:31.230 --> 00:49:32.880 align:middle line:84%
because you were
born on a 6 day,

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:35.930 align:middle line:84%
and your whole birthday makes
you a 9, which is the old soul.

00:49:35.930 --> 00:49:39.030 align:middle line:84%
Now that means even as a little
kid you were beyond your years.

00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:40.040 align:middle line:90%
How true was that?

00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:40.790 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Very.

00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:43.390 align:middle line:84%
My mom actually told
me that even as a baby

00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:45.044 align:middle line:90%
I looked very mature.

00:49:45.044 --> 00:49:45.710 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: Yes.

00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:47.600 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You must have
been a frustrating teenager

00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:48.444 align:middle line:90%
for your parents.

00:49:48.444 --> 00:49:49.290 align:middle line:90%

00:49:49.290 --> 00:49:51.120 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: Really, you came
through and said basically,

00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:51.870 align:middle line:90%
where's the phone?

00:49:51.870 --> 00:49:52.760 align:middle line:90%
I've got work to do.

00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:56.590 align:middle line:84%
Your energy was ready, and
any parent who's sensitive

00:49:56.590 --> 00:49:57.900 align:middle line:90%
would notice that.

00:49:57.900 --> 00:50:01.032 align:middle line:84%
But as a 9, eventually
do you want children?

00:50:01.032 --> 00:50:01.740 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:03.140 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: Because
you're born on a 6 day,

00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:04.264 align:middle line:90%
which is the mother energy.

00:50:04.264 --> 00:50:05.610 align:middle line:90%
You will do it differently.

00:50:05.610 --> 00:50:07.872 align:middle line:84%
You watched your parents
and what they did with you,

00:50:07.872 --> 00:50:08.580 align:middle line:90%
what they didn't.

00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:09.905 align:middle line:84%
There were things you
didn't appreciate.

00:50:09.905 --> 00:50:11.820 align:middle line:84%
It's like, no, I
wouldn't have done that.

00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:14.250 align:middle line:84%
How often did that pop in
your head while growing up?

00:50:14.250 --> 00:50:14.810 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: A lot.

00:50:14.810 --> 00:50:15.065 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: Right.

00:50:15.065 --> 00:50:15.540 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: All the time, yeah.

00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:17.130 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: And I say
that about her why?

00:50:17.130 --> 00:50:18.546 align:middle line:84%
One, because you're
a 9 life path.

00:50:18.546 --> 00:50:20.150 align:middle line:90%
But you're also born on a 6 day.

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:22.460 align:middle line:84%
You are not meant to
work for somebody else.

00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:23.810 align:middle line:90%
You are a strong energy.

00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And if they leave you
alone, you'll give 150%.

00:50:27.690 --> 00:50:28.990 align:middle line:90%
So what work have you picked?

What are you thinking of doing?

00:50:30.370 --> 00:50:32.280 align:middle line:84%

me, it's supposed

to be creative, form of some
way to express yourself,

>> MCCANTS: Right.

00:50:42.991 --> 00:50:44.630 align:middle line:84%
But when you say that,
is that about health?

00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:45.340 align:middle line:90%

00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:03.939 align:middle line:84%
I can't stick with one
thing for very long.

00:52:03.939 --> 00:52:04.980 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: You burn out.

00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:05.320 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:06.440 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: It's
like, this isn't fun.

00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And even at a
party, how restless

00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:09.990 align:middle line:84%
do you get if you're
stuck in a situation?

00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:10.740 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:12.525 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't go very well.

00:52:12.525 --> 00:52:13.650 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: No, it doesn't.

00:52:13.650 --> 00:52:16.380 align:middle line:84%
So do you notice,
guys, what I'm saying?

00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:19.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, my whole thing is there's
no such thing as a stranger

00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:20.410 align:middle line:90%
if I've got their number.

00:52:20.410 --> 00:52:23.300 align:middle line:84%
If you give me these numbers,
you're not a stranger to me.

00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And then it's like, how
do we get you on track?

00:52:25.310 --> 00:52:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And how do we get
you to be happy?

00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:30.890 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes our parents force
us into a career, right?

00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:32.250 align:middle line:90%
And it's not a good idea.

00:52:32.250 --> 00:52:34.262 align:middle line:84%
And I can counsel
the parents and say,

00:52:34.262 --> 00:52:35.470 align:middle line:90%
that's not where they belong.

00:52:35.470 --> 00:52:36.370 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:52:36.370 --> 00:52:38.869 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: I had one gal who
was going to be an accountant.

00:52:38.869 --> 00:52:40.050 align:middle line:90%
She was a 3.

00:52:40.050 --> 00:52:41.960 align:middle line:84%
The woman was a
human Christmas tree.

00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:44.070 align:middle line:84%
Beautiful girl, big
smile, bright eyes.

00:52:44.070 --> 00:52:47.320 align:middle line:84%
By helping the mom see that,
she now does reality shows.

00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:50.250 align:middle line:84%
She produces reality
shows, and she's so happy.

00:52:50.250 --> 00:52:51.520 align:middle line:90%
So that's all.

00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:53.830 align:middle line:84%
When you talk to me about
career, that's the way to go.

00:52:53.830 --> 00:52:55.270 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing now?

00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:57.066 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I work
at a bagel shop.

00:52:57.066 --> 00:52:57.690 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: OK.

00:52:57.690 --> 00:52:58.750 align:middle line:90%
So you're just doing that now.

00:52:58.750 --> 00:52:59.730 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: She's still in food.

00:52:59.730 --> 00:53:00.220 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: Yeah.

00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:00.710 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:01.640 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: Are you at school?

00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:03.810 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I'm doing
a yoga teacher training.

00:53:03.810 --> 00:53:04.180 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: Yeah.

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:04.370 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:53:04.370 --> 00:53:05.690 align:middle line:84%
Now this is what
I want to tell you

00:53:05.690 --> 00:53:07.065 align:middle line:84%
is going to happen
with this one.

00:53:07.065 --> 00:53:09.400 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be healing
people on all levels.

00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:10.280 align:middle line:90%
It will be food.

00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:12.289 align:middle line:90%
It will be physical.

00:53:12.289 --> 00:53:14.330 align:middle line:84%
Because longevity, we're
living longer than ever,

00:53:14.330 --> 00:53:16.530 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to be
a part of that crusade.

00:53:16.530 --> 00:53:17.924 align:middle line:90%
And you'll never be bored.

00:53:17.924 --> 00:53:19.340 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Let's
hear it for April.

00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:20.214 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE APPLAUDING]

00:53:20.214 --> 00:53:21.082 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, April.

00:53:21.082 --> 00:53:22.534 align:middle line:90%
You take care.

00:53:22.534 --> 00:53:25.922 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:53:25.922 --> 00:53:26.830 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:53:26.830 --> 00:53:29.890 align:middle line:84%
I just love the
way the numbers tie

00:53:29.890 --> 00:53:33.750 align:middle line:84%
into somebody's life,
their lifestyle.

00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:38.100 align:middle line:84%
As we wrap this up, Glynis,
if you have the numbers,

00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:40.590 align:middle line:84%
can you change your
life with the numbers?

00:53:40.590 --> 00:53:41.830 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: Absolutely.

00:53:41.830 --> 00:53:42.836 align:middle line:90%
It's knowledge is power.

00:53:42.836 --> 00:53:44.210 align:middle line:84%
And here's what
you want to know.

00:53:44.210 --> 00:53:46.280 align:middle line:84%
When you have a new
personal year cycle,

00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:48.620 align:middle line:84%
it gives you a sense of
what should I focus on.

00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:50.120 align:middle line:90%
Each month we're in a cycle.

00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:53.532 align:middle line:84%
Like I said about Obama, he went
into a cycle of 1, and he won.

00:53:53.532 --> 00:53:55.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you know
what cycle you're in,

00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:57.100 align:middle line:90%
you know what to focus on.

00:53:57.100 --> 00:54:00.200 align:middle line:84%
That's the key to success,
by the way, is focus.

00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:02.712 align:middle line:84%
George, when you don't focus,
you can't get it done, really.

00:54:02.712 --> 00:54:03.670 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:04.830 align:middle line:84%
>> MCCANTS: Even when you
made the joke earlier,

00:54:04.830 --> 00:54:07.500 align:middle line:84%
I've got to hear so how many
people died in the plane crash?

00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And they already
told you it was four.

00:54:09.110 --> 00:54:10.330 align:middle line:90%
It's focus.

00:54:10.330 --> 00:54:12.649 align:middle line:84%
And numerology helps
keep us in the moment.

00:54:12.649 --> 00:54:14.190 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're
studying numbers,

00:54:14.190 --> 00:54:15.530 align:middle line:84%
you're not worried
about yesterday anymore.

00:54:15.530 --> 00:54:17.020 align:middle line:84%
You're in this moment
right now having fun

00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:17.960 align:middle line:90%
with the people in the room.

00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:19.480 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, and
you do a great job.

00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:19.630 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: Thank you.

00:54:19.630 --> 00:54:21.317 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Glynis McCants,
the Numbers Lady.

00:54:21.317 --> 00:54:21.794 align:middle line:90%
>> MCCANTS: Thank you.

00:54:21.794 --> 00:54:22.835 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Thanks, Glynis.

00:54:22.835 --> 00:54:25.133 align:middle line:90%


00:54:25.133 --> 00:54:29.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, whether it's "Love
by the Numbers" or "Glynis

00:54:29.770 --> 00:54:34.400 align:middle line:84%
Has Your Number," numerology
truly affects our life

00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:37.230 align:middle line:84%
and how we live and
where we're going.

00:54:37.230 --> 00:54:39.380 align:middle line:84%
So just remember that
the next time you

00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:42.970 align:middle line:84%
look at a bunch of
numbers on a calendar.

00:54:42.970 --> 00:54:44.670 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
