>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.290 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.265 align:middle line:10%
Andrew Collins is
with us, noted writer.

00:00:24.265 --> 00:00:27.150 align:middle line:10%
He's got 15 books about
incredible subjects.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.370 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
when you open up one,

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.620 align:middle line:84%
you want to read the next
one, because they are just

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.680 align:middle line:84%
all fascinating about
human evolution and some

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.720 align:middle line:84%
of the things that have
happened on this planet,

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.160 align:middle line:90%
or in the universe.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And what we're going to
talk about on this program

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.690 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the
Nephilim, the giants.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.650 align:middle line:84%
If you have read the Old
Testament part of the Bible,

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.590 align:middle line:84%
you will read about fallen
angels, the Nephilim,

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.720 align:middle line:84%
that they came
down here to breed

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.610 align:middle line:84%
with whatever species of females
were on the planet at the time,

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.980 align:middle line:90%
and created giants.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.130 align:middle line:90%
Andrew, really?

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW COLLINS:
That's what we're told.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.170 align:middle line:10%
Yes, it's a long story,
and one we hopefully

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.970 align:middle line:10%
should get to the bottom of.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.630 align:middle line:84%
But it starts in
the book of Genesis.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.780 align:middle line:84%
We're told that these
angelic beings called

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.940 align:middle line:84%
the Elohim take
mortal wives, and they

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.980 align:middle line:90%
produce these offspring.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And the offspring
are originally named,

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.480 align:middle line:84%
although it was changed in
later versions of the Bible,

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.150 align:middle line:90%
as the Nephilim.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And this story
seems to be expanded

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.840 align:middle line:84%
in a book that's known as the
Book of Enoch and its prequel--

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.507 align:middle line:84%
no, sequel, I should say--
called the Book of Giants.

00:01:43.507 --> 00:01:45.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Book
of Enoch, of course,

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.920 align:middle line:90%
being about Enoch, right?

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.720 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Well, it's
not so much about--

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From his point.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.060 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: It's from
his perspective.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.640 align:middle line:84%
In theory, it was
written by him.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.230 align:middle line:90%
And it's about his journeys.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.670 align:middle line:10%
I mean, basically
what happens is

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.260 align:middle line:10%
that these two angels turn
up in his house one night

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.152 align:middle line:10%
as he's trying to sleep.

00:02:03.152 --> 00:02:04.818 align:middle line:84%
And they both say,
you know, do you want

00:02:04.818 --> 00:02:06.540 align:middle line:90%
to come with us on a journey?

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you know,
OK, I'll go with you.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And they take him and show him
the so-called seven heavens.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.795 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sounds like an
ET abduction case to me.

00:02:15.795 --> 00:02:17.080 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Well, absolutely.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And I know that Erich von
Daniken sees it in that way.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.090 align:middle line:90%
And who knows?

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.190 align:middle line:90%
He could be right.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.670 align:middle line:84%
But what they show him is
very, very interesting,

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.070 align:middle line:84%
and the story that's
told along the way.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.310 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the
places that they go

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.780 align:middle line:84%
is like this sort of settlement
that's high on the mountain

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.830 align:middle line:84%
where these beings
called the Watchers live.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, the term Watchers,
which in the original Hebrew

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.330 align:middle line:84%
is [? Eden, ?] which means
basically those who watch--

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like witnesses.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.710 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yeah, yeah.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.210 align:middle line:84%
Basically they are described
as these tall beings

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.160 align:middle line:90%
that are like trees.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.860 align:middle line:90%
So obviously very big.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And they live in this community,
which I often describe as

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.220 align:middle line:90%
almost like a kibbutz in a way.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.640 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's got its
gardens and walls and things

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.790 align:middle line:84%
that are going on, and it's got
an astronomical observatory.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, other different
buildings and places.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And the story is that
some of these Watchers

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.880 align:middle line:84%
have descended from
this location, which

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.700 align:middle line:90%
is described by various names.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.980 align:middle line:84%
It's called Heaven,
it's Paradise,

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.106 align:middle line:90%
but it's also Eden as well.

00:03:33.106 --> 00:03:33.905 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:03:33.905 --> 00:03:34.790 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: And that they come
down to the plains below,

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.200 align:middle line:84%
so it sort of
suggests that they're

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.130 align:middle line:84%
coming down from a
mountain-like environment.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And in the plains below, they've
mixed with the mortal women.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.770 align:middle line:84%
They've trafficked
with humankind.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And these women
have then produced

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.360 align:middle line:90%
these giant-sized babies.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, it is emphasized
that they are of large size.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.200 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get
onto the fact of, well,

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.790 align:middle line:90%
who exactly were these Watchers?

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.670 align:middle line:90%
Who exactly were these Nephilim?

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And in my opinion, we're talking
about flesh and blood beings,

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.630 align:middle line:84%
beings that, in my
opinion, were born

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.700 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, because although
the biblical account, the Book

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.480 align:middle line:84%
of Enoch and these other
so-called Enochian texts,

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.710 align:middle line:84%
suggests that they
are angelic in nature,

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.400 align:middle line:84%
there is a lot to suggest
that they are flesh and blood,

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.740 align:middle line:84%
and that the bibles
that are produced

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.680 align:middle line:90%
look like their Watcher fathers.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.970 align:middle line:90%
In one particular account--

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.800 align:middle line:90%
this is what's actually said--

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:47.520 align:middle line:84%
that, you know, the
husband accuses his wife

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.830 align:middle line:84%
of having slept with
one of these Watchers,

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.451 align:middle line:84%
because the baby that's produced
is not only large in size--

00:04:53.451 --> 00:04:54.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But looks like.

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:55.620 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: But looks like--

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:56.661 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like the father.

00:04:56.661 --> 00:04:59.280 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Has very pale
skin and red, ruddy cheeks,

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.780 align:middle line:90%
and things like this.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.540 align:middle line:84%
Very albino-like in
appearance, and very large.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.920 align:middle line:84%
And the wife says, no no no,
look, I've only slept with you.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.900 align:middle line:84%
You know, this is our
child, or whatever.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:11.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, right.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: And, you know,
this is the birth of Noah, I

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:16.650 align:middle line:90%
believe.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.170 align:middle line:84%
And so, this is
the type of stories

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.120 align:middle line:90%
that you find in these texts.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.406 align:middle line:84%
So we're definitely dealing
with flesh and blood here.

00:05:24.406 --> 00:05:25.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
strange stories.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:26.613 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: They are.

00:05:26.613 --> 00:05:30.520 align:middle line:10%
And that's what fascinated
me about them when I first

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.671 align:middle line:10%
started looking into
them, about 25 years ago,

00:05:33.671 --> 00:05:35.170 align:middle line:10%
and I started to
write a book called

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.480 align:middle line:10%
"From the Ashes of
Angels," which has brought

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.120 align:middle line:10%
out all of these traditions.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And so, if these
are flesh and blood

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.667 align:middle line:84%
human beings,
well, who are they?

00:05:46.667 --> 00:05:48.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And where
did they come from?

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.350 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Why
are they so large?

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.710 align:middle line:84%
Why do they seem to have
these albino features?

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.560 align:middle line:84%
Certainly amongst their
population-- we can't say they

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.480 align:middle line:90%
all were albinos.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.930 align:middle line:84%
So, we say, well, who
are we, to start with?

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.230 align:middle line:90%
Well, we are Homo sapiens.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:09.100 align:middle line:84%
We existed on the
Eurasian continent,

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.350 align:middle line:84%
certainly for
about 45,000 years,

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.750 align:middle line:84%
possibly with earlier
waves, perhaps as early

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.680 align:middle line:90%
as 65,000 years ago.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And we took over the
Eurasian continent

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.770 align:middle line:90%
from the Neanderthals.

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, in theory, they were
supposedly more primitive.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.960 align:middle line:84%
But the more we
find out about them,

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.540 align:middle line:84%
the more we know that
they did have an intellect

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.720 align:middle line:84%
and were very advanced
in their lifestyles

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.700 align:middle line:90%
and their technologies.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:41.320 align:middle line:84%
But just recently, we've
also put onto the human map

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.930 align:middle line:84%
a third type of
humankind that coexisted.

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.055 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: [INAUDIBLE], yeah.

00:06:45.055 --> 00:06:48.280 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: And these are
known as the Denisovans.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.250 align:middle line:10%
And their fossil
remains have been

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:53.950 align:middle line:10%
found so far in only one site.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:07:00.220 align:middle line:10%
It's in southern Siberia in a
place called the Denisova Cave.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And it would seem as if the
Denisovans existed from maybe,

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:10.300 align:middle line:84%
let's say, 400,000 years
ago down to approximately

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.140 align:middle line:90%
40,000 years ago.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:12.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What were their
features have been, Andrew?

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.520 align:middle line:10%
>>COLLINS: Well, this is where
it starts getting interesting,

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.700 align:middle line:10%
because all of the
anatomical remains that

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:23.726 align:middle line:10%
have been found so far suggest
that the Denisovans were huge.

00:07:23.726 --> 00:07:26.890 align:middle line:10%
Their teeth so large, that when
they were originally found,

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:29.750 align:middle line:10%
they were mistaken for that
of a cave bear, and cave bears

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:30.550 align:middle line:10%
are pretty big.

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:31.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
a two-inch tooth.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:32.460 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yeah.

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And every piece of
evidence suggests

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:38.140 align:middle line:84%
that we could be looking
at the giants of old.

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:41.590 align:middle line:84%
We could be looking here

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.070 align:middle line:84%
But we have to look
at the evidence.

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And at the moment, all
of this is brand new.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:55.090 align:middle line:84%
All of this is only coming out
now within the last decade.

00:07:55.090 --> 00:08:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And what we know is that
evidence of Denisovan DNA

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:04.270 align:middle line:84%
has been found in a number of
populations around the world--

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:06.760 align:middle line:90%
I mean, modern populations.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:11.890 align:middle line:84%
In Eastern Asia, but
also in North America,

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:14.980 align:middle line:84%
amongst various Native
American tribes.

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And these same tribes
have got these traditions

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:22.510 align:middle line:84%
about the giants, or the
Nephilim, in their midst.

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:25.210 align:middle line:84%
Very often, they were
at war with them.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:29.050 align:middle line:84%
But we also know that many of
these Native American tribes

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:33.970 align:middle line:84%
had within them a power elite
that was of a giant nature,

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:37.210 align:middle line:84%
that the chief, you
know, the leaders

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:40.840 align:middle line:84%
of the Native American
tribes, would often

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.750 align:middle line:84%
be of extreme height,
up to seven feet tall.

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:47.880 align:middle line:84%

You know, Central America
and in South America.

00:08:57.190 --> 00:09:00.390 align:middle line:84%
There were giants
all over the place.

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:01.810 align:middle line:90%
They were there.

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:04.990 align:middle line:84%
There are many
different accounts.

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:09.670 align:middle line:84%
Almost certainly, these are the
descendants of the Denisovans.

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And if not pure Denisovans,
probably their hybrids--

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:18.460 align:middle line:84%
mixtures between Homo sapiens
Denisovans and almost certainly

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:21.560 align:middle line:84%
Neanderthals as well, because
we know that all of these

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:22.360 align:middle line:90%
interbred.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.660 align:middle line:84%
That's the one thing we can
tell by the DNA evidence--

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:27.460 align:middle line:90%
that all of these interbred.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:31.140 align:middle line:84%
So coming back to the
story that we started with,

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:34.690 align:middle line:84%
that that's told in the Book
of Enoch, about the Watchers,

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:38.200 align:middle line:84%
they themselves were described
as extremely tall, you know,

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.310 align:middle line:90%
like trees.

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:41.050 align:middle line:84%
The Nephilim were
extremely tall.

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:43.330 align:middle line:90%
The babies were extremely large.

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:46.150 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible-- is
there a possibility

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:49.840 align:middle line:84%
that these giants, these
Nephilim, these Watchers,

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.540 align:middle line:84%
were all descendants
of the Denisovans,

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:54.730 align:middle line:84%
and if not pure
Denisovans, hybrids?

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:57.310 align:middle line:84%
I think the answer is
absolutely going to be yes.

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:19.110 align:middle line:84%

They Clearly say the

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.440 align:middle line:90%
they had a mutiny on board.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:43.460 align:middle line:84%
Some of them wanted to have
sex with beautiful humans.

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:46.380 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to have contact,
sexual contact with them.

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:48.410 align:middle line:90%
But it was forbidden to do so.

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:50.270 align:middle line:84%
That's written in
the Book of Enoch.

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:51.990 align:middle line:90%
So they make a mutiny.

And the story
relating to that is

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:38.150 align:middle line:84%
that the earliest wisdom that
allowed the first inhabitants

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:41.390 align:middle line:84%
to learn their astronomy
came from the Watchers,

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:46.280 align:middle line:84%
and that they actually
found this stele, this stone

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:50.330 align:middle line:84%
tablet that revealed the
astronomy of the Watchers.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:21.010 align:middle line:84%
some kind of power elite that

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:23.771 align:middle line:84%

00:13:28.605 --> 00:13:30.350 align:middle line:84%

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:33.267 align:middle line:84%
probably in what is today
the Steppes of Russia.

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And they brought together
all of the indigenous peoples

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:47.580 align:middle line:84%
of the region
around Gobekli Tepe.

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And they engaged them in
this building project,

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:53.480 align:middle line:84%
which I think had a
lot to do with the fact

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:57.470 align:middle line:84%
that there had been this
comic cataclysm immediately

00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:59.210 align:middle line:90%
before this time.

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And this cataclysm,
by the way, is

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:04.970 align:middle line:84%
mentioned in the
so-called Enochian texts,

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:08.150 align:middle line:84%
like the Book of Enoch, and
its sequel, the Book of Giants.

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:09.620 align:middle line:90%
It actually talks about it.

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:10.760 align:middle line:90%
It talks about the flood.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:14.420 align:middle line:84%
It talks about
this rain of fire.

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Very clearly, this relates
to a cataclysm that

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.600 align:middle line:90%
occurred prior to this time.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And I think that all of that
has to do with this comet impact

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:29.720 align:middle line:84%
that we now know
occurred around 10800 BC

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:32.990 align:middle line:84%
but had reverberations
for many hundreds of years

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:37.310 align:middle line:84%
afterwards, right the way
down to around 9600 BC,

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:40.300 align:middle line:84%
when Gobekli Tepe
was constructed.

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And in my opinion, the memory of
the Watchers and the Nephilim--

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:48.070 align:middle line:84%
because those two are
essentially synonymous,

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:48.870 align:middle line:90%
even though--

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:58.160 align:middle line:84%

the use of both names,

the same thing coming

at some point.

about giant beings, basically,

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:13.370 align:middle line:84%
giant flesh and blood
beings, that give humanity

the rudiments of civilization.

who claims that he stumbled
across one of these,

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:40.160 align:middle line:84%
that there was even a
live one in a cave that

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.560 align:middle line:90%
attacked some soldiers.

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.464 align:middle line:90%
So they're out there.

00:15:43.464 --> 00:15:44.630 align:middle line:90%
They're out there somewhere.

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:48.980 align:middle line:84%
But I would love to have one
of these skeletons displayed

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:50.367 align:middle line:90%
for the world, wouldn't you?

00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:51.200 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: It would.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is
that the largest amount

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:59.480 align:middle line:84%
of giant skeletons that
have been found probably

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.190 align:middle line:90%
comes from North America.

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:05.600 align:middle line:84%
There are literally thousands
and thousands of accounts.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.730 align:middle line:84%
Some of these we can
put down to hoaxes.

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:11.960 align:middle line:84%
Some of these we can put
down to misinformation.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.710 align:middle line:84%
But there is a core
there of real accounts

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:20.060 align:middle line:84%
that were recorded in
Smithsonian journals

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:24.770 align:middle line:84%
and publications and other
similar scholarly works

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:28.220 align:middle line:84%
that tell us that the
early archaeologists did

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:31.070 align:middle line:90%
find these giant skeletons.

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:34.554 align:middle line:84%
Now, these were generally
anything between seven feet,

00:16:34.554 --> 00:16:35.970 align:middle line:84%
may have been eight
feet, may have

00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:38.960 align:middle line:90%
been a few larger than that.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:43.980 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that all of
these bones have disappeared.

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And there is very
good reasons for that,

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:51.306 align:middle line:84%
because the Smithsonian,
in an act of--

00:16:51.306 --> 00:16:54.270 align:middle line:84%
you know, the US
government in the 1980s

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:57.650 align:middle line:84%
was made to repatriate
all of the bones

00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:59.720 align:middle line:90%
that it held within its vaults.

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.310 align:middle line:90%
And this was millions of them.

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:03.920 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely millions of them.

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:08.839 align:middle line:84%
And then later, the
NAGPRA law of repatriation

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:13.970 align:middle line:84%
meant that all the other
museums around the United States

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:15.890 align:middle line:90%
also had to repatriate theirs.

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:19.680 align:middle line:84%
So in theory, there
are no bones anywhere.

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, there
are no giant bones.

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:25.203 align:middle line:84%
And this is such a
tragedy, because--

00:17:25.203 --> 00:17:26.119 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We need that.

00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:27.119 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: We need them.

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:28.220 align:middle line:90%
We need to test them.

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:31.220 align:middle line:84%
We need to see
what their DNA is.

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And my best bet is
that we're going

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:36.150 align:middle line:84%
to see that they are
related to the Denisovans.

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:38.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: von Daniken
seems to be fascinated

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:39.980 align:middle line:90%
with the Book of Enoch.

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:41.280 align:middle line:90%
You've looked at this too.

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.655 align:middle line:84%
How important is
that to this story?

00:17:43.655 --> 00:17:47.840 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Well, the Book of
Enoch talks about the Watchers,

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:51.530 align:middle line:84%
the good Watchers, those
that remained loyal to Heaven

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:55.980 align:middle line:84%
and worked on behalf of
God, and those that fell.

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And by falling, we
actually mean coming

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:01.850 align:middle line:84%
from Heaven or from the
top of this mountain down

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:02.990 align:middle line:90%
into the plains below.

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:04.730 align:middle line:90%
That's the fall.

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:07.170 align:middle line:84%
The word Nephilim
means "those who fell."

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:10.350 align:middle line:84%
So as I said, it's
essentially the same role.

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:14.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And fall
could mean also

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.936 align:middle line:84%
falling from your belief
systems, religion.

00:18:16.936 --> 00:18:17.810 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: It can be.

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:18.610 align:middle line:90%
It can be.

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:20.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, certainly from
the virtues that--

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:21.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The fall from
grace, for examples.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:22.846 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:18:22.846 --> 00:18:24.980 align:middle line:90%
That's absolutely.

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:29.900 align:middle line:84%
And so the fallen Watchers
became the fallen angels.

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:33.560 align:middle line:84%
These become
popularized in books

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:36.980 align:middle line:84%
on the occult and so-called
medieval grimoires,

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:40.130 align:middle line:84%
which are books of spells
where people could evoke

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:45.170 align:middle line:84%
these fallen angels to
perform acts on your behalf

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:47.210 align:middle line:84%
or to find buried
treasure or whatever.

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:49.370 align:middle line:84%
So, they almost become
demonized in many ways.

00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:56.026 align:middle line:84%
So the true story becomes
lost within the occult itself.

00:18:56.026 --> 00:18:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And this is a shame,
really, because it

00:18:57.650 --> 00:19:00.230 align:middle line:84%
seems as if the fallen
angels were simply

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:03.800 align:middle line:84%
those that decided to
rebel against the very

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:06.792 align:middle line:84%
strict rules of Heaven
or Paradise or whatever,

00:19:06.792 --> 00:19:07.750 align:middle line:90%
and do their own thing.

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:08.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: And it's said
that the reason they did this

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:15.980 align:middle line:84%
was that they wanted to give
the knowledge of the Watchers

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:19.040 align:middle line:84%
to mortal kind, which
they did through the wives

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:19.956 align:middle line:90%
that they took.

00:19:19.956 --> 00:19:21.455 align:middle line:84%
And obviously the
wives, presumably,

00:19:21.455 --> 00:19:24.350 align:middle line:84%
passed it onto others,
and that created

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:26.420 align:middle line:90%
the rudiments of civilization.

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:29.330 align:middle line:84%
But it seems like it was a
case of too much too soon--

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:34.490 align:middle line:84%
you know, that their
children, the Nephilim,

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:37.780 align:middle line:84%
ran amok and drank blood
and did dark things.

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:38.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Vampires.

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: And became
bad boys, basically.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.020 align:middle line:90%
And vampires, of course.

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:43.890 align:middle line:90%
And so they had to be killed.

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:45.560 align:middle line:90%
They had to be got rid of.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened was
that the fallen angels were--

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:51.770 align:middle line:84%
the fallen Watchers were
rounded up, taken back, and put

00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:53.910 align:middle line:90%
in prison within Heaven.

00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:54.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:57.320 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: That's according
to the Book of Enoch.

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And all of their Nephilim
babies were killed--

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:00.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:01.160 align:middle line:90%
Horrible.

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.410 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: --in the
first infanticide,

there's got to be

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:07.824 align:middle line:90%
some truth behind some of this.

00:20:07.824 --> 00:20:08.990 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Some of it, yeah.

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:10.573 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there's something
going on here.

00:20:10.573 --> 00:20:17.150 align:middle line:84%
But again, it all emphasizes
the corporeal nature

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:19.640 align:middle line:84%
of what's going on here,
the flesh and blood nature.

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.550 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're not
just dealing with--

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:22.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's very violent.

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:23.750 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: --ethereal
angels here.

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:26.480 align:middle line:84%
We're dealing with
beings that actually

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:31.950 align:middle line:84%
lived and died on Earth
itself, in some manner.

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:35.810 align:middle line:84%
So, from all this
came civilization.

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:37.010 align:middle line:90%
This is the strange thing.

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:38.964 align:middle line:84%
And this is exactly
what happened

00:20:38.964 --> 00:20:40.130 align:middle line:90%
in the area of Gobekli Tepe.

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:45.830 align:middle line:84%
Type There, we had the first
agriculture, the first animal

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:50.900 align:middle line:84%
husbandry, first metalwork, the
first beer, the first wine--

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:52.510 align:middle line:90%
lots of different things.

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:55.580 align:middle line:84%
The same type of things
that the fallen angels are

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:56.630 align:middle line:90%
said to have given us.

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:57.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:00.980 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: So in my opinion,
the founders of Gobekli Tepe

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:02.940 align:middle line:84%
are the fallen angels,
the fallen Watchers.

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:05.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who was Enoch?

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:08.660 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: I think Enoch
was a bystander, somebody

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:10.955 align:middle line:84%
that was witnessing
what was going on,

00:21:10.955 --> 00:21:13.330 align:middle line:90%
on the edge of things.

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:15.560 align:middle line:84%
He would seem to have
known the Watchers.

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.905 align:middle line:84%
We have to be careful here,
because the Book of Enoch

00:21:18.905 --> 00:21:24.290 align:middle line:84%
itself is very clearly made up
of a series of older texts that

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:27.870 align:middle line:84%
are not accredited
to Enoch himself.

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:30.860 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the oldest parts
of the Book of Enoch

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:34.510 align:middle line:84%
come from an earlier text
known as the Book of Noah.

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:35.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:36.470 align:middle line:90%
Was Noah related to Enoch?

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:37.270 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yes.

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:41.870 align:middle line:84%
I think he's either the grandson
or great-grandson of Enoch.

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And Noah, of course, is
the guy with his family

00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:48.590 align:middle line:90%
that survives this cataclysm.

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:52.280 align:middle line:84%
So we can clearly place
him during this period,

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:56.030 align:middle line:84%
when this Younger Dryas
comet impact event actually

00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:57.020 align:middle line:90%
took place.

>>NOORY: I want to talk with
you more, Andrew, about Noah.

00:21:59.436 --> 00:22:03.950 align:middle line:84%
But there was a film
back in 2014 about Noah

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:05.900 align:middle line:90%
that ties into the Watchers.

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:06.923 align:middle line:90%

the day he made the Heavens.

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:17.400 align:middle line:10%
We watched over
Adam and Eve, saw

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:22.260 align:middle line:10%
their frailty and their love,
and then we saw their fall.

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:24.742 align:middle line:10%
And we pitied them.

00:22:24.742 --> 00:22:29.050 align:middle line:10%
We were not stone
then, but light.

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:31.990 align:middle line:10%
It was not our
place to interfere,

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:34.910 align:middle line:10%

00:22:40.552 --> 00:22:44.120 align:middle line:10%
he punished us.

>>NOORY: I remember
watching that movie.

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:13.580 align:middle line:84%
It was one of the
strangest movies I've ever

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:17.450 align:middle line:84%
seen, with these rocks
that were somewhat human,

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:19.020 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:22.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure it really
happened like that,

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:24.410 align:middle line:84%
but something dramatic
happened, I think.

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:25.400 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Absolutely.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:28.070 align:middle line:10%
And the Watchers on there-- who
are made out to be like these

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:31.010 align:middle line:10%
rock creatures--

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:33.816 align:middle line:10%
the size of them is brought out
here, the fact that they were--

00:23:33.816 --> 00:23:35.066 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They were giant size.

00:23:35.066 --> 00:23:36.650 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: --giant size.

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:40.670 align:middle line:84%
Clearly exaggerated, as
probably the original accounts

00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:43.310 align:middle line:84%
in the Book of Enoch are
exaggerated themselves.

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:45.830 align:middle line:84%
But there is a core
of reality here.

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:49.020 align:middle line:84%
There's a core of
historical truth.

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the Watchers
were flesh and blood beings.

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:55.520 align:middle line:84%
I think the Nephilim
were as well.

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:57.884 align:middle line:84%
And I think that they were
the founders of civilization.

00:23:57.884 --> 00:23:59.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think
you may be right.

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:02.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, back to Noah, of
course, the offspring

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:06.320 align:middle line:84%
eventually of Enoch,
we had this big flood.

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:08.000 align:middle line:90%
And he was warned, of course.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if the ark
story specifically is true

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:12.290 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:15.360 align:middle line:84%
But there was some kind
of fact behind that.

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:18.680 align:middle line:84%
But what do you think caused
the Great Flood, Andrew?

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:21.500 align:middle line:84%
Was it an asteroid
that hit the ocean

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:24.690 align:middle line:84%
and created this tsunami
that wiped out a region?

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:26.270 align:middle line:90%
What do you think it was?

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:28.550 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Well, in the
past, it was considered

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:33.410 align:middle line:84%
that the Great Flood occurred
during the chronological period

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:35.180 align:middle line:90%
of the Bible.

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:38.960 align:middle line:84%
So in time frame,
probably around 2500 BC.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.970 align:middle line:84%
But remember, the Bible
tells us that the world

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:45.980 align:middle line:84%
began in 4004 BC, so clearly
there's something wrong.

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:48.320 align:middle line:84%
I think the smart
money today would

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:52.490 align:middle line:84%
be that it's a memory of this
comet impact that took place

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:57.190 align:middle line:84%
around 10800 BC, with
these lingering after--

00:24:57.190 --> 00:25:01.580 align:middle line:84%
you know, this aftermath that
occurred for hundreds of years.

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:07.160 align:middle line:84%
The actual flood itself
occurred because the fragments

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:12.380 align:middle line:84%
hit the ice sheets, which at
that time were up to two miles

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:13.750 align:middle line:90%
in depth.

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And this melted
much of the water.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.710 align:middle line:84%
This flowed into the oceans,
drowning many low-lying regions

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:23.114 align:middle line:90%
very quickly.

00:25:23.114 --> 00:25:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
a memory of that.

00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:25.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huge imprints.

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:26.110 align:middle line:90%
It could be.

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:26.480 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Absolutely.

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:27.354 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It could be.

00:25:27.354 --> 00:25:29.120 align:middle line:84%
How about the tip,
though, to Noah?

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.620 align:middle line:90%
Who tipped him off?

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:35.930 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Well, I think that
if we think of the astronomer

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:39.360 align:middle line:84%
priests and the shamans
involved with Gobekli Tepe

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:45.080 align:middle line:84%
and see how advanced
they were in 9500 BC,

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:49.490 align:middle line:84%
we have to accept that there
were similar astronomer priests

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:54.770 align:middle line:84%
and shamans existing
when the cataclysm began.

00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:58.670 align:middle line:84%
And I suspect that they would
have had some kind of awareness

00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:00.510 align:middle line:90%
of what was going on.

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:03.830 align:middle line:84%
They would have known that when
a comet appeared in the sky

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:07.430 align:middle line:84%
and it started to break up, they
had a certain amount of time

00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:11.000 align:middle line:84%
to get out, or to go
in caves, or to move

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.344 align:middle line:90%
to higher ground, or something.

00:26:12.344 --> 00:26:14.135 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They could
see the tail coming in,

00:26:14.135 --> 00:26:14.900 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:15.140 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yeah.

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:16.810 align:middle line:90%
I think this is what happened.

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's the
legacy of that that ends up

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:23.790 align:middle line:84%
being behind the power
elite at Gobekli Tepe,

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:29.480 align:middle line:84%
and that these shamans, these
priests, that come in and take

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:32.120 align:middle line:84%
over the show in
Southeast Turkey,

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:36.050 align:middle line:84%
have not just this
memory of the cataclysm,

00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:39.320 align:middle line:84%
but they're able to tell
the local population,

look, we told you
and your forebears

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:46.610 align:middle line:84%
that the cataclysm was
coming in the past.

00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:50.340 align:middle line:84%
We will make sure that it
will never happen again.

erosion on the Sphinx that so

beginning to say indeed

00:26:56.090 --> 00:27:00.036 align:middle line:84%

to do with this flood.

known life, the Sphinx

has been buried up
to its neck in sand.

Despite this protection
from the elements,

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:15.450 align:middle line:10%
the body of the Sphinx
is deeply eroded.

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:18.470 align:middle line:10%
Although it's been dug out
and repaired many times,

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:21.190 align:middle line:10%
nothing's ever been found to
tell us who built the Sphinx,

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:21.990 align:middle line:10%
or when.

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:26.210 align:middle line:90%


00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:28.160 align:middle line:10%
This is John
Anthony West, author

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.680 align:middle line:10%
and independent Egyptologist.

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:33.450 align:middle line:10%
While researching the work of
French mathematician Schwaller

00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:36.050 align:middle line:10%
de Lubicz, he made
a chance discovery

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:38.740 align:middle line:10%
that would change his life.

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:40.760 align:middle line:10%
Schwaller made the
simple observation

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:43.540 align:middle line:10%
that the Sphinx had been
eroded by water, not

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:47.750 align:middle line:10%
by wind and sand, as
traditionally believed.

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:51.290 align:middle line:10%
These are two very
different types of erosion.

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:54.800 align:middle line:90%
Water in the Sahara Desert?

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:57.170 align:middle line:84%
There's been no significant
rainfall in the Sahara

00:27:57.170 --> 00:27:59.420 align:middle line:90%
for 9,000 to 10,000 years.

happened dramatically

00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:04.160 align:middle line:90%
during that time period.

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.870 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Absolutely.

00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:09.800 align:middle line:84%
Which obviously brings us
into the role of the Sphinx

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:13.020 align:middle line:84%
and the pyramids and
this great mystery.

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
there is evidence

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:19.820 align:middle line:84%
that the Sphinx, and certainly
the rock from which it was

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:23.970 align:middle line:84%
constructed, was around at
the time of this cataclysm,

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:28.610 align:middle line:84%
and that yes, it would have seen
these very violent changes that

00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:34.370 align:middle line:84%
were going on, right
the way down to 9600 BC.

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:36.980 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there
is much evidence

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:40.100 align:middle line:84%
to suggest that the
Sphinx is older than what

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:41.277 align:middle line:90%
the archaeologists tell us.

00:28:41.277 --> 00:28:42.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Much older.

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:46.730 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: They say around
2500 BC, and that it represents

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:51.320 align:middle line:84%
the faces of one of the
pharaohs that built the three

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:54.230 align:middle line:90%
pyramids on the Giza Plateau.

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:57.380 align:middle line:84%
But most likely is
that the original face

00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:58.770 align:middle line:90%
was that of a lion.

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:01.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mm-hmm, and
they carved it off.

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:05.400 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: And that this
was perhaps even built

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:10.970 align:middle line:90%
as a memory of this cataclysm.

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:16.750 align:middle line:84%
The symbol of the
lion is one of terror

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:21.770 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, not destruction,
but of a fierce nature.

00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:26.120 align:middle line:84%
And we have to be aware
that in astronomical terms,

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:29.720 align:middle line:84%
this cataclysm took
place in the Age of Leo,

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:33.740 align:middle line:84%
the age of the lion, due to
the fact that the stars of Leo

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:37.530 align:middle line:84%
rose at the time of the
equinox during this period.

00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And why did they choose the
lion for this particular age?

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:44.750 align:middle line:84%
Could it be because that was
the symbol of this destruction,

00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:47.690 align:middle line:84%
symbol of this rain
of fire that was said

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:49.440 align:middle line:90%
to have come out of the sky?

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.240 align:middle line:90%
And indeed--

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's all
tied in together.

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:51.860 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yeah.

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:56.860 align:middle line:84%
There is a female goddess
in Egypt called Sekhmet.

00:29:56.860 --> 00:30:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And she is this fierce
lioness that throws fire down

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:09.100 align:middle line:84%
on humanity in the old legends
because Ra, the sun god,

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:14.120 align:middle line:84%
became tired of the chatter
of the humans down on Earth.

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:17.300 align:middle line:84%
And he gets this goddess,
this lion-headed goddess,

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:22.490 align:middle line:84%
to throw down this fire and
almost destroys the human race.

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:24.680 align:middle line:84%
So I think that the
tradition of the Sphinx

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:27.050 align:middle line:84%
is somehow linked
with this story.

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:28.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
blame it on god, right?

00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:30.327 align:middle line:90%
A very unhappy god.

00:30:30.327 --> 00:30:31.910 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: They blame
it on an unhappy

00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:34.640 align:middle line:90%
god, who was Ra, the sun god.

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk about
what happened, though.

00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:37.910 align:middle line:90%
Where did they go?

Where are the Watchers?

Where's the Nephilim?

00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:41.570 align:middle line:90%
Where are the giants?

00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:43.010 align:middle line:90%
Where are they?

00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:48.110 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Well, we have to try
and put this into a perspective

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:51.300 align:middle line:84%
to do with our own
human evolution.

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:56.180 align:middle line:84%
We have to take it in many ways
out of its biblical context,

00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:59.020 align:middle line:84%
because if all of
these stories do relate

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:01.670 align:middle line:84%
to the foundations
of civilization,

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:05.450 align:middle line:84%
it occurred somewhere in the
area of Gobekli Tepe, which

00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:08.300 align:middle line:84%

the Near East in general,

about, let's say, 5000 BC.

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:20.330 align:middle line:84%
And by that time, if there were
people in these communities

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:21.980 align:middle line:90%
that looked different--

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:23.660 align:middle line:90%
maybe they were extremely tall.

00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:25.520 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
the description

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:27.920 align:middle line:84%
of the Watchers for a
moment, because one account

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:29.780 align:middle line:90%
is very interesting.

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:35.240 align:middle line:84%
It said that they had
faces like vipers,

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:38.030 align:middle line:90%
and they had very piercing eyes.

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:39.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like snakes.

00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:40.490 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yeah.

00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:43.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, what type of
person would have

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:45.650 align:middle line:90%
a head or face like a snake?

00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:46.722 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: An ugly person.

00:31:46.722 --> 00:31:47.680 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Well, maybe.

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:52.640 align:middle line:84%
But also somebody with an
extremely long head and jaws

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.367 align:middle line:90%
that were extremely long.

00:31:54.367 --> 00:31:55.825 align:middle line:84%
And there are
certain populations--

00:31:55.825 --> 00:31:56.699 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A long neck.

00:31:56.699 --> 00:31:59.730 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: --around the world
that have this type of head.

00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:01.105 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, you
only have to look

00:32:01.105 --> 00:32:05.170 align:middle line:84%
at a lot of these long-headed
individuals, the skulls that

00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:08.320 align:middle line:84%
are found in places
like Peru and Mexico

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:11.720 align:middle line:84%
and in the Middle
East as well, that you

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:14.270 align:middle line:84%
could construe these
people as having

00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:16.640 align:middle line:90%
a serpent-like appearance.

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And we can make
this link directly

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:24.530 align:middle line:84%
through the Maya of the
Yucatan, because there's

00:32:24.530 --> 00:32:28.790 align:middle line:84%
a certain priesthood
known as the Chan, which

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:34.820 align:middle line:84%
means the serpent or snakes,
who would deliberately deform

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:37.670 align:middle line:84%
the heads of the
babies that would

00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:42.029 align:middle line:84%
be born so that they looked
like their founder Itzamna.

00:32:42.029 --> 00:32:43.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They
elongated them, really.

00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:44.485 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yeah.

00:32:44.485 --> 00:32:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And their founder,
Itzamna, which

00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:49.970 align:middle line:84%
means basically the snake, or
he was the snake or serpent.

00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:54.230 align:middle line:84%
So we know that the elongation
of the head is somehow linked

00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:57.080 align:middle line:84%
or equals snake-like
in appearance.

00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:01.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could these
be reptilian ETs?

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:03.630 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: In my
opinion, probably

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:07.400 align:middle line:84%
I think that we have to look
for a more earthly explanation.

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And one of the pieces of
evidence for the reptilian

00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:14.640 align:middle line:84%
explanation comes from
these weird figurines

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:19.530 align:middle line:84%
that have been found in
graves in Iraq, placed there

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:22.900 align:middle line:84%
by a culture known
as the Ubaid people.

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:25.220 align:middle line:84%
They date to about
5000, 5500 BC.

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:26.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
do they look like?

00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:29.490 align:middle line:10%
>>COLLINS: And they
have these long lizard

00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:34.710 align:middle line:10%
or snake-like heads, extended
with these tufts of hair.

00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And some of them even
are shown holding babies.

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:42.420 align:middle line:84%
Others have these
emblems of office.

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And they'll be found in the
graves of various individuals

00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:45.930 align:middle line:90%
from this period.

00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:46.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Small figurines?

00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:48.280 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Yeah, they're
small figurines like this.

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:50.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's a few of them on
display in the British Museum,

00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:50.430 align:middle line:90%
for instance.

00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:52.138 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're made
out of what, stone?

00:33:52.138 --> 00:33:55.790 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: I think they
are made of baked clay.

00:33:55.790 --> 00:33:56.910 align:middle line:90%
But there's loads of them.

00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:58.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some of
them are just heads,

00:33:58.650 --> 00:33:59.430 align:middle line:90%
and they are made of stone.

00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:00.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
all look the same?

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:02.149 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Very similar, yeah.

00:34:02.149 --> 00:34:04.980 align:middle line:84%
And even though some say
that they are lizard-headed,

00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:06.960 align:middle line:84%
almost certainly they
are snake-headed,

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:10.620 align:middle line:84%
and they are abstract form of
these long-headed individuals.

00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:13.739 align:middle line:84%
Because the Ubaid
people, their ancestors

00:34:13.739 --> 00:34:15.330 align:middle line:90%
were known as the Halaf.

00:34:15.330 --> 00:34:19.350 align:middle line:84%
Their ancestors were the
builders of Gobekli Tepe.

00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And within the Halaf, they
also elongated their heads,

00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:26.740 align:middle line:84%
just in the same way as the
Maya and the peoples from Peru.

00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:27.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:29.040 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: But
what's so interesting

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:32.130 align:middle line:84%
is that the heads that were
elongated were already long,

00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:38.070 align:middle line:84%
so they were just accentuating
a particularly long-headed skull

00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:39.310 align:middle line:90%
in the first place.

00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:43.080 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they were doing
this for some kind of status.

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:45.690 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we
look different to you.

00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:48.070 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, they were
the power elite.

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:50.880 align:middle line:84%
They were the descendants,
in my opinion,

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:52.860 align:middle line:90%
of the builders of Gobekli Tepe.

00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:55.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Theologians
would go crazy

00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:59.490 align:middle line:84%
over many interpretations
of the Bible,

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:01.770 align:middle line:84%
because in this
particular case, we

00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:03.710 align:middle line:84%
seem to be talking
about something

00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:08.850 align:middle line:84%
that's more earthbound,
as opposed to angelic.

00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:13.440 align:middle line:84%
They may be extraterrestrials
and, again, not angelic.

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:16.320 align:middle line:84%
So religious people
would go nuts

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:18.160 align:middle line:84%
thinking that you
don't believe in God,

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:19.320 align:middle line:90%
or you're taking that away.

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:20.620 align:middle line:90%
I don't think that's the case.

00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:24.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you have to negate
the belief of a higher power

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:26.580 align:middle line:90%
to believe this theory.

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:28.340 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: I agree.

00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:32.940 align:middle line:84%
And at the core of these stories
is this historical account.

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think any
theologian would deny that.

00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:38.040 align:middle line:84%
I think there would
be a lot of debate

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.140 align:middle line:90%
as to what it represented.

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:43.830 align:middle line:84%
But you cannot deny that
the angels, the Watchers,

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:46.710 align:middle line:84%
and the Nephilim were
flesh and blood in nature.

00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:49.620 align:middle line:84%
But of course, that's
not to take away the fact

00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:51.490 align:middle line:84%
that there are different
types of angels.

00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:53.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's the
angels that rescue us

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:55.680 align:middle line:90%
from cars after an accident.

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:59.580 align:middle line:84%
There's the angels that come to
us in our dreams and visions.

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:01.440 align:middle line:84%
There are the
angels that probably

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:04.260 align:middle line:90%
guard the throne of Heaven.

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:06.870 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a term that's
used for many different types

00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:08.790 align:middle line:84%
of being, and amongst
them are definitely

00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:11.970 align:middle line:90%
flesh and blood human beings.

00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:16.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: John Milton in his work
"Paradise Lost" kind of alluded

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:17.760 align:middle line:90%
to these fallen angels.

of the story of Adam and Eve.

00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:26.820 align:middle line:10%
God makes the world.

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:28.640 align:middle line:10%
He makes our first
parents, Adam and Eve,

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.750 align:middle line:10%
and he puts them in charge
of the Garden of Eden.

00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:32.166 align:middle line:10%
He tells them they
can do anything

00:36:32.166 --> 00:36:34.740 align:middle line:10%
apart from eat of the fruit
of the Tree of Knowledge.

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:37.950 align:middle line:10%
Satan, a fallen angel,
disguises himself as a serpent

00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:40.800 align:middle line:10%
and comes along and tempts
Eve to eat the apple.

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:43.050 align:middle line:10%
She then persuades
Adam to do so too.

00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:46.050 align:middle line:10%
God is angry and banishes
our first parents

00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:47.580 align:middle line:10%
from the Garden of Eden.

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:50.460 align:middle line:10%

trying to look into the
origins of the Garden of Eden,

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:11.330 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't see the story that's
given to us in the first pages

00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:13.160 align:middle line:90%
of the Book of Genesis.

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:18.050 align:middle line:84%
To me, Adam and Eve represent
the earliest population

00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:22.940 align:middle line:84%
of the Near East after the
time of this cataclysm.

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:26.180 align:middle line:84%
The serpent represents
one of the Watchers.

00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:29.630 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Book
of Enoch actually

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:33.275 align:middle line:84%
gives us the name of the
serpent in the Garden of Eden.

00:37:33.275 --> 00:37:35.420 align:middle line:84%
He actually names and
says, it was one of us,

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:38.480 align:middle line:90%
one of those fallen angels.

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
therefore we're talking

00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:44.120 align:middle line:84%
about some kind of
allegorical story

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:47.300 align:middle line:84%
here about the
Watchers giving us

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:51.440 align:middle line:84%
the rudiments of civilization,
and us maybe misusing it

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:55.040 align:middle line:84%
initially, or it being a
case of too much too soon, so

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:57.380 align:middle line:84%
that we're banished
from the Garden of Eden,

00:37:57.380 --> 00:38:03.260 align:middle line:84%
the Garden of Eden being the
area of Southeast Turkey, Iraq,

00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Northern Iraq,
Syria, parts of Iran.

00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:11.420 align:middle line:10%
Because it's said that where
the four rivers of paradise

00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:16.610 align:middle line:10%

probably Eastern Turkey

00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:44.090 align:middle line:84%
and were then brought,
probably by Abraham

00:38:44.090 --> 00:38:48.670 align:middle line:84%
who, as we mentioned, was born
right close to Gobekli Tepe,

00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:51.590 align:middle line:84%
probably within sight
of Gobekli Tepe,

00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:56.450 align:middle line:84%
he then takes these stories
south into what we know today

00:38:56.450 --> 00:38:58.277 align:middle line:90%
as Palestine and Israel.

00:38:58.277 --> 00:39:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's bring in another
element from the late Zecharia

00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:03.920 align:middle line:84%
Sitchin in his work "The
Earth Chronicles," where

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:07.190 align:middle line:84%
he talks about the Anunnaki that
came here from a planet called

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:11.330 align:middle line:84%
Nibiru and genetically altered
whatever creatures might have

00:39:11.330 --> 00:39:15.950 align:middle line:84%
been on the planet at the time,
hence the creation of the Adam

00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:17.020 align:middle line:90%
and the Eve.

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:18.830 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:39:18.830 --> 00:39:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: The Anunnaki, or
to give them their other name,

00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:23.000 align:middle line:90%
the Anunna--

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.630 align:middle line:84%
the Anunna is
based on two words.

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:31.600 align:middle line:84%
Anu-- which means heaven, it
can mean star, it can mean sky--

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:35.090 align:middle line:90%
and nunna, which means people.

00:39:35.090 --> 00:39:37.580 align:middle line:84%
So you're actually just talking
here about the sky people,

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:38.870 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:45.260 align:middle line:84%
It is said that two of their
number, Enlil and Enki,

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:48.830 align:middle line:84%
gave humanity the
rudiments of civilization.

00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:52.400 align:middle line:84%
One of them gave us the
first sheep, it's said.

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:54.620 align:middle line:84%
The other one gave
us the first grain.

00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:56.410 align:middle line:84%
This is the
Mesopotamian tradition,

00:39:56.410 --> 00:40:01.040 align:middle line:84%
amongst the Sumerians and the
Babylonians, the Acadians.

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And what's so interesting is
that this story, which is all

00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:09.230 align:middle line:84%
based around a place
called the Du-Ku mound,

00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:13.340 align:middle line:84%
which is where the Anunnaki
were said to have existed,

00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:16.670 align:middle line:84%
which was located on a
mountain called [? Karsak, ?]

00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:20.180 align:middle line:84%
which basically meant
the holy mountain,

00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:23.990 align:middle line:84%
has actually been associated
with Gobekli Tepe.

00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:28.430 align:middle line:10%
Professor Klaus Schmidt, who was
the discoverer of Gobekli Tepe,

00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:32.120 align:middle line:10%
actually came to the
conclusion that the Anunnaki

00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:35.390 align:middle line:10%
were the power elite behind the
construction of Gobekli Tepe.

00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:36.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:37.564 align:middle line:90%
How it all ties is--

00:40:37.564 --> 00:40:38.480 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Absolutely.

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:39.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --truly remarkable.

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:41.835 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: So, if that's
the case, then the Anunnaki,

00:40:41.835 --> 00:40:46.010 align:middle line:84%
or the Anunna, were also the
Watchers or the Nephilim.

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:47.085 align:middle line:90%
They are all the same.

00:40:47.085 --> 00:40:48.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They are all the same.

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:52.470 align:middle line:84%
In your opinion, were there
giants on this planet?

00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:54.270 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Absolutely.

00:40:54.270 --> 00:40:55.369 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Many?

00:40:55.369 --> 00:40:57.660 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: I think there was
a whole population of them

00:40:57.660 --> 00:40:58.380 align:middle line:90%
originally.

00:40:58.380 --> 00:40:59.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All over the planet?

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:00.947 align:middle line:84%
Or just this region
we're talking about?

00:41:00.947 --> 00:41:01.863 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yeah, yeah.

00:41:01.863 --> 00:41:04.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have to go by
the evidence, of course.

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And the actual
remains that we've

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:09.990 align:middle line:84%
got so far come from
Southern Siberia, very, very

00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:14.460 align:middle line:84%
interesting place, which
I'm investigating right now.

00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And we find evidence of
their DNA right the way

00:41:18.610 --> 00:41:21.850 align:middle line:84%
across Eastern Asia, but
also in North America,

00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:23.670 align:middle line:84%
in Central America,
and in South America.

00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:26.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are we them?

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:31.630 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Well, today we can go
to these websites where you can

00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:32.620 align:middle line:90%
send your--

00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:34.522 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: DNA? ancestry.com
is one of them.

00:41:34.522 --> 00:41:35.980 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: And it
comes back to us.

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And we can actually find out
whether there's any Denisovan

00:41:39.070 --> 00:41:41.556 align:middle line:90%
or any Neanderthal within us.

00:41:41.556 --> 00:41:43.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, will it say
you're part of the Nephilim?

00:41:43.930 --> 00:41:44.730 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: Yeah.

00:41:44.730 --> 00:41:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think that if
you find out that you

00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:50.020 align:middle line:84%
have some Denisovan,
you can say, yeah,

00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:54.660 align:middle line:84%
I am descended from the
giants or the Nephilim of old.

00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:57.190 align:middle line:84%
If you're descended
from the Neanderthals,

00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:59.980 align:middle line:84%
then I think that you
were the ones that

00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:03.070 align:middle line:84%
gave us some of the
earliest evidence

00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:04.585 align:middle line:90%
of advanced human activity.

00:42:04.585 --> 00:42:06.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's
exciting, isn't it?

00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:08.320 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: It's absolutely
a very exciting time.

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:12.061 align:middle line:84%
I mean, DNA evidence is
changing everything at this time

00:42:12.061 --> 00:42:13.060 align:middle line:90%
to do with anthropology.

00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:14.726 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What keeps
driving you, Andrew?

00:42:14.726 --> 00:42:15.580 align:middle line:90%
You specifically.

00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:17.163 align:middle line:10%
>>COLLINS: I want
to know the answers.

00:42:17.163 --> 00:42:18.910 align:middle line:10%
I mean, you know,
there are so many

00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:21.670 align:middle line:10%
mysteries still to be solved.

00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:26.680 align:middle line:10%
And I just want to be
able to go to these places

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:29.980 align:middle line:10%
to speak to the archeology,
speak to local people,

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:35.220 align:middle line:10%
get the inside story from
them, to be able to confirm

00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:37.300 align:middle line:10%
our true origins in this world.

00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:40.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I love how some of
these stories are passed down.

00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:45.155 align:middle line:84%
Others have, as we talked about
earlier, just simply vanished.

00:42:45.155 --> 00:42:48.820 align:middle line:84%
>>COLLINS: Well, as I said,
it's to do with civilizations.

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:51.610 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we're just
dealing with one civilization.

00:42:51.610 --> 00:42:53.350 align:middle line:90%
We're dealing with many.

00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And they open up like flowers
at one part of the world,

00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:02.200 align:middle line:84%
and then they will close again,
maybe a few thousand years

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:04.180 align:middle line:84%
later, perhaps to
do with a cataclysm

00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:07.480 align:middle line:84%
or some environmental
disaster or something.

00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And then another one will open
in another part of the world.

00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
even though there's

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:16.630 align:middle line:84%
a certain amount of
cross-cultural contact,

00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:20.330 align:middle line:84%
that a lot is lost,
and that it may well

00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:25.030 align:middle line:84%
be that in Paleolithic times,
maybe 15, 20, 30,000 years ago,

00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:28.930 align:middle line:84%
even longer ago, we had certain
things which we are only

00:43:28.930 --> 00:43:30.497 align:middle line:90%
rediscovering today.

00:43:30.497 --> 00:43:31.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:43:31.330 --> 00:43:32.770 align:middle line:84%
Andrew, thanks for
being on the program.

00:43:32.770 --> 00:43:33.640 align:middle line:90%
>>COLLINS: It's my pleasure.

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:36.056 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We call this show
"Beyond Belief," because that's

00:43:36.056 --> 00:43:38.170 align:middle line:90%
exactly what is happening here.

00:43:38.170 --> 00:43:41.440 align:middle line:84%
Stories that you've heard
are simply beyond belief.

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:44.830 align:middle line:84%
The stories of fallen
angels, of the Nephilim,

00:43:44.830 --> 00:43:47.740 align:middle line:84%
that you read in the New
Testament and the Old Testament

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:50.620 align:middle line:84%
and in the Bible,
could be significantly

00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:52.820 align:middle line:84%
different from what
really happened.

00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:56.500 align:middle line:10%
So when you look at researchers
like Andrew Collins, who simply

00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:59.980 align:middle line:10%
say, oh, no no, there's
something else that's happened

00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:02.260 align:middle line:10%
and I'm going to
get the answers,

00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:04.990 align:middle line:10%
just keep watching
programs like ours,

00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:07.300 align:middle line:10%
and maybe we'll get
you that answer.

00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:08.890 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for watching.
