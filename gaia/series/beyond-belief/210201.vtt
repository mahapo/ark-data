>>MATTHEW LACROIX:
Really, we have

00:00:16.467 --> 00:00:17.960 align:middle line:84%
a story that at
least goes back 20,

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.210 align:middle line:90%
perhaps over 50,000 years ago.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.010 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Wow.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.427 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: We're
actually focusing

00:00:22.427 --> 00:00:23.600 align:middle line:90%
on specific civilizations.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.580 align:middle line:84%
We even go into ice
cores, really try

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.122 align:middle line:84%
to recreate what the atmosphere
and the climate was like back

00:00:28.122 --> 00:00:28.922 align:middle line:90%
then.

00:00:28.922 --> 00:00:31.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How do you find it
with ancient civilizations?

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:32.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: The
Sumerians, Akkadians,

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.198 align:middle line:84%
and Babylonians who
realized that cuneiform

00:00:35.198 --> 00:00:36.740 align:middle line:84%
was the only way
that something could

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.640 align:middle line:90%
survive more than 1,000 years.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.080 align:middle line:84%
So it's an open-minded show,
but it's largely evidence-driven

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.610 align:middle line:90%
as much as it possibly can be.

things continue

to happen for you and "Beyond

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.260 align:middle line:84%
You've got a program called
"Ancient Civilizations."

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.858 align:middle line:84%
You're just picked up for
another season, aren't you?

00:01:11.858 --> 00:01:14.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Yeah, we've been
working on a lot of things.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.078 align:middle line:10%
Some of the projects at Gaia
have been really exciting.

00:01:17.078 --> 00:01:19.370 align:middle line:10%
The direction we're taking
with "Ancient Civilizations"

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.440 align:middle line:10%
and other shows,
to be part of that

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.680 align:middle line:10%
and do something that really
changes people's perspective

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.057 align:middle line:10%
is a really exciting thing.

00:01:26.057 --> 00:01:28.640 align:middle line:10%
And I love that my work can be
incorporated into that, as well

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.750 align:middle line:10%
as being on the show itself.

really excited for all

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.420 align:middle line:84%

by like that, don't they?

00:01:43.302 --> 00:01:45.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How did you get
involved in your interest

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.123 align:middle line:90%
in ancient civilizations?

00:01:47.123 --> 00:01:49.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well, it
certainly wasn't something

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.270 align:middle line:90%
that I had planned for.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.900 align:middle line:84%
I was just a very
inquisitive person.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And I remember just going
along the inquisitive road

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.440 align:middle line:84%
of being curious about so
many things in the world.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And when I started
to really look

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.290 align:middle line:84%
into some of these
researchers, like

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.180 align:middle line:84%
Graham Hancock and
Randall Carlson

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.370 align:middle line:84%
and Robert Bauval
and Robert Schoch.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.889 align:middle line:84%
You start to see
some of the research

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:11.630 align:middle line:84%
that they're
providing, which really

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:12.950 align:middle line:90%
challenges the narrative.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And instead of being
something that, perhaps,

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.680 align:middle line:84%
makes you less
interested in history,

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.690 align:middle line:84%
it excites you more
because of, really,

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.610 align:middle line:84%
this hidden truth,
you could call it,

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.250 align:middle line:84%
that seems to exist that
is not being recognized.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: In "Ancient
Civilizations"

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.610 align:middle line:90%
what is your approach?

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Our approach
now, we are completely

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.170 align:middle line:84%
revitalizing and rechanging
"Ancient Civilizations"

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.570 align:middle line:84%
into a show that is
going to be the finest

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.320 align:middle line:84%
example of an evidence-driven
show with a high production

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.780 align:middle line:84%
value and a lot of
very important speakers

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.870 align:middle line:84%
that then looks at these
topics with the most

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.730 align:middle line:84%
amount of evidence
possible around the world

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.310 align:middle line:84%
to try to recreate
this lost story,

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.440 align:middle line:84%
recreate our story from
how far back it goes

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.430 align:middle line:84%
and how sophisticated it is
but bring it to this level

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.370 align:middle line:84%
where it's from a
scholarly academic level.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How far
back does it go?

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well, that's
a difficult question

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.170 align:middle line:84%
to answer because
we're really looking

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.150 align:middle line:84%
at the evidence from
the ancient Sumerians

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.480 align:middle line:84%
or looking at the
ancient Egyptian cultures

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.130 align:middle line:90%
or the ancient Hindu cultures.

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.640 align:middle line:84%
Really, we have a story that
at least goes back 20, perhaps,

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.350 align:middle line:90%
over 50,000 years ago.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.550 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Wow.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:20.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: And we're
not talking about--

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.870 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That far back?

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well, we're not
talking about nomadic hunter

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.260 align:middle line:90%
gatherers.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.480 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about when
civilization emerged.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.213 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Sophisticated
civilizations.

00:03:28.213 --> 00:03:29.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Yeah,
exactly, exactly.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Which is phenomenal.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.600 align:middle line:84%
What kind of technology do you
think they had that far back?

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well, it may not
be necessarily a question

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.910 align:middle line:84%
of the types of technology
because it may be more

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.070 align:middle line:84%
about a deep
understanding of nature

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.458 align:middle line:84%
and about the laws of
physics and reality

00:03:45.458 --> 00:03:47.750 align:middle line:84%
because, when we look at some
of these great structures

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.640 align:middle line:84%
like the Great Pyramid
of Giza, 2 and 1/2

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.690 align:middle line:84%
million megalithic blocks, an
average of 10 to 15 tons each,

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.000 align:middle line:84%
we look at that,
and if you actually

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.950 align:middle line:84%
try to consider how
if they were to lay

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.190 align:middle line:84%
each block with sheer
manpower, to try

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.200 align:middle line:84%
to do that over the course of
the time period we're given,

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.622 align:middle line:90%
it seems completely impossible.

00:04:05.622 --> 00:04:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at other
megalithic structures

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.205 align:middle line:84%
around the world, it seems that
there's something else going on

00:04:10.205 --> 00:04:12.680 align:middle line:84%
besides technology, maybe
more of an understanding

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.760 align:middle line:84%
of harmonics and
frequency related to some

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.079 align:middle line:90%
of these ancient structures.

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.621 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What are
some of the things

00:04:19.621 --> 00:04:22.320 align:middle line:84%
you get involved with in the
new season in terms of topics?

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: One of the
big directional changes

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.800 align:middle line:84%
of "Ancient Civilizations" that
we've done going from seasons 1

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.160 align:middle line:84%
through 3, going into season
4 now and then into season 5

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.520 align:middle line:84%
and beyond is now, instead of
looking at concepts and core

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.310 align:middle line:84%
ideas from around the
world about civilizations,

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.770 align:middle line:84%
we're actually focusing
on specific civilizations.

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.480 align:middle line:84%
So for instance,
looking at, well,

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.270 align:middle line:84%
when did the first original
Egyptian civilizations

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.370 align:middle line:84%
that built the
pyramids, when did they

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:47.870 align:middle line:90%
come around in history?

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.752 align:middle line:84%
And when did they get
their start, and how

00:04:49.752 --> 00:04:50.960 align:middle line:90%
did they get their knowledge?

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And then looking at
places like Easter Island

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.930 align:middle line:84%
with the ancient Moai heads and
how far down under the ground

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.540 align:middle line:84%
they go and how they're part
of a civilization that greatly

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.698 align:middle line:84%
predates the Rapa Nui, all
the way to places like Japan,

00:05:02.698 --> 00:05:04.490 align:middle line:84%
which really hasn't
been talked about a lot

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.820 align:middle line:84%
with their megaliths, and
Machu Picchu, and Tiwanaku,

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.430 align:middle line:84%
and the underwater cities
like Dwarka, India.

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.220 align:middle line:84%
We're really taking this
to a new direction where

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.950 align:middle line:84%
we're specifically looking
at civilizations that

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.960 align:middle line:84%
existed before the Younger
Dryas catastrophes of 12,000

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:19.760 align:middle line:90%
years ago.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.020 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That's exciting.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.270 align:middle line:84%
Do you get into the how
were the pyramids built?

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: We do.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.910 align:middle line:84%
We talk a lot about some of the
knowledge and some of the ways

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.790 align:middle line:84%
in which those structures
were put together and really

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.300 align:middle line:84%
go into, well, how old are they,
if we look at star alignments

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.550 align:middle line:84%
and considering the
procession of the equinox?

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.850 align:middle line:84%
We have to try to consider that
these dates that we're told

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.280 align:middle line:84%
and this time frame
is completely wrong.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And we have to
start over and try

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.100 align:middle line:84%
to listen to what the
evidence says to recreate

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.020 align:middle line:90%
the story of our story.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: There was a chap by
the name of Edward Leedskalnin,

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:57.730 align:middle line:84%
who was from Latvia, who
came to the United States

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.000 align:middle line:84%
and built something that
still mystifies everybody.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.330 align:middle line:90%
We call it Coral Castle.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:03.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Yep.

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:09.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: This frail man, small,
moved blocks almost the size

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.670 align:middle line:84%
of the pyramids to
build Coral Castle.

How in the world did he do that?

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:15.860 align:middle line:90%
And you look at him, don't you?

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: It's an
interesting story, and people

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.280 align:middle line:84%
that describe catching him
in the middle of his building

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.290 align:middle line:84%
state, that he did
it all alone, and he

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.990 align:middle line:84%
would do it when no one
was around, often at night.

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:30.580 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, he would
take these massive blocks

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.740 align:middle line:84%
and he would build them
up to create Coral Castle.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: And move them.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: But he
states that he learned

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:38.020 align:middle line:84%
the secrets of the
pyramid builders of Giza,

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.900 align:middle line:84%
and essentially, he
understood the same things

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.580 align:middle line:84%
that they did, which
I think gets back

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.180 align:middle line:84%
into looking at the type of
work that Nikola Tesla did.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.790 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at sound and
frequency and vibration.

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:49.930 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: And magnetism.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Right, that
seems to be the core of this

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.500 align:middle line:90%
rather than sheer manpower.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: He was a staunch
believer in magnetism,

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:57.710 align:middle line:90%
even wrote a small book on that.

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:58.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Yeah, exactly.

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:03.310 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I wonder if he
somehow magnetized the blocks

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.762 align:middle line:84%
and repelled them and just
floated them into place.

00:07:06.762 --> 00:07:08.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well, that's
one of the things

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.560 align:middle line:84%
that it comes into place
because, if our planet is based

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.160 align:middle line:84%
on this electromagnetism of the
entire North and South Pole,

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.350 align:middle line:84%
with these energy
centers, if you knew,

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.430 align:middle line:84%
just like Nikola
Tesla talked about,

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:22.390 align:middle line:84%
if you knew how to tap into that
free energy and understanding

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:24.760 align:middle line:84%
magnetism, you can
essentially do things that we

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.200 align:middle line:90%
think are impossible today.

appear to have been mastered
long before humanity

It's not fixed.

incredibly excited.

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:05.480 align:middle line:84%
We put so much work into
this to try to do something

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.960 align:middle line:84%
that no one's ever done before
to the level of really bringing

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:12.680 align:middle line:84%

was like back then to
try to understand, well,

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.100 align:middle line:84%
if a disaster did occur,
what is the science

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:38.660 align:middle line:84%
that that's based on to try
to understand, well, how does

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.130 align:middle line:90%
all this fit into our story?

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:42.335 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What are
prediluvian civilizations?

00:10:42.335 --> 00:10:44.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: That's a really
important thing to understand.

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:46.940 align:middle line:84%
There's other terms
that have been used.

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:49.970 align:middle line:84%
They essentially mean the
same thing, antediluvian,

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:51.860 align:middle line:90%
prediluvian, preflood.

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, that
time period has

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:56.900 align:middle line:84%
been identified geologically
and through climatology

00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:00.050 align:middle line:84%
as being before these
events of the Younger Dryas.

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:02.840 align:middle line:84%
The Younger Dryas is
called that because it's

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.450 align:middle line:84%
a very disruptive time
period in history that

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:10.340 align:middle line:84%
came between around 10,800
years ago and 13,000 years ago.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:13.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's this time period
of several thousand years

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:17.420 align:middle line:84%
that essentially has these
incredibly disastrous events

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:18.680 align:middle line:90%
that occurred on the Earth.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
think of as the flood

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:23.720 align:middle line:84%
because, ultimately, the
totality of those events--

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.020 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: The Noah flood.

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:24.590 align:middle line:90%
The Noah flood?

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:26.757 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Exactly, ultimately,
the totality of that

00:11:26.757 --> 00:11:28.250 align:middle line:84%
was that there was
a massive flood.

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:31.700 align:middle line:84%
I think that was mostly
based on tsunamis worldwide.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.760 align:middle line:84%
But either way, what that
means is prediluvian or any

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:38.990 align:middle line:84%
of the civilizations that
existed before that event.

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: There's no question
that the Bible has spelled out

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.990 align:middle line:84%
a lot of strange things that
happened on this planet.

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:48.500 align:middle line:84%
But as you have pointed out,
there's no other history.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.870 align:middle line:84%
There's no other
record of things

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:53.270 align:middle line:84%
that we had where the
knowledge is lost.

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:56.390 align:middle line:84%
What happened to the
plans for the pyramids?

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:58.490 align:middle line:84%
Surely they had to
be able to construct

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:01.970 align:middle line:84%
them architecturally with
sketches or something

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:03.470 align:middle line:90%
on papyrus.

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:04.462 align:middle line:90%
Where are they?

00:12:04.462 --> 00:12:06.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well, that's actually
a very good point to make.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:10.550 align:middle line:84%
When we look at papyrus and
we look at paper records, what

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:13.280 align:middle line:84%
we find is that paper
specifically can only

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.425 align:middle line:90%
last 500 to 1,000 years.

00:12:15.425 --> 00:12:16.550 align:middle line:90%
And when we look at these--

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:16.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And then
it disintegrates.

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:18.023 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Right, exactly.

00:12:18.023 --> 00:12:20.180 align:middle line:84%
So how do you have a
message be protected

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:21.590 align:middle line:90%
that can actually survive?

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And that really comes down to
the ingenuity of the Sumerians,

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Akkadians, and
Babylonians who realized

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:31.370 align:middle line:84%
that cuneiform, etching
into stone or clay

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:33.218 align:middle line:84%
and then baking that
clay into tablets,

00:12:33.218 --> 00:12:34.760 align:middle line:84%
was the only way
that something could

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.650 align:middle line:90%
survive more than 1,000 years.

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's why,
because the Egyptians relied

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:44.632 align:middle line:84%
so heavily on papyrus and paper
records and some hieroglyphs.

00:12:44.632 --> 00:12:46.340 align:middle line:84%
Although, I think
hieroglyphs were mainly

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:48.600 align:middle line:84%
done by the later
dynastic pharaohs.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.400 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Right.

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:50.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: And I
think that's one

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:52.490 align:middle line:84%
of the reasons why some of
that information has been lost.

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:54.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And don't forget
the Dead Sea Scrolls.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: That's
right, and that's--

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:56.570 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Clay tablets, right?

00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:57.737 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: But that's paper.

00:12:57.737 --> 00:12:59.090 align:middle line:90%
The Dead Sea Scrolls is paper.

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And thankfully, it
was put in these caves

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:04.770 align:middle line:84%
above the Dead Sea, which
was a very, very dry climate.

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:06.440 align:middle line:84%
So it enables
something like that

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.440 align:middle line:84%
to survive longer than
perhaps other places.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.150 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How far
back do you go?

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:15.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well, if we were to
look at things like the Brosius

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.940 align:middle line:84%
King List that
came out of Babylon

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.670 align:middle line:84%
and then compare it with the
Uruk List of Kings and Sages

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:22.850 align:middle line:84%
and the Sumerian King List,
if we take those three

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:26.960 align:middle line:84%
and we try to combine them
with the ancient pyramid king

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.690 align:middle line:84%
list that came out
of the Giza Plateau,

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:33.110 align:middle line:84%
we get dates that bring us
well over 50,000 years old.

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:35.360 align:middle line:84%
Some of them really
point us to something

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:38.150 align:middle line:84%
more like 200,000 years
old, which is totally

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:39.685 align:middle line:90%
beyond our comprehension today.

00:13:39.685 --> 00:13:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That is amazing.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:41.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: But it
really shows us

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.910 align:middle line:84%
that, if we were to look
at our civilization that

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:47.000 align:middle line:84%
has risen largely just
within 1,000 years,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.130 align:middle line:84%
if you really look at it,
over the course of all

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:51.230 align:middle line:84%
the technological
advancements and things

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:53.990 align:middle line:84%
that have happened since the
Middle Ages and everything,

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:57.740 align:middle line:84%
really, if we look at something
that's over 100,000 years old,

00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:01.550 align:middle line:84%
it almost is beyond our
capability to understand.

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:04.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And this
history has been lost.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:05.510 align:middle line:90%
How do we find it?

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:08.413 align:middle line:84%
How do you find it with
"Ancient Civilizations?"

00:14:08.413 --> 00:14:09.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: The
first thing we have

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:14.120 align:middle line:84%
to do is we have to shed this
preconditioned notion we get

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.520 align:middle line:84%
from doctrines we're
taught in school, this idea

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:20.150 align:middle line:84%
that civilization is only
come from a 6,000 year window

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:23.120 align:middle line:84%
and that everything before
was nomadic hunter gatherers

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:23.990 align:middle line:90%
and was primitive.

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:27.110 align:middle line:84%
We need to totally take that
and throw it out and start over

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:29.870 align:middle line:84%
again and actually look at what
the evidence around the world

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:30.890 align:middle line:90%
is telling us.

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And what that evidence
from, whether or not

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:35.000 align:middle line:84%
it's looking at the
ancient Maya or down

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.430 align:middle line:84%
into the pre-Inca,
the Egyptians,

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:40.550 align:middle line:84%
the Sumerians, the
ancient Japanese,

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:42.770 align:middle line:84%
or throughout
Southeast Asia, what

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:45.570 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing from all these
civilizations is they say,

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:47.300 align:middle line:84%
look, there was a
civilization that

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:51.080 align:middle line:84%
came long before us that taught
us everything we know now.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And that civilization
disappeared.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And that goes so much
further back than we're told.

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:58.040 align:middle line:84%
So if we take
megalithic evidence

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.200 align:middle line:84%
and look at radiocarbon
dating that we're doing

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.750 align:middle line:84%
and we look at the
totality of all of this,

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:05.870 align:middle line:84%
we can put together a
timeline and understanding

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:08.510 align:middle line:84%
to be able to recreate a show
like "Ancient Civilizations"

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:11.667 align:middle line:84%
that actually tells this
story from the evidence

00:15:11.667 --> 00:15:14.000 align:middle line:84%
rather than just from these
doctrines we've been taught.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.522 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Do you touch
on ancient aliens, ETs?

00:15:17.522 --> 00:15:18.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: It's
obviously an area--

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:21.740 align:middle line:84%
if something like that-- if
we have evidence of influences

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:23.417 align:middle line:84%
that come from the
stars, of course,

00:15:23.417 --> 00:15:24.500 align:middle line:90%
we're going to discuss it.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.590 align:middle line:84%
But the focus here
is, does the evidence

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:29.070 align:middle line:90%
support that direction?

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:31.160 align:middle line:84%
And if it doesn't,
then we don't go there.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.500 align:middle line:84%
We have to be
open-minded to say what

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.680 align:middle line:84%
is the strongest evidence
telling us from what this says?

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:40.220 align:middle line:84%
So it's an open-minded show,
but it's largely evidence-driven

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:41.660 align:middle line:90%
as much as it possibly can be.

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:43.493 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You had
mentioned the Great Flood.

00:15:43.493 --> 00:15:46.940 align:middle line:84%
We seem to have stories
abound about that.

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:50.210 align:middle line:84%
I happen to think maybe an
asteroid hit the planet right

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:53.060 align:middle line:84%
in the ocean and created that
tsunami you just mentioned.

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:54.330 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:55.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well, that's a
really interesting thing,

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:58.040 align:middle line:84%
because if we were to look at
everyone from Robert Schoch,

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.990 align:middle line:84%
who's a geologist, all the way
to Graham Hancock and Randall

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:01.790 align:middle line:90%
Carlson--

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:02.870 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Great people.

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:05.282 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Great researchers,
great people, great minds.

00:16:05.282 --> 00:16:06.740 align:middle line:84%
If we were to look
at that, there's

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:09.180 align:middle line:84%
really these two camps
that come into play.

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:11.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, I had a great conversation
with Randall Carlson

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:13.890 align:middle line:84%
a little while ago where
we were discussing this.

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And he came out and he's, of
course, a trained geologist.

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And he came out
and he was saying,

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:20.570 align:middle line:90%
look, maybe both are right.

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:24.560 align:middle line:84%
Maybe what we're looking at is
this Younger Dryas catastrophe

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:26.780 align:middle line:84%
period, maybe both
things happened.

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And by both I mean we had
impacts from celestial impacts,

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:31.730 align:middle line:90%
large comets.

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:34.580 align:middle line:84%
But maybe we also had things
like coronal mass ejections.

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:36.590 align:middle line:84%
These mini supernovas
from the sun.

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:38.780 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it all comes
into play because

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:41.270 align:middle line:84%
of these disruptions to
our outer solar system

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:42.930 align:middle line:90%
and our star, the sun.

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:45.920 align:middle line:84%
So really, I think we need to
look at it as maybe the Younger

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.910 align:middle line:84%
Dryas was a combination of all
of these different disastrous

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:49.710 align:middle line:90%
events.

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:51.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Let's take a
glimpse of the new season

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.580 align:middle line:84%
of "Ancient Civilizations"
about the Great Flood.

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:54.380 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:16:54.380 --> 00:17:00.680 align:middle line:10%
- In the beginning, after
a great devastation,

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:04.430 align:middle line:10%
according to the
Sumerian texts, the gods

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:08.480 align:middle line:10%
came and manifested
humans again.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And this is a theme that
we see repeated many times

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:17.030 align:middle line:84%
in many cultures
all over the world

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:21.770 align:middle line:84%
that there was a
creation of humans.

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:29.810 align:middle line:84%
There was a massive flood,
and the Earth was repopulated.

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:35.480 align:middle line:84%
That's reflected in the
Babylonian texts and the Hebrew

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:38.450 align:middle line:90%
texts and the Egyptian texts.

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:43.340 align:middle line:84%
They all mention
something similar.

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:45.680 align:middle line:10%
- When you do a deep
survey into the myths

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.600 align:middle line:10%
from around the
world, you actually

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.430 align:middle line:10%
find that there were
two different flood

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:50.930 align:middle line:10%
narratives that happened.

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And so in the very
first flood narrative

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:58.280 align:middle line:84%
it talks about a dark
world or a beginning

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.320 align:middle line:90%
and the end of an age.

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:04.490 align:middle line:84%
And then there's this cataclysm,
and this flood occurs.

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:08.090 align:middle line:84%
And the individual
escapes the flood

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:11.810 align:middle line:84%
with the seven sages,
the seven Abigails.

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And then after that, it is the
beginning of this golden age

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:19.310 align:middle line:90%
and this new period of time.

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:24.170 align:middle line:84%
With the Noah flood, there's
civilization that is occurring.

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:26.690 align:middle line:84%
And the flood
happens because they

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:29.030 align:middle line:84%
are trying to wipe
out the wickedness

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:33.110 align:middle line:84%
from on the planet, like you
find in the biblical narrative.

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And Noah survives the
flood, and there's

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:41.338 align:middle line:84%
no mention of these seven
sages or seven Abigails.

00:18:41.338 --> 00:18:43.130 align:middle line:10%
- So in South America
we have the tradition

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:46.940 align:middle line:10%
of Viracocha, who is a builder
god that suddenly shows up

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:50.630 align:middle line:10%
mysteriously after a global
flood wiped everything out.

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:52.820 align:middle line:10%
And he appears in
specific locations

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:54.950 align:middle line:10%
with a group of
seven specialists.

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:58.910 align:middle line:10%
They're experts in their fields
because wherever civilization

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:01.430 align:middle line:10%
appears on the face of
the Earth after the flood

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:04.160 align:middle line:10%
and is always one
charismatic leader who

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:07.280 align:middle line:10%
leads seven crafts people,
experts in their field.

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.530 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:11.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Fascinating,
fascinating indeed.

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And who told Noah
to build that ark?

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:16.708 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: That story is
one of my favorites of all

00:19:16.708 --> 00:19:18.250 align:middle line:84%
because, really,
what the first thing

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:20.038 align:middle line:84%
we need to do is
go back and realize

00:19:20.038 --> 00:19:21.580 align:middle line:84%
that the Noah is
actually a term that

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:23.290 align:middle line:90%
was given as a biblical term.

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:26.170 align:middle line:84%
His real name in the
ancient Sumerian text

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:30.985 align:middle line:84%
and into, for instance, the
Atra-Hasis, we find out--

00:19:30.985 --> 00:19:32.860 align:middle line:84%
and in the Epic of
Gilgamesh-- we find out he

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:35.800 align:middle line:84%
had a couple of names in history
that he actually was called by.

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:40.690 align:middle line:84%
His name was Ut-napishtim,
or his name was Ziusudra.

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:42.160 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: I like Noah better.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well, but his
story is really quite amazing

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:49.870 align:middle line:84%
because he was actually the very
last of these prediluvian kings

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:51.790 align:middle line:84%
of one of these
original five cities

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:53.920 align:middle line:90%
of Sumer known as Shuruppak.

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And his father Ubara-tutu
was the last great king

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:59.880 align:middle line:84%
of that city, and he was going
to take the reins to rule over

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:00.680 align:middle line:90%
that city.

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:03.850 align:middle line:84%
He did briefly until this
great catastrophe occurred.

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:06.130 align:middle line:84%
And he was the one who
recorded, basically,

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:08.710 align:middle line:84%
mankind's entire
story because he

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:11.050 align:middle line:84%
had a very special
bloodline that connected

00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:12.610 align:middle line:90%
to some of these ancient kings.

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And he was told, through a
reed bed from his god Enki,

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:21.130 align:middle line:84%
basically, how to survive
this catastrophe so

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:23.020 align:middle line:84%
that his offspring
and his bloodlines

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:25.450 align:middle line:84%
could literally bring
and carry on humanity.

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:27.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I'm looking
forward to the new season.

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:28.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Me too.

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:30.340 align:middle line:84%
I think that it's really
going to help a lot of people

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:33.490 align:middle line:84%
piece together some of these
aspects of understanding what

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:37.270 align:middle line:84%
this real story is but really
coming from as much evidence

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:38.410 align:middle line:90%
as we possibly can.

00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:40.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What is
the Great Anunna?

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: The Great Anunna
was the original term

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:46.240 align:middle line:84%
of these celestial beings that
came here that basically taught

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:49.900 align:middle line:84%
civilization everything because,
when we think of metallurgy

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:53.260 align:middle line:84%
or animal husbandry or
mathematics or astronomy,

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:56.050 align:middle line:84%
every single one of those
things came from one

00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:57.640 align:middle line:90%
single point in history.

00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:00.310 align:middle line:84%
The Sumerians claim that
all of that knowledge,

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:01.990 align:middle line:84%
which is where we
trace it all back to--

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:02.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Absolutely.

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:04.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: --was
handed down to them

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:07.390 align:middle line:84%
through what was called kingship
in the knowledge of the gods.

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:09.970 align:middle line:84%
And their gods, these
celestial gods, not

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:13.780 align:middle line:84%
the forces of nature,
physical or nonphysical beings

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:16.390 align:middle line:84%
that literally communicated
and taught them,

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:17.932 align:middle line:90%
they were called the Anunna.

00:21:17.932 --> 00:21:20.140 align:middle line:84%
It meant from those who are
from heaven came to Earth

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:22.390 align:middle line:84%
or from beyond
basically came here.

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And they were called the Great
Anunna and later the Anunnaki

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:27.070 align:middle line:84%
to the Akkadian and
Babylonian cultures.

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:30.130 align:middle line:84%
But that was their sky
gods that they essentially

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:33.220 align:middle line:84%
state all of the
knowledge of civilization

00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:36.395 align:middle line:84%
came from, which is why all of a
sudden everything just took off

00:21:36.395 --> 00:21:38.770 align:middle line:84%
and we became something very
different than what we were.

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:39.978 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Something exploded.

00:21:39.978 --> 00:21:41.302 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Something happened.

00:21:41.302 --> 00:21:42.760 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How do
we know that there

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.830 align:middle line:90%
were lost civilizations, Matt?

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:46.750 align:middle line:84%
How do we know this
without evidence?

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:50.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well, if we were to
look at, say, this 6,000 year

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:53.165 align:middle line:84%
model that we're taught in
school, this doctrine, right,

00:21:53.165 --> 00:21:54.790 align:middle line:84%
if we were to look
at that for a second

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:57.940 align:middle line:84%
and try to consider what's known
as the Mohs hardness scale,

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:00.850 align:middle line:84%
it means that, if you have a
civilization that's identified,

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:04.120 align:middle line:84%
like we're told, as being
a Bronze Age civilization,

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:06.820 align:middle line:84%
right, using bronze
and copper tools,

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:09.760 align:middle line:84%
it means that, according
to the Mohs hardness scale,

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.340 align:middle line:84%
those tools have
a certain hardness

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:14.350 align:middle line:84%
that they have to
them, which means

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:17.620 align:middle line:84%
they can't manipulate something
that's harder than they are.

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:19.490 align:middle line:84%
You simply can't
do anything to it.

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And what we find is, if we
look at the telltale signs

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:24.550 align:middle line:84%
of these megalithic
civilizations

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:26.860 align:middle line:84%
around the world, that
means giant stones,

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:29.290 align:middle line:84%
and we look at how most of
them are composed of quartzite

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:32.590 align:middle line:84%
and granite, on the Mohs
hardness scale that's a 7

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:35.530 align:middle line:84%
or an 8, which means it's
too hard to be able to carve,

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:37.570 align:middle line:84%
meaning that it's from
a civilization that

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:41.710 align:middle line:84%
had tools and technology that
was far beyond the capability

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:43.600 align:middle line:90%
these civilizations were taught.

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
proves that they're

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:48.940 align:middle line:84%
part of a lost civilization
because their knowledge

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:51.280 align:middle line:84%
was more and more
lost over time and not

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.500 align:middle line:90%
gained like we're taught.

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:55.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I can tell you're so
excited about these subjects.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:55.660 align:middle line:90%
You really are.

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:57.070 align:middle line:90%
You're like a little kid again.

00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:58.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: I am.

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.190 align:middle line:84%
It's a very exciting
thing to talk about

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:03.010 align:middle line:84%
because the evidence is
all around the world.

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:05.020 align:middle line:10%
And when you know
what to look for

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:07.840 align:middle line:10%
and when you understand the
story from what they tell us,

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:11.920 align:middle line:10%
it invigorates you to a level
of understanding of reality

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:15.170 align:middle line:10%
and understanding the history
of who we are to a completely

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:15.970 align:middle line:10%
different place.

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:18.490 align:middle line:10%
And all of a sudden, your
world changes, and you

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:20.740 align:middle line:10%
see that, look, we come
from something that's

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:22.690 align:middle line:10%
far greater than we were told.

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:26.320 align:middle line:84%
We come from something that was
like a spark of consciousness,

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.630 align:middle line:84%
and spark of the
gods, that turned us

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:31.700 align:middle line:84%
into something that was truly
remarkable in the universe.

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And we have since
fallen to such a degree,

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.320 align:middle line:84%
that we've forgotten
who we were.

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And we have total amnesia of
who truly came through before us

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.470 align:middle line:90%
and who we were.

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:43.667 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Egypt and Atlantis,
is there a connection?

00:23:43.667 --> 00:23:44.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: There is.

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:46.333 align:middle line:84%
There's actually some
phenomenal connections

00:23:46.333 --> 00:23:47.560 align:middle line:90%
that people don't know of.

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And when you think
about the story of Plato

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:52.728 align:middle line:84%
and how he came up with
the Timaeus et Critias.

00:23:52.728 --> 00:23:54.520 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people say
that it was an allegory

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:55.750 align:middle line:90%
for the perfect civilization.

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:57.520 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't based
on anything real.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:00.160 align:middle line:84%
But if you actually look
at the evidence from that,

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:03.970 align:middle line:84%
you find out that Plato learned
about the story of Atlantis

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:07.490 align:middle line:84%
from Solon and these
temple priests of Egypt.

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:08.290 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:11.200 align:middle line:84%
This is where the two connect
because Solon traveled

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.990 align:middle line:84%
to Egypt, and he met
these temple priests

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:16.000 align:middle line:84%
of a temple that
used to exist called

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.950 align:middle line:90%
Sais, the Temple of Sais.

00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:18.760 align:middle line:90%
And they state--

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:20.468 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What do you
mean used to exist?

00:24:20.468 --> 00:24:23.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: It was destroyed
about 1,000 years later,

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:26.575 align:middle line:84%
and all the records that
were there were lost.

00:24:26.575 --> 00:24:27.700 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Who destroyed it?

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:29.075 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: We
don't actually know

00:24:29.075 --> 00:24:31.450 align:middle line:84%
because those records of
what happened to that temple

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:32.900 align:middle line:90%
disappeared to history.

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:34.960 align:middle line:84%
But what the temple
priests have say state

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.880 align:middle line:84%
is that they were
the ones who had

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:40.630 align:middle line:84%
recorded the history and
information of Atlantis before.

00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:44.295 align:middle line:84%
And they tell Solon that
you remember one disaster,

00:24:44.295 --> 00:24:46.420 align:middle line:84%
but there have been many
that have come before you.

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And they go into
detail about Atlantis,

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:50.020 align:middle line:84%
and they state that
they're the ones that

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:52.360 align:middle line:84%
had the knowledge
contained in the temple

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:53.380 align:middle line:90%
and within the priests.

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And when it died
with them, it only

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:59.087 align:middle line:84%
survived with Plato,
Solon, and Diodorus.

00:24:59.087 --> 00:25:00.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Matt, why
is it so important

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:03.443 align:middle line:90%
for us to understand the past?

00:25:03.443 --> 00:25:05.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Understanding the
past, there's a famous quote.

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:07.277 align:middle line:84%
"You can't understand
where you're

00:25:07.277 --> 00:25:09.800 align:middle line:84%
going unless you know
where you've come from."

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to look back to
understand how far we reached,

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:16.570 align:middle line:84%
the level we were to
have achieved consciously

00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:19.000 align:middle line:84%
and energetically and
realize that we've fallen.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And if we can't
understand where we were,

00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:24.070 align:middle line:84%
then we're not going to know
how to get back to that again.

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And that place that
we were once at

00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:29.590 align:middle line:84%
tells this incredible
story of civilizations

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:31.660 align:middle line:84%
that rose up to this
level of understanding

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:34.270 align:middle line:84%
the universe, the Earth,
harmonics and energy

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:37.630 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness to a way
where they literally became gods

00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:39.220 align:middle line:90%
like those that created them.

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And we have fallen so
far that we're simply

00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:43.480 align:middle line:84%
trying to put these
pieces together,

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.820 align:middle line:84%
and that's why that
story matters so much.

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:48.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Did we ever
find ancient maps?

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:49.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: We have.

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:51.250 align:middle line:84%
Actually, one of
my favorite maps

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:53.590 align:middle line:84%
that we uncovered when
we were researching

00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:56.140 align:middle line:84%
season 5 of "Ancient
Civilizations"

00:25:56.140 --> 00:26:00.310 align:middle line:84%
is that, in 1907, there
was a map found in Tibet.

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And of course, of all
places like Tibet,

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:03.370 align:middle line:90%
it makes sense though.

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:05.197 align:middle line:84%
If there were
global catastrophes,

00:26:05.197 --> 00:26:07.030 align:middle line:84%
you'd want to protect
some of that knowledge

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:09.460 align:middle line:84%
in one of the highest
areas of the world, right?

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And so in the story that
it's really fascinating

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:14.620 align:middle line:84%
that's going to go into
season 5 is that we're

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:18.460 align:middle line:84%
looking at these ancient
Tibetan civilizations, right,

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:20.950 align:middle line:84%
that go far back,
where they describe

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:26.350 align:middle line:84%
how the story is that there was
a monk in Tibet who was just

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:29.770 align:middle line:84%
traveling through the mountains
one day in the early 1900s.

00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:33.520 align:middle line:84%
And he found a cave far
up on this mountainside

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:36.180 align:middle line:84%
that had been
essentially lost to time.

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:38.020 align:middle line:84%
He went in this cave,
and what he found

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:41.270 align:middle line:84%
was a library with records
all over the world, Chinese,

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:42.070 align:middle line:90%
Sanskrit--

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:43.462 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: From how far back?

00:26:43.462 --> 00:26:45.295 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Thousands
and thousands of years.

00:26:45.295 --> 00:26:46.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Oh, my gosh, relics.

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:48.112 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: And so what
happened was he went back,

00:26:48.112 --> 00:26:51.507 align:middle line:84%
and he ended up telling the
story to an ancient researcher

00:26:51.507 --> 00:26:53.590 align:middle line:84%
and a writer who was
traveling through the region.

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And that researcher and
writer went into these caves,

00:26:57.490 --> 00:26:58.990 align:middle line:90%
and he told him the story.

00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:02.460 align:middle line:84%
And because he realized that the
monk didn't know how to read,

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:04.600 align:middle line:84%
understand this because
he wasn't a scholar.

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:06.460 align:middle line:84%
So this scholar
went to this cave,

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:08.500 align:middle line:84%
and what he found
and uncovered was

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:10.420 align:middle line:84%
there was a map
in there, George,

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:13.180 align:middle line:84%
a map unlike any map that's
ever existed in history.

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:14.590 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: What did it show?

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:17.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: This map
showed detailed records

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.600 align:middle line:84%
from around the world,
cartographic records

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.940 align:middle line:84%
of ancient Atlantis
but, specifically,

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:24.940 align:middle line:84%
the region it existed in and
another civilization that

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:26.360 align:middle line:90%
was lost called Lemuria or Mu.

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:27.160 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Sure.

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: But what
was so important

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:32.020 align:middle line:84%
about it was that it depicts
how it was being destroyed

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:34.540 align:middle line:84%
at certain time periods
and that there was actually

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:36.250 align:middle line:84%
flooding that was
still occurring

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:38.680 align:middle line:84%
in places like the Amazon
basin and the Mississippi

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:41.440 align:middle line:84%
River, which goes
exactly with records

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.607 align:middle line:84%
from Younger Dryas of what
occurred during that time

00:27:43.607 --> 00:27:44.407 align:middle line:90%
period.

00:27:44.407 --> 00:27:46.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Where was Atlantis
sketched on this map?

00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Atlantis was shown
to be just West of Spain

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:52.960 align:middle line:84%
and going down into this
region of the Atlantic

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:55.463 align:middle line:84%
right down into the Mayan
region and off of the Bahamas.

00:27:55.463 --> 00:27:57.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Very close
to what Plato said.

00:27:57.130 --> 00:28:01.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Exactly, and it shows
the Lemuria Mu civilization

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:03.970 align:middle line:84%
as encompassing places
like Easter Island

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:06.550 align:middle line:84%
and over up to Hawaii
and down into places

00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:09.730 align:middle line:84%
like Indonesia, which really
aligns exactly with what

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:10.960 align:middle line:90%
the evidence is telling us.

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:13.550 align:middle line:84%

an interconnection of knowledge

between cultures long
before the Great Deluge.

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:34.520 align:middle line:84%
Who were these beings with
this advanced building

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:38.330 align:middle line:84%
knowledge, that could
move these massive stones?

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:42.080 align:middle line:10%
The question is no longer if
these sacred megalithic sites

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.990 align:middle line:10%
around the planet were built
before the Great Flood.

00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:48.860 align:middle line:10%
The greater mystery is
how long before the flood

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:50.270 align:middle line:10%
were they built?

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:52.130 align:middle line:84%
- In a number of myths,
one of the things

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:56.570 align:middle line:84%
we find is that there's no
cultural memory in humanity

00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:59.600 align:middle line:84%
of how they made these
megalithic structures.

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:04.100 align:middle line:84%
There is no recollection of
the engineering technology

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:07.340 align:middle line:84%
that's required to
create these structures

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:11.660 align:middle line:84%
and lift stones a
certain way because it

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:13.190 align:middle line:90%
wasn't their technology.

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:15.740 align:middle line:90%
It was the god's technology.

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:17.765 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why we
can't do it again.

everything is interconnected.

But as the connections
between ancient civilizations

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:55.920 align:middle line:84%
become more apparent, the map
must shift back to the time

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:57.810 align:middle line:84%
where the unification
of the planet

00:29:57.810 --> 00:30:02.790 align:middle line:84%
can be seen and felt as the
one divided into the many.

the division on the
planet grew stronger.

Turning back our
celestial clock,

00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:19.650 align:middle line:84%
we discover that whatever
label humanity tries

00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:22.800 align:middle line:84%
to put on this deluge
period in history,

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:25.530 align:middle line:84%
there are foundational
story points that

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:28.500 align:middle line:84%
connect all to a

on the surface of the planet.

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:34.770 align:middle line:84%
But when the hands of
time go back to the time

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:40.320 align:middle line:84%
before the end of the world, the
clues in archeology and tales

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:44.280 align:middle line:84%
told in hero's epic journeys
around the planet show

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:48.630 align:middle line:84%
that most civilized
structures eventually fall.

ancient knowledge that

going to be an amazing series.

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:07.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Yeah, I really am

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:09.000 align:middle line:90%
our heart and soul into this.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.290 align:middle line:84%

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:33.390 align:middle line:84%
I want to look at
some still pictures

00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:35.130 align:middle line:84%
and have you
explain to us, Matt,

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:36.870 align:middle line:84%
what they are because
they're dramatic.

00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:40.690 align:middle line:84%
The first is what we call
the Obelisk Aswan Egypt.

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:42.500 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at this.

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:43.875 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Yeah,
this is really--

00:31:43.875 --> 00:31:46.560 align:middle line:84%
you asked earlier in
the show about what's

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:49.260 align:middle line:84%
the proof that these lost
civilizations existed.

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:51.310 align:middle line:84%
But this even goes
a step further.

00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:53.550 align:middle line:84%
It proves that they
suddenly disappeared,

00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:56.880 align:middle line:84%
which means it wasn't like the
slow demise of civilization.

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:59.670 align:middle line:84%
It was something that occurred
very quickly at the height

00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:00.840 align:middle line:90%
of their sophistication.

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And this is the first
of three examples

00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:04.170 align:middle line:90%
that really highlight this.

00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:08.430 align:middle line:84%
So this is in Aswan Egypt, and
it's the unfinished obelisk.

00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:11.367 align:middle line:84%
And it was going to be the
largest obelisk in the world.

00:32:11.367 --> 00:32:12.450 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: How old is this?

00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:15.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: This obelisk is
well over 12,000 years old.

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:18.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, modern academia
tells us that it was left

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:20.150 align:middle line:90%
unfinished because it cracked.

00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:21.483 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Look at the stonework.

00:32:21.483 --> 00:32:22.500 align:middle line:90%
It's magnificent.

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Exactly,
but more realistically,

00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:29.250 align:middle line:84%
it cracked from giant megalithic
events and earthquakes that

00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:31.890 align:middle line:84%
seem to destroy
these civilizations

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:33.600 align:middle line:84%
and literally wipe
them out at the height

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:35.490 align:middle line:84%
of their sophistication,
meaning that they

00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:38.340 align:middle line:84%
were getting ready to finish
that when they were suddenly

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:39.893 align:middle line:90%
wiped out.

00:32:39.893 --> 00:32:41.060 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That's tremendous.

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:42.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Now, I want to
point one more thing out.

00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:44.370 align:middle line:84%
In the bottom part
of the screen,

00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:47.210 align:middle line:84%
notice that the lower
part of the obelisk

00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:52.010 align:middle line:84%
has these indications of
almost like scoop marks

00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:57.000 align:middle line:84%
or some means in which it
wasn't basically sanded down

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:57.800 align:middle line:90%
and flattened.

00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:00.080 align:middle line:84%
That's part of the
technology, George,

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:03.110 align:middle line:84%
for how they seem to have
taken these giant stones out

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:05.630 align:middle line:84%
of their hosts,
meaning that some kind

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:09.230 align:middle line:84%
of a technological tool would
basically scoop these out.

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And then they would
polish them down after.

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:11.870 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Exciting.

00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:14.300 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at our next
picture, which is out of China

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:15.200 align:middle line:90%
in a quarry.

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.972 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about this.

00:33:16.972 --> 00:33:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Yeah, this is
absolutely incredible.

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And for those who think this is
a natural formation, it's not.

00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:26.490 align:middle line:84%
This is part of what's known
as a Yangshan Quarry in China.

00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And the reason we know it's not
natural is right behind this,

00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:31.370 align:middle line:84%
behind where the
picture is taken,

00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:35.000 align:middle line:84%
there are a giant finished
stela's that had been basically

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.090 align:middle line:84%
carved down and smoothed,
basically, cut in such

00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:41.180 align:middle line:84%
a precise way that there were
tools that we have no idea what

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:42.267 align:middle line:90%
they were.

00:33:42.267 --> 00:33:43.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: That looks
like a little man

00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:45.570 align:middle line:84%
down there, a
sketch of something.

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:47.130 align:middle line:84%
Do you see that,
right in the front?

00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:47.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: I do.

00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:51.140 align:middle line:84%
These are basically-- this
was the gigantic stela that

00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:52.850 align:middle line:90%
was left completely unfinished.

00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:55.250 align:middle line:84%
It had just been taken
out of the host rock.

00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:56.570 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's the wild thing.

00:33:56.570 --> 00:34:01.460 align:middle line:84%
This stone, George,
is 16,000 tons.

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:04.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, the second largest stela
megalith we have in the world,

00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:06.840 align:middle line:90%
at Baalbek, Lebanon is 1,200.

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:08.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Which is
our next picture.

00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:10.430 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at that one.

00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:11.230 align:middle line:90%
Huge.

00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:13.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Yeah, so this
is at Baalbek, Lebanon.

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And yet again, we find
another situation where

00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:18.370 align:middle line:84%
this was a quarry where
this stone was not uncovered

00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:21.159 align:middle line:84%
until 1994, meaning
our understanding

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:23.830 align:middle line:84%
of these civilizations
is not that old.

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:26.480 align:middle line:84%
We're still figuring this out
and trying to understand it.

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:29.590 align:middle line:84%
But the point is,
these stones were

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:31.449 align:middle line:84%
of the largest of
their civilization,

00:34:31.449 --> 00:34:33.280 align:middle line:84%
meaning the height of
their sophistication,

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:35.620 align:middle line:84%
were in the process of being
taken out of their quarries

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:37.989 align:middle line:84%
when all of the work
mysteriously stopped.

00:34:37.989 --> 00:34:38.929 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Why?

00:34:38.929 --> 00:34:41.635 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: And that's the why is
what gets into understanding--

00:34:41.635 --> 00:34:42.489 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Did something happen?

00:34:42.489 --> 00:34:44.687 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Something
disastrous happened, George.

00:34:44.687 --> 00:34:47.020 align:middle line:84%
Where, during the Younger
Dryas, and we look at ice core

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:49.179 align:middle line:84%
samples, we see
temperature fluctuations

00:34:49.179 --> 00:34:51.367 align:middle line:84%
in the Earth that are
completely unfathomable.

00:34:51.367 --> 00:34:53.409 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You think there
were Earth changes that

00:34:53.409 --> 00:34:54.730 align:middle line:90%
caused the stop?

00:34:54.730 --> 00:34:55.914 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: We're looking
at Earth changes--

00:34:55.914 --> 00:34:56.199 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Or human changes.

00:34:56.199 --> 00:34:58.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: --so significant
that it's like something

00:34:58.540 --> 00:34:59.890 align:middle line:90%
out of a Hollywood movie.

00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:02.680 align:middle line:84%
Where, if you were to
imagine every volcano

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:05.560 align:middle line:84%
in the world going off and
every tectonic plate starting

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:08.650 align:middle line:84%
to move, you would
have basically a time

00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:11.950 align:middle line:84%
period over 1,000 years of
catastrophes that are occurring

00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:14.860 align:middle line:84%
over and over again
that would basically

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:18.240 align:middle line:84%
be enough to completely wipe
out a sophisticated civilization

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:19.040 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:23.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: It seems that ancient
civilizations were wiped out

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:27.290 align:middle line:84%
by events that happened
time and time again.

00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:28.780 align:middle line:90%
Did you find that in your work?

00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:30.373 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Yeah, it
seems to be, when

00:35:30.373 --> 00:35:32.290 align:middle line:84%
we look at geologic
evidence-- and again, this

00:35:32.290 --> 00:35:33.665 align:middle line:84%
is one of the
conversations I had

00:35:33.665 --> 00:35:37.210 align:middle line:84%
with the phenomenal geologist
and climatologist expert

00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:39.040 align:middle line:84%
Randall Carlson, where
we said, hey, look,

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:41.650 align:middle line:84%
there are these specific
two time periods that

00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:44.200 align:middle line:84%
keep coming up in geologic
and climatological records

00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:45.730 align:middle line:90%
over and over again.

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:49.480 align:middle line:84%
That is around 5,000 years
ago, every 5,000 years

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:51.100 align:middle line:90%
and every 13,000 years.

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:54.080 align:middle line:84%
So it's not one event,
but it's two events.

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:57.580 align:middle line:84%
But of those two,
this 13,000 year event

00:35:57.580 --> 00:35:58.960 align:middle line:90%
seems to be the worst.

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:02.710 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be the one that none
of these civilizations, George,

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:03.587 align:middle line:90%
have made it through.

00:36:03.587 --> 00:36:05.920 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And they never
picked back up again, did they?

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:06.837 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: They don't.

00:36:06.837 --> 00:36:09.400 align:middle line:84%
In fact, every time one
of these have happened,

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:13.090 align:middle line:84%
and according to the ancient
priests of Sais, the temple

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:15.790 align:middle line:84%
priests and the ancient
Maya and the Aztec,

00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:19.660 align:middle line:84%
there have been at least four
to five different civilizations

00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:21.640 align:middle line:90%
that have risen up and fallen.

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And every single time, we've
lost more and more knowledge

00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:27.190 align:middle line:90%
in each one of those falls.

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:29.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Matt, the great
geologist Gregg Braden,

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:30.730 align:middle line:90%
whom we've seen--

00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:32.950 align:middle line:84%
talks about ancient
civilizations

00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:34.945 align:middle line:84%
and why he thinks
something happened.

00:36:34.945 --> 00:36:35.890 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:37.720 align:middle line:10%
- There are common
themes that run

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:39.880 align:middle line:10%
through all of these stories.

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:42.940 align:middle line:10%
One of those themes
is that civilization

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:45.880 align:middle line:10%
is cyclic rather than
linear, that there

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:50.440 align:middle line:10%
have been previous cycles of
civilization that have lasted

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:52.960 align:middle line:10%
for approximately 5,000 years.

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.130 align:middle line:90%
Something happens.

00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:57.260 align:middle line:84%
Those cycles come to an
end, a new cycle begins.

00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:59.140 align:middle line:84%
This is where it gets
really interesting

00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:02.260 align:middle line:84%
because, even though
the cycles change,

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:05.740 align:middle line:84%
there appears to be a
continuity of knowledge,

00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:10.090 align:middle line:84%
a continuity of wisdom when it
comes to the end of one cycle

00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:12.316 align:middle line:90%
and the beginning of the next.

00:37:12.316 --> 00:37:16.850 align:middle line:10%
The Mayans divided one
precession of the equinoxes,

00:37:16.850 --> 00:37:20.380 align:middle line:10%
so 26,000 year
cycle approximately,

00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:25.360 align:middle line:10%
into five 5,125
year-long cycles.

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:28.990 align:middle line:10%
Each of those cycles,
when they begin,

00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:32.250 align:middle line:10%
something happens to the
civilization during that time.

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And one of the questions
that historians have asked

00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:38.950 align:middle line:84%
is, could there be something
that drives these cycles?

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:40.750 align:middle line:84%
Is there a cosmological
phenomenon?

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:42.370 align:middle line:90%
Is there a climactic phenomenon?

00:37:42.370 --> 00:37:44.560 align:middle line:90%
Is there a geologic phenomenon?

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:47.380 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's a convergence
of all of these phenomenon.

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:51.980 align:middle line:84%
Something happens
every 5,125 years.

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:58.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we take the year
2012 as the end of one 5,125

00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:04.090 align:middle line:84%
year-long cycle and we go back
in time to the 5,000 years

00:38:04.090 --> 00:38:06.730 align:middle line:84%
previously, this
would be the time

00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:10.210 align:middle line:84%
that we traditionally have
been taught that civilization

00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:12.550 align:middle line:90%
began in 5,500 years ago.

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:16.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, new discoveries are
revealing the remnants

00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:20.930 align:middle line:84%
of ancient civilizations that
predate that 5,000 years many,

00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:21.730 align:middle line:90%
many times.

00:38:21.730 --> 00:38:22.390 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:24.723 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Gosh wouldn't you
have loved social networking

00:38:24.723 --> 00:38:25.540 align:middle line:90%
in those days?

00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:27.440 align:middle line:84%
We'd find out instantly
what was going on.

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:28.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Right?

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:30.698 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's one of the things
that we have available to us

00:38:30.698 --> 00:38:32.590 align:middle line:84%
that I don't think anyone
else before us did.

00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And so we may have
certain technologies

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:39.790 align:middle line:84%
and certain capabilities that no
civilization before us has had.

00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:42.040 align:middle line:84%
And even though
on the surface it

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:45.040 align:middle line:84%
may seem we're very disconnected
and almost broken in some ways,

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:47.980 align:middle line:84%
but that technology
and those means

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:50.230 align:middle line:84%
that we have available
to us, I believe

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:53.290 align:middle line:84%
are being utilized for
us to survive this cycle

00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:55.130 align:middle line:90%
for the first time in history.

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:56.650 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Let's go
to Luxor in Egypt

00:38:56.650 --> 00:39:00.490 align:middle line:84%
and take a look at
our final picture.

00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:02.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: So here we
are in Luxor, Egypt.

00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:05.580 align:middle line:84%
We have some of, if
not, the largest stone

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:06.570 align:middle line:90%
statues in the world.

00:39:06.570 --> 00:39:07.050 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Amazing.

00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:08.080 align:middle line:10%
They look like pharaohs.

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:10.080 align:middle line:10%
>>LACROIX: They're called
the Colossi of Memnon.

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:13.500 align:middle line:10%
Now, they guard this entrance
into places like the Ramesseum

00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:14.935 align:middle line:10%
and Karnak temple.

00:39:14.935 --> 00:39:17.310 align:middle line:84%
But what's so phenomenally
interesting about these first,

00:39:17.310 --> 00:39:21.210 align:middle line:84%
to give a couple of stats,
these are 700 tons each.

00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:23.095 align:middle line:90%
And they're 60 feet tall.

00:39:23.095 --> 00:39:24.720 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: One piece,
or is it stacked--

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:26.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: One single
piece that has been broken

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:28.140 align:middle line:90%
by earthquakes over time.

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:28.380 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Amazing.

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:29.922 align:middle line:10%
>>LACROIX: But what's
so fascinating,

00:39:29.922 --> 00:39:32.190 align:middle line:10%
George, is that on
the Colossi of Memnon,

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:35.520 align:middle line:10%
there is what's known as
vitrification or scarring

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:38.340 align:middle line:10%
on one specific
part of each statue.

00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:40.860 align:middle line:84%
On the Northeast side
of each one of these

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:44.190 align:middle line:84%
we find evidence of
catastrophes that

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:47.070 align:middle line:84%
occurred that
literally were what

00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:49.470 align:middle line:84%
destroyed the civilization
that created them.

00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:51.630 align:middle line:84%
But those catastrophes
seem to have

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:54.000 align:middle line:90%
come from a specific direction.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And what's
interesting about that

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:58.680 align:middle line:84%
is that vitrification,
which means melting of rock,

00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:01.020 align:middle line:84%
can only occur if
temperatures in the surface

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:03.960 align:middle line:90%
exceed 2,000 degrees.

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:05.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: That's
an asteroid strike.

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:06.915 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: It's some
kind of a massive--

00:40:06.915 --> 00:40:07.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Well,
where's the crater?

00:40:07.170 --> 00:40:08.878 align:middle line:10%
>>LACROIX: --heat,
either asteroid strike

00:40:08.878 --> 00:40:12.630 align:middle line:10%
or a coronal mass
ejection blasting energy

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:15.060 align:middle line:10%
from the sun that basically
comes through the ozone layer

00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:16.380 align:middle line:10%
and literally can
invade the surface.

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:18.000 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE: Bigger than
a Carrington Event.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:18.660 align:middle line:90%
Something huge.

00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:20.077 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Something
much greater.

00:40:20.077 --> 00:40:22.650 align:middle line:84%
But it may be a combination of
both of those events, George,

00:40:22.650 --> 00:40:23.590 align:middle line:90%
that led to this.

00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:25.890 align:middle line:84%
But either way,
those civilizations

I'm looking forward
