And just over a
course of time, he

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.930 align:middle line:10%
told me there were
many stops and starts

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.480 align:middle line:10%
to get it made into a movie.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.650 align:middle line:10%
And somebody had called and
wanted to make it into a movie.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.235 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted me to go
with him to the meeting,

00:01:52.235 --> 00:01:54.360 align:middle line:84%
since I've been in the film
business my whole life.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.690 align:middle line:90%
So I went to the meeting.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.990 align:middle line:90%
It didn't turn out well.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And I had to sort of tell
Dr. Frank that he couldn't

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.410 align:middle line:90%
get involved with this person.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And I just saw how
disappointed he was.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And so, that began the
journey with me just

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.200 align:middle line:90%
sitting with him for years.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.220 align:middle line:84%
I said, just tell
me stories of you

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.110 align:middle line:84%
with Valiant Thor and his
crew and all of everything

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.050 align:middle line:90%
that's gone on.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.010 align:middle line:84%
Because the book is
vignettes of things

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.490 align:middle line:84%
that happened
throughout the years.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.710 align:middle line:84%
So we had to have a
chunk of a story-line.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:38.430 align:middle line:84%
So we did that, worked on the
major script for several years

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.470 align:middle line:84%
and, then, was going to
raised the money to do

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.260 align:middle line:90%
the film privately, right?

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.487 align:middle line:84%
And then, Dr. Frank passed
away in November of 2008.

00:02:51.487 --> 00:02:53.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Before you
could finish this.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Before we
could get the movie made.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.330 align:middle line:90%
The script was done.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.070 align:middle line:90%
So it was pretty devastating.

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And then, a couple
years after that,

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.290 align:middle line:84%
I worked on a film-- one
of the casting directors

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.040 align:middle line:84%
on "Sky Captain and
the World of Tomorrow"

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.130 align:middle line:84%
with Jude Law and Angelina
Jolie and another film

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.580 align:middle line:84%
with the producer who
did the "Saw" movies.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.800 align:middle line:84%
Those movies were
independent movies.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.370 align:middle line:84%
They came about because
they made a short film.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And they used that as their
expensive sizzle reel,

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.010 align:middle line:90%
to gain the private financing.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.240 align:middle line:84%
So both those films were
actually privately financed.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.948 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Perfect.

00:03:27.948 --> 00:03:31.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: So I decided,
I'm going to do a short film

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.192 align:middle line:84%
and call in all the favors
from all of my friends

00:03:34.192 --> 00:03:35.900 align:middle line:84%
throughout all the
years in the business.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And we even had James Cameron's
visual effects coordinator

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.980 align:middle line:90%
on board.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, talent
you just can't buy.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.966 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: You can't, no.

00:03:42.966 --> 00:03:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And all these people gave
of themselves freely.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.876 align:middle line:84%
And I always said, this
movie was made by the people,

00:03:49.876 --> 00:03:50.500 align:middle line:90%
for the people.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.210 align:middle line:84%
Because the people
wanted to see it.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.470 align:middle line:84%
Because people are the
ones that helped fund it.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All based on the
work of Frank Stranges.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:57.340 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yes.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who I remember as a
kid, reading some of his works.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.900 align:middle line:90%
He was huge into the UFO field.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:04.650 align:middle line:90%
Huge.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.670 align:middle line:90%
And he loved it.

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.980 align:middle line:84%
What an incredible story though,
"The Stranger at the Pentagon,"

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.895 align:middle line:84%
about someone who comes
from another planet.

00:04:12.895 --> 00:04:15.920 align:middle line:90%


00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.529 align:middle line:90%
Was it a drama?

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:19.730 align:middle line:90%
Or was it real?

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.720 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Well, when
I sat with Dr. Frank

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.800 align:middle line:84%
and talked to him-- I
read the book in the '80s.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And I sort of filed it
away and just thought, wow.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.020 align:middle line:84%
There's pictures of
this man, Valiant Thor,

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.620 align:middle line:90%
his vice-commander, Donn.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And then, there's
another lady whose name

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.500 align:middle line:90%
is Jill, who's a blond.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And I later found
out from Dr. Frank,

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.990 align:middle line:84%
she's the wife of
Vice-Commander Zann.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And those pictures were taken
in Howard Menger's backyard

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.820 align:middle line:84%
in High Bridge, New
Jersey, during the time

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:46.820 align:middle line:90%
that Valiant Thor was--

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:47.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they look human.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:48.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Right.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.210 align:middle line:90%
They look human.

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.870 align:middle line:84%
Actually, they're all
quite good looking.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, so a retired
Air Force photographer

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.270 align:middle line:84%
and UFOlogist, August
Roberts, was there that day.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And he saw that
Valiant Thor didn't

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.370 align:middle line:84%
have palm prints, fingerprints;
that he spoke to people

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:14.320 align:middle line:84%
in different languages; and that
when he looked at him, he said,

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.310 align:middle line:90%
he looked right through me.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And when he look
through me, he could

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.669 align:middle line:84%
feel him reading his
entire soul history.

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:22.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.084 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: He said
it was beyond anything.

00:05:24.084 --> 00:05:27.850 align:middle line:84%
He said, you knew that
this man was not from here

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:36.030 align:middle line:84%
and that he felt that he was
of the angelic class of beings.

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've been a UFO buff
all my life, all my life.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.030 align:middle line:84%
I know practically every
major UFO case that

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.870 align:middle line:90%
has occurred on this planet.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.170 align:middle line:90%
And this one is mind boggling.

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:52.430 align:middle line:84%
The fact that an
extraterrestrial would

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.510 align:middle line:84%
come here, would try
to give us, really,

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.420 align:middle line:90%
plans to build our future.

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.450 align:middle line:90%
Not quite-- thank, God.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.900 align:middle line:84%
It's like the "Twilight
Zone" film, right?

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:04.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Right.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not
a cookbook, right?

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.425 align:middle line:90%
But just an amazing story.

00:06:09.425 --> 00:06:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And looking at that
picture of Valiant Thor--

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.050 align:middle line:90%
good looking guy from--

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: It's
chilling to actually--

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:16.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is chilling.

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: --look at him,
if you study it as well.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happened
to Valiant Thor?

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:22.580 align:middle line:90%
Did he leave the planet?

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:23.320 align:middle line:90%
Did he die?

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.740 align:middle line:90%
Where is he now?

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Well,
everything that I tell

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.560 align:middle line:90%
you is what Dr. Frank told me.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.470 align:middle line:84%
So I'm, I guess,
the spokesperson.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:32.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're the
go-between, now.

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:34.928 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: I'm the
go-between at this point,

00:06:34.928 --> 00:06:36.040 align:middle line:90%
since Dr. Frank is gone.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:41.790 align:middle line:90%
But he left on March 16, 1960.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:45.730 align:middle line:84%
And then, returned
on March 16, 1961.

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:48.102 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Frank said, has
been here ever since.

00:06:48.102 --> 00:06:49.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's here now.

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: He's here now.

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And he commands a
giant starship that is

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.120 align:middle line:90%
14 miles long and 7 miles wide.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.030 align:middle line:84%
And that there is a
Victor Class fleet.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And his saucer is Victor
I. And there's Victor II,

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.020 align:middle line:90%
Victor III, Victor IV.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.690 align:middle line:84%
These saucers are
300 feet in diameter.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:09.690 align:middle line:90%
They're double-deckered.

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:11.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We may have
seen some of them.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yes.

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And we do-- and I'm sure,
at some point in the show,

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.180 align:middle line:84%
we're going to show the
blueprints to the Victor Class

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.880 align:middle line:90%
saucers as well.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And they hold up
to 200 in the crew.

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And there are over
100 of them stationed

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:31.910 align:middle line:84%
in and around the Earth,
monitoring 287 locations.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where are they from?

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:37.070 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Well, they could
be from all over the universe

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:38.430 align:middle line:90%
and other parts of the universe.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:42.430 align:middle line:84%
But Valiant Thor and his
immediate Vice-Commander crew

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.960 align:middle line:90%
are from the interior of Venus.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Frank explained that
Valiant Thor explained to him

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.520 align:middle line:84%
that all of the planets
throughout our galaxy

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:57.280 align:middle line:84%
are populated on the
inside and that they

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.870 align:middle line:84%
have ways of
terracing the insides

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:03.020 align:middle line:84%
and making them
like a spaceship.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.690 align:middle line:84%
They have ways of making
synchrotron skies.

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:08.520 align:middle line:84%
So if you're looking
up into the sky,

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.880 align:middle line:84%
you believe that you're
looking out into the real sky.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And they go from day
to night as well.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And that this is
also a way that they

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:21.340 align:middle line:84%
can control the
temperature-- but not only

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:26.170 align:middle line:84%
that-- the resignation fields
that keep theirselves young,

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:27.760 align:middle line:90%
so that they don't age.

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.430 align:middle line:84%
They stop aging
at about 30, even

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:33.330 align:middle line:84%
though the ones that are
born of man and woman

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.260 align:middle line:84%
can live up to
1,000, 2,000 years.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.329 align:middle line:84%
Created beings, such as
Valiant Thor, are immortal.

00:08:39.329 --> 00:08:41.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isn't that
an amazing story?

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:44.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yes, and I've
been doing lots of shows

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:49.130 align:middle line:84%
throughout my life,
casting science fiction

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:50.800 align:middle line:90%
shows and all of that.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And this story, though,
is one that brings hope.

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And people can't believe
it when they hear it,

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:02.610 align:middle line:84%
that there are such
beings out there who

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:06.870 align:middle line:84%
have this incredible
compassion for us

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:09.950 align:middle line:84%
and that are here to help
assist, even though it

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:13.110 align:middle line:90%
may be invisible to us knowing.

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:17.180 align:middle line:84%
But it's starting to
break through the barriers

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.270 align:middle line:90%
and the veil.

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And bringing this
up, this short film

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:23.750 align:middle line:84%
alone was never intended
for anybody to see.

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:24.520 align:middle line:90%
The world wanted--

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:25.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's just
your sizzle reel.

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:26.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: A
sizzle reel, yeah.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.611 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For getting financing.

00:09:27.611 --> 00:09:29.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Everybody
wanted to see it.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:33.580 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to see
it so desperately.

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.270 align:middle line:84%
So I made it
available for everyone

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:37.240 align:middle line:84%
to see and travel
around with it.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:40.344 align:middle line:84%
And as you know, we've
won two film festivals--

00:09:40.344 --> 00:09:41.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, you have

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:42.593 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: --with it as well.

00:09:42.593 --> 00:09:43.180 align:middle line:90%
Which is nice.

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wouldn't you
love to meet Valiant Thor.

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:47.260 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: I would really
love to meet Valiant Thor.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:47.900 align:middle line:90%
And I know--

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What would you ask him?

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:54.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Um, I have a
long laundry list of questions

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:55.455 align:middle line:90%
that I would ask him.

00:09:55.455 --> 00:09:57.210 align:middle line:84%
But I think what
I would really do

00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:02.240 align:middle line:84%
first is I would
really like to just sit

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:08.820 align:middle line:84%
with them and their energy and
just talk about regular things.

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:11.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me the
significance of Harley Byrd.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And any relation
to Admiral Byrd?

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:14.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yes.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:16.070 align:middle line:90%
He was his nephew.

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:18.510 align:middle line:84%
I've recently obtained
a couple of documents

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:20.660 align:middle line:90%
from the Byrd estate.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:25.000 align:middle line:84%
The first one is a letter
written by Admiral Richard Byrd

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.910 align:middle line:84%
to Rear Admiral Daniel Smith,
who was the Chief Naval

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:32.501 align:middle line:84%
Operations Officer
over at the Pentagon

00:10:32.501 --> 00:10:33.750 align:middle line:90%
for the Department of Defense.

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:34.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: CNO?

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.151 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yeah.

00:10:35.151 --> 00:10:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote a letter
to Harley at that time.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.160 align:middle line:90%
He was recently married in '56.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.180 align:middle line:90%
He had a baby on the way.

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:46.650 align:middle line:90%
And he needed a real job.

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:53.610 align:middle line:84%
So he was in the-- oh,
what do you call it?

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:54.235 align:middle line:90%
The Guard.

00:10:54.235 --> 00:10:54.921 align:middle line:90%
The--

00:10:54.921 --> 00:10:55.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Reserves.

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:58.360 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yes, thank you.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.770 align:middle line:90%
So anyway, he wrote a letter.

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And then, he started working
for the Department of Defense

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:08.030 align:middle line:84%
in '57, which is at the time
that Valiant Thor was there.

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, the other
document that I have

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:14.030 align:middle line:84%
is his honorable
discharge papers,

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:19.900 align:middle line:84%
which show that he was,
among many other titles,

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:23.020 align:middle line:84%
special assignment
officer as well

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:24.520 align:middle line:84%
there for the
Department of Defense.

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:24.800 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.075 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they put him in
charge of, like, Project Blue

00:11:27.075 --> 00:11:27.200 align:middle line:90%
Book.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.670 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: He was a part
of Project Blue Book, yes.

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And so, he wrote the foreword
to "Stranger at the Pentagon,"

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.832 align:middle line:84%
confirming, giving the case
file number, and everything.

00:11:38.832 --> 00:11:40.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they
investigated this?

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:41.080 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yes.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.909 align:middle line:84%
Well, he was right
there at the Pentagon.

00:11:42.909 --> 00:11:43.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is amazing.

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:47.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yeah, so
it's an amazing thing.

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:52.590 align:middle line:84%
So there is that proof
there from Harley Byrd.

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:57.640 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, Harley-- I found
out-- passed away, I think,

00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.592 align:middle line:84%
March 11, 2009, not
long after Dr. Frank.

00:11:59.592 --> 00:12:01.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was he a
believer, do you think?

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:01.520 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yes.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:02.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --in this entire story?

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:03.950 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yes, absolutely.

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:06.710 align:middle line:84%
I actually think he
met Valiant Thor.

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:08.855 align:middle line:84%
Because he was there
at the Pentagon.

00:12:08.855 --> 00:12:10.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was a
picture of Valiant Thor.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:11.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yeah.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were there any
pictures of him with Eisenhower?

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:14.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: No,
not that I know of.

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:16.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You didn't
see any of them.

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:18.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: But
here's what I think.

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:21.324 align:middle line:84%
There has to exist,
somewhere, photographs

00:12:21.324 --> 00:12:22.240 align:middle line:90%
of him and Eisenhower.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:22.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my gosh.

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:23.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:23.520 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Somewhere.

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, wouldn't you have
taken a picture with him?

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:26.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Many, many.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you say that
Valiant Thor is still here,

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:32.020 align:middle line:90%
are you talking about up there?

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.470 align:middle line:90%
Or physically on this planet?

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:35.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Physically
on the planet.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.790 align:middle line:84%
His craft, like I said,
is called Victor 1.

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:40.889 align:middle line:90%
And it's stationed at Lake Mead.

00:12:40.889 --> 00:12:42.430 align:middle line:84%
Actually, in the
book, it gives the--

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:43.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In the lake?

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.290 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Not in the lake.

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:46.700 align:middle line:90%
But it's more on dry land.

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:52.300 align:middle line:84%
I actually went out there,
actually, on March 16 this year

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:55.590 align:middle line:90%
and went to check out the site.

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:58.340 align:middle line:84%
Because we can now do it
with GPS, because we had the

00:12:58.340 --> 00:12:59.340 align:middle line:90%
coordinates.

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:01.920 align:middle line:90%
And it's just big open space.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's perfect for
taking off and landing

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:06.650 align:middle line:90%
and all that kind of stuff.

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:07.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nobody sees it.

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:08.858 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Nobody sees it.

00:13:08.858 --> 00:13:11.150 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Frank always talked
about a [? Verishield ?],

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:12.790 align:middle line:90%
is what he called it.

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:14.934 align:middle line:84%
When they would go pick
him up in Las Vegas

00:13:14.934 --> 00:13:17.350 align:middle line:84%
and, then, drive him to Lake
Mead-- because they had cars.

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:18.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Vegas-- I love
the way that sounds.

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:19.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: They do.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:19.780 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:21.424 align:middle line:90%
They did.

00:13:21.424 --> 00:13:22.451 align:middle line:90%
He said that--

00:13:22.451 --> 00:13:23.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He sang with Sinatra.

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:24.491 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yeah.

00:13:24.491 --> 00:13:26.950 align:middle line:90%


00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:28.740 align:middle line:84%
--the [? Verishield ?]
just opens up.

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:31.410 align:middle line:84%
They just drive right in
to the belly of the craft.

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:31.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it closes.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:32.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: And then,
it closes right up.

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:34.590 align:middle line:84%
But if there were
people here, they

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:38.120 align:middle line:84%
could even extend the
shield out this way,

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:40.360 align:middle line:84%
so nobody even sees
the car coming in.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:43.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why the interest, do
you think, in this country?

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.610 align:middle line:90%
In this planet?

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:50.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Well, because this
planet is dualistic in nature.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:56.460 align:middle line:84%
And from what I
understand, they're

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:58.641 align:middle line:90%
all fully conscious beings.

00:13:58.641 --> 00:13:59.640 align:middle line:90%
I think, what do we use?

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.007 align:middle line:90%
33 and 1/3 of our brain?

00:14:01.007 --> 00:14:01.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:02.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: They're
at full capacity.

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:03.750 align:middle line:90%
Imagine what that--

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:04.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Some of us do.

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:05.720 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Some
of us do, right.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.250 align:middle line:90%
But they're at full capacity.

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And imagine what somebody
like his brain is

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:13.150 align:middle line:90%
and what they can do.

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:15.620 align:middle line:84%
So they're here for the
shifting of consciousness,

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:19.820 align:middle line:84%
of moving at a duality, moving
the heart with the mind.

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And so as this planet
raises up, it'll

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:28.160 align:middle line:84%
again rejoin with
the universal society

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.177 align:middle line:84%
that it's forgotten about
for a very long time.

00:14:30.177 --> 00:14:32.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to look at
some of the behind-the-scenes

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:34.170 align:middle line:84%
of your movie "Stranger
at the Pentagon."

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:34.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Sure.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because this
is really fantastic.

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:37.060 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this.

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:38.850 align:middle line:90%


00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:41.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Hi,
I'm Craig Campobasso,

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:43.580 align:middle line:84%
screenwriter, producer, and
director of the short film

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:45.340 align:middle line:90%
"Stranger at the Pentagon."

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting here in front
of this green-screen,

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:50.710 align:middle line:84%
similar to the one that
we used on the sound stage

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:53.790 align:middle line:84%
where we just finished
shooting our space drama,

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:57.380 align:middle line:84%
inspired by a true story
about Valiant Thor, a created

00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:00.330 align:middle line:84%
being or an angel
in human form that

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:02.240 align:middle line:84%
lived at the Pentagon
for three years

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.650 align:middle line:84%
under the Eisenhower
administration.

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:06.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'd like to
share some of our sets

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:10.770 align:middle line:84%
with you-- the Joint
Chiefs of Staff,

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:15.320 align:middle line:84%
the underground Washington
Basilica of the Evil Emperium,

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:19.910 align:middle line:84%
the interrogation
room, the Oval Office.

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:22.480 align:middle line:90%
Next up, custom design.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:28.560 align:middle line:84%
This is Valiant Thor's uniform;
the Vice-Commanders' uniforms;

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:33.420 align:middle line:84%
Uniah, created being of
Melchizedek's uniform.

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And this is Uniah's
associate, Yeo's uniform.

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.021 align:middle line:84%
These are also the uniforms
of the galactic civilians.

00:15:40.021 --> 00:15:40.520 align:middle line:90%


00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:43.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Craig, that was
fun behind the scenes.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.910 align:middle line:84%
But you can only
imagine what this

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:49.365 align:middle line:84%
was really like, many years ago,
when this episode apparently

00:15:49.365 --> 00:15:49.865 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:15:49.865 --> 00:15:50.170 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yes.

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:51.599 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's just
mind-boggling.

00:15:51.599 --> 00:15:52.390 align:middle line:10%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yeah.

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:54.870 align:middle line:10%
And that's why I can't wait
to make the big giant feature

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:55.370 align:middle line:10%
film.

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:57.161 align:middle line:10%
Because we're going to
be on that starship.

00:15:57.161 --> 00:15:58.960 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be in
Victor I. And we're

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:02.050 align:middle line:84%
going to see things that
we've never seen before.

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:05.260 align:middle line:84%
This is just like
a little appetizer.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And imagine what we can do when
we really have a CGI budget

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:12.060 align:middle line:84%
and can hire somebody
like George Lucas's ILM.

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:14.185 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who would play
the part of Valiant Thor?

00:16:14.185 --> 00:16:16.310 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Do you know
who I really really like?

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:18.220 align:middle line:90%
Is Lee Pace.

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Lee Pace starred in
"Guardians of the Galaxy."

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:27.690 align:middle line:84%
He was in all the hobbit
movies and, I think,

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:29.600 align:middle line:84%
"Pushing Daisies,"
the TV series.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.310 align:middle line:84%
He looks very similar
to Valiant Thor.

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:33.500 align:middle line:90%
And he has that presence.

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you're
a casting director.

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:36.389 align:middle line:90%
You know what to do.

00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:37.180 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: I do.

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:37.780 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And Eileen Davidson, who played
his wife in the short film,

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:44.260 align:middle line:84%
will be back and play her
in the feature film as well.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
think, with this movie

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:52.690 align:middle line:84%
and with this sizzle reel and if
it gets out to the big screen,

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:58.080 align:middle line:84%
the real Valiant Thor will know
about it and will come down?

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.390 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Well,
Dr. Frank said,

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:03.440 align:middle line:84%
every time we were together
that they filmed us.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.410 align:middle line:90%
And they would store it.

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And then, when they had
time or if they were eating,

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.160 align:middle line:90%
they would actually watch it.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And so, I think that
everything is recorded

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:16.819 align:middle line:84%
and that they look and see
how everything is coming out.

00:17:16.819 --> 00:17:19.359 align:middle line:84%
And I do hope that
someday he'll come down.

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:21.640 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, you'll get to
interview him, George.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would love to
interview him on "Coast

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:23.119 align:middle line:90%
to Coast"--

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:23.785 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Would that
be the most awesome thing?

00:17:23.785 --> 00:17:25.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --and "Beyond Belief."

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:26.180 align:middle line:90%
That would be something.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yeah, that
would be beyond belief for me.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.040 align:middle line:90%
That would be so cool, so cool.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:33.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wonder if we
would be able to determine

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:38.470 align:middle line:84%
if this guy was truly an
extraterrestrial or some kind

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:39.127 align:middle line:90%
of good actor.

00:17:39.127 --> 00:17:41.710 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: No, we would know
he was because he doesn't have

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:43.270 align:middle line:84%
a belly-button and
he doesn't have

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:45.110 align:middle line:90%
fingerprints or palm-prints.

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would I ask you to
see if he has a belly-button?

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:49.130 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Of course, yeah.

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:50.680 align:middle line:90%
He would show that.

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:51.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:53.289 align:middle line:84%
And he would look
exactly the way

00:17:53.289 --> 00:17:54.580 align:middle line:90%
he looked from the photographs.

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:55.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He would
not have changed.

00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:56.630 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: He would
not have changed.

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:58.520 align:middle line:84%
None of them have
changed one bit, no.

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:02.564 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was the most
fascinating point for you?

00:18:02.564 --> 00:18:04.230 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: The
most fascinating point

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:08.270 align:middle line:84%
was learning more about
the story from Dr. Frank.

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:13.320 align:middle line:84%
But when I was writing
it, the experience

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.610 align:middle line:84%
that they gave me was, each
and every one of them--

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:18.470 align:middle line:84%
including Valiant Thor--
put their feeling body

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:19.479 align:middle line:90%
inside my body.

00:18:19.479 --> 00:18:20.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What an amazing story.

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:23.170 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: It was beyond
anything I've ever experienced.

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:23.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's beyond belief.

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.215 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: It's
beyond belief.

00:18:25.215 --> 00:18:27.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long have
you been in Hollywood now?

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:30.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: I
started when I was 15.

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:31.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow!

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:34.080 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: I did
commercials and some bit parts

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:38.480 align:middle line:84%
in movies and TV, transitioned
into a company called

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:39.450 align:middle line:90%
Kaleidoscope Films.

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:43.000 align:middle line:84%
I made teasers and
trailers for movies.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.970 align:middle line:84%
And then, I
transitioned from there,

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:49.710 align:middle line:84%
going to Universal Studios and
worked for Dino de Laurentiis,

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:52.300 align:middle line:84%
Raffaella de Laurentiis,
and David Lynch, who

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:53.655 align:middle line:90%
were making "Dune."

00:18:53.655 --> 00:18:54.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great movie.

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:55.613 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Great movie.

00:18:55.613 --> 00:18:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And so, that's where I
learned all about filmmaking.

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:02.500 align:middle line:84%
I worked on that film
from beginning conception

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:03.570 align:middle line:90%
all the way to the end.

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:05.675 align:middle line:84%
And that was a
four year journey.

00:19:05.675 --> 00:19:06.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The "spice."

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:08.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yeah, the
"spice," the "melange."

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why was the
spice so important?

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Well,
the spice was important

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.720 align:middle line:84%
because it actually accelerated
consciousness, right?

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's what created the
superbeing Paul Muad'dib.

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everybody wanted it.

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yeah.

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:26.677 align:middle line:84%
And it was just an
amazing journey.

00:19:26.677 --> 00:19:28.760 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people don't know
a lot of the backstory.

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:32.850 align:middle line:84%
But Val Kilmer was almost
playing Paul Muad'dib up until

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:35.070 align:middle line:90%
Kyle McLaughlin was found.

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:38.160 align:middle line:84%
Michael Biehn actually
screen-tested.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.716 align:middle line:84%
Kevin Costner
screen-tested as well.

00:19:40.716 --> 00:19:41.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a cult movie.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.173 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: It's a cult movie.

00:19:43.173 --> 00:19:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And David Lynch is
just so brilliant.

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And it was such a joy to
work with and learn from him.

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:54.780 align:middle line:84%
The movie today-- he wanted to
do a long version of the film

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:57.080 align:middle line:90%
and asked Universal to wait.

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:43.170 align:middle line:84%

ends up being pregnant.

>>CAMPOBASSO: Well,
Hollywood will

00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:57.950 align:middle line:90%
do anything that makes money.

00:25:57.950 --> 00:25:58.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:25:58.150 --> 00:25:59.608 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: So
that's why I think

00:25:59.608 --> 00:26:02.730 align:middle line:84%
we do see a lot of things
that are more negative-based.

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:05.847 align:middle line:84%
Because they're always
doing the conflict and--

00:26:05.847 --> 00:26:06.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: People like that.

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:10.200 align:middle line:84%

going to eat you and things

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.080 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:15.111 align:middle line:84%
I know, when I was a boy,
I loved horror films.

00:26:15.111 --> 00:26:16.860 align:middle line:84%
My niece and nephew,
when they were young,

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:18.060 align:middle line:90%
they loved horror films.

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:19.820 align:middle line:90%
And the gorier the better.

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:22.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
it is in our nature.

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:25.940 align:middle line:84%
But then, later on,
we start to want

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:31.150 align:middle line:84%
to see things of-- what's
interesting is, like,

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:32.660 align:middle line:84%
"Stranger at the
Pentagon," these

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:35.330 align:middle line:84%
are things that are
now becoming inspired

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:37.220 align:middle line:84%
by true stories, things
that are out there,

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:38.890 align:middle line:84%
things that are
different, instead

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:40.260 align:middle line:90%
of us seeing everything.

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think the great
thing about "Star Trek"

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:46.550 align:middle line:84%
is that it's conditioned
everybody for life

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:48.330 align:middle line:90%
out there in the universe.

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And here's one of the most
interesting, coolest things

00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:54.120 align:middle line:84%
ever-- Gene
Roddenberry was trying

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.811 align:middle line:90%
to sell that series everywhere.

00:26:55.811 --> 00:26:57.060 align:middle line:90%

nobody wanted it.

00:26:58.518 --> 00:27:02.150 align:middle line:90%
And he took it to Desilu.

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And Lucille Ball, at that
time, was the president,

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:10.030 align:middle line:84%
because Ricky-- or
Desi-- had stepped away.

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:13.439 align:middle line:84%
And she is the one who
green lit "Star Trek."

00:27:13.439 --> 00:27:13.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow!

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:15.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: We would
not have "Star Trek"

00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:16.130 align:middle line:90%

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:16.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Isn't that amazing?

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:18.550 align:middle line:84%

did "Mission Impossible."

00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:20.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, that is amazing.

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:21.544 align:middle line:84%

00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:33.160 align:middle line:84%

When George Lucas
did "Star Wars,"

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:45.300 align:middle line:84%
he was trying to explain
it to the Fox execs.

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:47.530 align:middle line:84%
They had no clue what
he was trying to do,

00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:50.840 align:middle line:84%
what he was trying to
say, what his vision was.

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And so, he actually
had to go out and hire

00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:56.990 align:middle line:84%
a professional
airbrush artist, who

00:27:56.990 --> 00:28:00.160 align:middle line:84%
came in and made giant
landscape pictures

was going to look like.

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:05.152 align:middle line:90%

00:28:05.152 --> 00:28:06.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's what sold it.

That's what sold it.

sizzle reels or short films,

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:15.680 align:middle line:84%
it gives them the idea of
what it will look like,

what it'll feel like.

00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:12.920 align:middle line:84%
to try and get things
brought more into the light

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:15.940 align:middle line:84%
and out in Hollywood,
in television and film.

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:18.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of my favorites is
well-- I've got a lot of them--

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:20.926 align:middle line:90%
is the movie "The Abyss."

00:31:20.926 --> 00:31:21.650 align:middle line:90%


00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:24.602 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:31:24.602 --> 00:31:50.387 align:middle line:90%


00:31:50.387 --> 00:31:52.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'll always
remember that part too,

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:54.770 align:middle line:84%
where he's typing
back to his girlfriend

00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:59.110 align:middle line:84%
while he's down there, going,
I knew it was a one way trip.

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:00.107 align:middle line:90%
Just a classic.

00:32:00.107 --> 00:32:00.815 align:middle line:90%
But he was saved!

00:32:00.815 --> 00:32:02.356 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yeah,
but he was saved.

00:32:02.356 --> 00:32:05.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Saved by the ETs.

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:07.355 align:middle line:90%
Brought him in and-- classic.

00:32:07.355 --> 00:32:08.605 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yeah, Ed Harris.

00:32:08.605 --> 00:32:09.104 align:middle line:90%
Love him.

00:32:09.104 --> 00:32:09.690 align:middle line:90%
He was great.

00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:13.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I've been a big
fan of submerged UFO cases.

00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:13.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yes.

00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:15.768 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's something
going on down there.

00:32:15.768 --> 00:32:16.750 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yeah.

00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:18.666 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So as you look
at all of this, Craig,

00:32:18.666 --> 00:32:23.010 align:middle line:84%
and specifically your work with
"Stranger at the Pentagon,"

00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:28.310 align:middle line:84%
if this becomes a big
movie, will the short clip--

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:29.430 align:middle line:90%
is that a standalone?

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:31.522 align:middle line:84%
Or you think you have
to have the big movie?

00:32:31.522 --> 00:32:32.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: No.

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:34.182 align:middle line:90%
The big movie has to be.

00:32:34.182 --> 00:32:35.640 align:middle line:84%
There's so much
more to this story.

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.348 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would it look
anything like what

00:32:37.348 --> 00:32:38.570 align:middle line:90%
the smaller version was?

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:43.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Well, those
are scenes from the big film.

00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:46.530 align:middle line:84%
They're shortened
scenes that are taken

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:48.410 align:middle line:90%
from the actual feature film.

00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:52.237 align:middle line:84%
And then, I ended it with a
cliffhanger in the short film.

00:32:52.237 --> 00:32:53.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which you
could still change.

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:55.695 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Which I
could-- right, exactly.

00:32:55.695 --> 00:32:59.634 align:middle line:84%
But the exciting thing is
that there's much information.

00:32:59.634 --> 00:33:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And there's so much of what
went on during the three years

00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:03.350 align:middle line:90%
that he was there.

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:05.720 align:middle line:90%
And what he had to endure.

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And Eisenhower and Nixon were
actually for his proposal.

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:16.400 align:middle line:84%
But it was the constant
battle with the Joint Chiefs,

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:20.090 align:middle line:90%
with the CIA and--

00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:21.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what
did Thor want to do?

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:23.680 align:middle line:90%
What was that proposal?

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:26.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Well,
the proposal that stood

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:32.330 align:middle line:84%
alone was to help eliminate
sickness, disease, and poverty,

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:33.700 align:middle line:90%
and to prolong life.

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:35.919 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, but that means
businesses could go out

00:33:35.919 --> 00:33:36.710 align:middle line:90%
of business, right?

00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:38.251 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: And
that's exactly what

00:33:38.251 --> 00:33:40.050 align:middle line:90%
they came back with in the end.

00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:42.720 align:middle line:84%
It would get rid of
pharmaceutical companies.

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:45.870 align:middle line:84%
It would get rid of doctors,
nurses, all of that.

00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:48.310 align:middle line:90%
But then, you think about it.

00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:50.684 align:middle line:84%
This world's based on
monetary and greed.

00:33:50.684 --> 00:33:51.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: So if
all of that went away,

00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:56.220 align:middle line:84%
then greed would have
to go away, right?

00:33:56.220 --> 00:34:00.120 align:middle line:84%
In their society,
everybody is the same,

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:04.960 align:middle line:84%
and everybody is taking care
of, and everybody is cared for,

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:07.510 align:middle line:84%
and everybody does all
different kinds of jobs.

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:09.560 align:middle line:84%
But they also live
very long lifespans.

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:14.690 align:middle line:84%
So they aren't considered
an adult until they're 75.

00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:16.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, why didn't
people like Eisenhower

00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:19.870 align:middle line:84%
fight and say, we're
going to do this?

00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:21.810 align:middle line:90%
We're going to implement this?

00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:24.469 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take this
plan and make it happen

00:34:24.469 --> 00:34:25.989 align:middle line:90%
and make this a better planet?

00:34:25.989 --> 00:34:27.040 align:middle line:90%
Why not do that?

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:29.110 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Well,
I'm not exactly

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:34.192 align:middle line:84%
sure of every little detail
that happened during that.

00:34:34.192 --> 00:34:35.650 align:middle line:84%
But there was a
lot of other things

00:34:35.650 --> 00:34:37.639 align:middle line:84%
that I know that
he was busy with.

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:43.219 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Frank told
me that he really

00:34:43.219 --> 00:34:48.730 align:middle line:84%
had befriended Richard Nixon as
well, because he was a lot more

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:50.400 align:middle line:90%
available and accessible.

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:52.719 align:middle line:84%
But that they really
did want this to happen.

00:34:52.719 --> 00:34:55.739 align:middle line:84%
And they were really
trying to help it.

00:34:55.739 --> 00:35:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Because they really did want
to help the American people.

00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:05.250 align:middle line:84%
Eisenhower really,
really talked about a lot

00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:09.360 align:middle line:84%
of stuff about the military
complex and all of that.

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:11.942 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was amazing.

00:35:11.942 --> 00:35:13.900 align:middle line:84%
I think I even have a
little quote that he did.

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:15.560 align:middle line:90%
I'll use my cheat sheet.

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:17.970 align:middle line:84%
He said, "I like to believe
that people, in the long run,

00:35:17.970 --> 00:35:21.420 align:middle line:84%
are going to do more to promote
peace than our governments.

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:24.426 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, I think that
people want peace so much

00:35:24.426 --> 00:35:26.050 align:middle line:84%
that, one of these
days, the government

00:35:26.050 --> 00:35:28.140 align:middle line:84%
had better get out of the
way and let them have it."

00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:28.765 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:35:28.765 --> 00:35:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And he also said
in his departure,

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:34.204 align:middle line:84%
be wary of the military
industrial complex.

00:35:34.204 --> 00:35:35.120 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Complex.

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:35.630 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:36.463 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He knew it.

00:35:36.463 --> 00:35:37.010 align:middle line:90%
He saw it.

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
happening right now.

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:39.229 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yes.

00:35:39.229 --> 00:35:41.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Richard
Nixon, apparently,

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:46.030 align:middle line:84%
saw extraterrestrials
at Homestead Military

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:49.300 align:middle line:84%
Base down in Florida and brought
Jackie Gleason to see them.

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:50.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: That's correct.

00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:52.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And apparently,
Jackie Gleason's

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:54.610 align:middle line:84%
life changed for the
rest of his life.

00:35:54.610 --> 00:35:56.880 align:middle line:90%
He was always interested in ETs.

00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And this just scared
him, mind-boggled him.

00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:02.059 align:middle line:90%
It did whatever it had to do.

00:36:02.059 --> 00:36:02.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yeah.

00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But Nixon
was in on this stuff.

00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:05.339 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: He was in on it.

00:36:05.339 --> 00:36:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And I even heard,
throughout the grapevine,

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:11.810 align:middle line:84%
that when Spielberg made "Close
Encounters" that he was taken

00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:13.710 align:middle line:90%
and shown the beings as well.

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:15.169 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That would
be fascinating.

00:36:15.169 --> 00:36:16.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Wouldn't
that be fascinating?

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:18.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would
you react to that?

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:19.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Wow!

00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:22.610 align:middle line:84%
Just to see them, if you
were brought, and saw them--

00:36:22.610 --> 00:36:24.105 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Would it be eerie?

00:36:24.105 --> 00:36:26.104 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: I don't
know if it would be eerie.

00:36:26.104 --> 00:36:28.190 align:middle line:84%
I think it'd be, well,
definitely otherworldly.

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And it would
definitely be something

00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:31.380 align:middle line:84%
that would stay with you
the rest of your life.

00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:32.546 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Would it scare you?

00:36:32.546 --> 00:36:34.856 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: It
wouldn't scare me.

00:36:34.856 --> 00:36:36.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: If you saw big heads--

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:37.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Big
heads and big eyes.

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:38.556 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --black eyes.

00:36:38.556 --> 00:36:40.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO:
Well, they're dead.

00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:40.350 align:middle line:90%
They're not alive.

00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:41.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Spiney hands.

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:43.865 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: They're not alive.

00:36:43.865 --> 00:36:46.324 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you wonder whether
they were good ETs, or not.

00:36:46.324 --> 00:36:47.698 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Or
if they weren't.

00:36:47.698 --> 00:36:48.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:49.910 align:middle line:90%
And that I don't know.

00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:50.660 align:middle line:90%
That I don't know.

00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:52.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, the
universe is so vast.

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:53.509 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yeah.

00:36:53.509 --> 00:36:55.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
the message you want

00:36:55.050 --> 00:36:59.232 align:middle line:84%
people to get when they watch
"Stranger at the Pentagon"?

00:36:59.232 --> 00:37:01.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: That there is
life out there in the universe.

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And that that life is
here helping us in ways

00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:12.100 align:middle line:84%
that we couldn't even
understand-- planetary-wise,

00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:14.690 align:middle line:90%
spiritually.

00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And helping us to live a more
enriched spiritual life as

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:23.870 align:middle line:84%
well, through all of
the different contacts

00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:25.760 align:middle line:84%
and through all of
the information that's

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:28.750 align:middle line:84%
being imparted and
brought into the world.

00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:31.370 align:middle line:84%
We know that over the
past 30, 40 years,

00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:35.860 align:middle line:84%
we've had a major giant spike
in spiritualism on the planet.

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:36.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huge.

00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:38.110 align:middle line:90%
Not necessarily religion.

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:40.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Not
religious, but people

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:44.620 align:middle line:84%
really believing in spirituality
and wanting to make themself

00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:45.120 align:middle line:90%
grow.

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:50.600 align:middle line:84%
So what people are now doing
is, instead of using their mind,

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:52.830 align:middle line:84%
they use their heart
to rule their mind.

00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you
stop thinking about,

00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:57.230 align:middle line:90%
what's best for me?

00:37:57.230 --> 00:38:00.910 align:middle line:84%
What can I do for me to
better get what I want?

00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:03.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's to help,
not only mankind,

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:04.650 align:middle line:90%
but all universal kind.

00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And they look at it from
that way, Valiant Thor

00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:08.812 align:middle line:90%
and that whole complement.

00:38:08.812 --> 00:38:10.270 align:middle line:84%
They look at it
from the standpoint

00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:14.460 align:middle line:84%
that they are here to help
all of universal-kind,

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:17.010 align:middle line:84%
because they are all
of universal-kind.

00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:17.820 align:middle line:90%
And they know that.

00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:18.861 align:middle line:90%
And they understand that.

00:38:18.861 --> 00:38:20.850 align:middle line:84%
So they're waiting
for us to catch up.

00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:23.585 align:middle line:84%
And when that day comes
and we rejoin with--

00:38:23.585 --> 00:38:24.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it will.

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:25.543 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: And it will.

00:38:25.543 --> 00:38:26.600 align:middle line:90%
It's got to.

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.870 align:middle line:90%
There's so many sightings.

00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:32.100 align:middle line:84%
There's so much stuff
that's going on.

00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And we hear new
things every day.

00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:36.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They could be
Valiant Thor's ships.

00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:37.666 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: They could be.

00:38:37.666 --> 00:38:39.124 align:middle line:90%
They absolutely could be.

00:38:39.124 --> 00:38:40.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
interesting too.

00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:42.930 align:middle line:84%
Here's another
thing-- the shroud

00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:49.610 align:middle line:84%
of secrecy that occurred
in '57-- why hasn't he

00:38:49.610 --> 00:38:51.610 align:middle line:90%
made himself more known today?

00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:55.950 align:middle line:84%
There's something going
on, which is preventing him

00:38:55.950 --> 00:38:58.397 align:middle line:90%
from simply saying, I'm here.

00:38:58.397 --> 00:38:59.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Right.

00:38:59.230 --> 00:38:59.650 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:01.024 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you think it is?

00:39:01.024 --> 00:39:03.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Well,
back in those days,

00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:05.910 align:middle line:84%
they were more
accessible, the beings.

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:07.170 align:middle line:90%
I know Valiant Thor was.

00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And actually, there's
been several people

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:12.080 align:middle line:84%
that have come forward since
I've made the film who actually

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:15.120 align:middle line:90%
met him back in the day.

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And their description of him
and the feeling that they got

00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:21.550 align:middle line:90%
were all the same.

00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:23.270 align:middle line:90%
Two of them are women.

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:24.740 align:middle line:84%
But the one thing
that both women

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:26.680 align:middle line:84%
said-- which was
interesting-- is

00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:30.370 align:middle line:84%
that there was a
pheromone about him that

00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:33.990 align:middle line:90%
smelled like love and peace.

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:35.095 align:middle line:90%
And you felt safe.

00:39:35.095 --> 00:39:35.845 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Goodness.

00:39:35.845 --> 00:39:37.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: And
goodness and beauty.

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And everybody feels
that when they meet him.

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And I think that when they
turned his proposal down,

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:48.000 align:middle line:84%
he turned to Dr.
Frank, who had happened

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.090 align:middle line:84%
to have been in Washington
giving a lecture on UFOs

00:39:52.090 --> 00:39:53.140 align:middle line:90%
and the Bible.

00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:57.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think that he was
his grassroots campaign

00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:59.760 align:middle line:90%
to continue the story.

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:01.780 align:middle line:90%
And Dr. Frank toured the world.

00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:04.751 align:middle line:84%
He used to go to Korea and
fill stadiums of people

00:40:04.751 --> 00:40:06.000 align:middle line:90%
who wanted to hear about this.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:06.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: People were into this.

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:06.800 align:middle line:90%
They still are.

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:07.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: They still are.

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:08.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But it was huge then.

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:10.289 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: But it
was really huge then.

00:40:10.289 --> 00:40:13.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was the
Valiant Thor visitation

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:16.782 align:middle line:84%
the basis for the movie "The
Day the Earth Stood Still"?

00:40:16.782 --> 00:40:17.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: No.

00:40:17.490 --> 00:40:18.990 align:middle line:90%
Because that was made--

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:20.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That came out before?

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:22.100 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: That
came out in 1951.

00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:22.910 align:middle line:90%
And Valiant Thor--

00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:23.565 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: About six years before.

00:40:23.565 --> 00:40:25.080 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: --arrived in '57.

00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:28.110 align:middle line:84%
But there were probably
others before him as well.

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:33.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what do you think,
then, of that movie coming out

00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:36.710 align:middle line:84%
six years before almost the
exact same thing happened

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:38.240 align:middle line:90%
in real life?

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:38.885 align:middle line:90%
That's bizarre.

00:40:38.885 --> 00:40:39.718 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Right.

00:40:39.718 --> 00:40:43.410 align:middle line:84%
So it makes you wonder,
could somebody else like that

00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:45.062 align:middle line:90%
have come?

00:40:45.062 --> 00:40:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We have seen--

00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:49.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: And they
wanted to see what

00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:50.390 align:middle line:90%
the world's reaction would be.

00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:53.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have seen
things happen in Hollywood,

00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:56.280 align:middle line:84%
like "The Lone Gunman,"
where it depicted

00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:59.170 align:middle line:90%
planes hitting tall buildings.

00:40:59.170 --> 00:41:02.600 align:middle line:90%
And then, 9/11 happens.

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:06.370 align:middle line:84%
So you've got the movie "The
Day the Earth Stood Still."

00:41:06.370 --> 00:41:09.097 align:middle line:84%
And then, a real, so-called
"visitation" occurs.

00:41:09.097 --> 00:41:09.930 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Right.

00:41:09.930 --> 00:41:13.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is Hollywood
so ahead of the curve?

00:41:13.330 --> 00:41:15.670 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO:
Well, I also think,

00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:18.215 align:middle line:84%
could those thoughts
be implanted?

00:41:18.215 --> 00:41:18.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe.

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:21.720 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Maybe Valiant
Thor implanted those thoughts

00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:25.352 align:middle line:84%
in a writer or Robert
Wise way back when.

00:41:25.352 --> 00:41:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or they're
told to do it--

00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:27.850 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Or
they're told to do it.

00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:29.058 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --by the government.

00:41:29.058 --> 00:41:30.150 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: That's true.

00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:32.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's so many
different scenarios

00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:33.740 align:middle line:90%
that could have happened.

00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure there
were other beings that

00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:39.390 align:middle line:90%
came before him as well.

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:46.160 align:middle line:84%
But Eisenhower was somebody
who was really hands-on

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:49.270 align:middle line:90%
with visitors, as we know.

00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:53.370 align:middle line:84%
Because he'd met with
many different visitors.

00:41:53.370 --> 00:41:56.610 align:middle line:84%
McElroy, the representative,
I think, from New Hampshire--

00:41:56.610 --> 00:41:58.760 align:middle line:84%
there's a whole
YouTube video of him

00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:01.800 align:middle line:84%
saying he saw the papers
on his desk of him

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:03.700 align:middle line:84%
meeting with several
extraterrestrial races.

00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:04.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Isn't that amazing?

00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:05.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yes.

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:06.350 align:middle line:90%
And that--

00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:07.603 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why would he
make this up, right?

00:42:07.603 --> 00:42:08.394 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Yeah.

00:42:08.394 --> 00:42:10.660 align:middle line:84%
And that they were here
to promote peace, love,

00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:11.930 align:middle line:90%
and goodwill.

00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And the video is
still on YouTube.

00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:17.766 align:middle line:90%
My channel is Craig Campobasso.

00:42:17.766 --> 00:42:19.640 align:middle line:84%
It's on that channel if
people can't find it.

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:21.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was going to
say-- where can people

00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:22.494 align:middle line:90%
get more information on you?

00:42:22.494 --> 00:42:23.410 align:middle line:90%
Through that YouTube--

00:42:23.410 --> 00:42:24.868 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Well,
through YouTube

00:42:24.868 --> 00:42:26.850 align:middle line:90%
and StrangeratthePentagon.com.

00:42:26.850 --> 00:42:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And then, my book website
is autobiographyofanET.com.

00:42:29.610 --> 00:42:32.069 align:middle line:90%


00:42:32.069 --> 00:42:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, good
luck in the quest

00:42:33.610 --> 00:42:35.774 align:middle line:84%
to get the financing to
turn this into a movie.

00:42:35.774 --> 00:42:37.190 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Thank
you very much.

00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:39.398 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Might you just take
it to a huge movie house

00:42:39.398 --> 00:42:40.401 align:middle line:90%
and have them do it?

00:42:40.401 --> 00:42:42.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPOBASSO: No,
because it has to remain

00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:44.040 align:middle line:84%
with private financing
so we can keep

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:45.900 align:middle line:90%
the spiritual story intact.

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:48.084 align:middle line:10%
Because if I were to do it--

00:42:48.084 --> 00:42:49.000 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Take it out--

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.249 align:middle line:10%
>>CAMPOBASSO: --with a studio,
then they have the say.

00:42:51.249 --> 00:42:53.980 align:middle line:10%
And they would make Valiant
Thor, Captain Universe,

00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:54.790 align:middle line:10%
literally.

00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:56.037 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And maybe evil.

00:42:56.037 --> 00:42:57.620 align:middle line:10%
>>CAMPOBASSO: Well,
and we don't know.

00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:01.017 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, and I promised Dr.
Frank I would never do that.

00:43:01.017 --> 00:43:03.100 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, good for
you for keeping your word.

00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:03.980 align:middle line:10%
>>CAMPOBASSO:
Yeah, it'll happen.

00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:04.580 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Craig, thanks--

00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:04.940 align:middle line:10%

you so much, George.

00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:14.437 align:middle line:84%

really exciting.
