>>PAUL PERRY: He said, I've
got this writer who can't

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.460 align:middle line:90%
pull the trigger on a book.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.840 align:middle line:90%
His name is Raymond Moody.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.040 align:middle line:90%
Have you ever heard of him?

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.360 align:middle line:90%
All these people came up.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And they said, I
can't wait till I die.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.900 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Whoa.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.060 align:middle line:84%
You came close to
dying yourself.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.615 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: Ventricular
tachycardia.

00:00:24.615 --> 00:00:25.490 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Oh, my God.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.260 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: The widowmaker,
as they call it.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Have you looked
at the death of Jesus?

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.500 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: I have not, but I've
looked at the life of Jesus.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.885 align:middle line:84%
There's whole medical
papers published

00:00:35.885 --> 00:00:37.760 align:middle line:84%
about did Jesus have a
near-death experience.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.630 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Exactly.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.152 align:middle line:84%
How do we know it wasn't
an extraterrestrial craft?

00:00:41.152 --> 00:00:42.110 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: We don't know.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.730 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: What are Holy relics?

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.028 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: They are
body parts of Saints.

00:00:47.028 --> 00:00:48.320 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Body parts of Saints.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.120 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Yeah.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.338 align:middle line:90%
Once a year, he would come out.

00:00:51.338 --> 00:00:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And he would show
them to the public.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:53.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: And they'd cheer?

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.952 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Some people would die.

00:00:54.952 --> 00:00:59.925 align:middle line:90%

>>GEORGE: Well, thanks for
joining us on "Beyond Belief."

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.910 align:middle line:10%
Paul Perry is with us,
a documentary filmmaker

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.820 align:middle line:10%
and co-author of several
incredible "New York Times"

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.300 align:middle line:10%
bestselling books, including
"Evidence of the Afterlife"

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.770 align:middle line:10%
and "Saved by the Light."

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.400 align:middle line:84%
Paul, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.200 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Thank you.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.340 align:middle line:84%
I've wanted to be on this
show for a long time.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Your works
are simply stupendous.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.370 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Thank you very much.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How did you
get involved in this?

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.060 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: Well, I was
editing a magazine

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.340 align:middle line:84%
in New York called
"American Health Magazine."

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.430 align:middle line:10%
It was the most successful
magazine of the '80s.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.910 align:middle line:10%
And one day, I got a
call from my book agent

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.130 align:middle line:10%
who wanted me to meet
him and have a hamburger.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.820 align:middle line:10%
And so we're having
this hamburger.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.450 align:middle line:10%
And he says, I've got this
writer who can't quite

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.430 align:middle line:10%
pull the trigger on a book.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.765 align:middle line:10%
His name is Raymond Moody.

00:01:47.765 --> 00:01:48.890 align:middle line:90%
Have you ever heard of him?

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And I said, no, I've never
heard of Raymond Moody.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And he says, well,
he works in the field

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.750 align:middle line:84%
of near-death experiences
and near-death studies.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.180 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever heard of
a near-death experience?

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.320 align:middle line:90%
I said, yeah.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.560 align:middle line:84%
People, they drown,
they see a tunnel.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.750 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not really
that interested.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And he said, look,
for the editor

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.820 align:middle line:84%
of a major magazine, a
major health magazine,

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.190 align:middle line:90%
you're not very smart.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.790 align:middle line:84%
You need to do a book
with Raymond Moody

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.450 align:middle line:84%
and understand what near-death
experiences are about.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.520 align:middle line:90%
So I did that.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.340 align:middle line:84%
And I flew to Georgia
where Raymond lived.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.400 align:middle line:90%


00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.100 align:middle line:84%
The first book we did together
was called "The Light Beyond."

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And that was supposed to
look at all the research that

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.880 align:middle line:84%
had been done since
life after life had

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.300 align:middle line:90%
been written 10 years earlier.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: So you
learned quickly.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:42.855 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: I learned quickly.

00:02:42.855 --> 00:02:44.880 align:middle line:90%
And I learned from the master.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.910 align:middle line:84%
Raymond is a wonderful,
wonderful teacher.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:47.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Think
the world of him.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.350 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: And we
got to this point

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.660 align:middle line:84%
where we finished
the book, but we

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.810 align:middle line:84%
had just a little tiny
bit in it about children

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.760 align:middle line:90%
and near-death experiences.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, isn't anyone
doing research on children

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.200 align:middle line:90%
in near-death experiences?

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.320 align:middle line:84%
And Raymond says, only
one person that I know,

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.330 align:middle line:84%
and that's a pediatrician in
Seattle named Melvin Morse.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.130 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Aha.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.340 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: And he said,
why don't you go see him

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.290 align:middle line:84%
if you're interested
in doing the book?

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.730 align:middle line:90%
So I called Melvin.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.580 align:middle line:84%
I went and stayed with
him, and convinced

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.910 align:middle line:84%
him to do a book on children
in near-death experiences.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:21.750 align:middle line:90%
And that came out.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.220 align:middle line:90%
It was "Closer to the Light".

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.150 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't sell
that book to anybody.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.610 align:middle line:84%
It was rejected
by 18 publishers.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:31.410 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Wow.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.050 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: And one
publisher, HarperCollins,

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.660 align:middle line:84%
Diane Reverand at
HarperCollins bought it.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And the day she called
to tell me she bought it,

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.610 align:middle line:84%
I had also received all
the rejection letters

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:42.740 align:middle line:90%
from the other publisher.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And they've stayed
your publisher, I think,

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.910 align:middle line:90%
haven't they?

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:45.480 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Mostly.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.720 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Yeah.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.960 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Yeah.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:46.960 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: In most books.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.920 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: And I was reading
these rejection letters.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And they're all saying
things like people don't care

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.850 align:middle line:90%
this much about their children.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.800 align:middle line:84%
This is a magazine
article, not a book.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.300 align:middle line:84%
There was a typo on page
two of the proposal.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And I won't take
it because of that.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.990 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, here's Diane
Reverand on the phone saying,

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.330 align:middle line:84%
if you do this right,
it's going to be huge.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.155 align:middle line:90%
And it was.

00:04:10.155 --> 00:04:11.460 align:middle line:90%
It came out.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.755 align:middle line:90%
Oprah grabbed it.

00:04:13.755 --> 00:04:15.463 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: It took off
like a rocket ship.

00:04:15.463 --> 00:04:16.630 align:middle line:10%
>>PERRY: Like a rocket ship.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:18.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: "Saved by
the Light," you're

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.339 align:middle line:84%
a co-author with
Dannion Brinkley.

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:22.650 align:middle line:90%
How did that relationship occur?

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.750 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: Well, I had
written two books now

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:28.980 align:middle line:90%
on near-death experiences.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.810 align:middle line:84%
One was "The Light
Beyond" with Raymond.

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.310 align:middle line:84%
The other was "Closer
to the Light."

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.727 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: So at
that point, you're

00:04:33.727 --> 00:04:35.040 align:middle line:90%
beginning to become the expert.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.957 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Trying to be.

00:04:35.957 --> 00:04:37.350 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Yeah.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.500 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: And I went to
a conference in Seattle

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.130 align:middle line:90%
and the conference with Melvin.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And after we spoke, all
these people came up.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And they said, I
can't wait till I die.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:51.630 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Whoa.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:52.430 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: And yeah.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.150 align:middle line:90%
And we both put the brakes on.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.460 align:middle line:84%
And then this happened
again in the next conference

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.020 align:middle line:90%
we were at and again.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And I said, that really isn't
what these books are about.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.110 align:middle line:84%
I need to do a book about
one case study, the best

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.225 align:middle line:84%
one I can find, that
shows the good and the bad

00:05:10.225 --> 00:05:11.350 align:middle line:90%
of a near-death experience.

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:12.150 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Sure.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.120 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: And so I went out
searching for the best case

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.200 align:middle line:90%
study.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And I found a number
of people but they just

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.860 align:middle line:90%
didn't seem right.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.210 align:middle line:84%
I didn't feel like I
could work with them.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.640 align:middle line:90%
And I went to Raymond's house.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.190 align:middle line:90%
Raymond lived in Alabama.

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking to
Raymond about this.

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And Raymond says, have you
ever met Dannion Brinkley?

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.030 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no, I hadn't.

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.340 align:middle line:84%
But at this point, I'd
known Raymond for two years.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And they were really
tight at that point.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.420 align:middle line:90%
But I'd never met Dannion.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.875 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
next time he's around,

00:05:41.875 --> 00:05:43.500 align:middle line:84%
you should come and
stay and visit him.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.720 align:middle line:90%
You should meet him.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.230 align:middle line:84%
10 minutes later, Dannion
comes blasting in the door.

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.010 align:middle line:90%
White t-shirt, covered with oil,

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.810 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Big guy.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.600 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Big guy, noisy.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.280 align:middle line:84%
He drove his car up to
get a wrench or something

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.080 align:middle line:90%
from Raymond.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: He's got
that little accent.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:00.650 align:middle line:90%


00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:01.740 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Yeah.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:02.650 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Hi, I'm
Dannion Brinkley.

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:03.910 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Total hillbilly.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
first time I met him.

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And he did what he does
so well, is he just

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.740 align:middle line:90%
read me, psychically, read me.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And we had all kinds
of great conversations

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.830 align:middle line:84%
about near-death experiences,
and people he had met,

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.660 align:middle line:90%
things that had happened to him.

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.760 align:middle line:84%
As soon as I got home,
I called Diane Reverand

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.830 align:middle line:90%
and called Nat, my agent.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And we all flew back to
Alabama and met with Dannion.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.010 align:middle line:84%
And by the end of
the day, he had

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.880 align:middle line:84%
done the same thing, same magic
to them that he had done to me.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.290 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: He wowed them.

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.210 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: And we had
a book contract.

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And his stories- hit
by lightning several times--

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.320 align:middle line:90%
it's just amazing.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.220 align:middle line:90%
Indeed.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.230 align:middle line:84%
You produced a
documentary called,

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:52.280 align:middle line:84%
"Afterlife," which
tells a incredible story

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.830 align:middle line:90%
about the afterlife.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:54.630 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.005 align:middle line:10%
>>PERRY: There
are a million ways

00:06:56.005 --> 00:07:00.960 align:middle line:10%
to die, perhaps two
million, perhaps even more.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:05.510 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we don't even know
how many ways there are to die.

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.360 align:middle line:84%
But one thing we do know
is that a high percentage

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.030 align:middle line:84%
of those who die have
what is commonly known

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:14.360 align:middle line:90%
as a near-death experience.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.760 align:middle line:84%
Many people report
going up a tunnel

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.020 align:middle line:84%
and seeing heavenly bodies
bathed in bright light.

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And a good number see their life
flashed before them in a life

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:29.170 align:middle line:84%
review and even enter
a heavenly realm.

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:32.200 align:middle line:84%
We have many representations
of near-death experiences

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.730 align:middle line:90%
all around us.

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:36.850 align:middle line:84%
Artists down through
history and in every culture

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:40.780 align:middle line:84%
have been there to record
these heavenly encounters.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.780 align:middle line:10%
It's as though mankind takes
a common path to heaven

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.810 align:middle line:10%
and always has.

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.760 align:middle line:10%
I know all about
near-death experiences,

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.910 align:middle line:10%
because I have written about
them, nine books and all

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:55.240 align:middle line:10%
with a number of the
field's top researchers.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:08:00.130 align:middle line:10%
I have looked at death in many
ways and in many cultures.

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:02.890 align:middle line:10%
Yet, funny thing,
in all the years

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:05.080 align:middle line:10%
I have studied and
written about death,

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.380 align:middle line:10%
I have rarely thought that
it would ever happen to me.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:11.620 align:middle line:10%
Most of the time, I thought
that I would always be here,

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.740 align:middle line:10%
a permanent inhabitant
of the living world.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:16.870 align:middle line:90%
What was it Sigmund Freud said?

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:19.090 align:middle line:84%
"When we attempt
to imagine death,

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:22.330 align:middle line:84%
we perceive ourselves
as spectators."

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:27.250 align:middle line:84%
Like most everyone else, I, too,
imagine myself as a spectator.

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:30.970 align:middle line:10%
I hid behind my writing,
safe for mortality.

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:35.470 align:middle line:10%
I had a box seat in the stadium
of mankind, an eternal observer

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:38.260 align:middle line:10%
in the game of life.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.650 align:middle line:90%
Then reality paid me a visit.

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:44.110 align:middle line:84%
It was a beautiful day
with spectacular light

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:45.610 align:middle line:90%
and clean air.

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:49.810 align:middle line:84%
It was, as they say,
a good day to die.

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:52.300 align:middle line:84%
I was out taking a
walk in the desert.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:56.410 align:middle line:10%
When out of nowhere, my heart
began to race fast and hard

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:58.270 align:middle line:10%
like a runaway engine.

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:01.270 align:middle line:10%
Before long, I was down and out.

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:04.540 align:middle line:10%
In a lucid moment, I realized
that I could easily become

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:06.610 align:middle line:10%
the subject of my own work.

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:09.250 align:middle line:10%
I imagine what that would
be like by remembering

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:12.100 align:middle line:10%
stories used in the
books I had written.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:14.560 align:middle line:10%
No longer did I believe
that the only thing

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:18.370 align:middle line:10%
wrong with immortality was
that it goes on forever.

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:21.380 align:middle line:10%
Or that it was a fate
worse than death.

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:24.920 align:middle line:84%
I wanted real answers
to the age-old question,

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:28.580 align:middle line:90%
what happens when we die?

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You came
close to dying yourself.

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:33.645 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: Ventricular
tachycardia.

00:09:33.645 --> 00:09:34.520 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Oh, my God.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.140 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Left ventricle.

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:38.990 align:middle line:90%
The widowmaker, as they call it.

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Did anybody
find you out there?

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.720 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: I actually,
finally, got up.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.570 align:middle line:90%
And my wife came over.

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:47.910 align:middle line:84%
My wife was there, and
helped me to the car.

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And we went to the Mayo
Clinic and got fixed.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.520 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: How long ago was that?

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.603 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: 15, 20 years ago.

00:09:56.603 --> 00:09:57.562 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Good for you.

00:09:57.562 --> 00:09:58.525 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Yeah.

00:09:58.525 --> 00:09:59.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Well,
that gives you, I

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:03.390 align:middle line:84%
think, the credibility to write
about near-death experiences.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:04.460 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: It does.

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:06.195 align:middle line:84%
When you stand
close to the edge,

00:10:06.195 --> 00:10:07.820 align:middle line:84%
you have a different
view of the world.

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.060 align:middle line:90%
That's for sure.

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:12.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What do you think
the other side is all about?

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.665 align:middle line:90%
What is it, Paul?

00:10:13.665 --> 00:10:15.290 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: Well, I have
this conversation

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:16.790 align:middle line:90%
a lot with Raymond.

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And what we know
is that people who

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:24.290 align:middle line:84%
have near-death
experiences, many of them

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:27.510 align:middle line:90%
go into a heavenly realm.

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:32.610 align:middle line:84%
They describe it as like
looking at a city at night

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:34.730 align:middle line:90%
and seeing the bright lights.

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:36.630 align:middle line:90%
That's one way they describe it.

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:41.700 align:middle line:84%
Others says it's a
very pastoral scene.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.950 align:middle line:84%
But the problem with
near-death experiences

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:46.632 align:middle line:84%
is that they're
gateway experiences.

00:10:46.632 --> 00:10:48.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What do
you mean by that?

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:50.970 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: Well, they'll take
you to the gate of eternity,

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:51.910 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:54.960 align:middle line:84%
But if you cross a boundary--
and there's almost always

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.060 align:middle line:84%
a boundary involved in a
near-death experience--

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.325 align:middle line:84%
people can't cross
a certain boundary.

00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And they're told, if
you cross this boundary,

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:01.890 align:middle line:90%
you're not coming back.

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:03.265 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You're
not coming back.

00:11:03.265 --> 00:11:05.280 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: And if they
cross that boundary,

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.600 align:middle line:90%
we don't know what happens.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.570 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what the
heavenly realm is like.

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:12.690 align:middle line:84%
So all we have is a
gateway experience

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:15.390 align:middle line:90%
where we go to the gates.

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:17.080 align:middle line:90%
We go to the city limits.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.470 align:middle line:84%
But we don't go right
into the city itself.

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:24.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Are you convinced
that the dying experience

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:27.300 align:middle line:90%
and the other side is real?

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:28.170 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: I am.

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:28.470 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:29.880 align:middle line:90%
I am absolutely convinced.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Were you
always convinced?

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:32.550 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: No, of course not.

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:32.850 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:34.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm very skeptical person.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:35.235 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: What changed you?

00:11:35.235 --> 00:11:37.590 align:middle line:84%
Meeting other people
or meeting situations?

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:39.030 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: No, not
my own situation.

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:41.940 align:middle line:84%
It was meeting other
people and studying it.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And realizing that here's one
of the most important things

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.840 align:middle line:84%
about near-death
experiences is that they're

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:53.590 align:middle line:84%
consistent experiences
throughout all cultures.

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:58.470 align:middle line:84%
So a Muslim in Egypt is
going to have the same--

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:01.120 align:middle line:84%
yeah, the same
symptoms, if you will,

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:05.940 align:middle line:84%
of a near-death experience as
someone here, someone in Omaha,

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:07.037 align:middle line:90%
for instance.

00:12:07.037 --> 00:12:09.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What are shared
death experiences, Paul?

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:15.090 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: Well, let me walk
into that a little bit.

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:17.900 align:middle line:84%
One of the problems with
the near-death experience

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.550 align:middle line:90%
is that it's subjective.

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:23.730 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, if you
have a near-death experience,

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:25.830 align:middle line:90%
you can only tell me about it.

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:27.040 align:middle line:90%
I can't experience it.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:27.840 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Right.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:31.200 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: And that's what makes
it a subjective experience.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's what makes it the
source of a lot of criticism

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:37.265 align:middle line:90%
by skeptics.

00:12:37.265 --> 00:12:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: The
skeptics think it's

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.710 align:middle line:90%
a figment of the imagination.

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:44.430 align:middle line:84%
Or it's the dying process
that creates this illusion.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:45.380 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: It's that.

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:46.380 align:middle line:90%
They think it's a dream.

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:49.650 align:middle line:84%
Or they think it's a
mechanistic aspect of our brain

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:51.810 align:middle line:90%
that triggers these elements.

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And people who have
near-death experiences

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.190 align:middle line:84%
generally don't have
all the elements

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:57.600 align:middle line:90%
of a near-death experience.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:58.950 align:middle line:90%
But they'll leave their body.

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:00.210 align:middle line:90%
They'll go up a tunnel.

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:01.680 align:middle line:90%
They'll see a dead relative.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:04.330 align:middle line:90%
They'll see a beam of light.

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:06.120 align:middle line:84%
So they're subjective
experiences,

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.800 align:middle line:84%
because you can't
really take me there.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.230 align:middle line:90%
You can only tell me about it.

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:13.210 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What tends
to send people back?

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:19.500 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: It's generally a beam
of light that speaks to you.

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.110 align:middle line:84%
It speaks to these people
and says, you can't leave.

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:23.040 align:middle line:90%
You can't go.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.710 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people want
to go beyond the boundary.

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And they're told by a beam
of light or just a voice

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:32.250 align:middle line:90%
that, sorry, you can't go.

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:33.420 align:middle line:90%
You have things to do.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:35.378 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Well, do you
think these shared death

00:13:35.378 --> 00:13:36.810 align:middle line:90%
experiences are the real deal?

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:37.320 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Yes.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.910 align:middle line:84%
I think shared death
experiences are

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:41.413 align:middle line:84%
completely different from
a near-death experience.

00:13:41.413 --> 00:13:43.080 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Our friend
Raymond Moody, whom

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:46.500 align:middle line:84%
we've mentioned
several times already,

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:49.080 align:middle line:84%
had an opportunity to talk
with you about the death

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.010 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:51.395 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Oh, that's great.

00:13:51.395 --> 00:13:52.770 align:middle line:10%
>>RAYMOND MOODY:
For a long time,

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:56.250 align:middle line:10%
we've known that people
who almost die and return

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:59.790 align:middle line:10%
have these extraordinary
experiences.

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:04.470 align:middle line:10%
But it's now becoming
quite obvious

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:06.930 align:middle line:10%
that this experience
is also very

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:10.080 align:middle line:10%
common among those
who are standing

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:13.560 align:middle line:10%
at the bedside of
a dying loved one.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:20.190 align:middle line:10%
That is, it's quite common
that when a loved one dies,

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:25.380 align:middle line:10%
the people standing
around will say that they

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.050 align:middle line:10%
seem to leave their bodies.

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:31.920 align:middle line:10%
They seem to accompany
the dying person partway

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.252 align:middle line:10%
into another realm.

00:14:33.252 --> 00:14:35.460 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: And these are people
who are not near death.

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:36.690 align:middle line:90%
They're perfectly well.

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:37.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Absolutely.

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:40.110 align:middle line:10%
They're just standing
there accompanying

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:43.800 align:middle line:10%
at the bedside
someone who is dying.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.370 align:middle line:10%
And all of the
effects that we hear

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:50.340 align:middle line:10%
from near-death
experiences are also

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:54.930 align:middle line:10%
present in the shared
death experiences.

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:59.200 align:middle line:10%
People say that they become
aware of a beautiful light.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.100 align:middle line:10%
A very common feature
is that they tell us

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:08.370 align:middle line:10%
that they see the relatives
of the deceased person coming

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:10.090 align:middle line:10%
to meet them and
to take them away.

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:10.890 align:middle line:10%
>>PERRY: Right.

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:14.880 align:middle line:90%


00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.460 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: Another very
common feature of this

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:19.890 align:middle line:10%
is that people will tell
us that they actually

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:25.650 align:middle line:10%
see the spirit of the person
who is dying stand up,

00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:30.870 align:middle line:10%
or rise up from the body
that's just deceased.

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:37.140 align:middle line:10%
Very often, this takes the form
of a misty globe, sometimes,

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:39.390 align:middle line:10%
a globe of golden light.

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:45.090 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes, it's described
more as a grayish cloud.

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:51.480 align:middle line:10%
And that this just rises
up, and typically passes

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.100 align:middle line:10%
through the ceiling.

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:56.460 align:middle line:10%
And quite a number of
cases, however, this

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:58.740 align:middle line:10%
is described as
having more of a form.

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:03.450 align:middle line:10%
People will say that as though
there were a transparent

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:06.540 align:middle line:10%
replica of the
person who is dying,

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:10.050 align:middle line:10%
just sort of sits up or
stands up out of the body,

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:12.520 align:middle line:10%
and goes away.

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:14.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: He is one of
a kind, isn't he, Paul?

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:16.170 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: He's wonderful.

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:21.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: He makes the
dying process seems so real.

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:22.990 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: He does.

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:26.238 align:middle line:90%
He almost makes it seem fun.

00:16:26.238 --> 00:16:27.280 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: I'm in no rush.

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:28.090 align:middle line:90%
Either are you.

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:28.930 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: No, I'm not.

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:30.472 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: But when
we get there, it's

00:16:30.472 --> 00:16:32.230 align:middle line:84%
nice to be able to
know, because do

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:35.860 align:middle line:84%
you think when that time
comes, we'll think back

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:40.142 align:middle line:84%
at moments like this, and go,
oh, yeah, we talked about that?

00:16:40.142 --> 00:16:41.350 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Oh, I think we will.

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:43.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when the
time comes, I think

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:46.450 align:middle line:84%
we'll have a very
extensive life review.

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:50.800 align:middle line:84%
That's one thing that almost
all near-death experiences have.

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.590 align:middle line:84%
Where they go back and they
review their entire life

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:56.410 align:middle line:84%
in minute detail,
and they generally

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:58.690 align:middle line:84%
do it with kind of a
babysitter, if you will.

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:01.493 align:middle line:84%
Someone who's speaking to
them, and saying, oh, you

00:17:01.493 --> 00:17:02.410 align:middle line:90%
should have done this.

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:04.342 align:middle line:90%
You shouldn't have done that.

00:17:04.342 --> 00:17:05.800 align:middle line:84%
But they aren't
there to shame you.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:10.180 align:middle line:84%
They're just there to help
you understand how you could

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:12.080 align:middle line:90%
have operated better in life.

00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:14.080 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Have you looked
at the death of Jesus?

00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:16.880 align:middle line:90%


00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.369 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: I have not.

00:17:19.369 --> 00:17:21.890 align:middle line:84%
But I've looked at
the life of Jesus.

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:25.809 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Because I think he
had a shared death experience.

00:17:25.809 --> 00:17:27.770 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: We had that
discussion a lot.

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:31.790 align:middle line:84%
Did Jesus have-- I mean,
there's whole medical papers

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:32.750 align:middle line:90%
published about that.

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:34.390 align:middle line:84%
Did Jesus have a
near-death experience?

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:35.190 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Exactly.

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:38.730 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: And that's
a great question.

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:40.020 align:middle line:90%
That's a great question.

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:42.437 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I mean, something
happened 2,000 years ago.

00:17:42.437 --> 00:17:43.270 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Absolutely.

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:47.277 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Something very
mystical, very supernatural.

00:17:47.277 --> 00:17:48.110 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Yeah, sure.

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:51.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And God, I would love
to have been a witness to that.

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:53.850 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: But then it carried
on beyond a shared death

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:54.650 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:57.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could
easily classify it

00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:58.970 align:middle line:90%
as a shared death experience.

00:17:58.970 --> 00:17:59.630 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: I think so.

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:01.213 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: But then
there's other things

00:18:01.213 --> 00:18:04.970 align:middle line:84%
that happen where he
later appeared later

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:06.110 align:middle line:90%
to different people.

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:07.242 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: In
different places, too.

00:18:07.242 --> 00:18:08.700 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: In different
places, yeah.

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:12.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's a lot of
different places actually.

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And so that takes it
into a different realm

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:17.720 align:middle line:90%
from shared death experiences.

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.850 align:middle line:84%
That takes it into an
actual resurrection.

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:22.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Tell me
about Jesus in Egypt.

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:26.210 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: Well, I got
intrigued by Jesus

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:28.200 align:middle line:90%
in Egypt when I went to Egypt.

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:30.072 align:middle line:90%
And I think it was in 1995.

00:18:30.072 --> 00:18:32.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: My dad was born
in Cairo, by the way.

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:33.830 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: I thought so.

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:35.300 align:middle line:90%
I thought so.

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And I went to Egypt to do a
documentary film on the Stone

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:41.720 align:middle line:90%
Temples of the Nile.

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:44.900 align:middle line:90%
And so we just flew to Egypt.

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
exhausting flight.

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And we flew to Egypt,
immediately got

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:52.730 align:middle line:84%
on another plane, flew
way out to Abu Simbel.

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:54.643 align:middle line:84%
And we had our production
boat out there.

00:18:54.643 --> 00:18:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And we got on the
production boat.

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:57.560 align:middle line:90%
Everyone's exhausted.

00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting on
the bow of the boat.

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:03.830 align:middle line:84%
Because we're there to work
on a documentary on the Stone

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:04.700 align:middle line:90%
Temples of the Nile.

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:05.180 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Right.

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:07.180 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: And I'm sitting
on the bow of the boat.

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden
across the desert,

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:14.450 align:middle line:84%
there's three guys on
camels all dressed in white.

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:17.396 align:middle line:90%
And I thought--

00:19:17.396 --> 00:19:18.630 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Too biblical.

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:19.838 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: It was too biblical.

00:19:19.838 --> 00:19:21.710 align:middle line:90%
And I thought Jesus was here.

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:22.580 align:middle line:90%
It's in Matthew.

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:26.985 align:middle line:84%
It says that he came to Egypt
to get away from King Herod.

00:19:26.985 --> 00:19:27.785 align:middle line:90%
The whole family--

00:19:27.785 --> 00:19:28.040 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: He escaped.

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:28.873 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: He escaped.

00:19:28.873 --> 00:19:30.680 align:middle line:90%
The whole family fled.

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:34.610 align:middle line:90%
And what's left of him here?

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:37.220 align:middle line:90%
Do people know what he did?

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:40.550 align:middle line:84%
If you do the math on
the verses in the Bible,

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:43.460 align:middle line:84%
there's only a few verses
about him being in Egypt.

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:47.092 align:middle line:84%
There's only a verse that
says they fled from Israel.

00:19:47.092 --> 00:19:48.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: He was a
boy when they came in.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:52.250 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: He was very young,
probably about two years old.

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And then five verses
later, they leave Egypt.

00:19:56.930 --> 00:20:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't really tell
what he did while he was there.

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:03.500 align:middle line:84%
So I started asking
people in every town

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.840 align:middle line:90%
we'd get to in the boat.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.755 align:middle line:90%
Jesus was here.

00:20:08.755 --> 00:20:09.880 align:middle line:90%
What do you know about him?

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.400 align:middle line:84%
Everybody, I was asking
all kinds of people.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:12.988 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And they
knew who he was.

00:20:12.988 --> 00:20:14.280 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Well, they're Muslims.

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.850 align:middle line:84%
So Jesus has a really
big place in the Quran.

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:19.770 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: He does.

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:22.170 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: And so does
the Holy Family.

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:24.600 align:middle line:84%
So they all started
telling me stories.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.630 align:middle line:10%
They said, well, he
was here in Matariya.

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:29.610 align:middle line:10%
And there's a tree
there that they

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:33.090 align:middle line:10%
say has continued to
grow for 2,000 years that

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:34.170 align:middle line:10%
shows he was there.

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:37.440 align:middle line:90%
Or he was in Gabal al-Tayr.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.990 align:middle line:90%
And in parts of Cairo--

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:43.050 align:middle line:84%
Cairo didn't exist
then, but the area did.

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And so I started getting
these stories from Egyptians

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:50.400 align:middle line:90%
and putting them on a map.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And I had pins and I would
put the map, map his course

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.840 align:middle line:90%
through Egypt.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: He was
all over the place.

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:00.140 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: He was.

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:04.050 align:middle line:84%
But then I was able to contact
Pope Shenouda who's the Coptic

00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:07.020 align:middle line:90%
Pope for Coptic Christians.

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:08.820 align:middle line:90%
And he says, well, I have a map.

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:12.560 align:middle line:84%
We've just finished
a map of where Jesus

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.450 align:middle line:90%
was, where the Holy Family was.

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And we put together
a synod of bishops

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:20.400 align:middle line:84%
to decide if this map
is authentic or not.

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.500 align:middle line:90%
And they had Muslims.

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:24.600 align:middle line:84%
And they had Coptic
bishops as well.

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:27.290 align:middle line:84%
And he gave me a
copy of the map.

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:32.210 align:middle line:84%
So at that point, that
became the focus of my life.

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:33.860 align:middle line:90%
I had to go to Egypt.

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And I had to go visit all the
sites that Jesus had visited.

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:39.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And you
produced a documentary.

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:42.710 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: I produced a document--
well, I first wrote a book.

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:43.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: "Jesus in Egypt".

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: "Jesus in Egypt".

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:45.390 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: So beautiful.

00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:45.860 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: It's out there now.

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:47.277 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Let's
take a little look

00:21:47.277 --> 00:21:48.650 align:middle line:90%
at the clip of this documentary.

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:58.450 align:middle line:90%


00:21:58.450 --> 00:21:59.950 align:middle line:10%
>>PERRY: I'm curious
to know how you

00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:02.890 align:middle line:10%
could tell where this Holy
Family trail is looking back

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:05.135 align:middle line:10%
2,000 years.

00:22:05.135 --> 00:22:06.010 align:middle line:10%
>>BISHOP MARCOS: Yes.

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:11.750 align:middle line:10%
In the Bible, in the New
Testament, the angel appears.

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:19.510 align:middle line:10%
And there are a vision to Joseph
to take the baby and his mother

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:20.848 align:middle line:10%
to go to Egypt.

00:22:20.848 --> 00:22:22.390 align:middle line:10%
>>PERRY: Both the
Pope and the Bishop

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:25.030 align:middle line:10%
thought that I should start
my journey in the same place

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:27.205 align:middle line:10%
that the Holy Family
crossed into Egypt.

00:22:27.205 --> 00:22:53.720 align:middle line:90%


00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:57.840 align:middle line:10%
Now the Holy Family came through
here about 2,000 years ago.

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:01.082 align:middle line:10%
What did they see at this
temple complex of Tel Basta?

00:23:01.082 --> 00:23:02.540 align:middle line:10%
>>LUTFY SHERIF:
Christian tradition

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:04.760 align:middle line:10%
says that Jesus
and the Holy Family

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.890 align:middle line:10%
arrived here at Tel Basta.

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:09.390 align:middle line:10%
And the locals rejected them.

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:11.810 align:middle line:10%
And so Jesus, more
or less out of anger,

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:15.240 align:middle line:10%
destroyed all the temples.

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:18.620 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: It must be amazing
to walk on the same ground

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:19.752 align:middle line:90%
that Jesus walked on.

00:23:19.752 --> 00:23:20.960 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Oh, it's incredible.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the archeologists
say that when

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:26.750 align:middle line:84%
you go to the pyramids now,
it looked exactly the same way

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:29.460 align:middle line:84%
that it looked when
Jesus came through.

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And then you're going to places
that tourists don't go to when

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:36.520 align:middle line:90%
you follow the trail of Jesus.

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And you see a lot of things
that have never really

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.120 align:middle line:90%
been seen before.

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.450 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we showed this,
we had the premiere

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:47.720 align:middle line:84%
for this with the
Mubarak family.

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:51.515 align:middle line:84%
And he used to be president of
Egypt till he got overthrown.

00:23:51.515 --> 00:23:53.760 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE: --ousted him
out in the Arab Spring.

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:54.560 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Right.

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And we showed it in the opera
in the opera house at Cairo.

00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And he brought 1,600
of his best friends.

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: 1,600?

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:02.300 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Yeah.

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And we sat up in a
hardened opera box, my wife

00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:10.460 align:middle line:84%
and I with Mrs. Mubarak, and
Mr. Mubarak, and Boutros-Ghali,

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:12.740 align:middle line:84%
and a number of other
people, luminaries.

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And Mrs. Mubarak kept
turning around to us,

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:19.025 align:middle line:84%
and saying this is an Egypt
I've never seen before.

00:24:19.025 --> 00:24:19.825 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Really?

00:24:19.825 --> 00:24:20.625 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Yeah.

00:24:20.625 --> 00:24:22.160 align:middle line:84%
And she said that
a number of times.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.930 align:middle line:90%
It's really very true.

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:26.693 align:middle line:84%
It's way, way off
the beaten path.

00:24:26.693 --> 00:24:28.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Tell me the
significance, Paul, of "

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:31.230 align:middle line:90%
Jesus in Egypt" in your opinion.

00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:36.050 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: Well, he
was with us 33 years.

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And the Bible covers
only 3 and 1/2 years.

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:42.237 align:middle line:84%
Well, it covers
actually covers about--

00:24:42.237 --> 00:24:43.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Not a lot.

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:43.870 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Not a lot.

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:45.990 align:middle line:84%
It covers a bit
less than 10 years.

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:49.310 align:middle line:84%
And so the significance
to me is that there's

00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:54.020 align:middle line:84%
a lot of information out there
that wasn't used in the Bible.

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of those
are oral tradition,

00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:02.750 align:middle line:84%
which Middle Eastern Christians
believe is grade A gospel.

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:05.120 align:middle line:90%
And so I used a lot of those.

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:07.700 align:middle line:84%
The Quran has a lot
of stories in it

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:09.920 align:middle line:84%
about Jesus and
about Mary and Joseph

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.330 align:middle line:84%
that the Bible
doesn't have at all.

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:14.450 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to combine
all of these stories

00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:18.230 align:middle line:84%
to tell as complete
a story as I could

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:22.960 align:middle line:84%
about what I always call the
secret childhood of Jesus.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.610 align:middle line:84%
Because I think it's important
to know what kind of a child

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:26.410 align:middle line:90%
he was.

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:29.958 align:middle line:84%
It's important to know
that he did divine things.

00:25:29.958 --> 00:25:32.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I was going to say,
did he do mystical things then?

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:33.958 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: He did do
mystical things.

00:25:33.958 --> 00:25:36.070 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, he did a lot
of healings according

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:37.240 align:middle line:90%
to the oral tradition.

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:38.800 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: At a young age?

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.840 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: A very young
age, about three or four.

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.240 align:middle line:90%
He was born as if a man.

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:46.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Did he know who he was
at that time, in your opinion?

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:49.630 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: I think it's
clear that he did.

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:51.070 align:middle line:90%
He knew he was very special.

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And of course, his family
knew he was very special.

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:57.850 align:middle line:84%
And he showed this specialness
by going through Egypt

00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:02.290 align:middle line:84%
and doing miracle after miracle
until people were literally

00:26:02.290 --> 00:26:03.350 align:middle line:90%
following him.

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:05.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How old was
when he left Egypt?

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:08.650 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: Oh, he was about
5 and 1/2 years old.

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:11.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And they came back
to, where, the Middle East?

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:11.910 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Yeah.

00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:14.320 align:middle line:84%
According to the
Bible, and according

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:16.870 align:middle line:84%
to the information I
found, they left Asyut,

00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:18.760 align:middle line:90%
which is the center of Egypt.

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And they and they took
a boat back to Israel.

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: When they were out
of danger from Herod, right?

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:26.500 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Yes.

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:27.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:29.170 align:middle line:84%
They were contacted
by an angel in Asyut.

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And Asyut now,
interestingly enough, is it

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:35.950 align:middle line:84%
has a church dedicated to
that, in an area called

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Gabal al-Tayr, which
is mountain of fire.

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's where they say
that the Holy Family lived

00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:45.940 align:middle line:84%
for nine months until they
got the message from an angel

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:47.830 align:middle line:84%
that they could
return to Israel.

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:54.520 align:middle line:84%
But now, in that area,
there's repeat visions

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:57.320 align:middle line:90%
that occur from the sky.

00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:58.120 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Still?

00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:58.920 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Still.

00:26:58.920 --> 00:26:59.730 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:03.090 align:middle line:90%
And I photographed one.

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:05.027 align:middle line:90%
I photographed one.

00:27:05.027 --> 00:27:06.360 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: What did it look like?

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:09.400 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: It looked
like a shower of light.

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:11.970 align:middle line:90%
And it was orange.

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And it came down on
top of this church.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.470 align:middle line:90%
But the church was white.

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:17.830 align:middle line:90%
And you could tell that it--

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:18.630 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Wow

00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:20.310 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: It wasn't something.

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:22.020 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't an anomaly
that happened.

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:23.437 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How do
we know it wasn't

00:27:23.437 --> 00:27:24.630 align:middle line:90%
an extraterrestrial craft?

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:25.654 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: We don't know.

00:27:25.654 --> 00:27:26.454 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Possible?

00:27:26.454 --> 00:27:27.390 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Possible.

00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:31.980 align:middle line:84%
I took it to the Apple
lab at American University

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:34.530 align:middle line:90%
and had them examine it.

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:36.210 align:middle line:90%
And they examined it.

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And they said this was not
something that happened.

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:43.440 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't a flare on the lens,
that it was truly something

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.660 align:middle line:90%
that came down from the sky.

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:47.100 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That is dramatic.

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:50.400 align:middle line:84%
So he leaves Egypt,
goes back to Palestine.

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:51.810 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Goes back to Israel.

00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:54.963 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE: I guess, right?

00:27:54.963 --> 00:27:56.130 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Then he disappears.

00:27:56.130 --> 00:27:58.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Just disappears
until he pops up again

00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:01.020 align:middle line:90%
when he's close to, what, 30?

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:05.190 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: Well, he pops up again
at the age of 12 for one day.

00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And then after that, from the
age of 12 until the age of 30,

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:12.820 align:middle line:90%
he's off the charts.

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:13.620 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Charts.

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: He's off
the Bible charts.

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:20.850 align:middle line:84%
But there's a number of stories
and books in the Bible--

00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:23.700 align:middle line:84%
and books-- that did not
make it into the Bible.

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
stories that I relied on

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:28.720 align:middle line:90%
to do "Jesus in Egypt."

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And my intention is
to go ahead and do

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:37.440 align:middle line:84%
the rest of the trip that covers
the next 17 or 18 years where

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:39.820 align:middle line:90%
he left home, went to Israel.

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:42.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: He was one
of a kind, obviously.

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:47.263 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: The most important
person in history.

00:28:47.263 --> 00:28:48.430 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Changed the world.

00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:50.140 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: The most
formidable, easily.

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:50.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Do you think
he was the real deal?

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: He has to
be the real deal.

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:57.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he exhibited
so much power and power

00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:58.910 align:middle line:90%
through kindness.

00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:00.503 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: What are Holy relics?

00:29:00.503 --> 00:29:01.670 align:middle line:90%
You've done some work there.

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:08.080 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: Holy relics, they
are body parts of Saints.

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.535 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Body parts of Saints?

00:29:09.535 --> 00:29:11.035 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: Yeah, body
parts of Saints.

00:29:11.035 --> 00:29:12.820 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Like ears and fingers?

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:14.470 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Fingers, ears, noses.

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:16.980 align:middle line:90%


00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:19.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Where
were they obtained?

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:26.780 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: Well, supposedly
they were obtained from Saints

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:29.410 align:middle line:90%
after the Saints died.

00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:33.328 align:middle line:84%
And then they were spirited
away by Christians.

00:29:33.328 --> 00:29:35.620 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: So a Saint would
die and they'd chop them up?

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:38.680 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: Or if they weren't
chopped up before by people

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:40.340 align:middle line:90%
who didn't like them.

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:41.140 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: My God.

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:43.057 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: So if you have
Matthew, for instance,

00:29:43.057 --> 00:29:47.950 align:middle line:84%
Matthew, when Christ
was crucified,

00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:50.880 align:middle line:90%
Matthew went to Alexandria.

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And he started preaching
the word in Alexandria.

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:55.440 align:middle line:90%
And he had his head cut off.

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.403 align:middle line:90%
And his head is now a relic.

00:29:57.403 --> 00:29:58.320 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Where is it?

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:00.900 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Well, it was in Egypt.

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:04.130 align:middle line:84%
The Coptic Christian
church had it.

00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:05.870 align:middle line:90%
The Catholics took it.

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And the Catholics put
it in the Vatican.

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:09.290 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: His skull.

00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:10.880 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: His skull,
for several years

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:13.858 align:middle line:84%
until recently until the
last three or four years.

00:30:13.858 --> 00:30:15.150 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: They had it actually?

00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:16.400 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: They actually had it.

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:19.588 align:middle line:84%
And they gave it back
to Coptic Christians.

00:30:19.588 --> 00:30:20.630 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That's amazing.

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:22.250 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: Well, there's a
lot of trade that goes on

00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:23.570 align:middle line:90%
in body parts, if you will.

00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:28.580 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Is there any feeling
of special, supernatural things

00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:30.200 align:middle line:90%
when you're close to it?

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:31.730 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: There's
always a feeling

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:35.720 align:middle line:84%
when I'm close to all
of this stuff, when

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:39.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm close to Holy
relics, for instance.

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:41.210 align:middle line:90%
Holy relics are amazing.

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:44.150 align:middle line:84%
And I never had thought
about them in my whole life

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:47.300 align:middle line:84%
until I became a
Knight in Portugal.

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:51.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a Knight with the
Portuguese royal house.

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:51.920 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Oh, good.

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:54.940 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: And I've
met a fellow there

00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:58.450 align:middle line:84%
named Carlos Evaristo who's
the Vatican relic expert

00:30:58.450 --> 00:30:59.800 align:middle line:90%
in Portugal.

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And he introduced me to
their private collection

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:08.135 align:middle line:84%
which is 25,000 certified relics
that they have at the castle--

00:31:08.135 --> 00:31:09.010 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Body parts?

00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:10.310 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: --in Ourém castle.

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:11.110 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:13.277 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What's the
significance of the body parts?

00:31:13.277 --> 00:31:14.880 align:middle line:90%
What do they do?

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:17.650 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: They're
objects of veneration.

00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:18.450 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Simple.

00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:20.892 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: People think they heal.

00:31:20.892 --> 00:31:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Get some
sort of a finger

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:24.000 align:middle line:90%
and rub it over you, or what?

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.380 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: You just being in
the same room, praying to it.

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:27.180 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Really?

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:27.660 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Yeah.

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:28.740 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I've
never heard of this.

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:29.130 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Oh, yeah.

00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:29.930 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:34.300 align:middle line:84%
Really, they're in beautiful
reliquaries, they're called.

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:37.150 align:middle line:84%
They're in little
golden church--

00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:38.230 align:middle line:90%
that looks like churches.

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:39.813 align:middle line:84%
They're in these
little golden houses.

00:31:39.813 --> 00:31:42.520 align:middle line:90%


00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:45.940 align:middle line:84%
There's one where there's
a bone of a Saint.

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:49.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's in a reliquary that
looks like the whole hand

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:49.940 align:middle line:90%
and the bone.

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:50.982 align:middle line:90%
And you can see a window.

00:31:50.982 --> 00:31:52.420 align:middle line:90%
And you can see the bone.

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:53.280 align:middle line:90%
It is fascinating.

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Well, you
produced a documentary

00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:56.840 align:middle line:90%
called "Relic Kingdoms".

00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:57.640 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Yes.

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:01.697 align:middle line:84%
And what I was doing was going
all over Europe filming relics.

00:32:01.697 --> 00:32:02.530 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: All right.

00:32:02.530 --> 00:32:03.310 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:04.110 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Yeah.

00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:07.600 align:middle line:10%
Oh, Indiana Jones,
you chose poorly.

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:10.330 align:middle line:10%
You spent years reading
ancient manuscripts

00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:13.400 align:middle line:10%
and scouring antique
maps to find the Holy

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:17.050 align:middle line:10%
Grail, the cup of the
Last Supper of Jesus

00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:20.410 align:middle line:10%
Christ, the most sought
after relic of all times.

00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:24.980 align:middle line:90%


00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:26.750 align:middle line:10%
Yet none found it.

00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:28.760 align:middle line:10%
Even you, Indy.

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:30.740 align:middle line:10%
You went to the
deserts of Jordan

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:35.690 align:middle line:10%
and found, well, a fiction,
imitation grails guarded

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:39.170 align:middle line:10%
by a bewildered and
immortal knight.

00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:41.450 align:middle line:10%
All false, Mr. Jones.

00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:43.970 align:middle line:10%
The real Grail wasn't there.

00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:47.870 align:middle line:10%
That's because it's
here in Valencia, Spain

00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:50.970 align:middle line:10%
where it has been for
hundreds of years.

00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:56.030 align:middle line:10%
At first, hidden, but
now in plain sight.

00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:57.940 align:middle line:10%
This is the story
of the real cup

00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:02.290 align:middle line:10%
of the Last Supper, the
first relic of Christendom,

00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:07.060 align:middle line:10%
the one and only Holy Grail.

00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: That's a
fascinating documentary, Paul.

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:11.410 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: It's kind of amazing.

00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:13.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What are the
implications for all of us

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:15.700 align:middle line:90%
with these Holy relics?

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:18.100 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: Well, there's
none unless you're

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:19.240 align:middle line:90%
a member of the faith.

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:23.350 align:middle line:84%
I will say that almost every
religion that's non Protestant

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:25.750 align:middle line:90%
has relics.

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:29.960 align:middle line:84%
In Egypt, every
church has the bones

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:33.850 align:middle line:90%
of St. Michael, St. George.

00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:34.782 align:middle line:90%
It goes on and on.

00:33:34.782 --> 00:33:36.490 align:middle line:84%
But there are just
little powdered bones.

00:33:36.490 --> 00:33:38.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everyone says,
well, they couldn't possibly

00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:41.890 align:middle line:84%
have all the bones of St.
George because they would have

00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:43.960 align:middle line:90%
5,000 pounds worth of bones.

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:45.140 align:middle line:90%
But that's not the case.

00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:48.810 align:middle line:84%
They just have a little
bit of powder from Jesus.

00:33:48.810 --> 00:33:51.760 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And Jesus,
of course, resurrected.

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:53.650 align:middle line:90%
There are no bones.

00:33:53.650 --> 00:33:54.970 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Right, right.

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:57.302 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Wouldn't that be
amazing though to have that?

00:33:57.302 --> 00:33:58.510 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: That'd be wonderful.

00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:02.410 align:middle line:84%
But it's like it's our
connection to the divine.

00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:06.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's how people who
believe in relics and worship

00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:07.390 align:middle line:90%
relics look at them.

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:10.340 align:middle line:84%
They look at them as a
connection to the divine.

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:14.110 align:middle line:84%
So in France, for instance,
you had Louis 11th

00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:17.860 align:middle line:84%
who ruled that country, because
he was called the Relic King.

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:19.900 align:middle line:90%
And he had the crown of thorns.

00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And we had an opportunity to
work with the crown of thorns.

00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:25.360 align:middle line:90%
But he had the crown of thorns.

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:28.179 align:middle line:84%
Once a year, he
would come out and he

00:34:28.179 --> 00:34:30.125 align:middle line:84%
would show them to the
public, hold them up,

00:34:30.125 --> 00:34:31.000 align:middle line:90%
and that would be it.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.125 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: And they'd cheer?

00:34:32.125 --> 00:34:33.423 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Some people would die.

00:34:33.423 --> 00:34:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Tell me
the significance

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:38.620 align:middle line:84%
of all of this with afterlife,
which is what we talked about

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:40.440 align:middle line:90%
in the beginning.

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:43.170 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: Well, it
all links somewhere.

00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:46.889 align:middle line:84%
I think it all links
in the spiritual realm

00:34:46.889 --> 00:34:49.199 align:middle line:84%
where you go from
near-death experiences

00:34:49.199 --> 00:34:50.460 align:middle line:90%
to shared death experiences.

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:53.550 align:middle line:90%
There's a clear link there.

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And then it's not a big step to
be wanting to deal with Egypt

00:34:58.260 --> 00:34:59.850 align:middle line:90%
and to deal with Jesus.

00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:03.990 align:middle line:84%
Egypt is the first Resurrection
religion in history.

00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's where almost all
Resurrection teachings came

00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:11.560 align:middle line:90%
from until the time of Jesus.

00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:14.648 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a really big step
to make that jump to Egypt.

00:35:14.648 --> 00:35:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Yet the
ancients believed in life

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:19.300 align:middle line:84%
after death way beyond
and before Jesus.

00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:20.100 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: They did.

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:21.030 align:middle line:90%
But oh, yeah.

00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:21.870 align:middle line:90%
They definitely did.

00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:22.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:23.280 align:middle line:90%
You can see that.

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure it was
before Egypt even.

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:28.980 align:middle line:84%
But you can see evidence of it
on the walls of Egypt, which

00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:30.430 align:middle line:90%
are thousands of years old.

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
near-death experiences

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:36.028 align:middle line:90%
written in the walls.

00:35:36.028 --> 00:35:38.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Well, they had books,
the Tibetan Book of the Dead,

00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:40.820 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptian Book
of the Dead, where

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:43.730 align:middle line:84%
it was basically
a guide on what's

00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:44.970 align:middle line:90%
going to happen when you die.

00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:45.770 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: That's it.

00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:48.198 align:middle line:90%
And you can see it on the walls.

00:35:48.198 --> 00:35:49.490 align:middle line:90%
You can read it in those books.

00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:53.810 align:middle line:84%
It's my theory that Resurrection
religion, even to the day,

00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:57.920 align:middle line:84%
even till now, came
largely from the Egyptians.

00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:58.988 align:middle line:90%
They kind of codified it.

00:35:58.988 --> 00:36:01.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Everything seemed
to come from the Egyptians.

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:02.370 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Or the Greeks.

00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:03.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Or the Greeks.

00:36:03.370 --> 00:36:04.328 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: That was true.

00:36:04.328 --> 00:36:05.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:06.847 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Do you think
they go back much

00:36:06.847 --> 00:36:08.722 align:middle line:90%
farther than we think?

00:36:08.722 --> 00:36:09.680 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: The Egyptians?

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.540 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: In terms of societies?

00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:12.950 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Yeah, they do.

00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:13.790 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely do.

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:17.330 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's great
archeological evidence of that.

00:36:17.330 --> 00:36:21.320 align:middle line:84%
You don't see much archeological
evidence of the Egyptians

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:25.160 align:middle line:84%
until things went stone,
where they started dealing

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:26.690 align:middle line:90%
in stone and building pyramids.

00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:28.710 align:middle line:90%
That was in 2,600.

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:30.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: But if
they built them.

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:32.600 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Well, anyway.

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And the architect was thought
to be a guy named Imhotep.

00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:40.395 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What's
next for you, Paul?

00:36:40.395 --> 00:36:42.770 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: I want to get this
series done, the Relic series

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:43.570 align:middle line:90%
done.

00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:47.900 align:middle line:84%
And I'm also working on a book
on shared death experiences.

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:49.895 align:middle line:90%
Beyond that, that's about it.

00:36:49.895 --> 00:36:51.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Yeah, the
shared death experiences,

00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:54.540 align:middle line:84%
which we've talked about
are really fascinating.

00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:57.230 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: They are fascinating.

00:36:57.230 --> 00:37:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And you can look
at old documents

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:02.060 align:middle line:90%
and see them in history.

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:05.480 align:middle line:84%
Plato wrote about them
in Plato's "Republic."

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:07.220 align:middle line:84%
There's a shared
death experience that

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:10.910 align:middle line:90%
happens in Plato's "Republic."

00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:12.920 align:middle line:90%
You see them in the Bible.

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What creates
the sharing experience?

00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:19.450 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: Oh, that's a
million dollar question.

00:37:19.450 --> 00:37:20.530 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: It sure is.

00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:22.690 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: And I don't
think anyone knows.

00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:27.280 align:middle line:84%
However, the National
Institutes of Health

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:31.600 align:middle line:84%
are now investigating something
called terminal lucidity, which

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:33.790 align:middle line:84%
is, as it sounds,
it's people who

00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:35.747 align:middle line:84%
become lucid after
they are certified--

00:37:35.747 --> 00:37:36.830 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: --a lucid dream?

00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:39.970 align:middle line:90%


00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:42.635 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: Essentially,
they have no brainwaves.

00:37:42.635 --> 00:37:44.260 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these people
who have terminal

00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:45.603 align:middle line:90%
lucidity have no brain waves.

00:37:45.603 --> 00:37:47.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: But then
they come back?

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:48.020 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: They come back.

00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:48.930 align:middle line:90%
And they're in bed.

00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:49.730 align:middle line:90%
I've seen it.

00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:52.060 align:middle line:90%
I actually saw it one time.

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:55.120 align:middle line:90%
They wake up out of a coma.

00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:57.885 align:middle line:84%
In the coma, they
have no brain waves.

00:37:57.885 --> 00:37:59.260 align:middle line:84%
So they're
essentially not there.

00:37:59.260 --> 00:37:59.740 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Right.

00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:01.540 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: And they
wake up out of a coma.

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:05.080 align:middle line:84%
They carry on very lucid,
lengthy conversations.

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:07.270 align:middle line:84%
Their family members
think, oh, my God, we

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:08.470 align:middle line:90%
can bring them home now.

00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:11.510 align:middle line:84%
And they generally die within
a few hours or a couple of days

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:12.310 align:middle line:90%
later.

00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:12.610 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Really?

00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:13.570 align:middle line:90%
All of them?

00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:14.560 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Almost all of them.

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:15.852 align:middle line:90%
There's a few that have lasted.

00:38:15.852 --> 00:38:17.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Are you aware
of Eben Alexander?

00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:17.860 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Yeah.

00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:18.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I know Eben.

00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:19.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:20.260 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Great story.

00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:21.635 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: Yeah,
he's a good story.

00:38:21.635 --> 00:38:23.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Afterlife
and you pass on.

00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:24.040 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRY: Yeah.

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:25.415 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Everybody
seems to talk

00:38:25.415 --> 00:38:26.710 align:middle line:90%
about the same thing, Paul.

00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:28.377 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: Well, that's
because it happens

00:38:28.377 --> 00:38:30.220 align:middle line:90%
the same way to everybody.

00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:33.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can look at
the research of Jeff Long.

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:35.142 align:middle line:90%
Jeff has collected--

00:38:35.142 --> 00:38:36.100 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Jeffrey Long?

00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:37.642 align:middle line:10%
>>PERRY: Jeffrey
long has collected--

00:38:37.642 --> 00:38:40.150 align:middle line:10%
I don't know-- 4,000,
5,000 case studies

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:41.930 align:middle line:10%
from all over the world.

00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:44.260 align:middle line:10%
They all read the same.

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:45.270 align:middle line:10%
They're all the same.

00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:46.887 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Are you
afraid of dying?

00:38:46.887 --> 00:38:48.720 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: I think
everyone's afraid of dying.

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:50.340 align:middle line:10%
I don't care what they say.

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:52.590 align:middle line:10%
And yes, I am afraid of dying.

00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:54.480 align:middle line:10%
I'm afraid of taking
a journey that I

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:56.860 align:middle line:10%
don't know where I'm going.

00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:58.710 align:middle line:84%
I know what'll happen
up to a certain point.

00:38:58.710 --> 00:39:01.410 align:middle line:84%
But like I said before,
it's a gateway experience.

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:02.580 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what's beyond.

00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:05.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Do you believe
in reincarnation?

00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:07.660 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: Raymond and I did
a book on reincarnation.

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:08.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: You did.

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:10.540 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRY: And we
did that because we

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:12.610 align:middle line:90%
were asking the same question.

00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:15.580 align:middle line:84%
We're running into
reincarnation stories

00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:18.663 align:middle line:84%
constantly by studying
near-death experiences.

00:39:18.663 --> 00:39:20.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Paul, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:24.370 align:middle line:10%
It's the age old question,
what happens when you die?

00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:27.940 align:middle line:10%
One day, we'll all
find out, but not yet.

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:29.120 align:middle line:90%
Not yet.

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:29.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:32.940 align:middle line:84%
And thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:38.000 align:middle line:90%
