>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.460 align:middle line:84%
We've got a very special
guest for you today.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.050 align:middle line:10%
Captain Randy Cramer,
an officer who

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.203 align:middle line:10%
has been given the authority
to address all of us

00:00:34.203 --> 00:00:36.620 align:middle line:10%
on behalf of the command staff
of the United States Marine

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.210 align:middle line:10%
Corps.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.860 align:middle line:84%
He was very knowledgeable-- and
I'm going to emphasize this--

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.160 align:middle line:84%
of President
Eisenhower's 1933 work

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.200 align:middle line:84%
as a covert military
intelligence

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.350 align:middle line:84%
branch with specific
authority over

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.200 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial visitations.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.660 align:middle line:84%
How in the world did
you stumble into that?

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.660 align:middle line:90%


00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.320 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY CRAMER: On
purpose, as it were.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.960 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't really
my choice so much

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.740 align:middle line:10%
as it was, me being engineered
genetically from the ground up

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.320 align:middle line:10%
actually into the program since
the time before I was born,

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.120 align:middle line:10%
really.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.182 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't really
pick and choose it.

00:01:16.182 --> 00:01:17.515 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They picked it for you.

00:01:17.515 --> 00:01:19.470 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: They decided they
wanted to genetically engineer

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.410 align:middle line:90%
a bunch of people.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And I was in the
program or my parents

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.750 align:middle line:84%
got selected to have
their genetic material put

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.790 align:middle line:84%
into the program and I
got made out of that.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.825 align:middle line:90%
So yay for me.

00:01:28.825 --> 00:01:30.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are you going
public with this, Randy?

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.992 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: My brigadier
asked me a number of years

00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:36.900 align:middle line:84%
ago, if I wanted to discuss my
story and covert military space

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.990 align:middle line:84%
program affairs to the general
public, which I was not

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.940 align:middle line:84%
necessarily eager
to do at the time.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.360 align:middle line:84%
But with some convincing,
decided that, OK, sure.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.010 align:middle line:84%
You want someone to be the PR
guy, I guess, I'll do that,

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.110 align:middle line:90%
then.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So this
shroud of secrecy

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.050 align:middle line:84%
that we've heard so much
about, they basically

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.180 align:middle line:84%
said for you, we're
taking off the gloves.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.020 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.100 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: It was determined
that the need for truth

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.580 align:middle line:84%
was more important than
the need for secrecy.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.820 align:middle line:84%
So why we are still
unable to get--

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.470 align:middle line:84%
well, let's just
say, we're working

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.960 align:middle line:84%
towards the official
channels allowing

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.570 align:middle line:84%
to have some open
discussions about disclosure.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.100 align:middle line:84%
But in lieu of that,
before we get there,

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.150 align:middle line:84%
it was important to have
some personnel discuss

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.620 align:middle line:84%
what's been going on, just
outside of that with sanction

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.490 align:middle line:90%
from my superiors.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.140 align:middle line:90%
So not a whistleblower.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.230 align:middle line:84%
I've been harassed by my
superiors to discuss openly.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.120 align:middle line:84%
But we're still in
the realm of what

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.890 align:middle line:90%
we call plausible deniability.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.260 align:middle line:84%
So you can go ahead
and ask questions

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.300 align:middle line:84%
to the Air Force and the
Marine Corps and NASA

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.370 align:middle line:84%
and there's still
an official denial.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.820 align:middle line:84%
But we decided it was
more important to start

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.880 align:middle line:84%
disseminating the
information somehow,

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.500 align:middle line:84%
so that people could get a
little more warmed up to what's

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.300 align:middle line:90%
been going on.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.127 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At what level did
this authority come from?

00:02:50.127 --> 00:02:52.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: From the command
staff of United States Marine

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:53.570 align:middle line:90%
Corps Special Sections.

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.050 align:middle line:84%
That's a senior department
of a table full of generals.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And tell us,
since your youth, how

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.520 align:middle line:90%
this program evolved for you.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.170 align:middle line:90%
How did you get into it?

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And what did they
plan to do with you?

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I was created under
a soldier augmentation project.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.340 align:middle line:84%
So I was genetically engineered
to be a combat operative.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.200 align:middle line:84%
So I would be trained throughout
my childhood, my adolescence,

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.060 align:middle line:84%
and then was sent
onto a deployment when

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.130 align:middle line:84%
I was 17 years old,
for several decades.

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you have
a normal childhood?

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.135 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Pretty normal.

00:03:25.135 --> 00:03:27.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you play
baseball and stuff like that?

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.060 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.660 align:middle line:90%
No, I went-- normal family.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.250 align:middle line:90%
Normal school.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.600 align:middle line:84%
They conduct the training
operations covertly.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.340 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes at night, when
everyone else is asleep.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.550 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes there's
some implants involved

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.523 align:middle line:84%
so that some remote
information can be disseminated

00:03:44.523 --> 00:03:46.190 align:middle line:84%
to the subjects when
they're young, when

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.200 align:middle line:90%
they're asleep in their beds.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have a
secret Space Force now.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yes.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That has been formed.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.380 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
its purpose is?

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.080 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, its
purpose, I think, in general

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.680 align:middle line:84%
is to allow there to be
a discussion about why

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.950 align:middle line:84%
we need to have the
militarization of space.

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.940 align:middle line:84%
That it's an arena in
which other countries

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.985 align:middle line:84%
are starting to usher
and take some territory.

00:04:10.985 --> 00:04:12.950 align:middle line:84%
And the Chinese have
made it very clear

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.440 align:middle line:84%
that they want to
have a facility

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.910 align:middle line:84%
on the moon in a pretty
short amount of time.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.540 align:middle line:84%
India has launched a
lander not too long ago.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.603 align:middle line:84%
So other countries are
getting involved in the--

00:04:24.603 --> 00:04:25.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Quickly, too.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.320 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And in this isn't,
sort of, the overt

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.410 align:middle line:84%
known military and
civilian space program.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.460 align:middle line:84%
So as those people encroach
and get closer and closer,

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.300 align:middle line:84%
we need to exercise a little
bit more military muscle power.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.053 align:middle line:84%
And say, well, we
want to make sure

00:04:40.053 --> 00:04:41.720 align:middle line:84%
we're letting people
know we're involved

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.680 align:middle line:84%
in satellite maintenance and
protection and cybersecurity

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.070 align:middle line:84%
and whatever the next
generation or threshold

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.370 align:middle line:84%
of being involved in the
militarization of space is.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very beginning
introduction of a conversation.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.250 align:middle line:84%
Whereas-- which is the case
with every military department,

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.680 align:middle line:84%
you have what is discussed
publicly and then

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.810 align:middle line:84%
you have what underneath that
is covert and not discussed

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:07.610 align:middle line:90%
publicly.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think it's a great
idea to have a Space Force.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:11.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh, yeah.

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For the defense
of the country alone,

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.100 align:middle line:90%
it's a good idea.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.900 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it?

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:15.700 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.870 align:middle line:84%
I think it's good to have
people who specialize

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.210 align:middle line:84%
in the arena of
space and the things

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.770 align:middle line:90%
that we have to deal with there.

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.680 align:middle line:84%
You don't necessarily want to
give that to other departments

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.760 align:middle line:84%
whose job is to primarily be
on the land or the sea or just

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:30.560 align:middle line:90%
in the air.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.120 align:middle line:84%
You kind of want to make it a
special arena for specialists

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.175 align:middle line:84%
who were specifically trained
and experienced in that area.

00:05:38.175 --> 00:05:39.050 align:middle line:90%
For sure, I think so.

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:40.883 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The announcement
of the Space Force

00:05:40.883 --> 00:05:42.830 align:middle line:90%
came under President Trump.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.070 align:middle line:84%
Who do you think or what
kind of presentation

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.820 align:middle line:84%
was delivered to him for him
to make this announcement

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:50.855 align:middle line:90%
of a Space Force?

00:05:50.855 --> 00:05:52.230 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: That's
a good question.

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:54.560 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that I could
answer specifically to that,

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.340 align:middle line:84%
other than to say that I'm sure
that there are some admirals

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.220 align:middle line:84%
and some generals who have been
presenting this information

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.888 align:middle line:90%
to him and to others for years.

00:06:02.888 --> 00:06:03.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think so, too.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.347 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: And this
isn't something

00:06:05.347 --> 00:06:07.700 align:middle line:84%
that happened six months
ago or even three years ago

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.072 align:middle line:84%
that someone would have
just come up with this idea.

00:06:10.072 --> 00:06:11.780 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that's been percolating

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.973 align:middle line:90%
for well over a decade or two.

00:06:13.973 --> 00:06:15.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This has been
on the planning stages.

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:16.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: For sure.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.960 align:middle line:84%
It's not something you
just snap your fingers

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.420 align:middle line:84%
and go we're going to make a
new branch of the military.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.370 align:middle line:84%
It's something that had
to be some discussion

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:23.855 align:middle line:84%
and thought about
for a long time.

00:06:23.855 --> 00:06:26.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think he was the
only president who bit with it

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.488 align:middle line:84%
and said, OK, I'm
going to do this?

00:06:28.488 --> 00:06:30.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I don't think
he would be the only one.

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.730 align:middle line:84%
I think he was the one
that ended up in the chair

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:33.530 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.180 align:middle line:84%
I think whoever would
have been in the chair

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.900 align:middle line:84%
at the time would have
been the person who would

mean to all of us?

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:09.520 align:middle line:84%
- And so rises a new era
of American space flight.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.660 align:middle line:10%
And with it, the ambitions
of a new generation

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.750 align:middle line:10%

maximum dynamic pressure.

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.471 align:middle line:10%

[END PLAYBACK]

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's exciting, Randy.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:57.340 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Very.

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:01.350 align:middle line:84%
I think it;s significant that
we're seeing private space

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:03.780 align:middle line:84%
industry getting further
and further along.

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:05.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You like that?

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:06.175 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:08:06.175 --> 00:08:08.290 align:middle line:84%
No, I think Elon Musk
is doing a great job.

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And I think he's made quite
a bit of substantial progress

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:14.230 align:middle line:84%
in the world of commercial
and private spaceflight.

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:18.300 align:middle line:84%
That's important for us to make
it more economically efficient

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.340 align:middle line:84%
and feasible so that
it can be something

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:23.910 align:middle line:84%
that we can continue to
apply broader spectrum.

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:26.005 align:middle line:84%
So that we can get
industry into space.

00:08:26.005 --> 00:08:28.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think NASA
should have continued, though,

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:31.860 align:middle line:84%
our manned space program,
with our own rocketry system?

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.299 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: I think so, actually.

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:35.309 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's something
that should have been cut.

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:36.726 align:middle line:84%
I think it's
something that should

00:08:36.726 --> 00:08:39.230 align:middle line:84%
have been given extra funding,
to be honest with you.

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:42.270 align:middle line:84%
There are certain things
that certain departments

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:44.980 align:middle line:84%
and operations who've
been at it for decades,

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:47.610 align:middle line:84%
why in the world would you want
to cut them off and tell them

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:50.070 align:middle line:84%
to stop doing their job, when
it's something that they've

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:52.080 align:middle line:84%
been doing very
well for decades,

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.160 align:middle line:84%
and then just hand it
off to some other people?

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.090 align:middle line:84%
So I think that was
an unfortunate step,

00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:59.640 align:middle line:90%
but other people are coming in.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.230 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to make it
work out one way or the other.

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:04.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we had to
rely on the Russians

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.620 align:middle line:90%
to get anybody up into space.

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:06.420 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.490 align:middle line:84%
We had to get a
Soyuz, if we wanted

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:10.920 align:middle line:84%
to get up to the
International Space Station.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.710 align:middle line:90%
Now we have some options.

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:14.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, that's true.

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:19.660 align:middle line:84%
But, as you say, it's kind
of unfortunate as a nation--

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:21.960 align:middle line:84%
as an organized
nation, we stopped

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.660 align:middle line:84%
and we are relying
on privatization.

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:29.280 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens one day, if
those private companies decide

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.250 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to do this,
or we want more money,

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:33.450 align:middle line:90%
or something like that?

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:36.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Luckily, I think Elon
Musk is a very driven person.

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And has made it
very clear that he

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.460 align:middle line:84%
doesn't care how much
money of his own cash

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.920 align:middle line:84%
that he spends on
space development.

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.920 align:middle line:84%
That he will drop as
many billions of dollars

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.320 align:middle line:84%
that he has lying around
because he believes in it

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.140 align:middle line:90%
that strongly.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:52.800 align:middle line:84%
So I think, in that case, it's
good to have someone who's

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.370 align:middle line:84%
dedicated to something, has the
billions of dollars to spend,

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:59.410 align:middle line:84%
and doesn't seem to have any
reluctance at spending as much

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:00.660 align:middle line:90%
as possible to make it happen.

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:02.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But he's
obviously doing it

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.370 align:middle line:90%
for a return, don't you think?

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:07.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: He's a businessman
so I think he'd be--

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:10.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't think
he's wasting his money.

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:10.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: No.

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:10.350 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:11.560 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so, either.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.680 align:middle line:84%
But I think he's
incredibly driven.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.260 align:middle line:84%
I think that it's
listening to him talk.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.480 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the things
from his own childhood

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.720 align:middle line:90%
that he wanted to see.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:23.400 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to see our own
society and civilization

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.450 align:middle line:90%
get into space.

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And then found himself
in an opportunity

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:29.190 align:middle line:84%
where he had the
billions of dollars

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:31.470 align:middle line:84%
that he could start
his own private rocket

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.160 align:middle line:90%
company if he wanted to.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.400 align:middle line:84%
So I think he's a
smart businessman.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And he's certainly hoping
for financial return,

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.860 align:middle line:84%
but I'm sure he's incredibly
driven for us getting out

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:42.660 align:middle line:90%
into space.

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:45.498 align:middle line:84%
And if he spends
his entire fortune

00:10:45.498 --> 00:10:47.790 align:middle line:84%
to help make that happen, I
think he'd be OK with that.

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:48.665 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:10:48.665 --> 00:10:51.360 align:middle line:90%
Now these are programs we see.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.790 align:middle line:84%
What about the
ones we don't see?

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:54.690 align:middle line:90%
What do you know?

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:57.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, those are the
ones that are getting billions

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.480 align:middle line:84%
and billions or even trillions
of dollars more of money that

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.970 align:middle line:84%
are continuing to
develop vehicles--

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:03.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Black ops.

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:06.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Continuing
to make base vehicles,

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:10.710 align:middle line:84%
technological development
on covert technology

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:12.330 align:middle line:84%
derived from the
reverse engineering

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:13.950 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial
technologies.

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:16.830 align:middle line:84%
So magneto-gravitic,
electro-gravitic, propulsion

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:20.190 align:middle line:84%
systems, vehicles that can
travel across the solar system,

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:22.623 align:middle line:90%
across the galaxy.

00:11:22.623 --> 00:11:24.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you part
of these programs?

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:24.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Absolutely.

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.080 align:middle line:84%
Spent my whole career
working with these programs

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.763 align:middle line:90%
and working with these vehicles.

00:11:28.763 --> 00:11:30.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What else
are they doing?

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.840 align:middle line:84%
What's their motive
for these, Randy?

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.270 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: The motive is
self-sufficiency-- military

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:36.290 align:middle line:90%
self-sufficiency.

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:41.150 align:middle line:84%
So as long as we
are not militarily

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:45.140 align:middle line:84%
self-sufficient when it comes
to our space-based technology,

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:50.000 align:middle line:84%
we're dependent on other
people to watch our back,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.590 align:middle line:90%
help protect our perimeters.

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:54.530 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, be a
babysitter for us.

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you that most
of the species that end up

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.930 align:middle line:84%
playing the role of these
sort of babysitters,

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:01.530 align:middle line:84%
don't want to do
it for very long.

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:04.760 align:middle line:84%
They would much prefer that
the civilizations that they're

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:07.530 align:middle line:84%
watching over become as
self-sufficient as quickly

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:08.330 align:middle line:90%
as possible.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.880 align:middle line:84%
So given that we've
had a few decades--

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.310 align:middle line:84%
like seven or more--
to be working on this,

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:15.130 align:middle line:90%
we've made some progress.

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And I would think
that it's safe for me

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:22.250 align:middle line:84%
to say the space immediately
around the planet

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:25.010 align:middle line:84%
and what covers most
of our solar system

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:29.180 align:middle line:84%
is fairly well-protected by
the military space program

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:30.380 align:middle line:90%
that we have at the moment.

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:32.270 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean that
we're bullet-proof

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:34.910 align:middle line:84%
or can't possibly be
harmed by anything.

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:38.290 align:middle line:84%
But it means that we've achieved
a level of self-sufficiency.

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:41.040 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to have other
people babysitting for us.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If most Americans
knew about these programs

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:47.977 align:middle line:84%
that you know about,
would they freak out?

00:12:47.977 --> 00:12:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Based on
the studies that we

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.430 align:middle line:84%
have done looking at social
psychological demographics,

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:56.540 align:middle line:84%
you have some people who are
readily available to accept

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:59.750 align:middle line:84%
these things as, oh, I already
knew this has been going on

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:00.550 align:middle line:90%
for some time.

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:01.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: And you have
a small percentage

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.820 align:middle line:84%
of people who, I
think, are really

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.770 align:middle line:90%
the most reluctant to accept.

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:08.990 align:middle line:84%
I think we're
achieving that, kind

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:11.330 align:middle line:84%
of, large level of
acceptance where

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:16.295 align:middle line:84%
we're getting into those 70, 75,
80 percentile of the population

00:13:16.295 --> 00:13:21.200 align:middle line:84%
that if something were
to occur tomorrow,

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.340 align:middle line:90%
they might be shocked.

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:23.750 align:middle line:90%
They might be, oh, crud.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:27.110 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think they would be
so surprised that they wouldn't

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:29.670 align:middle line:84%
be able to come to acceptance
in a very short period of time.

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:31.790 align:middle line:84%
So I think given the
numbers we're looking at,

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:34.310 align:middle line:84%
three quarters of the
population, if something were

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:37.550 align:middle line:84%
to happen tomorrow, would go
into a state of acceptance

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:38.465 align:middle line:90%
almost immediately.

00:13:38.465 --> 00:13:39.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
been into space?

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:40.550 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh, absolutely.

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:41.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How far?

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:42.950 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh, way far.

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:44.120 align:middle line:90%
Outside the solar system.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what kind of
rocketry have you been in?

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:48.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, they
don't use rocketry.

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:50.090 align:middle line:84%
So most of the
propulsion systems

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:52.310 align:middle line:84%
are a combination of
electro-gravitic and

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:53.330 align:middle line:90%
magneto-gravitic.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:56.990 align:middle line:84%
So the electro-gravitic
phenomenon

00:13:56.990 --> 00:14:00.020 align:middle line:84%
is running a high voltage
electric frequency

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:01.910 align:middle line:84%
through the fuselage
of the vehicle which

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:03.770 align:middle line:90%
changes the weight.

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:04.970 align:middle line:90%
So you have--

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:06.815 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Almost anti-gravity?

00:14:06.815 --> 00:14:07.617 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: It does.

00:14:07.617 --> 00:14:08.450 align:middle line:90%
It makes it buoyant.

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:11.990 align:middle line:84%
Think about a large metal
fuselage that's heavy

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:14.570 align:middle line:84%
and then it's, all of a
sudden, buoyant because

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:16.490 align:middle line:84%
of the electro-gravitic
phenomena.

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:20.930 align:middle line:84%
The magneto-gravitics
is the mercury engine

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:24.980 align:middle line:84%
that spins around,
creates a toroidal field

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.980 align:middle line:84%
that gives you the sort of
actual lift and propulsion

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:29.770 align:middle line:84%
that's the, sort of,
anti-gravity drive.

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:31.910 align:middle line:84%
So a combination of
those two technologies

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:34.490 align:middle line:84%
give you vehicles
that can travel

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:37.635 align:middle line:84%
in space tremendous distances
and tremendous speeds.

00:14:37.635 --> 00:14:38.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How far out?

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And when you said way
out of our solar system,

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:42.120 align:middle line:90%
I mean, to other planets?

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:42.920 align:middle line:90%
Beyond?

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:46.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: We have made some
excursions out into the galaxy.

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:47.630 align:middle line:90%
Visited some other worlds.

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:49.370 align:middle line:90%
Visited some other star systems.

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:50.200 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it
fascinating out there?

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:53.548 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: It's amazing.

00:14:53.548 --> 00:14:56.170 align:middle line:90%


00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:59.320 align:middle line:84%
What I think is the most
amazing thing about the universe

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.300 align:middle line:84%
at large, as I have
come to understand,

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:05.370 align:middle line:84%
it's as if you took
every book, every movie,

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:07.560 align:middle line:84%
every television show
that anyone's ever

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:10.980 align:middle line:84%
made that professes some
understanding, where we thought

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:14.040 align:middle line:84%
about a science fiction
extraterrestrial world,

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:17.380 align:middle line:84%
shook it up in a giant ball,
and dropped it out on the floor,

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:18.660 align:middle line:90%
and that's what you have.

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.883 align:middle line:84%
That the universe
is really everything

00:15:20.883 --> 00:15:22.800 align:middle line:84%
that we've ever thought
that it ever could be.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And more things that we've
never thought that it could be.

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're really,
Mork, aren't you?

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:28.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: No, no.

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:30.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm from here.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:31.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You sure?

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:32.210 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: I'm sure.

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:33.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm from here.

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:36.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now do these
programs continue with you?

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:37.130 align:middle line:90%
Or are you done now?

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:37.930 align:middle line:90%
Retired?

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:41.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I'm acting as a public
relations officer at this time,

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.740 align:middle line:84%
until at some other
point, that my job might

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:44.770 align:middle line:90%
be something different.

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:48.090 align:middle line:84%
So for the time being, my
job is to talk to people.

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:50.740 align:middle line:84%
If at any point, someone wants
me to do something differently,

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:52.980 align:middle line:84%
all they have to do is
give me different orders.

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:54.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, did you
come across anything

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:58.900 align:middle line:84%
bizarre or unusual
on these travels?

00:15:58.900 --> 00:15:59.700 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.117 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like all
the time, right?

00:16:01.117 --> 00:16:02.570 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: All the time.

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:07.350 align:middle line:84%
Really weird just becomes a
state of normal sometimes.

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:09.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you ever
come across anomalies?

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.670 align:middle line:84%
Like, did you go
through a black hole

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:15.210 align:middle line:84%
or come across another
universe or anything?

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:17.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I guess,
nothing that strange.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.430 align:middle line:84%
But we certainly--
well, one of the things

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:22.590 align:middle line:84%
I found fascinating
about being a pilot

00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:25.230 align:middle line:90%
was that space has weather.

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:28.560 align:middle line:90%
So there are gash clouds.

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:32.530 align:middle line:84%
There's actually high
and low pressure.

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:34.770 align:middle line:90%
So there can be cyclones.

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:37.290 align:middle line:90%
There can be winds.

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:38.580 align:middle line:90%
Micro meteors.

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:42.330 align:middle line:84%
There's this very interesting
phenomenon that causes,

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:45.720 align:middle line:84%
instead of space to
be this static vacuum,

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:49.080 align:middle line:84%
it's actually this
very busy active place

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.590 align:middle line:84%
of high pressure
and low pressure

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:52.800 align:middle line:84%
and this very, very
thin atmosphere.

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.660 align:middle line:90%
But it's not breathable.

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:57.630 align:middle line:84%
But the external
sensors in the vehicles

00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:00.190 align:middle line:84%
can show you this
tremendous variation,

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:05.260 align:middle line:84%
which, again, can cause wind,
tornadoes, various, like, space

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:06.060 align:middle line:90%
weather.

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:08.400 align:middle line:84%
So I never would have
thought that that

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.650 align:middle line:84%
would have been a thing that
I would have experienced.

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:11.450 align:middle line:90%
But yes.

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:13.118 align:middle line:90%
Space has actual weather.

00:17:13.118 --> 00:17:15.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Scientists believe that
they may have found evidence

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.238 align:middle line:90%
of a parallel universe.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:18.250 align:middle line:84%
Randy, it's entirely possible
there are parallel universes.

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:19.125 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Absolutely.

00:18:19.125 --> 00:18:22.200 align:middle line:84%
As it's been explained
to me, we live

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:28.290 align:middle line:84%
in a state of understanding
our experience through time

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:31.050 align:middle line:84%
and space and
dimension as something

00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:33.300 align:middle line:84%
that's unique to where
we are at the time.

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:38.010 align:middle line:84%
But that it overlaps in layers
with other mathematical,

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:42.700 align:middle line:84%
physiological energetic
layers of dimension frequency

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:43.530 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:48.510 align:middle line:84%
So we're sitting in a room
experiencing a conversation,

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:52.272 align:middle line:84%
which overlaps a
number of other rooms

00:18:52.272 --> 00:18:54.480 align:middle line:84%
in which other things, other
people, and other things

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.880 align:middle line:84%
can also be occurring that
you and I don't experience

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.860 align:middle line:84%
in this particular
density or frequency

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:00.370 align:middle line:90%
that we're sitting in right now.

00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:02.370 align:middle line:84%
That's my understanding
of how it works, anyway.

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:04.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what about
going back into time

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:04.950 align:middle line:90%
through some of this?

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:06.825 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, we
certainly understand, also

00:19:06.825 --> 00:19:09.810 align:middle line:84%
through some experimentation,
time travel's possible.

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:12.550 align:middle line:84%
It's not my specialty, but
there are apparently ways--

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:16.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you've not been
in a time traveling apparatus?

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:20.190 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I have, but
it's not my specialty.

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:22.290 align:middle line:84%
My understanding is
we have the ability

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:25.770 align:middle line:84%
to look back and forth
through time through something

00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:26.670 align:middle line:90%
called a chronovisor.

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:30.120 align:middle line:84%
A little helmet that you put on,
lets you see backwards in time.

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And the ability to jump
people backwards in time

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:34.890 align:middle line:84%
is also a thing
that has occurred.

00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:37.410 align:middle line:84%
There are programs that have
been involved with that--

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:39.930 align:middle line:84%
Project Pegasus
and Andy Basiago.

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:41.190 align:middle line:90%
Some people have heard of.

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:42.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:43.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: So not my forte.

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:45.420 align:middle line:90%
But my understanding is, yes.

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:47.430 align:middle line:90%
Time travel is also a thing.

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If the
American public truly

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:53.010 align:middle line:84%
understood what was going
on beyond the realm of what

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:56.673 align:middle line:84%
we think we know,
would they be in shock?

00:19:56.673 --> 00:19:58.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Again, I think
some people would be.

00:19:58.590 --> 00:19:59.810 align:middle line:90%
Some people wouldn't be.

00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:03.310 align:middle line:84%
I think it depends
on at what level--

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:04.860 align:middle line:84%
some people, I
think, are a lot more

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:08.070 align:middle line:84%
ready to accept that are
extraterrestrials that maybe

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:09.337 align:middle line:90%
have been here, are here now.

00:20:09.337 --> 00:20:10.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:12.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: And you start
talking time travel,

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.073 align:middle line:84%
there's some more people
that you might lose

00:20:14.073 --> 00:20:15.365 align:middle line:90%
who are going to be like, wait.

00:20:15.365 --> 00:20:17.760 align:middle line:84%
Time travel, that sounds
a little too ridiculous.

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:20.130 align:middle line:84%
So there's always going
to be some technology that

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:22.980 align:middle line:84%
sounds too far off for
certain people to believe.

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:25.860 align:middle line:84%
But the farther we get
along into the universe

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:28.080 align:middle line:84%
and understanding
what the possibility

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:29.820 align:middle line:84%
of these technological
advances are,

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:33.120 align:middle line:84%
as well as what we learn
and develop to use and apply

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.950 align:middle line:84%
in our own military
space programs,

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:37.950 align:middle line:84%
learning that the universe
is a very big place.

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:42.150 align:middle line:84%
And possibility is something
that has a very big question

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:43.590 align:middle line:90%
mark at the end.

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:49.320 align:middle line:84%
And that it's the potential
of all of the variations

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.930 align:middle line:84%
that we can imagine is
a lot more plausible

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:54.570 align:middle line:84%
than a finite,
squared universe where

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:57.220 align:middle line:84%
only certain limited
things can occur.

00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:59.610 align:middle line:84%
The more we know, the more
we know we don't know.

00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:01.860 align:middle line:84%
And the more we learn, the
bigger and more amazing

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:02.790 align:middle line:90%
the universe is.

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:04.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you met
extraterrestrials?

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:05.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Sure.

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:05.590 align:middle line:90%
A few.

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:06.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You like them?

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:08.128 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Some of them.

00:21:08.128 --> 00:21:10.110 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were very
nice and very pleasant.

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:12.870 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were
total douchebags.

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:14.745 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were they evil?

00:21:14.745 --> 00:21:15.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: I think they're--

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:17.287 align:middle line:84%
I've met a couple
that were pretty

00:21:17.287 --> 00:21:19.560 align:middle line:84%
selfish and narcissistically
sociopathic.

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:20.360 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they from the
same planet as the good ones?

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:26.410 align:middle line:84%
Or there's a bad planet
and a good planet?

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:30.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: It's usually
not that black or white.

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:35.940 align:middle line:10%
A whole other species is not
usually either good or bad.

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:36.790 align:middle line:90%
They are people.

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And so you have people
with different intentions,

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:45.390 align:middle line:84%
different belief systems
that can be both good and bad

00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:46.800 align:middle line:90%
and somewhere in the gray area.

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:51.080 align:middle line:84%
I think there are some
species who tend to be more

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.910 align:middle line:90%
socially cooperative.

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And you have maybe
some other species

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:58.970 align:middle line:84%
that tend to be
socially dysfunctional

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:00.740 align:middle line:90%
and maybe bullyish.

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:02.870 align:middle line:84%
So kind of can
depend on evolution.

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:06.500 align:middle line:84%
Can sometimes just
depend on personality.

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:10.818 align:middle line:84%
Or, I suppose, genetic
profiles, in some cases.

00:22:10.818 --> 00:22:12.485 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's
important to understand

00:22:12.485 --> 00:22:15.800 align:middle line:84%
that the universe
full of other beings

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:17.840 align:middle line:84%
is just like a planet
full of people.

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.180 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot of
different life forms

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:22.730 align:middle line:84%
that think and do and believe
a lot of different things.

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And you can't make it black and
white and say they're all good.

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:27.340 align:middle line:90%
They're all bad.

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:29.170 align:middle line:90%
It's just a mix of everything.

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:30.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I want
to be honest with you,

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:35.510 align:middle line:84%
you seem to be a very
decent, nice guy.

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:38.270 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Off the battlefield,
I tend to be a very nice person.

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:41.150 align:middle line:84%
On the battlefield,
I'm a monster.

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:44.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you come
across as a nice guy.

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:47.390 align:middle line:84%
But is there this
devious part of you?

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:51.605 align:middle line:84%
You're in a program that does
some very strange things.

00:22:51.605 --> 00:22:53.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: No, I don't think
there's a devious part of me.

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:57.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm a marine that's trained
as a combat professional.

00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:00.530 align:middle line:84%
So you put the right tools
in my hand and tell me to sic

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:01.467 align:middle line:90%
'em, and--

00:23:01.467 --> 00:23:02.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Off you go.

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:03.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Off I go.

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.292 align:middle line:90%
That's what I do, so.

00:23:05.292 --> 00:23:07.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There seems to be a
strange agenda on this planet,

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:08.710 align:middle line:90%
these days, Randy.

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:09.510 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:12.110 align:middle line:90%
What's the end game here?

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:14.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I think, without
going into a long explanation,

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:20.480 align:middle line:84%
I think that we are looking
at the inevitable collision

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.490 align:middle line:84%
of certain things
that have been going

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:25.490 align:middle line:84%
on in the world for the
past seven decades or so.

00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:30.290 align:middle line:84%
You have this development of a
covert military apparatus that

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:32.450 align:middle line:84%
has been very
separated from a lot

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:34.880 align:middle line:84%
of the other military
apparatus and a lot

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:38.810 align:middle line:84%
of the known executive and
legislative operations.

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:42.710 align:middle line:84%
That, in some cases,
can be seen as separate

00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:45.710 align:middle line:84%
or even some rogue programs in
which this all sort of takes

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:46.670 align:middle line:90%
place.

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:51.530 align:middle line:84%
That there's this inevitable
collision of these realities

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:52.610 align:middle line:90%
that we live in.

00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And that, at some point, all of
this commercial, conventional

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.270 align:middle line:84%
space technology
is going to come

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:02.270 align:middle line:84%
colliding with all of
this advanced space

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:05.810 align:middle line:84%
technology and
extraterrestrial beings

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:07.970 align:middle line:84%
in such a way that is
going to get everyone

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:10.760 align:middle line:84%
to have to deal with
it in a way that's

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:13.230 align:middle line:90%
not going to be optional.

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:15.200 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the
inevitable point here.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.960 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that people
who are preparing for that,

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:21.320 align:middle line:84%
are preparing for some
disclosure event in which we're

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.970 align:middle line:84%
all going to have
to accept that we

00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:24.320 align:middle line:90%
live in a great big universe.

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:25.490 align:middle line:90%
And it's not just us.

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:30.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a deep
state agenda, in your opinion?

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:32.450 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: I think that--

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:35.750 align:middle line:84%
again, I think that
sort of divides things

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:37.410 align:middle line:84%
into some kind of
black and white,

00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:40.580 align:middle line:84%
which I think it's a
little more complicated.

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:43.820 align:middle line:84%
When people say the
government or the deep state,

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:49.010 align:middle line:84%
there's some idea that there
is this singular cohesive group

00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:51.290 align:middle line:84%
of people who are
all in agreement

00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:54.600 align:middle line:84%
about an agenda in
which they behave.

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
that that's true.

00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:59.000 align:middle line:84%
I think you have a
number of agencies,

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.890 align:middle line:84%
a number of departments that
have individual agendas that

00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:07.400 align:middle line:84%
cooperate with each
other where they have to,

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:11.120 align:middle line:84%
and in some cases, where they
want to, but in many cases,

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:14.210 align:middle line:84%
compete and/or don't cooperate
where they don't want to

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:15.780 align:middle line:90%
or don't have to.

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:20.960 align:middle line:84%
So it's, kind of, really a
mess of different departments

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:23.540 align:middle line:84%
and different people at the
head of different departments

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:26.300 align:middle line:84%
who are pushing for
different agendas

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:28.730 align:middle line:84%
based on what they think
is best for everyone.

00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:30.560 align:middle line:84%
Or, in some cases,
what some people think

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:32.730 align:middle line:84%
is best for their
own pocketbook.

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:36.740 align:middle line:84%
So we're also, again, seeing
the inevitable conflict

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:38.900 align:middle line:84%
and collision of some of
those forces, as well.

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
work itself out

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:43.340 align:middle line:84%
in what is probably going
to be a bit of a mess.

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:45.610 align:middle line:84%
But it's, I think, that's
where we're approaching,

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:46.792 align:middle line:90%
is that getting sorted out.

00:25:46.792 --> 00:25:49.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're going through
something that I never thought

00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:50.720 align:middle line:90%
would happen on this planet.

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.730 align:middle line:84%
They say with a
vaccine that it's

00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:57.170 align:middle line:84%
a plan to put a little chips
in the vaccine to implant us.

00:25:57.170 --> 00:25:59.860 align:middle line:84%
They're happening
in Sweden right now.

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:02.850 align:middle line:10%
- Forget wearable technology.

00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:05.400 align:middle line:10%
Swedish office
worker Lin Kowalska

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:08.900 align:middle line:10%
is having it implanted
under her skin.

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:11.640 align:middle line:10%
A microchip about the
size of a grain of rice

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:14.340 align:middle line:10%
is injected into her hand.

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:16.800 align:middle line:10%
The radio frequency
identification chip

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:19.590 align:middle line:10%
is made from Pyrex glass
and contains an antenna

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:23.310 align:middle line:10%
and microchip, with
no need for batteries.

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:25.260 align:middle line:10%
While some workers
may feel uneasy

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:27.540 align:middle line:10%
at the prospect of
literally taking their work

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:29.760 align:middle line:10%
home with them, the
designers say the chip

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:32.130 align:middle line:10%
is completely safe and secure.

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:35.010 align:middle line:10%
- I've just been chipped myself.

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:38.110 align:middle line:10%
It's not a painless process,
but it doesn't last too long.

00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:40.350 align:middle line:10%
Not too difficult. Minor
surgical procedure,

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:43.350 align:middle line:10%
which basically involves
a little chip the size of,

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:47.340 align:middle line:10%
I suppose, of a grain of rice
being inserted under your skin.

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:49.620 align:middle line:10%
And you can then go off
and have it programmed

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:52.540 align:middle line:10%
and then do various things
inside the building.

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:55.380 align:middle line:10%
Let's go to have a look.

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.608 align:middle line:10%
Here's Hannes Sjoblad
who is in charge

00:26:57.608 --> 00:26:59.650 align:middle line:10%
of his whole chipping
operation in this building.

00:26:59.650 --> 00:27:00.760 align:middle line:10%
Now you've been
chipped yourself.

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:01.490 align:middle line:10%
Where's your chip?

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:01.680 align:middle line:10%
- Yeah.

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.180 align:middle line:10%
I have a chip right
here which I use

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:04.410 align:middle line:10%
to access the entire office.

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:07.335 align:middle line:10%
- So let's see if we can get
into this particular door.

00:27:07.335 --> 00:27:09.120 align:middle line:10%
- This is how I do it.

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:11.430 align:middle line:10%
No need for passcodes.

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:15.370 align:middle line:10%
- And we're in.

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:16.620 align:middle line:90%
- There's my chip right there.

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:18.450 align:middle line:90%
- So you can actually see it.

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:20.460 align:middle line:84%
- It's about the size
of a grain of rice.

00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:21.960 align:middle line:90%
And it feels like it, too.

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.810 align:middle line:10%
But what that tiny
chip can and can't do

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:27.900 align:middle line:10%
has become the source of
much concern and confusion.

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:30.632 align:middle line:10%
- I was in a grocery store and
a couple of ladies say, hey.

00:27:30.632 --> 00:27:32.340 align:middle line:84%
You're the guy with
the chip in your arm.

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:33.273 align:middle line:90%
Aren't you?

00:27:33.273 --> 00:27:34.690 align:middle line:84%
Run it across the
scanner so we'll

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:38.330 align:middle line:84%
see if we get a
discount on groceries.

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:40.960 align:middle line:10%
- Sean Darks is the
CEO of CityWatcher.com,

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:44.570 align:middle line:10%
a small company in Cincinnati,
that's the first US business

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:46.875 align:middle line:10%
to use chip implants
in its employees.

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:49.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they crazy?

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:52.380 align:middle line:90%
Getting chipped?

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:53.643 align:middle line:90%
Have you been chipped?

00:27:53.643 --> 00:27:56.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I've got implants
in my body all over the place,

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:58.350 align:middle line:90%
but that's part of my job.

00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:03.020 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not worried about
that for me, personally.

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:06.185 align:middle line:84%
Elon Musk is talking about
developing a neurolink

00:28:06.185 --> 00:28:07.310 align:middle line:90%
that they want to work on--

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:07.354 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:28:07.354 --> 00:28:07.940 align:middle line:84%
They want to put
that in the brain.

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:08.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: --the ability to
have something in your brain

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:11.450 align:middle line:84%
that you can hook right up
into your device or something

00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:12.427 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:28:12.427 --> 00:28:14.510 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know that people
are crazy for thinking

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:16.910 align:middle line:84%
about such things or
developing such things.

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:19.370 align:middle line:84%
It's an inevitability
that as we get

00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:21.080 align:middle line:84%
certain technological
advancements,

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:23.630 align:middle line:84%
some people are going
to want to do whatever

00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:25.710 align:middle line:90%
that they can with them.

00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:28.400 align:middle line:84%
When we come up with the
ability to implant people

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:31.070 align:middle line:84%
with cybernetic
super eyeballs that

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:34.020 align:middle line:84%
can see across the
electromagnetic spectrum,

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:36.680 align:middle line:84%
someone's going to pay to get
one installed in their head.

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.500 align:middle line:84%
Because they're going to
think it's a cool enough idea.

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:40.070 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that
everybody should

00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:42.680 align:middle line:90%
or that it's a great idea.

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:48.060 align:middle line:84%
But as far as putting a chip
into a vaccine or something,

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:49.670 align:middle line:84%
that's incredibly
cost prohibitive.

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:54.590 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about needing
to make billions of chips

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:57.110 align:middle line:84%
because you have
to put in, like,

00:28:57.110 --> 00:29:00.350 align:middle line:84%
1,000 nanobots into
a person's body

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:03.925 align:middle line:84%
to be able to create a
transmittable signal that's

00:29:03.925 --> 00:29:05.300 align:middle line:84%
viable, if you're
talking about--

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:06.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
what they want.

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:06.710 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Right.

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:08.085 align:middle line:84%
But you have to
be talking about,

00:29:08.085 --> 00:29:11.370 align:middle line:84%
like, nano chips that are so
tiny that you can't see them

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:12.170 align:middle line:90%
in the vial.

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:13.790 align:middle line:90%
And they're very expensive.

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And why go through
that expense when

00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:18.890 align:middle line:84%
you, pretty much, are
tracking everybody just fine

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:20.990 align:middle line:90%
by their phone?

00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:24.860 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is, pretty much,
telling the intelligence

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:26.420 align:middle line:84%
agencies where you
are and what you

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:29.300 align:middle line:84%
think about everything, just
by what you put on your phone.

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:32.300 align:middle line:84%
Why have to spend a bunch
of money putting chips

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:34.910 align:middle line:84%
in people when everyone's
walking around with their phone

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:37.890 align:middle line:84%
providing all of
that information?

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:40.340 align:middle line:84%
So it's something
that's feasible to do.

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:42.230 align:middle line:90%
I think it's cost prohibitive.

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:44.418 align:middle line:84%
And why bother doing
it, like I said,

00:29:44.418 --> 00:29:46.460 align:middle line:84%
when you can just track
everybody by their phone?

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:48.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this the
sign of the beast that's

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:50.180 align:middle line:90%
in the Book of Revelation?

00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:51.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: I don't think so.

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:51.910 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:56.600 align:middle line:84%
I think that that's reaching
into apocalyptic conspiracy

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:58.790 align:middle line:84%
theories and a place that
I wouldn't subscribe to.

00:29:58.790 --> 00:29:59.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't go there.

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:00.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: No.

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:05.360 align:middle line:84%
I think that it's non-accurately
assessing tactical thinking,

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.600 align:middle line:90%
if I want to be nice about it.

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if you were
a plant by the government

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:17.170 align:middle line:84%
to go forward and to
convince us to get chips

00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:18.917 align:middle line:90%
and that all this was great?

00:30:18.917 --> 00:30:20.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Oh, I'm
definitely not going

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:22.660 align:middle line:90%
to convince people to get chips.

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:25.390 align:middle line:84%
I would not be a person
who would suggest go out

00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:27.850 align:middle line:84%
and get a microchip
planted in you.

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:29.440 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't suggest that at all.

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:32.263 align:middle line:84%
If it were available technology
that's a personal choice,

00:30:32.263 --> 00:30:34.930 align:middle line:84%
then people would have to decide
whether they were going to make

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:35.730 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:37.540 align:middle line:84%
But I'm certainly
not here to advocate

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:39.873 align:middle line:84%
to people that they go ahead
and do something like that.

00:30:39.873 --> 00:30:41.450 align:middle line:90%
That's not my job.

00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:42.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is your job?

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: My job is
to go down the bullet

00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:47.480 align:middle line:84%
points of what the
command staff would like

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:48.800 align:middle line:90%
me to disseminate to people.

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.592 align:middle line:84%
That they think that
they should know about

00:30:50.592 --> 00:30:53.240 align:middle line:84%
what's happening in covert
military space program

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:55.820 align:middle line:84%
activities, disclosure
events, and what

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:58.513 align:middle line:84%
the near future of a
post-disclosure environment

00:30:58.513 --> 00:30:59.930 align:middle line:84%
most likely is
going to look like.

00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:03.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do they benefit
by having you do this?

00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Hopefully,
by having people

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:08.300 align:middle line:84%
a little softened up to the
idea so there's less shock.

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:10.560 align:middle line:84%
There's less surprise
and less panic.

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:11.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's going to happen.

00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:12.260 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it?

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:13.302 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh, absolutely.

00:31:13.302 --> 00:31:14.270 align:middle line:90%
It's inevitable.

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:15.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No stopping it.

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:15.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: No.

00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:16.280 align:middle line:90%
None at all.

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:18.920 align:middle line:84%
Pumping the gas, not
pumping the brakes.

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:21.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:22.740 align:middle line:84%
What kind of a
world will we have

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:25.095 align:middle line:90%
in the next 15 years, 20 years?

00:31:25.095 --> 00:31:27.720 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I think we're going to
be in a post-disclosure world.

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.510 align:middle line:84%
Which means the travel
embargo, the trade embargo,

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:32.970 align:middle line:84%
and the information
embargoes will all be down.

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And so we will be able
to travel to and for.

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.820 align:middle line:84%
We will be getting
information from all

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:41.340 align:middle line:84%
over the intergalactic
community.

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And our economy
will boom because we

00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:45.885 align:middle line:84%
will be trading with the
intergalactic community.

00:31:45.885 --> 00:31:47.760 align:middle line:84%
Selling them all the
cool stuff that we make.

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why doesn't this
intergalactic community

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:53.910 align:middle line:84%
merely come down here,
wipe out coronavirus,

00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:56.850 align:middle line:84%
and get this planet
back to normal, again?

00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, because
there's some rules about how

00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:02.670 align:middle line:84%
civilized worlds have
to conduct themselves

00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:05.170 align:middle line:84%
as they grow into the
intergalactic community.

00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's not up to a
bunch of other people

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:09.510 align:middle line:84%
outside of our own system
to come and tell us

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:11.010 align:middle line:90%
how we're going to do things.

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:15.000 align:middle line:84%
There are some agreements about
how we should do things or even

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.640 align:middle line:84%
some treaties that we've
signed on how we're

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:19.840 align:middle line:90%
going to do things over time.

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:23.670 align:middle line:84%
But it's up to us to
have our own sovereignty

00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:26.580 align:middle line:84%
to be able to decide how we
want to make this happen.

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:30.240 align:middle line:84%
To look at our own social
psychological demographics

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.670 align:middle line:84%
of human beings on planet
Earth and figure out

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:35.700 align:middle line:84%
the best way for us to walk
everybody through that process.

00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:38.970 align:middle line:84%
Instead of thinking that
somebody who's not from here

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:41.610 align:middle line:84%
has the ability to understand
us well enough to tell us

00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:43.240 align:middle line:90%
how to go through the process.

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:45.510 align:middle line:84%
So while I get that
to some people,

00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:48.060 align:middle line:84%
it seems like a
solution-oriented thing to have

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:50.670 align:middle line:84%
someone else come down
here and clean it all up--

00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:51.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Please.

00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:54.328 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Polish it up and
say there, it's all done--

00:32:54.328 --> 00:32:55.870 align:middle line:84%
it just doesn't get
to work that way.

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:57.330 align:middle line:84%
We get to solve
our own problems.

00:32:57.330 --> 00:32:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And we get to walk
through it our own way.

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And we get to come to
that place in a way

00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:05.225 align:middle line:84%
that we've decided through
our own sovereignty.

00:33:05.225 --> 00:33:07.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there an upside
to all the stuff that's

00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:07.950 align:middle line:90%
happening to us right now?

00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:08.825 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: I think so.

00:33:08.825 --> 00:33:11.220 align:middle line:84%
Again, a post-disclosure
environment

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:14.310 align:middle line:84%
is one in which the
economy is thriving.

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:18.570 align:middle line:84%
Advanced technology is going
into the industrial world

00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:20.250 align:middle line:90%
and into the private sector.

00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And the embargoes on travel
and information disappear.

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And so we have access to
greater data and information

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:30.670 align:middle line:84%
from all over the
intergalactic community.

00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:32.970 align:middle line:84%
We have the ability to
trade more of our stuff

00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:34.920 align:middle line:84%
to the intergalactic
community and from

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:36.930 align:middle line:90%
the intergalactic community.

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And get to travel
outside of our own system

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:43.980 align:middle line:84%
and start making vacation
plans to other planets.

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:46.380 align:middle line:90%
So I consider those all upsides.

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:49.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has been the
most fascinating place you have

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:51.615 align:middle line:90%
journeyed to out into space?

00:33:51.615 --> 00:33:55.430 align:middle line:90%


00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:56.890 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: That's a tough call.

00:33:56.890 --> 00:33:59.990 align:middle line:84%
There is this really
lovely little planet

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:03.110 align:middle line:84%
in the Cassiopaean
system called Sonora.

00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:03.920 align:middle line:90%
And it's--

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Inhabitable.

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:05.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:08.090 align:middle line:84%
It has a full blown
civilization of humanoids

00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:11.570 align:middle line:84%
that are very, very similar to
you and I. Except their eyes

00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:13.639 align:middle line:84%
are actually
significantly different.

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:16.880 align:middle line:84%
They have a swirly pupil,
instead of around pupil.

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:20.719 align:middle line:84%
So other than the eyeballs,
they would look practically

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:22.949 align:middle line:90%
identical to you and I.

00:34:22.949 --> 00:34:25.460 align:middle line:84%
They're similar to
us in a lot of ways

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:29.570 align:middle line:84%
that while being a very
different and unique place,

00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:32.400 align:middle line:90%
it's also kind of like home.

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:33.710 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:38.600 align:middle line:84%
It's like visiting someone
who's a biogenetic relative

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:41.370 align:middle line:84%
of some kind, from
somewhere very far away.

00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:44.060 align:middle line:84%
So it's, like I said,
some parts of it

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:47.630 align:middle line:84%
are really reminiscent
of home, while also being

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:49.210 align:middle line:90%
very alien and very different.

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:50.524 align:middle line:90%
So beautiful place.

00:34:50.524 --> 00:34:54.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where are they on the
advancement pole next to us?

00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:56.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I would
say that their--

00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:59.690 align:middle line:84%
I would say that their
mental psionic evolution

00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:02.600 align:middle line:84%
is a little bit more
advanced than where we are.

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:06.830 align:middle line:84%
But they're not really a
militarized civilization.

00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:11.330 align:middle line:84%
So their development
in private technology,

00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:16.940 align:middle line:84%
industrial technology is
commensurate with some

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:19.160 align:middle line:84%
of what we can do--
our most advanced

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:20.960 align:middle line:90%
industrial capabilities.

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:23.930 align:middle line:84%
But we certainly
have a higher level

00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:27.050 align:middle line:84%
of military-grade
technology than they

00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:29.150 align:middle line:84%
do because it's something
that they haven't really

00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:30.200 align:middle line:90%
spent time developing.

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:33.440 align:middle line:84%
So that's true with a
lot of different species.

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:36.290 align:middle line:84%
You don't necessarily have
this very cut and dry,

00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:39.140 align:middle line:84%
they're more advanced,
then we are less advanced.

00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:42.220 align:middle line:84%
You have some things that
they may be more advanced

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:45.500 align:middle line:84%
and in some things that we
may actually have some level

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:47.330 align:middle line:84%
of advancement that
someone else doesn't.

00:35:47.330 --> 00:35:49.820 align:middle line:84%
So it can be an
interesting mix of what's

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:51.620 align:middle line:84%
more advanced or
less advanced based

00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:54.680 align:middle line:84%
on personal evolution,
genetic evolution,

00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:56.750 align:middle line:84%
social psychological
psionic evolution,

00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:58.497 align:middle line:90%
and technological applications.

00:35:58.497 --> 00:36:00.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Randy, should we be
concerned about any warring

00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:02.480 align:middle line:90%
civilizations out there?

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:03.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Always.

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:03.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:04.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Always.

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:05.510 align:middle line:90%
Always.

00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:08.240 align:middle line:84%
We have what we-- as we
get out into the universe

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:11.510 align:middle line:84%
and we come across
more species, we

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:15.290 align:middle line:84%
come up with what is
a 95%, 5% breakdown.

00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:19.190 align:middle line:84%
Which is about 95% of the
species that we run into,

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:20.870 align:middle line:90%
pretty much, friendly.

00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:23.975 align:middle line:84%
Would like to just trade
goods and services.

00:36:23.975 --> 00:36:26.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They've reached
an evolutionary scale.

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:29.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, or they just
have a social development scale

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:32.180 align:middle line:84%
that they say trade is
better than punching people

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:33.920 align:middle line:90%
in the face.

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:37.270 align:middle line:84%
And so about 95% of most
species would rather trade

00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:38.270 align:middle line:90%
than get into a scuffle.

00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:39.395 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But that other 5%.

00:36:39.395 --> 00:36:42.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: That 5%
that we're always

00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:45.060 align:middle line:84%
going to have to have a strong
defense for and always be

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:46.310 align:middle line:90%
looking over our shoulder for.

00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:47.602 align:middle line:90%
Because they're just out there.

00:36:47.602 --> 00:36:49.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
makes them so evil?

00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:51.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: You know, evil
is an interesting word.

00:36:51.830 --> 00:36:59.060 align:middle line:84%
I think it's self-interest above
and beyond a moral and ethical

00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:01.490 align:middle line:90%
standard that most species have.

00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:03.420 align:middle line:90%
I think, again, that 95%, 5%--

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:06.920 align:middle line:84%
that 95%, most species have
a certain ethical and moral

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:09.350 align:middle line:84%
standard that you just don't
go kick somebody in the face

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:11.540 align:middle line:90%
and take their stuff.

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:16.640 align:middle line:84%
But that 5% may just be,
hey, social Darwinism

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:19.040 align:middle line:84%
in the universe says if I'm
big enough and strong enough,

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:20.957 align:middle line:84%
I'm perfectly entitled
to kick you in the face

00:37:20.957 --> 00:37:22.110 align:middle line:90%
and take your stuff.

00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:26.100 align:middle line:84%
So it comes from just a change
in ethical and moral belief

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:26.900 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And whether you think it's OK
to just take people's stuff

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:29.980 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:31.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that 5% aware of us?

00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:34.800 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Oh, the farther
we get out into space,

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:36.938 align:middle line:84%
the more species become
aware of us, for sure.

00:37:36.938 --> 00:37:38.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that a good
thing for us to do?

00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:41.190 align:middle line:84%
We're literally broadcasting
where we're coming from.

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:44.390 align:middle line:84%
I think overall, it's
a positive thing.

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:47.660 align:middle line:84%
Because it gets us more friends,
more neighbors, more trade

00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:48.680 align:middle line:90%
partners.

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:51.830 align:middle line:84%
But, again, the more
you get out there, sure.

00:37:51.830 --> 00:37:53.780 align:middle line:84%
You're going to run into
some of those problem

00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:55.280 align:middle line:90%
children and the bad actors.

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we have a strong
military to deal with that.

00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:00.200 align:middle line:84%
Because it's just
going to happen.

00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:01.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we
really fight back--

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:02.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh, yeah.

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:03.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: An
extraterrestrial force

00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:05.160 align:middle line:84%
that has the
ability to get here?

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:05.960 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh, yeah.

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:06.440 align:middle line:90%
We're--

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:07.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:09.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: We've made some
pretty amazing advancements

00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:11.700 align:middle line:90%
over the last number of decades.

00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:15.260 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's important
to make a point.

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:17.990 align:middle line:84%
Some species-- in fact,
a lot of species--

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:20.000 align:middle line:90%
will develop a technology--

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.190 align:middle line:84%
let's say, a spaceship,
for instance--

00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:26.030 align:middle line:84%
and if it functions
and it works,

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:28.970 align:middle line:84%
they're not going to change it
for centuries, sometimes even

00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:30.085 align:middle line:90%
thousands of years.

00:38:30.085 --> 00:38:31.460 align:middle line:84%
So you have species
out there who

00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:33.290 align:middle line:84%
are driving around
the same spaceship

00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:35.880 align:middle line:84%
that they've been driving around
for the past 2,000, 3,000,

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:38.120 align:middle line:90%
4,000, 5,000 years.

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:40.790 align:middle line:10%
Whereas we, as a
species, turn out

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:45.350 align:middle line:10%
to be a minority among the
intergalactic community, where

00:38:45.350 --> 00:38:49.930 align:middle line:10%
we have a creative desire
to build things better

00:38:49.930 --> 00:38:53.270 align:middle line:10%
five seconds after we're
done building the last one

00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:54.230 align:middle line:10%
that we built.

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:57.790 align:middle line:10%
So what we have
done in six decades,

00:38:57.790 --> 00:39:02.980 align:middle line:10%
seven decades is go centuries
beyond what some species

00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:06.100 align:middle line:10%
have done in hundreds or
even thousands of years.

00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:08.830 align:middle line:84%
Because they just don't
have the same interest

00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:12.830 align:middle line:84%
to change and make better and
develop and create than we do.

00:39:12.830 --> 00:39:15.520 align:middle line:10%
So we've actually
taken the technology

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:19.960 align:middle line:10%
that we have acquired from these
early extraterrestrial reverse

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:22.900 align:middle line:10%
engineering programs all
the way back to the '40s

00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:25.340 align:middle line:10%
and we've run crazy with it.

00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:27.610 align:middle line:84%
So as we've entered into
the intergalactic community

00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:31.360 align:middle line:84%
now, for almost
3/4 of a century,

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:33.580 align:middle line:90%
we've made significant progress.

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And we actually can stand
on our own two feet.

00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And there are more
species than not that are

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:42.640 align:middle line:84%
in this corner of the
galaxy that have no desire

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:44.097 align:middle line:90%
to test us militarily.

00:39:44.097 --> 00:39:46.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Randy, thanks for
being on Beyond Belief.

00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:47.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Thank you so much
for having me here, George.

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:49.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating discussion.

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:50.620 align:middle line:90%
Well, there you have it.

00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:52.360 align:middle line:90%
A secret Space Force.

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:54.470 align:middle line:10%
Out there to protect us?

00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:55.630 align:middle line:90%
Or not?

00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:56.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:58.690 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
