>>GEORGE NOORY: And
you're convinced that you

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.288 align:middle line:90%
can reverse terminal cancer?

00:00:14.288 --> 00:00:15.830 align:middle line:84%
>>STANISLAW BURZYNSKI:
I am because I

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.255 align:middle line:90%
am doing this all the time.

00:00:17.255 --> 00:00:18.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You've seen it happen?

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Not in
everybody because it's

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.450 align:middle line:84%
very complex, but in
many, many patients, yes.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.520 align:middle line:84%
There's abundance of
evidence that this works.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.753 align:middle line:90%
It should be approved now.

00:00:27.753 --> 00:00:28.586 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:00:28.586 --> 00:00:29.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: And they're
dragging their feet.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It'd save lives today.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.258 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Yes,
people are dying.

00:00:32.258 --> 00:00:34.910 align:middle line:84%
People could be saved, and
they are dragging their feet.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.710 align:middle line:84%
This will be revealed
to the public.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.540 align:middle line:90%
Enough is enough, I would say.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.233 align:middle line:90%


00:00:43.233 --> 00:00:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Welcome
to Beyond Belief.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.140 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Stanislaw
Burzynski with us has

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.810 align:middle line:10%
been researching and
developing cancer treatments

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.560 align:middle line:10%
for more than 40 years
with incredible results.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.480 align:middle line:84%
The government does
not want you to know

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.950 align:middle line:90%
about all these results.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.648 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Burzynski thank you, and
thank you for joining us.

00:00:59.648 --> 00:01:00.940 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: It is my pleasure.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:01.510 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have heard
so much about you.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.319 align:middle line:84%
This is my first
time meeting you,

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:09.282 align:middle line:84%
and I feel like I'm in
the presence of a god.

00:01:09.282 --> 00:01:10.240 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: Thank you.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.223 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What you have done--

00:01:12.223 --> 00:01:13.390 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: Well, I think--

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.965 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's amazing.

00:01:14.965 --> 00:01:17.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: It was
coincidence at the beginning.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.630 align:middle line:84%
So I was lucky to
make the discovery,

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.360 align:middle line:84%
and then I decided to
persist and pursue this.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.295 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's go
back to the beginning.

00:01:25.295 --> 00:01:25.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Well,
the beginning--

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.232 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Born in Poland, right?

00:01:27.232 --> 00:01:29.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Yes, the
beginning was very humble.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.730 align:middle line:10%
When I was a medical student,
I began work at the same time

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.770 align:middle line:10%
in the department
of biochemistry.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.650 align:middle line:10%
When I became the
second grade student,

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.680 align:middle line:10%
I was already giving
lectures to the students

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.970 align:middle line:10%
from the first year.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.240 align:middle line:10%
So I was involved in
biochemical research.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.110 align:middle line:84%
One of the projects was
to study amino acids

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.190 align:middle line:84%
in blood of patients
with various diseases.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.650 align:middle line:84%
When I did study
these amino acids,

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.150 align:middle line:84%
I found that there was
some unknown substances--

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh huh.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.907 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Which
were not amino acids,

00:02:05.907 --> 00:02:07.130 align:middle line:90%
but they were very similar.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.100 align:middle line:84%
So I was intrigued
what they are.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And I found that these
substances were peptides.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.690 align:middle line:84%
Peptides are chains
of amino acids.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:15.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Natural or unnatural?

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Naturally-occurring
peptides in human blood.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.550 align:middle line:84%
What's even more important
is that in advanced cancer

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.010 align:middle line:84%
patients, you
could not see them.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.030 align:middle line:90%
They were gone.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.750 align:middle line:84%
So this gave me the idea that
perhaps they play some parts

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.610 align:middle line:90%
in defense against cancer.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:31.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Defense.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: I
fractionated them,

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.590 align:middle line:84%
and when I came to
the United States,

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.700 align:middle line:84%
I already had 39 peptide
fractions isolated from blood.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.370 align:middle line:90%
Nobody ever heard about it, OK.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.100 align:middle line:84%
It's like suddenly
discovering archipelago

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.570 align:middle line:84%
of the islands which were hidden
from the rest of the world.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.410 align:middle line:84%
I was very lucky
because I received

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.210 align:middle line:84%
the position of
assistant professor

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.250 align:middle line:84%
at Baylor College
of Medicine, which

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.160 align:middle line:90%
was very good medical school.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.810 align:middle line:84%
Doing research of
peptide, they just

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.690 align:middle line:84%
got a Nobel Prize
for two people who

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.910 align:middle line:90%
did the research on peptides.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.670 align:middle line:84%
They left Baylor,
and I had an honor

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.530 align:middle line:90%
to inherit their equipment.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.740 align:middle line:90%
So I got a good start.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:13.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You did.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: I was 27 years
old, and when I was 28

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.590 align:middle line:84%
I already was nominated by the
National Cancer Institute US

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.920 align:middle line:84%
principal investigator to
study the peptides which

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.120 align:middle line:90%
I discovered.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.580 align:middle line:84%
I was somewhat unhappy
about it because obviously,

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.475 align:middle line:84%
the people who I supervised
could be my father.

00:03:33.475 --> 00:03:36.430 align:middle line:84%
They were very well
known scientists

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.980 align:middle line:90%
at M.D. Anderson and Baylor.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is a cancer?

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.703 align:middle line:90%
What is cancer?

00:03:41.703 --> 00:03:43.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Cancer
is the disease

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.510 align:middle line:90%
of information processing.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.580 align:middle line:84%
How it's created,
because, during our life

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.600 align:middle line:84%
the genes, which we
inherited from our parents,

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.290 align:middle line:84%
are exposed to a variety of
factors, and they are mutating.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.230 align:middle line:84%
When you have a certain
number of mutated genes,

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.790 align:middle line:84%
usually around 80, but
maximum's around 650,

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.200 align:middle line:90%
they form a network.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.490 align:middle line:90%
They form a software.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And this software is
telling their body

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.780 align:middle line:84%
how to make billions
of malignant cells.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.360 align:middle line:84%
I described this
theory 35 years ago,

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.685 align:middle line:84%
but nobody really
paid attention to it.

00:04:18.685 --> 00:04:20.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're listening
to you now, aren't they?

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.200 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Yeah, yeah,
now, the entire medicine

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.300 align:middle line:84%
is going in this
direction to try

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.640 align:middle line:84%
to treat the genes
which are causing cancer

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.370 align:middle line:84%
but are still behind,
probably 10 years, what we do.

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.940 align:middle line:84%
They will come to this point,
but they will need time, OK.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.770 align:middle line:90%
Big institutions are slow.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And I am rather moving rapidly
because we are a small company.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't have
government interference,

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.260 align:middle line:84%
we can really accomplish
a lot of things.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the cancer cells,
do they regenerate themselves?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: They
multiply all the time.

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.850 align:middle line:84%
Cancer is also the
process of manufacturing.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.670 align:middle line:84%
Billions of these cells
are created every day.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they kill
off the good cells?

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: They
starve the good cells.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.400 align:middle line:90%
They destroy the organs.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.380 align:middle line:90%
But at the same time, they die.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.280 align:middle line:84%
They may not survive longer
than a few days, some of them,

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.120 align:middle line:90%
some others a little longer.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.260 align:middle line:10%
So if you cut off the
supply of cancer cells,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.780 align:middle line:10%
the cancer will be eliminated.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.640 align:middle line:90%
How you can cut off the supply?

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.620 align:middle line:84%
Remove the software
which is telling

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.210 align:middle line:84%
the body how to
make cancer cells,

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.400 align:middle line:90%
and that's exactly what we do.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has been the
traditional, not your system,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.120 align:middle line:84%
but the traditional system
for medicine to treat cancer?

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Well,
traditional system

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.570 align:middle line:84%
to treat cancer was introduced
about 180 years ago by a guy

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.390 align:middle line:90%
who was born in my country.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.160 align:middle line:90%
His name was Rudolf Virchow.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.090 align:middle line:84%
He was a great
pathologist in 1845.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.640 align:middle line:84%
He introduced diagnosis of
cancer under microscope.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.798 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the
doctors are doing today.

00:05:53.798 --> 00:05:55.090 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing wrong about it.

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.120 align:middle line:84%
They look under a microscope,
and they say well,

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.910 align:middle line:84%
this picture looks like
such and such lung cancer.

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.090 align:middle line:84%
Another one looks
like a breast cancer.

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.460 align:middle line:84%
They put the labels, lung
cancer, breast cancer,

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.860 align:middle line:90%
and they treat the name.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.507 align:middle line:84%
They don't see what
is causing this.

00:06:09.507 --> 00:06:10.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a huge difference.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Well, in the
our exclusive program,

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.680 align:middle line:84%
Burzynski Cancer
Cure Cover-up, we

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.190 align:middle line:84%
hear about some tragic
results of traditional methods

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.220 align:middle line:90%
to treat cancer.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:22.780 align:middle line:90%
Let's look.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:27.310 align:middle line:10%
- What I'd like to talk to
you about today is my now

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.960 align:middle line:10%
7-year-old daughter.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.360 align:middle line:10%
This is an identical twin.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.490 align:middle line:10%
Her sister is now dead.

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.950 align:middle line:10%
Her sister, when she was
four years old, Kristin,

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:37.900 align:middle line:10%
developed a
highly-malignant brain tumor

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.420 align:middle line:10%
that had spread throughout
her spine and her brain.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.180 align:middle line:10%
The doctors told us that
we had really two options.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.000 align:middle line:10%
Take her home and let
her die, or bring her

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.720 align:middle line:10%
in for massive dosages of chemo
and radiation simultaneously.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.370 align:middle line:10%
In either event, she
was going to die,

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:54.220 align:middle line:10%
they were quite certain
of that, and very quickly.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.470 align:middle line:10%
Believing her only chance
to be the standard route,

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.690 align:middle line:10%
we gave her the
chemo and radiation.

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.480 align:middle line:10%
It burned her skull so bad
she had second degree burns,

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.820 align:middle line:10%
and her hair never came back.

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.950 align:middle line:10%
To change her diapers we
had to wear rubber gloves

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:09.490 align:middle line:10%
because her urine was so
toxic, and it burned her.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:11.773 align:middle line:10%
At the end of six
months, miraculously,

00:07:11.773 --> 00:07:13.690 align:middle line:10%
she survived the standard
treatment, although,

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:17.170 align:middle line:10%
there was a high
expectation she wouldn't.

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:18.620 align:middle line:10%
She still had cancer.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.880 align:middle line:10%
We were told sorry, we've
done everything we can.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.290 align:middle line:10%
Now, she's going
to die, probably

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:25.030 align:middle line:10%
within a couple of months.

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:28.630 align:middle line:10%
My wife and I, choosing not to
accept that, started reading.

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:31.420 align:middle line:10%
The first book I picked
up, the third chapter

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.030 align:middle line:10%
discussed Dr. Burzynski.

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:36.130 align:middle line:10%
As you may guess, I have
some expertise in fraud.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:37.630 align:middle line:10%
In fact, I'm quite
certain there are

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.922 align:middle line:10%
enough attorneys in the room
that I could be voir dired

00:07:39.922 --> 00:07:41.650 align:middle line:10%
as an expert in fraud.

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:44.260 align:middle line:10%
And I conducted my
own investigation.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.930 align:middle line:10%
I have no doubt the
man is not a fraud.

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:48.940 align:middle line:10%
I have no doubt
that he does what

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.672 align:middle line:10%
he does out of earnest belief
that his medicine works.

00:07:52.672 --> 00:07:54.880 align:middle line:10%
And now, you're in a position
to judge for yourselves

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.530 align:middle line:10%
whether it works
or not, but it's

00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:00.730 align:middle line:10%
well-established by the
FDA that it's non-toxic.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:03.700 align:middle line:10%
18 months later,
we took my daughter

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.350 align:middle line:10%
off the antineoplaston.

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:06.730 align:middle line:10%
She had not died.

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:08.410 align:middle line:10%
She had no signs of tumor.

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:11.470 align:middle line:10%
She remained free for
18 months of cancer.

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:14.620 align:middle line:10%
Within a month, the cancer
was widespread in her brain.

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.990 align:middle line:10%
We put her back on
Burzynski's, by the way,

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:18.400 align:middle line:10%
at the objections
of our doctors,

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.730 align:middle line:10%
for some reason felt
that it had failed her.

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:22.600 align:middle line:10%
We put her back on.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.660 align:middle line:10%
Within nine weeks, the
tumor was completely gone.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:29.500 align:middle line:10%
She died last July of
neurological necrosis.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.990 align:middle line:10%
Her brain fell apart
from the radiation.

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:35.320 align:middle line:10%
The autopsy showed that she
was completely cancer-free.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.289 align:middle line:10%
Out of 52 cases of
that disease ever,

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:41.080 align:middle line:10%
no one died cancer-free,
just Chrissy.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.240 align:middle line:10%
So she didn't die of
a terminal illness.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:48.170 align:middle line:10%
She died of my inability
to care for her properly,

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:49.960 align:middle line:10%
and she died from bad advice.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:54.370 align:middle line:84%
She died because there's a
government institution that

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:59.020 align:middle line:84%
disseminates false information
and is not looking out

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.150 align:middle line:90%
for the welfare of the people.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:02.472 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow, what a story.

00:09:02.472 --> 00:09:04.180 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Well,
this is a tragic story

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:08.200 align:middle line:84%
because she received twice
as high doses of radiation

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.190 align:middle line:90%
as the other children.

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:11.710 align:middle line:84%
At that time, they were
experimenting with this.

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:14.140 align:middle line:84%
These days, nobody is
giving such heavy radiation.

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:16.360 align:middle line:84%
She died from
radiation necrosis.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.000 align:middle line:84%
However, some of the
people who are sitting

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.220 align:middle line:84%
at this congressional
investigation

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.950 align:middle line:84%
are now surviving 33
years cancer-free.

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:25.882 align:middle line:84%
The boy who was sitting
next to the speaker--

00:09:25.882 --> 00:09:27.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right next
to the speaker.

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:28.908 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: Yes, the boy--

00:09:28.908 --> 00:09:29.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On your program.

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:34.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Yes, the boy
was given only six months

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:36.850 align:middle line:84%
to live when he came to us
because of a malignant brain

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:37.650 align:middle line:90%
tumor.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.790 align:middle line:84%
He was seen by the best
specialist at Mayo Clinic.

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:41.440 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't do
anything for him.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.670 align:middle line:90%
We got rid of his tumor.

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:46.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, 33 years later,
he's doing extremely well

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:48.970 align:middle line:84%
and living a normal life, as
well as many other people.

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:50.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
you say, doctor,

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:55.000 align:middle line:84%
is your success rate in
treating cancerous tumors?

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.400 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: At this moment,
the success rate is quite high.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:05.380 align:middle line:84%
It's from 66% objective response
to about 85% across the board,

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.703 align:middle line:84%
if you are talking about some
40 different types of cancer.

00:10:08.703 --> 00:10:10.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And
traditional medicine,

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.268 align:middle line:90%
what percent would that be?

00:10:11.268 --> 00:10:13.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Close to 0% because
these patients are terminal.

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:14.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my God.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:17.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: They
tried everything.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.720 align:middle line:84%
Some of them, they have a
history of cancer for 20 years.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:20.918 align:middle line:90%
They were sent to hospice.

00:10:20.918 --> 00:10:22.085 align:middle line:90%
This is typical of patients.

00:10:22.085 --> 00:10:24.580 align:middle line:90%
Some are brought to us in coma.

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:27.220 align:middle line:84%
Of course, not
everybody is responding,

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.040 align:middle line:84%
but the results,
when we're attacking

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:33.040 align:middle line:84%
the genes which are causing
the cancer, are amazing.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.970 align:middle line:90%
And they come very quickly.

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:39.340 align:middle line:84%
But in order to respond, you
need to have the right genes.

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:42.820 align:middle line:84%
They are coming from the
pool of 23,000 genes which

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:44.350 align:middle line:90%
we have in our body.

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:46.930 align:middle line:84%
The medications which
exist to treat the genes,

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:49.030 align:middle line:90%
now, they count over 200.

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:51.550 align:middle line:84%
But they usually
attack single genes.

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:54.550 align:middle line:84%
If you have a patient with
brain tumor who has 600 genes,

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:56.170 align:middle line:90%
you are out of luck.

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:59.365 align:middle line:84%
But antineoplastons
are now attacking,

00:10:59.365 --> 00:11:03.670 align:middle line:84%
according to our research,
close to 180 mutated genes.

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:07.720 align:middle line:84%
If you add antineoplastons,
you can get rid of many tumors.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.690 align:middle line:84%
But then you can add
some other medication

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:13.150 align:middle line:84%
which hit the genes for which
antineoplastons don't work.

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:15.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How soon
do you see a change?

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:18.130 align:middle line:84%
Somebody comes to you,
they have a tumor,

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:20.680 align:middle line:84%
they have cancerous
tumors, you start them

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.970 align:middle line:84%
on a program, which
we'll get into.

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:24.790 align:middle line:84%
But how soon do you
see that change?

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:25.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Well,
first of all, we

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:27.670 align:middle line:84%
would like to know if
we can help the patient,

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:29.890 align:middle line:84%
and we are running
genomic analysis.

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:31.850 align:middle line:84%
We don't do it in-house
anymore because there

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:34.233 align:middle line:84%
are very good companies,
usually sponsored

00:11:34.233 --> 00:11:35.650 align:middle line:84%
by pharmaceutical
companies, which

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:38.540 align:middle line:84%
are doing this much better
than what we did in the past.

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.220 align:middle line:90%
This is covered by insurance.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:42.190 align:middle line:84%
The patient usually
doesn't pay anything.

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:45.250 align:middle line:84%
We get the results in
seven days regarding--

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:46.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Seven days?

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.400 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Seven--
yes, whatever.

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.850 align:middle line:84%
It was taking 10 years to
decipher the genome before.

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:55.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can get the results
on the most important

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:58.220 align:middle line:84%
mutated genes with colon
cancer in seven days.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And these are the genes
which are in blood.

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:05.410 align:middle line:84%
Plus it's extremely sensitive in
detecting billion parts of gram

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:06.730 align:middle line:90%
per cubic CC of blood.

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:09.820 align:middle line:84%
So we find out if we can
help this patient or not.

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:13.480 align:middle line:84%
If you've got some unusual genes
for which we don't have data,

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:14.470 align:middle line:90%
then we cannot help.

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:16.810 align:middle line:90%
But in most patients, we can.

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:20.170 align:middle line:84%
And then usually,
if you are talking

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:22.720 align:middle line:84%
about highly-malignant
tumors, they usually

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.540 align:middle line:84%
respond very rapidly, or
they don't respond at all.

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:28.420 align:middle line:84%
Glioblastoma, we have
seen glioblastoma--

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:29.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a brain tumor?

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:31.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Yeah,
extremely malignant tumor.

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:33.820 align:middle line:84%
We are seeing glioblastoma
start going away

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:36.670 align:middle line:90%
from MRIs within four weeks.

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:38.763 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My sister died of that.

00:12:38.763 --> 00:12:40.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Of course, not
everybody is responding,

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:45.400 align:middle line:84%
but we got something
like 85% response

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.940 align:middle line:84%
rate, which the elimination, of
the tumor [INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.550 align:middle line:84%
in classical variety
of glioblastoma, which

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:53.950 align:middle line:90%
covers about 85% of patients.

00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:56.497 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isn't that what
Senator Edward Kennedy had also?

00:12:56.497 --> 00:12:57.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: Correct, yes.

00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, he was thinking
about coming to us,

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:00.907 align:middle line:90%
but it was too late.

00:13:00.907 --> 00:13:02.740 align:middle line:84%
Finally, he died before
he was able to come.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was going to say
what is too late for a patient?

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.518 align:middle line:10%
>>BURZYNSKI: Too late
for the person is usually

00:13:07.518 --> 00:13:09.740 align:middle line:10%
when he is in coma because
then it's difficult.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.820 align:middle line:84%
We have some patients
who recovered from coma,

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:14.200 align:middle line:90%
and we got rid of the tumors.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:17.830 align:middle line:84%
But the chance is
something like probably 2/3

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:20.870 align:middle line:84%
of them are going to
die, and they have

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:22.390 align:middle line:90%
a variety of complications.

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:23.500 align:middle line:90%
They may get pneumonia.

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:27.530 align:middle line:84%
They may have a
bleeding from the tumor.

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:30.820 align:middle line:84%
So such patients usually
don't have much chance.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:33.750 align:middle line:84%
But if the patient
has at least couple

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:36.510 align:middle line:84%
of months expected
survival, I think

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:37.650 align:middle line:90%
we have a fighting chance.

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And we see the results
in most of these cancers

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:42.990 align:middle line:90%
during the first month.

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And on the top of
the response rate,

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:49.350 align:middle line:90%
we have now breast cancer.

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:51.990 align:middle line:84%
Triple negative breast
cancer is the most difficult,

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:54.690 align:middle line:84%
and we are getting
66% response rate.

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:58.210 align:middle line:84%
But in the other
advanced breast cancer,

00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:01.080 align:middle line:84%
they spread everywhere,
OK, we are now

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.777 align:middle line:84%
at the level of close
to 90% response rate.

00:14:03.777 --> 00:14:04.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fantastic.

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.230 align:middle line:84%
And you are pretty
direct with a patient?

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:08.640 align:middle line:90%
If they come to you, you tell--

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:09.705 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: We have to.

00:14:09.705 --> 00:14:13.260 align:middle line:84%
We have to because first, we
screen the patient to find out

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.470 align:middle line:84%
if they should come to us
or not because obviously,

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:18.550 align:middle line:90%
some of them we cannot help.

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:19.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you're in Houston.

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:22.600 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Yes, and they
travel from all over the world.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:26.310 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, we don't want
them to travel for nothing.

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:31.290 align:middle line:84%
But we go through very extensive
consent process, informed

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:34.290 align:middle line:84%
consent process, which
is required by the state

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.080 align:middle line:84%
laws, numerous papers
which patient needs

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:40.300 align:middle line:90%
to read, understand, and sign.

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.680 align:middle line:84%
So this is very
strictly guarded by law.

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:47.223 align:middle line:84%
And I can treat this right
only terminal cancer patients.

00:14:47.223 --> 00:14:48.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
what you go after.

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:52.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Yes, well, again,
I like it because these people

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.250 align:middle line:90%
are hopeless.

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:54.970 align:middle line:90%
Nobody can help them anymore.

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:56.440 align:middle line:90%
They tried everything.

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.710 align:middle line:84%
So then we have a little more
freedom what we can do to help.

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if you help them,
they're miracles, aren't they?

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: You can see
results rather quickly.

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:09.000 align:middle line:84%
We can have children who are
paralyzed, who cannot swallow,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.470 align:middle line:90%
who cannot walk.

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:13.500 align:middle line:84%
And recently, we have
children with brainstem tumors

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.330 align:middle line:90%
who could not only walk.

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:18.780 align:middle line:84%
But from the wheelchair, they
could run through the corridor

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:19.590 align:middle line:90%
after two weeks.

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:22.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
Burzynski treatment plan?

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:25.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Well, the
plan, we call it cyber war

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:28.860 align:middle line:84%
because we're attacking
the program which

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:30.330 align:middle line:90%
is necessary to make cancer.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:31.800 align:middle line:90%
We are not killing cancer cells.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:34.470 align:middle line:84%
We are attacking the
program which is causing

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:36.750 align:middle line:90%
them to grow and multiply.

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:37.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I see.

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: And
our treatment plan

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:42.150 align:middle line:84%
consists of the proliferation
of antineoplastons,

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:44.580 align:middle line:90%
which covers most of the genes.

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:47.580 align:middle line:84%
Plus, we are prescribing
some other medications which

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:50.880 align:middle line:84%
are called targeted medications,
or gene-targeted medications.

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
administer it, IVs?

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:54.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Yes,
antineoplastons

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.450 align:middle line:84%
for such advanced patients
are administered IVs,

00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:02.970 align:middle line:84%
but they are given this at
home because we perfected

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:04.560 align:middle line:90%
automatic delivery systems.

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:08.850 align:middle line:84%
There's a special pump which
we ask the company to design,

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:11.235 align:middle line:84%
and this delivers
automatically the medicine.

00:16:11.235 --> 00:16:13.110 align:middle line:84%
The patient does not
need to be hospitalized.

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:15.120 align:middle line:84%
We teach them how
to program the pump.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:18.330 align:middle line:84%
They do it at home,
side effects minimal.

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:20.100 align:middle line:84%
Of course, on the
top of that, we

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:23.160 align:middle line:84%
may add some tablets of
gene-targeted medication, which

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:27.150 align:middle line:84%
we can prescribe because we do
not cover all of these genes.

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:30.218 align:middle line:84%
But if you are lucky enough, the
combination may work very well.

00:16:30.218 --> 00:16:32.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I interviewed
a person by the name

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:34.470 align:middle line:84%
of Ty Bollinger, who
wrote a book called

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:36.540 align:middle line:90%
Cancer: Step Outside the Box.

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:40.190 align:middle line:84%
He talks about how
the treatments,

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:43.220 align:middle line:84%
the regular, normal
medical treatments

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:46.752 align:middle line:90%
can be more harm than good.

00:16:46.752 --> 00:16:48.210 align:middle line:10%
- They operate on
someone, and they

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:52.927 align:middle line:10%
cut into a cancerous tumor,
cutting into a tumor seeds

00:16:52.927 --> 00:16:54.260 align:middle line:10%
the cancer into the bloodstream.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:54.890 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Goes all
over the place.

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:57.020 align:middle line:10%
- It causes the cancerous cells
to go into the bloodstream,

00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:58.190 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Where it might
have been isolated.

00:16:58.190 --> 00:16:59.480 align:middle line:10%
- Well, it was isolated.

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:01.700 align:middle line:10%
That's the body's
self-protection mechanism

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:03.740 align:middle line:10%
is to wall it off into a tumor.

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:05.300 align:middle line:10%
It's not spreading
at that point.

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:07.369 align:middle line:10%
Most of the spreading
of cancer happens

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:10.400 align:middle line:10%
from either the diagnostic
treatments or the treatments

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.698 align:middle line:10%
themselves, like surgery
to try to remove a tumor.

00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:14.990 align:middle line:10%
There's no way, if you remove
a tumor, that you are not

00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:17.900 align:middle line:10%
going to cut into that tumor
and spread some of those cancer

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:19.092 align:middle line:10%
cells into the bloodstream.

00:17:19.092 --> 00:17:21.050 align:middle line:10%
Then it goes through the
blood, into the lymph,

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:23.400 align:middle line:10%
and it's everywhere.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:26.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would you say is
one of the most dramatic cases

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:30.900 align:middle line:84%
you've had of someone
who is near terminal

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:32.730 align:middle line:84%
and you changed it,
you turned it around.

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:34.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: A little
boy, three years old,

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:38.820 align:middle line:84%
was brought to us from
Madras, or Chennai, in India.

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:40.620 align:middle line:90%
Both parents were doctors.

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:44.760 align:middle line:84%
He developed glioblastoma
of brainstem,

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:48.210 align:middle line:84%
which is called DIPG, diffuse
intrinsic pontine glioma.

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:50.520 align:middle line:84%
But on top of that,
this was the tumor

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:51.645 align:middle line:90%
of the highest malignancy.

00:17:51.645 --> 00:17:52.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yes.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: This is
uniformly deadly tumor.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:54.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And fast.

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: If you combine
strategic location of tumor

00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:01.590 align:middle line:84%
in the brain stem with very
heavy aggressiveness, well,

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:03.030 align:middle line:90%
it's pretty much hopeless.

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:05.340 align:middle line:90%
He was brought to us in coma.

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:09.030 align:middle line:84%
After three months, the active
tumor was gone from the MRI.

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:09.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gone.

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.257 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Gone,
well, from MRI.

00:18:11.257 --> 00:18:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can still see
some swelling, some scars,

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:15.780 align:middle line:90%
but active tumor was gone.

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:18.760 align:middle line:90%
And then he recovered from coma.

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:21.330 align:middle line:90%
He was able to eat normally.

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:23.190 align:middle line:84%
But we also have
some other couple

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:25.530 align:middle line:84%
of patients who were
brought to us in coma,

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:28.410 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't make it
because such patients are

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:30.840 align:middle line:90%
vulnerable to develop pneumonia.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.240 align:middle line:84%
They usually received
radiation therapy.

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:37.140 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they receive blood
clots, sometimes they bleed.

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.810 align:middle line:84%
So there are numerous
other medical problems,

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:42.060 align:middle line:84%
and I have to treat these
patients as outpatient

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:45.960 align:middle line:84%
because the treatment is not
approved in the hospital.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:49.890 align:middle line:84%
So I have to treat some of the
toughest cases in the world

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:53.550 align:middle line:84%
outpatient, which, again,
during the epidemics,

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:57.540 align:middle line:84%
it served a purpose because
they don't get COVID.

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:00.690 align:middle line:84%
In the hospital, they
can get COVID and die.

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:01.800 align:middle line:90%
But it's very difficult.

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:04.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you have
a patient that survives

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:08.253 align:middle line:84%
and the tumors
shrink and go away,

00:19:08.253 --> 00:19:09.420 align:middle line:90%
how does that make you feel?

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:12.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Numerous patients,
I published numerous articles

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:13.178 align:middle line:90%
in scientific--

00:19:13.178 --> 00:19:14.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you must
feel good about that.

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:17.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Sure, in
scientific medical journals,

00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:18.960 align:middle line:84%
in peer reviewed
journals, now, we

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:21.870 align:middle line:84%
are publishing average
article per month

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:23.460 align:middle line:90%
on the long-term survival.

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:26.610 align:middle line:84%
First time medical history,
like 27-year survival,

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:30.810 align:middle line:84%
tumor-free, 23 years
survival, and we just

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:35.670 align:middle line:84%
accepted another article about
25-year survival of DIPG.

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:38.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they ever come
back and thank you years later?

00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:41.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: We maintain
contact with people.

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:44.460 align:middle line:90%
Of course, we have reunions.

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:47.220 align:middle line:84%
We had 35 years
reunion, whatever,

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:52.080 align:middle line:84%
and we are giving them
some decorations when

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.300 align:middle line:90%
they survived such a long time.

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:55.980 align:middle line:84%
But of course, there
are some people

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:57.720 align:middle line:84%
who would like to
forget about it,

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:00.660 align:middle line:84%
and they don't want to
talk about it because they

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:04.978 align:middle line:84%
had a brain tumor a long time
ago, some other terrible--

00:20:04.978 --> 00:20:06.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bad memories, I guess.

00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:08.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: They don't
like to recall it.

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:11.790 align:middle line:84%
We have a talented
attorney from California

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:14.790 align:middle line:84%
who was treated by us in
1995 for glioblastoma.

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:19.020 align:middle line:84%
We got rid of his tumor, but he
is alive and back in practice.

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:21.140 align:middle line:84%
But he does not
advertise it because who

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.550 align:middle line:84%
would like to go to the
attorney who had a brain tumor?

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:27.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many patients do
you think you treat and work

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.030 align:middle line:90%
on per year.

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:31.910 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: We are maintaining
the patient load below 100

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:34.340 align:middle line:90%
because it's very intensive.

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:37.040 align:middle line:84%
The care is very
intensive, and we

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:40.410 align:middle line:84%
don't want to really decrease
the standard of care.

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:43.670 align:middle line:84%
So we would like to spend a lot
of time with these patients,

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:45.230 align:middle line:84%
and they have a
lot of questions.

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:46.580 align:middle line:90%
The whole families are coming.

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.800 align:middle line:84%
For instance, we have
whole families coming

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.168 align:middle line:90%
from New Zealand or Australia.

00:20:50.168 --> 00:20:52.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They come from all
over the world, don't they?

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:55.910 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Yeah, and
they would like to know--

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:58.730 align:middle line:84%
and we need to have people
who speak many languages.

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:01.310 align:middle line:84%
Our staff speak somewhere
like 15 languages

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:03.470 align:middle line:90%
so it's helpful also.

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:06.200 align:middle line:84%
But we would like to limit
the number of patients

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.370 align:middle line:84%
because we like to spend
a lot of time with them,

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:12.230 align:middle line:84%
and we like to make sure that
they receive the best care.

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:16.915 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you surprised at
how well your treatment works?

00:21:16.915 --> 00:21:19.040 align:middle line:10%
>>BURZYNSKI: Yes, I am
surprised to a certain point

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.620 align:middle line:10%
because it didn't come suddenly.

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:25.220 align:middle line:10%
At the beginning, we didn't
have such a good response rate

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:27.890 align:middle line:10%
because we were
perfecting our treatment.

00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:29.973 align:middle line:84%
It took many years to
come to this point.

00:21:29.973 --> 00:21:31.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Perfecting
it and experimental.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:35.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Yeah, well, initial
patients were treated in 1977,

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:38.480 align:middle line:84%
and at that time,
20% of patients

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.250 align:middle line:84%
who were in phase
I clinical trials

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:41.660 align:middle line:90%
responded to the treatment.

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:45.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, we have
much better success rate.

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:46.412 align:middle line:90%
We're around 80%.

00:21:46.412 --> 00:21:47.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this
treatment, doctor,

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:50.520 align:middle line:84%
that people without
cancer should take, too?

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:51.320 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: No.

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:52.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would it
be preventative?

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:54.688 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Not yet, we
are not at this level,

00:21:54.688 --> 00:21:56.420 align:middle line:84%
and the reason is
that the methods

00:21:56.420 --> 00:22:00.380 align:middle line:84%
to detect the genes which
are mutated in blood

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:03.710 align:middle line:84%
are not yet so sensitive
to do it for people

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:04.890 align:middle line:90%
who don't have cancer.

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:05.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I see.

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Because
they don't have

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:10.730 align:middle line:84%
enough of this genetic
material in blood.

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:14.030 align:middle line:84%
For instance, the patients
who have advanced cancer,

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:21.170 align:middle line:84%
they may have something like
around 100 million parts

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:24.260 align:middle line:90%
of gram per cubic CC of blood.

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And this can be detected
by the current methods,

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:30.710 align:middle line:84%
but people who
don't have cancer,

00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:32.870 align:middle line:84%
they may have a
million times less.

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:37.340 align:middle line:84%
I introduced a method
which can study molecules

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:38.420 align:middle line:90%
at such low level.

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:41.210 align:middle line:84%
It's called phantom
molecular level.

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:46.970 align:middle line:84%
Nano is a million times
less sensitive than phantom.

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:50.990 align:middle line:84%
In 1974, I published
a method in Journal

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:54.650 align:middle line:84%
of Analytical Biochemistry
how to analyze peptides

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:58.970 align:middle line:84%
in the level of a million
times less than nano.

00:22:58.970 --> 00:22:59.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:02.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Well, it was
a very tedious method.

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:03.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have
always said, doctor,

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:07.040 align:middle line:84%
that all of us,
you, me, all of us

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.810 align:middle line:90%
have cancer cells in our body.

00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:13.490 align:middle line:84%
It's our immune system
that helps suppress it.

00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:14.300 align:middle line:90%
Am I right?

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:15.758 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: You're
right, but they

00:23:15.758 --> 00:23:17.990 align:middle line:90%
escape from the immune system.

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:20.660 align:middle line:84%
In the immune system,
we have system

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:22.980 align:middle line:84%
of antineoplastons, the
peptides we have discovered.

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:23.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:28.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: When this peptide
goes down, then, of course,

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:31.520 align:middle line:84%
the program to make
cancer cells is

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:34.220 align:middle line:84%
expanding because
antineoplastons

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:36.950 align:middle line:84%
are getting rid of the
software engineers of cancer.

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:39.320 align:middle line:84%
Immune system is
killing cancer cells.

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:41.930 align:middle line:84%
Antineoplastons are
not killing cancer.

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:44.515 align:middle line:84%
They are removing software,
and they will die.

00:23:44.515 --> 00:23:45.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you
raise the peptide

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:47.300 align:middle line:90%
level, is that what you do?

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:49.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Yes,
ultimately, because, you

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:53.000 align:middle line:84%
see, the treatment
with chemotherapy

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.340 align:middle line:84%
originating from the war, when
they used gases to kill people,

00:23:58.340 --> 00:23:59.170 align:middle line:90%
to kill soldiers.

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:02.450 align:middle line:84%
So this is toxic
treatment which kills

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:04.340 align:middle line:90%
cells, which kills also people.

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:07.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It kills the
good stuff, too, right?

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:11.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: But now, the name
of the game is the cyber war.

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:13.820 align:middle line:84%
You can neutralize
the country if you

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:16.430 align:middle line:84%
neutralize the
infrastructure, if you

00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:18.590 align:middle line:90%
utilize information processing.

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:20.000 align:middle line:90%
You can see this all the time.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.220 align:middle line:90%
You don't need powerful bombs.

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:23.960 align:middle line:84%
You can conquer
the country simply

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:28.340 align:middle line:90%
by affecting the software.

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And this is very
dangerous, but I

00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:33.140 align:middle line:84%
am using similar principal
how to cure cancer

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:34.490 align:middle line:90%
in a peaceful way.

00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:36.990 align:middle line:84%
Don't poison cancer,
but remove software

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:38.240 align:middle line:90%
which is necessary to make it.

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The medical schools,
are they teaching your system?

00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:41.990 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: Not at all.

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:42.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not at all.

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:43.410 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: Not at all.

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:47.000 align:middle line:84%
They usually say
bad words about us.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.620 align:middle line:10%
They don't cooperate with us.

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:51.950 align:middle line:84%
They sabotage our
treatment when they

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:54.260 align:middle line:84%
know that they can't do
anything for the patient

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.330 align:middle line:84%
because they don't know
what to do with this.

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:59.960 align:middle line:84%
But with a patient who will go
to the hospital for such reason

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:02.330 align:middle line:84%
like pneumonia or
some other problem,

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:04.437 align:middle line:84%
they usually tell
the patient go home

00:25:04.437 --> 00:25:06.270 align:middle line:84%
because this treatment
is not going to work.

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:09.290 align:middle line:84%
So these doctors, they
behave in a horrible way,

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:11.960 align:middle line:84%
except for a certain
percentage who works with us.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:15.560 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere like one out of 20
oncologists works with us.

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:16.880 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing new about it.

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.470 align:middle line:84%
It was always this way
when medical discovery

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:20.270 align:middle line:90%
was presented.

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:21.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about big pharma?

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:22.790 align:middle line:84%
Are they jumping
in on this, going

00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:24.060 align:middle line:90%
let's see what he's doing.

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:25.310 align:middle line:90%
Let's duplicate it.

00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:27.368 align:middle line:90%
Let's make money doing it.

00:25:27.368 --> 00:25:28.910 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: They
still don't get it,

00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:31.130 align:middle line:84%
that this would be
salvation for them,

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:34.290 align:middle line:84%
because we are using
some of their medication

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:36.050 align:middle line:90%
which works on the genes.

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:39.320 align:middle line:90%
But they are very, very passive.

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:42.380 align:middle line:84%
They each have their own
plans they would like to use,

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:45.500 align:middle line:84%
whatever they introduce
for many, many years.

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:48.860 align:middle line:84%
So they're not paying much
attention to what we have.

00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:50.090 align:middle line:90%
It's too early for that.

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:52.460 align:middle line:84%
There will be a time
when all of them

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:57.170 align:middle line:84%
will be crowded in our
door because finally they

00:25:57.170 --> 00:25:58.790 align:middle line:90%
will get it what it is.

00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:01.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a Gaia show
called The Truth About Cancer.

00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:03.740 align:middle line:84%
Robert Scott Bell
and Darrell Wolfe

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:08.575 align:middle line:84%
share their insights about why
these things are happening.

00:26:08.575 --> 00:26:11.260 align:middle line:10%
>>ROBERT SCOTT BELL: At the
time of the late 1800s and early

00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:14.205 align:middle line:10%
1900s, 20th century,
medical schools

00:26:14.205 --> 00:26:15.580 align:middle line:10%
taught a lot of
different things.

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:17.230 align:middle line:10%
There were homeopathic
medical schools.

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:18.700 align:middle line:10%
There were naturopathic schools.

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:21.430 align:middle line:10%
There were eclectic
herbal-type medicine schools.

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:23.140 align:middle line:10%
And so it was all there.

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:24.520 align:middle line:10%
There was not one way.

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:26.980 align:middle line:10%
And what happened was that
the Rockefeller and Carnegie

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:31.392 align:middle line:10%
Foundations were interested
in establishing the one way.

00:26:31.392 --> 00:26:32.350 align:middle line:10%
How would they do that?

00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:34.510 align:middle line:10%
Well, they would get a hold
of the education system

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:38.500 align:middle line:10%
and create a medical monopoly
via basically eliminating

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:41.560 align:middle line:10%
all competition to
patent petrochemical

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:43.240 align:middle line:10%
medical education.

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:46.000 align:middle line:10%
That's the Flexner Report
of 1910, it became known.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.670 align:middle line:10%
Abraham and Simon Flexner
were hired to do this.

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:50.740 align:middle line:10%
It was a preordained,
commissioned report.

00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:52.600 align:middle line:10%
>>DARRELL WOLFE:
Not surprisingly,

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:55.810 align:middle line:10%
the basis of the report
was that it was far too

00:26:55.810 --> 00:27:00.760 align:middle line:10%
easy to start a medical school
and that most schools were not

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:03.420 align:middle line:10%
teaching sound medicine.

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:06.000 align:middle line:10%
Let me translate this for you.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.980 align:middle line:10%
These natural health
colleges were not

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:14.090 align:middle line:10%
pushing enough chemical
drugs manufactured by who?

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:16.040 align:middle line:10%
Carnegie and Rockefeller.

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:20.120 align:middle line:10%
The AMA, who were evaluating
the various medical colleges,

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:23.750 align:middle line:10%
made it their job to target and
shut down the larger respected

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:26.090 align:middle line:10%
homeopathic colleges.

00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:29.150 align:middle line:10%
Carnegie and Rockefeller
began to immediately shower

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:33.560 align:middle line:10%
hundreds of millions of dollars
on these medical schools

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:38.298 align:middle line:10%
that were teaching
drug-intensive medicine.

00:27:38.298 --> 00:27:39.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's true, isn't it?

00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:40.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI:
Absolutely, well, this

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:42.650 align:middle line:84%
is why they are doing
a great job, of course.

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:46.022 align:middle line:84%
They have congresses when
they present it to the public.

00:27:46.022 --> 00:27:47.480 align:middle line:84%
Numerous people
are attending this.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:50.621 align:middle line:90%
But they're doing a great job.

00:27:50.621 --> 00:27:54.690 align:middle line:84%
Ty Bollinger visited our
clinic a number of times.

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:55.740 align:middle line:90%
He's a very good man.

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:56.823 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He is a good guy.

00:27:56.823 --> 00:27:59.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: So they're
trying to bring to the people

00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:02.270 align:middle line:84%
something which can save
their lives, at least

00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:03.590 align:middle line:90%
of some of them.

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:07.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, there is
tremendous progress

00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:10.070 align:middle line:84%
in the area in
which I am involved,

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:11.600 align:middle line:84%
but this progress,
at this moment,

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.210 align:middle line:90%
is at a laboratory level.

00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:15.770 align:middle line:84%
Every week there
is something new.

00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:16.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Expand.

00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:18.308 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: From
laboratory level,

00:28:18.308 --> 00:28:21.080 align:middle line:84%
it will filter to
clinical level.

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:23.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did the government
try to shut you down?

00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:25.088 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Well,
they were trying

00:28:25.088 --> 00:28:27.260 align:middle line:90%
to shut me down for 35 years.

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:30.230 align:middle line:90%
So this was like 35 Years War.

00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:32.613 align:middle line:84%
I barely survived because
it was very difficult.

00:28:32.613 --> 00:28:33.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was tough.

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:36.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Great financial
losses, harassment,

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:39.412 align:middle line:90%
living in horrible times.

00:28:39.412 --> 00:28:41.120 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to
shut us out, and they

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:42.630 align:middle line:90%
knew that it even works.

00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:43.760 align:middle line:90%
So that's what is bad.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:46.610 align:middle line:84%
FDA admitted that they knew
that the treatment works.

00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:48.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you ever
lose your medical license?

00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:50.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Well,
Texas Medical Board

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.760 align:middle line:84%
was trying to take
my license away

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:56.840 align:middle line:84%
for testing the genes
which are causing cancer.

00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:02.750 align:middle line:84%
I began doing this 22 years
ago in our laboratory.

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:03.860 align:middle line:90%
They attacked me.

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:07.820 align:middle line:84%
Why do you test the genes in
blood which are causing cancer?

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, a senate is going
to force Medicare

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:15.373 align:middle line:84%
to request that everybody will
be tested this way to detect--

00:29:15.373 --> 00:29:16.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is
good news, right?

00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Yeah,
it's good news

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:19.310 align:middle line:90%
because it's moving forward.

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:21.800 align:middle line:84%
But before this would
filter to oncologists,

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:24.740 align:middle line:84%
it takes time because
they're very passive.

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:26.630 align:middle line:90%
They are just obeying.

00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:29.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why, doctor, don't they
look at your success records

00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:32.270 align:middle line:84%
and go look what
this person is doing?

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:36.140 align:middle line:84%
He's got this high rate of
60%, or whatever the number is.

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:37.350 align:middle line:90%
Why don't they look at this?

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:38.150 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:38.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: They
don't look at this

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:40.530 align:middle line:84%
because it didn't
come from Harvard,

00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:41.900 align:middle line:90%
didn't come from Mayo Clinic.

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:45.330 align:middle line:84%
It comes from little
space, little place

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:46.370 align:middle line:90%
which I am running.

00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And they feel that what
I publish is not true,

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:53.540 align:middle line:84%
but I publish some
350 publications.

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And now, every month,
I am producing one

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:59.120 align:middle line:84%
to two publications about
the long-term survival.

00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:02.120 align:middle line:90%
I have about 300 patents.

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:04.940 align:middle line:84%
There is a tremendous
amount of their --

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:08.660 align:middle line:84%
I was going to various
congresses twice or four times

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:12.290 align:middle line:84%
a year, the top congresses
regarding cancer,

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:13.310 align:middle line:90%
and presented it.

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:15.980 align:middle line:84%
But usually, they were
given me some hide--

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:18.110 align:middle line:90%
they hide my research.

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:20.280 align:middle line:90%
They didn't give me the lecture.

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:23.090 align:middle line:90%
Oh, let's get a poster, OK?

00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:25.430 align:middle line:84%
So they neglected
this for many years,

00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:28.520 align:middle line:84%
but the time will come when
they will understand it.

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:31.190 align:middle line:84%
This is typical for
scientific revolution.

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:35.300 align:middle line:84%
We are coming to the point
when ultimately these people,

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:37.707 align:middle line:84%
they will understand
whatever they were doing.

00:30:37.707 --> 00:30:39.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're
convinced that you

00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:41.778 align:middle line:90%
can reverse terminal cancer?

00:30:41.778 --> 00:30:44.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: I am because I
am doing this all the time.

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:45.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You've seen it happen.

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:47.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Not in
everybody because it's

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:50.360 align:middle line:84%
very complex, but in
many, many patients, yes.

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.787 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why doesn't
it work for everybody?

00:30:52.787 --> 00:30:54.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Because
everybody is different,

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:59.640 align:middle line:84%
because the program is
coming from 23,000 genes.

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:00.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I see.

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: And this is only
the first layer of complexity

00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:08.150 align:middle line:84%
because this is what we call
genetics, problems, the genes.

00:31:08.150 --> 00:31:12.500 align:middle line:84%
But then you have epigenetics,
which is even more complex,

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:15.512 align:middle line:84%
the possibility of
30 million changes.

00:31:15.512 --> 00:31:16.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you think, doctor,

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:21.380 align:middle line:90%
of vitamins and supplementation?

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:22.385 align:middle line:90%
Does it help?

00:31:22.385 --> 00:31:24.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: They are
important, no doubt about it.

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:27.620 align:middle line:84%
But in terminal cancer patients,
they play a secondary part.

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:30.680 align:middle line:84%
If a patient cannot
swallow, well--

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can't
take your vitamins.

00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:33.680 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: Yeah.

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:35.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I know a
person in St. Louis,

00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:39.620 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
give him a larynec--

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:42.300 align:middle line:84%
they're going to remove
it because it's cancerous.

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:43.100 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: Yeah.

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:45.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does that sound
like it's gone too far?

00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:48.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Correct, yes, but,
for instance, in many cases,

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:50.430 align:middle line:84%
they have tubes because they
are not able to swallow.

00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:52.650 align:middle line:84%
They have cancer in
the esophagus, stomach,

00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:55.910 align:middle line:84%
or they have a brain
tumor which is causing

00:31:55.910 --> 00:31:58.160 align:middle line:90%
paralysis of the muscles.

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:00.950 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, they
may recover from this

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:03.050 align:middle line:90%
if you have enough time.

00:32:03.050 --> 00:32:05.840 align:middle line:84%
We need somewhere like one to
two months to make sure that--

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:07.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It spreads that fast?

00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:10.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Yeah,
if their survival

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:13.100 align:middle line:84%
is measured in a few
days, then we really

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:14.690 align:middle line:90%
don't have much chance.

00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, they
bring such patients,

00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:19.710 align:middle line:90%
and we won't be able to help.

00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:23.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has been
the most satisfying aspect

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:24.210 align:middle line:90%
of what you do?

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:25.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Well,
perhaps treatment

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:28.710 align:middle line:84%
of malignant brain
tumors in children

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:30.810 align:middle line:90%
because they are tragic cases.

00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:34.290 align:middle line:84%
All of them practically
die from such tumors.

00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:36.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does St Jude's
ever call you for help?

00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:37.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: No.

00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:39.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You would
think they would.

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: They
are against us.

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:43.020 align:middle line:84%
We are seeing patients
coming from them,

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:45.840 align:middle line:84%
but they don't say
good words from us.

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:48.420 align:middle line:84%
Simply, they don't want
to look at the results.

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:52.470 align:middle line:84%
FDA inspected all of our
results regarding brain tumors,

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:55.170 align:middle line:84%
and they had a very
good opinion about it,

00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:58.510 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't really
make the breakthrough

00:32:58.510 --> 00:33:00.190 align:middle line:90%
so the other guys will follow.

00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:01.190 align:middle line:90%
They still sabotage.

00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:04.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there anybody
in government, high up,

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:06.403 align:middle line:90%
who would back you publicly?

00:33:06.403 --> 00:33:08.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Yes,
there are such people,

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:10.310 align:middle line:84%
but they are silent because
of political pressure.

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:11.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're afraid.

00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:13.102 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Some of
the top people at FDA,

00:33:13.102 --> 00:33:14.250 align:middle line:90%
they knew very well.

00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:16.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, your
patients love what you do.

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:17.640 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at some
of the stories.

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: The patients
are very important.

00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:21.210 align:middle line:10%
- My name is Jodi Fenton.

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:23.940 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Burzynski saved
my life 19 years ago

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:26.670 align:middle line:10%
when I was diagnosed with an
inoperable brain tumor, known

00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:28.800 align:middle line:10%
as an anaplastic astrocytoma.

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:32.190 align:middle line:10%
- My name is Dustin Canary, and
Dr. Burzynski saved my life.

00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:35.940 align:middle line:10%
- My wife is treated by
Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski,

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:40.170 align:middle line:10%
an incredible human being who
I believe has found something

00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:42.360 align:middle line:10%
that could help so many people.

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:45.340 align:middle line:10%
- Hannah's prognosis
was like 18 months.

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:46.140 align:middle line:10%
- Yeah.

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:47.580 align:middle line:10%
- And that was eight years ago.

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:51.120 align:middle line:10%
- When I was 2 1/2 years old, I
was diagnosed with a stage four

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:53.220 align:middle line:10%
medulloblastoma brain tumor.

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:57.180 align:middle line:10%
- Conventional doctors offered
me chemotherapy and radiation

00:33:57.180 --> 00:34:00.750 align:middle line:10%
and said that maybe those
treatments would give me five

00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:03.420 align:middle line:10%
years to live, perhaps, maybe.

00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:06.270 align:middle line:10%
- 75% of the tumor was
surgically removed,

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:09.750 align:middle line:10%
and the remaining 25% was
treated by Dr. Burzynski's

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:11.190 align:middle line:10%
antineoplastons.

00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:13.170 align:middle line:10%
- I got my scan
results, and like,

00:34:13.170 --> 00:34:18.643 align:middle line:10%
there's nothing, not even a
teeny tiny little bit, left.

00:34:18.643 --> 00:34:21.060 align:middle line:10%
- The remaining tumor was gone,
and I've been in remission

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:22.440 align:middle line:10%
for over 20 years.

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:25.050 align:middle line:10%
- Within six months, all
that was left of the tumor

00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:26.219 align:middle line:10%
was scar tissue.

00:34:26.219 --> 00:34:29.880 align:middle line:10%
- I've been cancer-free
free for five years.

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:32.080 align:middle line:10%
- Can ask you why are
you looking up there.

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:32.969 align:middle line:10%
- I'm just thinking.

00:34:32.969 --> 00:34:33.960 align:middle line:10%
- Oh, OK.

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:35.085 align:middle line:10%
- This is my thinking face.

00:34:35.085 --> 00:34:37.679 align:middle line:10%
- It is amazing, and
we never forget all

00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:39.090 align:middle line:10%
of the people that helped us.

00:34:39.090 --> 00:34:41.190 align:middle line:10%
- I'm doing my dream job,
working as a firefighter

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:45.239 align:middle line:10%
paramedic, and my wife
is expecting this fall.

00:34:45.239 --> 00:34:46.710 align:middle line:10%
- It's now 19 years later.

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:49.440 align:middle line:10%
I'm cancer-free, I'm a
thriving mother of two.

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:52.170 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Burzynski saved my life,
and I owe my life to him.

00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:54.179 align:middle line:10%
Thank you, Dr. Burzynski.

00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:56.590 align:middle line:10%
- Without Dr. Burzynski, none
of this would be possible,

00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:57.840 align:middle line:10%
and I owe my life to him.

00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:03.060 align:middle line:10%
- I believe this guy needs
all of the adulation possible

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:05.670 align:middle line:10%
and for people to
wake up and realize

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:08.610 align:middle line:10%
who he is, what he's
done, what he's doing,

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:11.040 align:middle line:10%
and how his treatment
could help so many people.

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:14.400 align:middle line:10%
- I think we look younger
than we did, better, brighter.

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.980 align:middle line:10%
- I think I'm a lot healthier.

00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:20.250 align:middle line:10%
- I think on that note, must
be the coffee that you drink.

00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:22.810 align:middle line:10%
OK, goodbye.

00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:23.610 align:middle line:90%
Say goodbye.

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:25.690 align:middle line:90%
- Bye.

00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:26.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:29.023 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Well, what is
remarkable about these people

00:35:29.023 --> 00:35:32.390 align:middle line:84%
that they have a history
of being cancer-free,

00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:36.530 align:middle line:84%
and this was cancer which was
having very short survival

00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:39.260 align:middle line:90%
rate, for up to 27 years.

00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:42.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they need to come
back for additional treatments,

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:44.730 align:middle line:90%
like maintenance or anything?

00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: We use maintenance
treatment for regular eight

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:49.910 align:middle line:84%
months after the tumor
is gone, and then they

00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:51.080 align:middle line:90%
can live happily ever after.

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:52.550 align:middle line:84%
But what happens
with these people

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:55.520 align:middle line:84%
is remarkable because
they completely recovered.

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And some of them we
treated as little kids.

00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:01.700 align:middle line:84%
This young man was brought to
us when he was three years old.

00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:04.580 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't have standard
of care treatment

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:05.900 align:middle line:90%
because he was too little.

00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:07.820 align:middle line:90%
And he recovered completely.

00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:10.580 align:middle line:84%
He is now a fireman,
and we are invited--

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:12.980 align:middle line:84%
there was a time when we
were invited every two

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:16.250 align:middle line:84%
months for another wedding
because these people got

00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:18.990 align:middle line:90%
married, and they did very well.

00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:20.330 align:middle line:90%
They have children now.

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:21.900 align:middle line:90%
They live a normal life.

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:26.885 align:middle line:84%
So I was invited to a Jewish
wedding, to a Baptist wedding.

00:36:26.885 --> 00:36:29.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mazel tov.

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:32.090 align:middle line:84%
I tell you what, if I knew
anybody who had cancer,

00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:33.750 align:middle line:90%
I would send them to you.

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:34.490 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Thank
you very much.

00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:36.080 align:middle line:84%
We'll be glad to look
for what we can do.

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:37.872 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What can we
do to continue to help

00:36:37.872 --> 00:36:39.210 align:middle line:90%
you to get the word out?

00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:42.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Well, public
needs to be aware what is this

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:46.010 align:middle line:84%
because the count that
politicians will do it,

00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:48.620 align:middle line:84%
or the docs will do
it, they don't do it.

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:51.600 align:middle line:84%
They do it only when they
are forced by the public.

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:53.870 align:middle line:84%
The public should be
aware that there is a way

00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:56.425 align:middle line:84%
to save people with
terminal cancer,

00:36:56.425 --> 00:36:57.800 align:middle line:84%
and they should
declare that this

00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:02.300 align:middle line:84%
should be approved because we
did more than any other company

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:03.860 align:middle line:90%
regarding FDA requirements.

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:07.590 align:middle line:84%
We did twelve phase
II clinical trials,

00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:09.710 align:middle line:84%
which prove safety
and efficacy in brain

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:11.300 align:middle line:90%
tumors, different types.

00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:13.340 align:middle line:84%
Also, there was
randomized clinical trials

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:16.880 align:middle line:84%
in colon cancer, which
spread to the liver.

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:19.365 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How about
pancreatic cancer?

00:37:19.365 --> 00:37:20.240 align:middle line:90%
That's the tough one.

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:21.907 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Did not
do clinical trials,

00:37:21.907 --> 00:37:23.480 align:middle line:84%
but we are getting
good results now.

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:26.850 align:middle line:84%
So this principle can be
applied to any cancer,

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:30.010 align:middle line:84%
but there is an abundance
of evidence that this works.

00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:31.347 align:middle line:90%
It should approved now.

00:37:31.347 --> 00:37:32.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: They're
dragging their feet.

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:34.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It'd save lives today.

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:35.880 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: People are dying.

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:38.540 align:middle line:84%
People could be saved, and
they are dragging their feet.

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:40.340 align:middle line:84%
This should be
revealed to the public.

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:42.530 align:middle line:90%
Enough is enough I would say.

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:44.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If somebody's
out there now

00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:47.570 align:middle line:84%
has a friend who has cancer,
can they call your clinic?

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:49.147 align:middle line:90%
What do they do?

00:37:49.147 --> 00:37:50.480 align:middle line:90%
How do they make an appointment?

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:52.147 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: They
should call our clinic

00:37:52.147 --> 00:37:55.620 align:middle line:84%
and I have a team of very
good people in the admission.

00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:57.410 align:middle line:90%
They will gather information.

00:37:57.410 --> 00:37:59.750 align:middle line:84%
They will make some
preliminary selection.

00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:01.628 align:middle line:84%
They present it to
the doctors, and we

00:38:01.628 --> 00:38:03.920 align:middle line:84%
would like to find out what
can we do for this patient.

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:06.110 align:middle line:84%
Can we treat this
patient, or we cannot?

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:08.570 align:middle line:84%
There's no sense for them
to come from the other end

00:38:08.570 --> 00:38:10.220 align:middle line:84%
of the world if we
cannot help them.

00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:12.913 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there some
that you have to reject?

00:38:12.913 --> 00:38:14.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Sure,
some of them we

00:38:14.330 --> 00:38:17.630 align:middle line:84%
are rejecting because we know
that we won't be able to help.

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:21.530 align:middle line:84%
We rejected recently a
young man from Argentina.

00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:24.110 align:middle line:84%
They were planning to bring
him on a private plane

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:27.620 align:middle line:84%
with a doctor, or whatever, but
we told him look it's too late,

00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:29.210 align:middle line:84%
he probably will
die within the week.

00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:30.200 align:middle line:90%
And he did.

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:33.110 align:middle line:84%
They were planning to bring
him, and the same day he

00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:34.880 align:middle line:90%
died at home.

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:37.498 align:middle line:84%
So we don't want
them to suffer more.

00:38:37.498 --> 00:38:39.290 align:middle line:84%
But some people are
desperate so they would

00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:40.520 align:middle line:90%
like to do whatever they can.

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:42.440 align:middle line:84%
They can bring the team
of their own doctors

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:44.257 align:middle line:84%
to help to take care
of the patients.

00:38:44.257 --> 00:38:45.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a dreaded disease.

00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:47.782 align:middle line:90%
What do you think causes cancer?

00:38:47.782 --> 00:38:49.490 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Numerous,
numerous, factors.

00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:53.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Chemicals out
there, [INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:58.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: So the real cause
of cancer are mutated genes,

00:38:58.190 --> 00:39:01.110 align:middle line:84%
and mutated genes were created
by thousands and thousands

00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:02.960 align:middle line:90%
of different factors.

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:06.540 align:middle line:84%
Some of these genes are
inherited, but in most cases,

00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:08.480 align:middle line:84%
they are occurring
during the patient's life

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:10.190 align:middle line:84%
and can be removed
from the body.

00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And you can prove it by
repeating the blood test, which

00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:13.580 align:middle line:90%
shows that they're gone.

00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:15.680 align:middle line:84%
When the tumors are
gone, genes are gone.

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:19.170 align:middle line:84%
Nothing new about it to treat
the cause of the disease.

00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:25.870 align:middle line:84%
This was presented by
Aristotle as 3,300 years ago.

00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:30.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why can't the body,
doctor, fight this on its own?

00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:31.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Because
body does not

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:34.100 align:middle line:90%
have enough antineoplastons.

00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:38.450 align:middle line:84%
When cancer is advancing,
it's affecting the kidneys,

00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:41.210 align:middle line:84%
and kidneys is throwing
antineoplastons

00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:43.220 align:middle line:90%
from the system to the drain.

00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:45.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you come up
with a pill that increases

00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:47.000 align:middle line:90%
these antineoplastons?

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Well, so
when we suppress cancer,

00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:52.460 align:middle line:84%
then the cancer is
no longer releasing

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:54.680 align:middle line:84%
chemicals which are
forcing antineoplastons

00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:55.730 align:middle line:90%
out of the body.

00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And the body will recover and
make these antineoplastons.

00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:02.605 align:middle line:84%
But initially, we need to
provide them from the outside.

00:40:02.605 --> 00:40:03.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You do
a remarkable job.

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:05.010 align:middle line:90%
How do people find you?

00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:06.350 align:middle line:90%
Do you have a website out there?

00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:07.808 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Oh,
we have a website,

00:40:07.808 --> 00:40:09.590 align:middle line:84%
and we have numerous
publications.

00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:13.130 align:middle line:84%
But most cases, this
is word of mouth.

00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And people are happy
when they completely

00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:18.260 align:middle line:84%
recover so they would
like to talk about it.

00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:22.610 align:middle line:84%
They form organizations, like
patients with brain tumors.

00:40:22.610 --> 00:40:25.760 align:middle line:84%
Recently, I was
interviewed by organization

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:29.720 align:middle line:84%
of parents whose children
died from DIPG, diffuse

00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:31.400 align:middle line:90%
intrinsic pontine glioma.

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:33.950 align:middle line:84%
This was about a week ago,
a very good interview.

00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And they are trying
to be helpful,

00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:41.060 align:middle line:84%
and this is very important
because the action of people

00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:43.070 align:middle line:90%
will cause the change.

00:40:43.070 --> 00:40:45.540 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, we still have
a democratic society,

00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:47.990 align:middle line:84%
even if we have so
many restrictions.

00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And the people's voice
could be very powerful.

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:52.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were
born in Poland.

00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:54.355 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Yes, I
was born in Poland.

00:40:54.355 --> 00:41:01.250 align:middle line:10%
I suffered through Communism
and through Nazi occupation.

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:05.060 align:middle line:10%
It was a horrible time,
but ultimately, I'm

00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:08.090 align:middle line:10%
glad I came to the US because
obviously, I would never

00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:09.620 align:middle line:10%
be able to do it in Poland.

00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:14.048 align:middle line:10%
They wanted to send me
to the army for life.

00:41:14.048 --> 00:41:15.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, in
spite of the things

00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:17.990 align:middle line:84%
you've gone through here,
still the best country.

00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:20.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: I didn't
join the Communist Party.

00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:21.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:23.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad you're
continuing doing what

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:24.633 align:middle line:90%
you're doing to help humanity.

00:41:24.633 --> 00:41:27.050 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Thank you, well,
trying to do whatever I can.

00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:32.570 align:middle line:84%
It's not easy, but so far,
we've seen very good results.

00:41:32.570 --> 00:41:34.440 align:middle line:90%
And this is very important.

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:37.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, as they say,
the proof is in the pudding--

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:37.750 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: Absolutely.

00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:38.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you have the proof.

00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:39.740 align:middle line:90%
>>BURZYNSKI: Yes.

00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:41.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Doctor, thanks
for being on the program.

00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:42.525 align:middle line:84%
>>BURZYNSKI: Thank
you very much.

00:41:42.525 --> 00:41:46.730 align:middle line:84%
It's my pleasure, and I would
like to thank you and Gaia

00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:50.480 align:middle line:84%
because I'm sure that a number
of people who will see this

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:51.500 align:middle line:90%
will be helped.

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:54.740 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Truly remarkable, an
individual like Dr. Burzynski

00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:58.100 align:middle line:10%
who has put his career
on the line to save

00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:00.560 align:middle line:10%
lives, and he's saving them.

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:01.580 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:04.820 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
Beyond Belief.
