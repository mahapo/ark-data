00:00:02.952 --> 00:00:20.159 align:middle line:90%


00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:21.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.530 align:middle line:10%
You know, we talk a lot on this
program about the afterlife.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.780 align:middle line:10%
And we're going to do that
now with a different twist,

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.540 align:middle line:10%
a different perspective,
with Richard Martini,

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.610 align:middle line:10%
noted author, researcher.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.860 align:middle line:10%
And he's back on
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.349 align:middle line:90%
Richard, always good to see you.

00:00:35.349 --> 00:00:37.640 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD MARTINI: It's always
good to see you, George.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've always done so
remarkable things, great work.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.310 align:middle line:84%
You've investigated the
life of Amelia Earhart.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.780 align:middle line:84%
But tonight, we're going to
talk about the afterlife.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.594 align:middle line:84%
What do people generally
think about that?

00:00:52.594 --> 00:00:53.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Well, it's funny.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.440 align:middle line:84%
Because you gave me that
moniker, the afterlife expert.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.320 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, wow.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.120 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.840 align:middle line:90%
I guess I am.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.665 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Now it follows you.

00:01:00.665 --> 00:01:02.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Yeah, now it
follows wherever I go.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.519 align:middle line:84%
And friends of mine
say, are you going

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.730 align:middle line:84%
to talk about this life,
or just the afterlife?

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.010 align:middle line:90%
But people are fascinated.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.444 align:middle line:84%
Because, of course, what's going
to happen after we're here?

00:01:13.444 --> 00:01:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And what I've found, and what's
really fascinating in this

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.318 align:middle line:84%
research-- and I've been filming
people under deep hypnosis

00:01:18.318 --> 00:01:21.620 align:middle line:84%
for 10 years, and interviewing
people who've had near-death

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.000 align:middle line:84%
experiences, and then most
recently, talking to mediums,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.570 align:middle line:84%
who have access to people
on the other side--

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.050 align:middle line:84%
and the idea is, in
mediumship, most mediums

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.686 align:middle line:84%
they help you find
your love of your life.

00:01:35.686 --> 00:01:36.810 align:middle line:90%
Or they predict the future.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: In my case, I
was interested in comparing

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.040 align:middle line:90%
the research.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.300 align:middle line:84%
So if you can access
somebody on the other side,

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.010 align:middle line:84%
would they be telling
me the same story

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.270 align:middle line:84%
that people under deep
hypnosis are telling me?

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.890 align:middle line:90%
And I found that to be the case.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.690 align:middle line:84%
So what I do when I interview
someone on the other side,

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.689 align:middle line:84%
let's say, I'm not
interested in proving

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:57.980 align:middle line:90%
that they're on the other side.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.060 align:middle line:84%
Because I've already done
that as many times as I--

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You believe
that from the get go.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:01.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Yeah.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.040 align:middle line:84%
It's like when you
have an experience,

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.130 align:middle line:84%
you no longer think of it
as something you don't know.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.139 align:middle line:90%
You know it.

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:10.699 align:middle line:84%
So I've had the experience
of people on the other side

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:12.060 align:middle line:90%
proving who they were to me.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.060 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, what I
do is I interview people

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.610 align:middle line:84%
on the other side
about their experience.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.130 align:middle line:84%
Who was there to greet
you when you crossed over?

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.920 align:middle line:84%
What's it like for you
while you're over there?

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.990 align:middle line:84%
What's it like for
you to talk to me?

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.747 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And why
do they come back?

00:02:25.747 --> 00:02:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well, in general,
what they're trying--

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.190 align:middle line:84%
what they tell me is that
they have never left.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.900 align:middle line:84%
It's not-- it's
sort of like when

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.300 align:middle line:84%
you step outside of
your body, you're

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.560 align:middle line:90%
in a different frequency.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.360 align:middle line:90%
The way--

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But you go back.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well, you do
go back home, let's say.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And you go back, and
reconnect with the other 2/3

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.130 align:middle line:84%
of your conscious energy
that's already back there.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.630 align:middle line:84%
This is what was
in the research,

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.690 align:middle line:90%
and I found to be true.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:50.960 align:middle line:90%
But you can come back here.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.580 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, if you think of some
loved one, or say their name,

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.682 align:middle line:90%
it's like a cell phone.

00:02:56.682 --> 00:02:58.640 align:middle line:84%
It's like pick up on a
cell phone, and dialing.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.900 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how
a cell phone works,

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:00.860 align:middle line:90%
but you dial those numbers.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:01.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it finds them.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:02.918 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: And it finds them.

00:03:02.918 --> 00:03:05.527 align:middle line:90%
And if they're not busy--

00:03:05.527 --> 00:03:06.860 align:middle line:90%
you might get a message machine.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How could they
be busy in the afterlife?

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.180 align:middle line:90%
What'd they do?

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.360 align:middle line:90%
They sit on a cloud all day.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Playing that harp.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.920 align:middle line:84%
Or like Prince, playing
with Jimi Hendrix.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.697 align:middle line:90%
No, actually.

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:20.030 align:middle line:84%
What people report-- and I
can only tell you what people

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.050 align:middle line:90%
report--

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.960 align:middle line:84%
is that there's a
lot to do back there.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.030 align:middle line:84%
There's classrooms
that we go to.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.150 align:middle line:90%
I visited some of them.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You have?

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.004 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: While I was
under deep hypnosis, yes.

00:03:30.004 --> 00:03:31.670 align:middle line:84%
I'll just tell you
where that came from.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.820 align:middle line:84%
My friend Luana Anders, when
she passed away in 1996--

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.100 align:middle line:84%
she was a pretty
famous actress--

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.680 align:middle line:84%
she was telling me,
before she died,

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.152 align:middle line:84%
I have this recurring dream
that I'm in a classroom.

00:03:43.152 --> 00:03:44.860 align:middle line:84%
And people are talking
about spirituality

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.443 align:middle line:84%
in a language I've
never heard before.

00:03:46.443 --> 00:03:48.470 align:middle line:84%
But somehow I
completely understand.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.266 align:middle line:84%
The day she died, her close
friend called me and said,

00:03:51.266 --> 00:03:53.390 align:middle line:84%
"I had this wonderful dream
about Luana last night.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.490 align:middle line:90%
She was in a classroom.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:56.840 align:middle line:90%
Everyone was dressed in white."

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.840 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "Oh my gosh.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.300 align:middle line:90%
That was her dream."

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.040 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned it to
her hospice care

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.840 align:middle line:84%
nurse, who nearly
fainted, and said

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.840 align:middle line:90%
that was her recurring dream.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.430 align:middle line:90%
At first, it was startling.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.530 align:middle line:90%
I went to class for 18 years.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.260 align:middle line:84%
Do I really want to go back
to class in the afterlife?

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And then, when I picked
up Michael Newton's book,

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.060 align:middle line:84%
"Journey of Souls," there
in the first chapter

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.190 align:middle line:84%
was a guy saying that while
he was under deep hypnosis,

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.050 align:middle line:90%
he was visiting a classroom.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.290 align:middle line:84%
So that's what impelled me
in starting this research.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.259 align:middle line:84%
So when I finally did
a between-life session,

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:30.800 align:middle line:84%
they said, "Where
do you want to go?"

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.680 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "I want to
go visit my friends."

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And I found myself
in a classroom.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.850 align:middle line:90%
Not hers, but another classroom.

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.520 align:middle line:84%
And I was there with a
teacher and students,

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.060 align:middle line:84%
who were all looking at me
like I was their oldest friend.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.740 align:middle line:84%
People I've never
seen before, but they

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.320 align:middle line:84%
were looking at me like it was
important for me to be there.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.490 align:middle line:84%
But then, after
that class, I went

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.240 align:middle line:84%
to-- they said, "Where
do you want to go?"

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.100 align:middle line:84%
I said, "I want to
go visit Luana."

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm in this
classroom, a giant auditorium.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.170 align:middle line:84%
I can see a teacher
in the front.

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.120 align:middle line:90%
And she's--

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.607 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All in
white robes, right?

00:05:03.607 --> 00:05:05.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well, in this case,
I didn't see white robes.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.030 align:middle line:84%
So that might have
been the front row.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.010 align:middle line:84%
I just saw normal
people sitting around.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.290 align:middle line:84%
And I started telling
the hypnotherapist,

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.330 align:middle line:84%
"I'm in a classroom
that deals with healing.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.140 align:middle line:84%
The students here learn
how to channel the healing

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.550 align:middle line:90%
light of the universe.

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.150 align:middle line:84%
So that when a doctor or
a healer on the planet

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.210 align:middle line:84%
needs to heal somebody,
that's how they do it."

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And a student turned to me,
in my mind's eye, and said,

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.900 align:middle line:84%
"You don't know what
you're talking about."

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
"Well, this is odd.

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.730 align:middle line:84%
Why would this student
be chastising me

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.230 align:middle line:90%
if I was making it up?"

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:39.520 align:middle line:90%
But then I said, "Look.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.340 align:middle line:84%
Not every doctor signs
up to cure everybody.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.710 align:middle line:84%
Not every person
signs up to be cured."

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.350 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people want
to examine an illness,

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:48.860 align:middle line:90%
the energy of an illness.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.560 align:middle line:90%
So not everybody gets cured."

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And the students looked
at me, went, "OK.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.460 align:middle line:84%
I guess you do know what
you're talking about."

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.000 align:middle line:84%
I've been back to that
classroom many times.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.844 align:middle line:84%
I've done five
between-life sessions.

00:05:59.844 --> 00:06:00.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a lot.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: The second time
I went back to the class,

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.427 align:middle line:90%
it was as if--

00:06:04.427 --> 00:06:06.760 align:middle line:84%
it was two years later with
a different hypnotherapist--

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.190 align:middle line:84%
but it was as if 20
minutes had gone by.

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.740 align:middle line:84%
My friend Luana was
introducing me to the teacher

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.570 align:middle line:90%
and apologizing.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.170 align:middle line:90%
And saying, "This is my friend.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.250 align:middle line:90%
He's--"

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In this hypnotic state?

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Exactly.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.560 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, is
that it felt like it had

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.180 align:middle line:90%
happened 20 minutes earlier.

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.860 align:middle line:90%
But it was two years.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Richard, how do we
know that the brain isn't doing

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.070 align:middle line:84%
these things to us, either
at the moment of death,

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.200 align:middle line:84%
or when you're close to
dying, or when you or

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.220 align:middle line:90%
have a near-death experience?

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.270 align:middle line:84%
How do we know that there's not
some quirk in the brain that

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.130 align:middle line:90%
creates this light, this image?

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And does it-- and that
it really doesn't exist?

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:43.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Exactly.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, what I focus on
is new information.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.540 align:middle line:84%
So that would
mean, let's say you

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.110 align:middle line:84%
have a near-death experience,
and you see somebody.

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And when you see
that person, you

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:58.900 align:middle line:84%
learn something new from them
that you couldn't have known.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.870 align:middle line:84%
Like seeing a sister or
brother that you didn't know

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.840 align:middle line:84%
existed, but had died
before you were born.

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.600 align:middle line:84%
That's what happened
to Dr. Eben Alexander.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.380 align:middle line:84%
When he was there, he met a
woman who guided him around,

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:11.180 align:middle line:90%
and he--

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: "Proof of
Heaven," his book.

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:13.278 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: "Proof of Heaven."

00:07:13.278 --> 00:07:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was, about
six months after his experience,

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.570 align:middle line:84%
the family that had put
him up for adoption--

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:21.070 align:middle line:90%
because he was an adoptee--

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:24.080 align:middle line:84%
sent him a photograph of
a sister he'd never met.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And that was the woman who'd
guided him around that journey.

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:32.420 align:middle line:84%
In the book "Heaven is for
Real" by Todd and Colton Burpo,

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:33.220 align:middle line:90%
he found--

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.650 align:middle line:84%
met a sister, who
he had never known.

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:36.640 align:middle line:90%
But she had died.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.475 align:middle line:84%
So I focus on this
new information.

00:07:38.475 --> 00:07:40.767 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and that's
pretty startling information.

00:07:40.767 --> 00:07:41.724 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: It is, yeah.

00:07:41.724 --> 00:07:44.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because out of nowhere,
how would an Eben Alexander

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:46.320 align:middle line:90%
have known until he went across.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: But what I've
found in my research

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:51.380 align:middle line:84%
is that you can ask questions
to get new information.

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:53.440 align:middle line:84%
So I was saying, I was
working with mediums.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.210 align:middle line:84%
So what I do is, I'm
interviewing somebody

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:56.110 align:middle line:90%
on the other side.

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:57.850 align:middle line:90%
And I'm asking them.

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:00.190 align:middle line:84%
They give me a
piece of information

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:02.620 align:middle line:84%
that I can now go to
their family, and say--

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.050 align:middle line:84%
I only focus on people
that I knew, generally.

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:07.260 align:middle line:84%
People I knew or
the medium knows.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.000 align:middle line:84%
And then I can ask people,
"Did you know this?"

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.170 align:middle line:90%
And they research it.

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And find out, oh
my gosh, indeed.

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:14.990 align:middle line:90%
I did not know that.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:16.270 align:middle line:90%
But I now I do.

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:17.710 align:middle line:84%
Because you've
just told it to me.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you friends with
the late actor Bill Paxton?

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.060 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: I was.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:23.710 align:middle line:10%
Billy and I started off
our careers together.

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:25.694 align:middle line:10%
His took off in one direction.

00:08:25.694 --> 00:08:26.610 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: So did yours.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:27.460 align:middle line:10%
So did yours.

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:28.940 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTINI: Mine went off
in a different direction.

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:29.740 align:middle line:10%
It's OK.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:32.530 align:middle line:10%
We used to razz each
other, constantly.

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:33.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great actor.

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:35.261 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Great actor
and a wonderful guy.

00:08:35.261 --> 00:08:38.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Died tragically, I
think, in a hospital room.

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:39.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: In a hospital room.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.970 align:middle line:84%
He had a lifelong
condition for his heart.

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And they were trying to
fix it and repair it.

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:45.605 align:middle line:90%
And apparently--

00:08:45.605 --> 00:08:46.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something happened.

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:47.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: --things went--
something went wrong.

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:48.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you dealt
with a medium, right?

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:50.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: But well,
in Bill's case,

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.620 align:middle line:84%
I'd known him since we
started off together.

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:55.390 align:middle line:84%
And he was going to
star in my first film.

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:56.470 align:middle line:90%
And so we were close friends.

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And he helped me
rewrite some things.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And over the years, we
always stayed in touch.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:03.536 align:middle line:84%
And when he passed
away, I had meetings

00:09:03.536 --> 00:09:04.660 align:middle line:90%
with two different mediums.

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.386 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, "Well,
let's just see."

00:09:06.386 --> 00:09:08.260 align:middle line:84%
But in this case, instead
of saying his name,

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.930 align:middle line:84%
I just said, "I have
a friend named Bill

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:12.550 align:middle line:90%
that I'd like to talk to."

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:14.200 align:middle line:90%
And in both cases--

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.780 align:middle line:84%
Jennifer Shaffer and
Kimberly Babcock--

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.010 align:middle line:90%
they don't know each other.

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:21.100 align:middle line:84%
But in both cases, Bill
came through very clearly.

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:22.930 align:middle line:90%
He talked to Jennifer.

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:25.506 align:middle line:84%
She said to me, "Why is he
showing me the Titanic?"

00:09:25.506 --> 00:09:27.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take a look at
Jennifer Shaffer right now.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:28.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: OK.

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:29.379 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:09:29.379 --> 00:09:33.510 align:middle line:84%
We have a mutual friend who
passed away recently, Bill.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:36.052 align:middle line:10%
And is he avail-- does
he want to talk to us?

00:09:36.052 --> 00:09:37.760 align:middle line:10%
>>JENNIFER SHAFFER:
Oh, they just danced.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.100 align:middle line:10%
That's interesting.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.043 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Who's they?

00:09:40.043 --> 00:09:41.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAFFER: Bill.

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:41.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: And?

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:42.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAFFER: Luana.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.747 align:middle line:90%
They did a little tango thing.

00:09:44.747 --> 00:09:45.674 align:middle line:90%
It was kind of funny.

00:09:45.674 --> 00:09:47.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Does Bill
want to talk to us?

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:50.060 align:middle line:90%


00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:51.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAFFER: He just
filed his nails.

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:53.220 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what he just did.

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: That means,
"Yeah, I'm here.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.460 align:middle line:90%
Whatever."

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAFFER: Whatever.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:58.920 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:09:58.920 --> 00:09:59.820 align:middle line:90%
Shampooing his hair.

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:00.620 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:01.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Yes.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:03.920 align:middle line:84%
Get ready for your
close up, Bill.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.080 align:middle line:90%
Make up.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
need a lot of it.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:10.420 align:middle line:84%
So tell us what it's
like for you over there.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:12.474 align:middle line:90%
And who was the first person--

00:10:12.474 --> 00:10:13.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAFFER: He says it's fun.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.680 align:middle line:90%
He's scaring people.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Who was the first
person to greet you when you

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:18.800 align:middle line:90%
stepped off--

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:19.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAFFER: His dad.

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:19.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: His dad.

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:20.750 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And was that a happy
thing, a happy connection?

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:27.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAFFER: Shocking,
because that meant he died.

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:29.664 align:middle line:90%
So I just saw that--

00:10:29.664 --> 00:10:30.660 align:middle line:90%
Hold on.

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:32.302 align:middle line:90%
It's interpretation.

00:10:32.302 --> 00:10:33.640 align:middle line:90%
He said, "Yes, at first.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.190 align:middle line:90%
That subsided."

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:42.940 align:middle line:84%
So Billy's saying that
at first he was startled.

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.760 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't scary, like
his heart-- it wasn't scary.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:49.930 align:middle line:90%


00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:53.730 align:middle line:84%
He says it was recognition
of both worlds,

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:55.250 align:middle line:90%
that he's leaving one.

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:57.640 align:middle line:84%
But he shows them going
in together, as one.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Was this
an exit point for you?

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.410 align:middle line:84%
Was this something
that you had planned

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:03.604 align:middle line:90%
that maybe would happen?

00:11:03.604 --> 00:11:05.770 align:middle line:84%
Was this the right time,
or was this the wrong time?

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:13.370 align:middle line:90%


00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:15.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAFFER: His
physical body was--

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:19.182 align:middle line:84%
it was the wrong
time for him here.

00:11:19.182 --> 00:11:21.960 align:middle line:84%
It was the right
time for his soul.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.275 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: I understand.

00:11:23.275 --> 00:11:24.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:25.764 align:middle line:90%
What'd you learn from that?

00:11:25.764 --> 00:11:27.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well,
it's interesting.

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:30.480 align:middle line:84%
When you hear someone tell you
something from the other side,

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.040 align:middle line:90%
all you can do is take notes.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think you were
really talking to Bill Paxton

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:34.770 align:middle line:90%
through her?

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:37.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well, once we started
talking about the Titanic--

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:39.540 align:middle line:84%
she said, "Why is he
showing me the Titanic?

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:42.300 align:middle line:84%
Is this the Bill that was
in the movie "The Titanic?"

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Why
don't you ask him?"

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:47.250 align:middle line:84%
So ultimately, we went
through a number of things--

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:49.200 align:middle line:84%
what I would consider
to be hallmarks--

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.541 align:middle line:84%
where I knew that only Bill
would know the answers.

00:11:51.541 --> 00:11:52.341 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You knew.

00:11:52.341 --> 00:11:52.880 align:middle line:90%
Bill knew.

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:53.430 align:middle line:90%
She didn't.

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:54.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Correct.

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:55.090 align:middle line:90%
That she did not.

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:57.810 align:middle line:84%
But I also spoke
with another medium.

00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:00.060 align:middle line:84%
And she said the
same thing about who

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:02.140 align:middle line:90%
met you when you crossed over.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.560 align:middle line:84%
So when you compare
the two mediums saying

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.260 align:middle line:84%
the identical things,
then you at least

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:08.619 align:middle line:90%
have a data set that you could--

00:12:08.619 --> 00:12:10.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And one didn't know
what the other was saying.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:11.826 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Not at all.

00:12:11.826 --> 00:12:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, in the second
one, she didn't know who--

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.440 align:middle line:90%
he wouldn't tell her who he was.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And at the very
end, I said, "Billy,

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:19.710 align:middle line:90%
show-- tell her who you are."

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:21.300 align:middle line:90%
And he did this, she said.

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:22.290 align:middle line:90%
And did that.

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And then her father
called on the phone.

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.384 align:middle line:84%
This medium's
father on the phone.

00:12:26.384 --> 00:12:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And she said, "What
are you doing, Dad?"

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:31.170 align:middle line:84%
And she said, "I'm watching this
movie with Bill Paxton called

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:32.402 align:middle line:90%
"Twister."

00:12:32.402 --> 00:12:33.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Synchronicity.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: What are
the odds of that?

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:37.020 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, I'm not trying

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:40.410 align:middle line:84%
to prove something that I
can feel that I already know.

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:44.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have touched a lot
of lives in your own career.

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:48.650 align:middle line:84%
But what has your research
into the afterlife

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:51.140 align:middle line:90%
taught you about what this is?

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:54.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well, some
basic fundamental things.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.470 align:middle line:84%
Which is, I think
of a caterpillar.

00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:59.355 align:middle line:84%
And what does the
caterpillar turn into it?

00:12:59.355 --> 00:13:00.155 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It morphs.

00:13:00.155 --> 00:13:02.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: It morphs
into a butterfly.

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:05.430 align:middle line:90%
And do we mourn the cocoon?

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:06.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:09.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Do we do we have
a parade for the cocoon?

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:11.270 align:middle line:90%
Do we put up a shrine for the--

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:12.350 align:middle line:90%
well, we kind of do.

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:14.516 align:middle line:84%
We do these things with
people who have passed away.

00:13:14.516 --> 00:13:15.542 align:middle line:90%
We look at the cocoon.

00:13:15.542 --> 00:13:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And we spent a lot
of time working.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.130 align:middle line:84%
But we don't even think
about the butterfly,

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:22.220 align:middle line:90%
which is having an adventure.

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:25.112 align:middle line:84%
And what a wonderful thing,
when you start to realize--

00:13:25.112 --> 00:13:26.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting analogy.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:30.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: --it's all part of
the journey that we're all on.

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And if we can focus a little
bit on the butterfly, then

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:35.480 align:middle line:84%
maybe we can understand
that the things

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.900 align:middle line:84%
that we consider to be really
upsetting, or stressful,

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:42.500 align:middle line:84%
or painful, are just part
of that cocoon's journey.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've had
friends that are atheists.

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:47.104 align:middle line:90%
And they've died.

00:13:47.104 --> 00:13:48.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: It happens.

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:49.145 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Have they changed?

00:13:49.145 --> 00:13:52.370 align:middle line:84%
Have they come back to you
and said, "Whoa, Rich, I

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:53.980 align:middle line:90%
was way off on this."

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:55.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Yes, as
a matter of fact.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.260 align:middle line:90%
It's funny you mentioned that.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.870 align:middle line:10%
A friend of mine, Harry
Dean Stanton, an actor,

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:02.730 align:middle line:10%
who passed away a
couple of months ago--

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:04.430 align:middle line:10%
but he was also
very close friends

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:06.800 align:middle line:10%
with Luana, Luana Anders.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:11.060 align:middle line:84%
I worked with Luana to help me
gather these people together.

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.190 align:middle line:90%
Because I know her.

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:13.710 align:middle line:90%
I know her frequency.

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:16.697 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, and in this case Harry
Dean, who was a famous atheist,

00:14:16.697 --> 00:14:19.280 align:middle line:84%
and he just made a movie called
"Lucky," where he talks about,

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.050 align:middle line:90%
there is no afterlife.

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:23.240 align:middle line:84%
He was also in "Big
Love" with Bill Paxton.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.920 align:middle line:10%
So there's a connection there.

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.030 align:middle line:10%
But Harry came through.

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:28.130 align:middle line:10%
And I said, "So
Harry, what was it

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:31.880 align:middle line:10%
like when you realized
there was an afterlife?"

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:34.250 align:middle line:90%
And he said, "Luana tricked me."

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:35.180 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "How?"

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And then, he gave me
this elaborate story

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.730 align:middle line:84%
of how she had started
appearing at his hospital bed

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:41.826 align:middle line:90%
as he was dying.

00:14:41.826 --> 00:14:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And he thought, "Oh,
this is a hallucination.

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:46.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm just-- my brain
is hallucinating."

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And then, when he crossed
over, he was in a car with her.

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:52.940 align:middle line:84%
But it was 1967, and
they're on their way

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.460 align:middle line:90%
to the Monterey Pop Festival.

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:59.300 align:middle line:84%
This is Jennifer telling
me this, from Harry.

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:00.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm the only person
in the room who

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.290 align:middle line:84%
knows that Harry was
driving the car when they

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:05.240 align:middle line:90%
went to the Monterey Festival.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.980 align:middle line:84%
But now, she then
proceeds to say

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:09.060 align:middle line:84%
who is in the car,
where they went,

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:10.310 align:middle line:90%
who they went to see on stage.

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And she knew it all?

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:11.975 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: She knew it all.

00:15:11.975 --> 00:15:15.350 align:middle line:84%
Jimi Hendrix, all these details
that Jennifer could never

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:16.320 align:middle line:90%
have known.

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, "So at what
point did you realize?"

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.020 align:middle line:90%
He said, "We got a flat tire."

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:22.640 align:middle line:84%
He said, "I thought
when you die,

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.220 align:middle line:84%
you turn-- you
fall into a dream.

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:25.220 align:middle line:90%
You're in a happy dream.

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:27.376 align:middle line:84%
And that's your
reality forever."

00:15:27.376 --> 00:15:29.000 align:middle line:84%
He said, "But then
we got a flat tire."

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.005 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In the--
on the other side?

00:15:30.005 --> 00:15:30.575 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: In the dream.

00:15:30.575 --> 00:15:31.602 align:middle line:90%
On the other side.

00:15:31.602 --> 00:15:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And I got out-- he said,
"I got out of the car.

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:34.476 align:middle line:90%
And I looked at Luana.

00:15:34.476 --> 00:15:36.020 align:middle line:90%
And I said, wait a minute.

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:37.670 align:middle line:90%
We didn't have a flat tire.

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:40.370 align:middle line:90%
And she said, I know."

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "It was that moment
I realized she had given me

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:45.590 align:middle line:90%
a soft landing."

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:46.970 align:middle line:90%
That was his words.

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:50.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, he also described to me
the deathbed scene, where there

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:52.490 align:middle line:90%
were five women around him.

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "And I
saw a baby that I was

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.900 align:middle line:90%
supposed to have back in 1962.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:58.490 align:middle line:90%
The baby had died."

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:00.770 align:middle line:84%
He said, "But I was
there holding the baby."

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:03.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I went to his
memorial service a week later,

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:06.770 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Does anybody know
anything about how Harry died?"

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And this woman told me there
were five women around him.

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:14.467 align:middle line:84%
And he asked out loud,
"Somebody hand me the baby."

00:16:14.467 --> 00:16:15.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At the moment of death?

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: At the
moment of death.

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:18.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Weird.

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: I said to
Harry, "What do you

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:20.674 align:middle line:90%
want to tell your friends?"

00:16:20.674 --> 00:16:21.920 align:middle line:90%
And I mean, his friends--

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.950 align:middle line:84%
Nicholson, and Al Pacino,
and Warren Beatty--

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:26.720 align:middle line:84%
they were all at the
memorial service.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.386 align:middle line:84%
I said, "What do you
want to tell them?"

00:16:28.386 --> 00:16:30.860 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Tell them
there is an afterlife."

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:33.230 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Harry, nobody's
going to believe

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:36.154 align:middle line:84%
that Richard was talking
to you on the flipside--"

00:16:36.154 --> 00:16:37.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And goes up
to them, and says--

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:38.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: And right.

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:39.786 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
go, you're nutty.

00:16:39.786 --> 00:16:41.510 align:middle line:90%
So he said, "All right.

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:45.500 align:middle line:84%
Tell them to believe in the
possibility of an afterlife.

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.990 align:middle line:84%
Because then they won't
waste their lives, like I

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:49.520 align:middle line:90%
did, arguing--"

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:50.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That it didn't exist.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: "--that
it didn't exist."

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.840 align:middle line:84%
He said it was like
being on a treadmill.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "So why did
you come to believe that?"

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:58.080 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Too many
friends of mine had died.

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:01.070 align:middle line:84%
I had to wall myself
off from that emotion."

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And now, when I talked to
him-- because he shows up.

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:06.480 align:middle line:84%
Jennifer and I do this every
week, have these sessions.

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Your sessions.

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:09.046 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: He shows up,
and says, "Thank you."

00:17:09.046 --> 00:17:10.730 align:middle line:90%
And I say, "Thank me for what?"

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:15.319 align:middle line:84%
He says, "For throwing a lot
of dust in to people's world."

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:18.890 align:middle line:84%
Because now they know that
the things that I said-- he

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:22.040 align:middle line:84%
told one of his friends,
the medication you're taking

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:23.069 align:middle line:90%
is drying you up.

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:25.250 align:middle line:90%
You need to drink more water.

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:26.990 align:middle line:90%
Very obscure detail.

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:29.370 align:middle line:84%
But his son came
up to me and said,

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:30.590 align:middle line:90%
"We tell him that every day.

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:33.710 align:middle line:84%
How could you
possibly know that?"

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:34.849 align:middle line:90%
So listen.

00:17:34.849 --> 00:17:36.890 align:middle line:84%
You want to talk to your
friends on the flipside?

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:38.660 align:middle line:90%
You can.

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.500 align:middle line:84%
Your loved ones, the
ones you've lost.

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:41.300 align:middle line:90%
You can.

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:43.660 align:middle line:90%
There's a method for doing it.

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:44.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I believe that.

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:47.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: And so I can
tell you, in one case, we--

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:49.360 align:middle line:84%
Jennifer and I were
having a conversation.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:50.807 align:middle line:90%
And Michael Newton showed up.

00:17:50.807 --> 00:17:51.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The doctor?

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:52.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: The doctor.

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And Michael and I were
not close friends.

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:57.880 align:middle line:84%
So like I said, mostly
it's people I knew.

00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:59.740 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'd interviewed him.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:00.540 align:middle line:90%
And we emailed.

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:02.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he was
a renowned doctor.

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:03.155 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Renowned
psychologist.

00:18:03.155 --> 00:18:03.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dealing
with the afterlife.

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:06.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Michael Newton,
who wrote all those books.

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:08.320 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, I said to
Michael, "What are you

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.790 align:middle line:90%
doing over there?"

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:13.377 align:middle line:84%
He said, "I'm doing noetic
science from this side."

00:18:13.377 --> 00:18:14.960 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
noetic science was.

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:15.595 align:middle line:90%
Neither did Jennifer.

00:18:15.595 --> 00:18:15.850 align:middle line:90%
I had to look it up.

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:17.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Edgar Mitchell did.

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:18.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Edgar Mitchell did.

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:19.810 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't.

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:21.160 align:middle line:90%
And so now, I said, "All right.

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.400 align:middle line:84%
So what-- how--
give me a 1, 2, 3.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.790 align:middle line:84%
How do we tell people to reach
to the people on that side?"

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:30.610 align:middle line:90%
And he said, "Say their name."

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:32.590 align:middle line:84%
I said, "In your
mind, or out loud?"

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:34.060 align:middle line:90%
He said, "It doesn't matter."

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:35.650 align:middle line:90%
I said, "OK."

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:37.360 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Make a
list of questions you

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.130 align:middle line:90%
want to ask your loved one."

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:40.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:41.795 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: And I
said, "Well, how

00:18:41.795 --> 00:18:43.900 align:middle line:84%
do people know that
they're not making it up

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:45.160 align:middle line:90%
when they hear something?"

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.380 align:middle line:84%
He said, "When they
answer the question before

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:49.210 align:middle line:90%
you can form it."

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:51.384 align:middle line:84%
Then you'll know
you're connected.

00:18:51.384 --> 00:18:53.050 align:middle line:84%
So you have a list
of questions that you

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:54.520 align:middle line:90%
don't know the answer to.

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.440 align:middle line:90%
You start to ask this question.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.476 align:middle line:90%
And it's answered.

00:18:57.476 --> 00:18:59.725 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So I got to tell
you this great story of Rose

00:18:59.725 --> 00:19:00.525 align:middle line:90%
and Betty.

00:19:00.525 --> 00:19:03.190 align:middle line:84%
They were friends
since childhood, Rich.

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And as they got into
their later lives,

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:07.310 align:middle line:90%
they decided to cut a pack.

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:08.110 align:middle line:90%
They wanted a deal.

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:12.370 align:middle line:84%
And that was, whichever
died and went first,

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:14.410 align:middle line:84%
the other would come
back and tell the living

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:16.180 align:middle line:90%
one what it was like.

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And they did all kinds of things
together in their real life.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.660 align:middle line:90%
They played softball together.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.100 align:middle line:90%
They went to the prom together.

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:23.980 align:middle line:90%
They went to college together.

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:26.500 align:middle line:90%
And one day Betty died.

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:29.290 align:middle line:90%
And it was a sad thing for Rose.

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:31.720 align:middle line:90%
And Rose is in bed one night.

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And she hears--
she gets woken up.

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:39.400 align:middle line:90%
She hears, "Rose.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.240 align:middle line:90%
Rose."

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.020 align:middle line:90%
Rose wakes up.

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:44.960 align:middle line:90%
She's in shock.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.390 align:middle line:90%
"Betty?

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:47.530 align:middle line:90%
Betty, is that you?"

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:48.330 align:middle line:90%
"Rose.

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:50.060 align:middle line:90%
It's me.

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:52.900 align:middle line:90%
It's me on the other side."

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:53.700 align:middle line:90%
"Betty.

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:55.290 align:middle line:90%
This is amazing.

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:56.260 align:middle line:90%
What's it like?

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:57.060 align:middle line:90%
What's it like?

00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:57.720 align:middle line:90%
We promised.

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:58.520 align:middle line:90%
We cut a deal."

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:02.440 align:middle line:90%
She said, "Well, it's amazing.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:05.320 align:middle line:84%
We have good news and
bad news for you Rose.

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:08.410 align:middle line:90%
But first, we're young again.

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:10.900 align:middle line:90%
We play softball every day.

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:13.550 align:middle line:90%
We have a great time.

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:15.670 align:middle line:90%
That's the good news."

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:17.980 align:middle line:84%
"Well, Betty, what's
the bad news?"

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:21.262 align:middle line:84%
"Rose, you're
pitching tomorrow."

00:20:21.262 --> 00:20:23.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: [LAUGHTER]

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The afterlife.

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:25.570 align:middle line:90%
I had to get that in.

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:26.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: That's a great--

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:27.030 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:28.390 align:middle line:90%
And it's probably accurate.

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:28.760 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:29.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It might be.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:33.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Because
their sense of time

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.830 align:middle line:84%
is different from
our sense of time.

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:37.420 align:middle line:84%
They're not allowed
to mess with us.

00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:37.900 align:middle line:84%
They're not allowed
to change anything.

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:39.134 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't know even
what time is on the other side,

00:20:39.134 --> 00:20:39.220 align:middle line:90%
do they?

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:40.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well,
I think they do.

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:40.910 align:middle line:90%
I think they do.

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:42.076 align:middle line:90%
I think they're aware of it.

00:20:42.076 --> 00:20:43.339 align:middle line:90%
It's just a different--

00:20:43.339 --> 00:20:45.130 align:middle line:84%
I think that time exists
on the other side.

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:46.840 align:middle line:84%
This is a debate
that people have.

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.020 align:middle line:84%
It's just not the
same as over here.

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:51.620 align:middle line:84%
It's just relatively
completely different.

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:55.270 align:middle line:84%
So they're aware of things
that are likely outcomes.

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:56.930 align:middle line:90%
They can't predict the future.

00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:58.210 align:middle line:90%
Nobody can.

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:00.022 align:middle line:84%
But they can give
you likely outcomes.

00:21:00.022 --> 00:21:02.230 align:middle line:84%
They can say, "Well, if this
happens and that happens

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:03.896 align:middle line:84%
and everybody does
what they're supposed

00:21:03.896 --> 00:21:06.130 align:middle line:90%
to do, then that will occur.

00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:08.770 align:middle line:90%
You will be pitching tomorrow."

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:10.474 align:middle line:90%
But there's a possibility that--

00:21:10.474 --> 00:21:11.515 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It could happen.

00:21:11.515 --> 00:21:13.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: --Rose
has a recovery.

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:16.150 align:middle line:84%
She's dating a doctor, who
comes in and fixes her.

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:18.470 align:middle line:90%
So it's likely outcomes.

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:20.620 align:middle line:84%
But what you hear quite
a bit, as I have--

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:23.380 align:middle line:84%
you talk to people
in this field--

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:25.690 align:middle line:84%
and they'll tell
you, "Well, there

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:27.310 align:middle line:90%
is no time on the other side."

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:30.310 align:middle line:84%
But I've just found
that it's relative time.

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:33.940 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, I had
two years apart

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:36.280 align:middle line:90%
from being in this classroom.

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:38.642 align:middle line:90%
But it felt like 20 minutes.

00:21:38.642 --> 00:21:40.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which was
nothing in time.

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:41.929 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Yeah, a few minutes.

00:21:41.929 --> 00:21:42.970 align:middle line:90%
And so I've asked people.

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:45.460 align:middle line:84%
One woman said to me, "I
experienced this lifetime

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:46.880 align:middle line:90%
over 25 years.

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:50.560 align:middle line:84%
But when I went back, it felt
like 10 minutes had gone by."

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.300 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How influential was
the late Michael Newton--

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:55.630 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Michael Newton--
with your work?

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:57.440 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTINI: Well, with
my work, of course,

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:58.650 align:middle line:10%
it was really everything.

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:00.850 align:middle line:84%
He was the guy who opened
up the rabbit hole.

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:03.460 align:middle line:84%
Because he was a skeptic
about the afterlife.

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:05.800 align:middle line:84%
He had been a skeptic
about his work.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:08.710 align:middle line:84%
He allowed me to be a
skeptic about everything

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:10.570 align:middle line:90%
that I was seeing or saying.

00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:12.760 align:middle line:84%
And once I did my
first session--

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:14.290 align:middle line:90%
like I said, I've done five--

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:16.300 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I had
taken the red pill.

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:19.030 align:middle line:10%
But then, when I started
researching it in depth,

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:20.890 align:middle line:10%
I found that there
was a doctor--

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:24.040 align:middle line:10%
a psychologist in New
Jersey, Dr. Helen Wambach,

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:26.500 align:middle line:10%
who 10 years earlier
than Michael,

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:27.880 align:middle line:10%
had done the same research.

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.640 align:middle line:10%
Where she had people under
deep hypnosis talking

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.890 align:middle line:10%
about choosing your lifetime.

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:36.280 align:middle line:84%
Did you choose your lifetime,
et cetera, et cetera?

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:37.600 align:middle line:90%
And you find these things.

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.700 align:middle line:84%
But Michael-- in
Michael's case, he's

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:43.330 align:middle line:84%
got so many hallmarks that are
important for us to examine.

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:46.570 align:middle line:84%
So you check out
of this lifetime.

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:48.860 align:middle line:84%
You get to the
flipside, as I call it.

00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:51.220 align:middle line:84%
There's a council
that you might meet.

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:54.760 align:middle line:84%
There is your soul guide that
you're going to run into.

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:56.110 align:middle line:90%
There are your soul mates.

00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:56.943 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Loved ones.

00:22:56.943 --> 00:22:58.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Your loved ones.

00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:01.150 align:middle line:84%
You're going to see
people in your soul group,

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:02.980 align:middle line:90%
as Newton used to call it.

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:05.050 align:middle line:90%
Some that might disturb you.

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:08.980 align:middle line:84%
Because there's the uncle
that I really didn't like.

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:12.160 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out, he says
to you, "Don't you remember?

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.830 align:middle line:84%
You asked me to be
the annoying uncle.

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:16.987 align:middle line:84%
You asked me to play that
role in this lifetime.

00:23:16.987 --> 00:23:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And I said I didn't
want to, because I

00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:19.900 align:middle line:90%
did that in the Viking Era.

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:21.200 align:middle line:90%
But I agreed.

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:24.550 align:middle line:84%
Because you said, "I can
only learn this lesson

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:28.030 align:middle line:84%
if you play the evil, drunk
uncle in this lifetime."

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And I did it out of
my love for you."

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:33.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On "Flip Side," you
can see Michael Newton talking

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:35.850 align:middle line:90%
in his entirety on Gaia.

00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:38.670 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:41.164 align:middle line:90%


00:23:41.164 --> 00:23:43.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHAEL NEWTON: When they're
ready to come forward again

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:45.650 align:middle line:84%
into the next
incarnation, there's

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:48.590 align:middle line:84%
an area where they-- there's
kind of a life selection

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:51.770 align:middle line:84%
and body selection area,
where they have choices

00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:53.300 align:middle line:90%
of different kinds of bodies.

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And who they think they
could work best with.

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:58.010 align:middle line:84%
And of course, their
elders and guides

00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:03.720 align:middle line:84%
have had a hand in the selection
of choices, if you will.

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.990 align:middle line:84%
And then, they come
forward into the next life.

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:12.140 align:middle line:84%
I think what's key to all this
is that there's such order

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:13.700 align:middle line:90%
and discipline upstairs.

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very compassionate
love relationship.

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:22.130 align:middle line:84%
It isn't one that involves
the kinds of things

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:25.880 align:middle line:84%
that we see on Earth, with a
hierarchy of beings who lord it

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:30.050 align:middle line:90%
over you and engender fear.

00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:34.100 align:middle line:84%
There is so much forgiveness
and understanding.

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:35.360 align:middle line:90%
We all make mistakes.

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:37.970 align:middle line:84%
Some of us make
terrible mistakes.

00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's all forgiven,
once we cross over.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And there's various
ways in which

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:48.200 align:middle line:84%
they can help heal the soul
that I explain in my books.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.400 align:middle line:84%
But I don't need
to go into here.

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:56.330 align:middle line:10%
But I just want you to know
that what clients gain from all

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:58.610 align:middle line:10%
this, when they wake
up in your office

00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:01.400 align:middle line:10%
after one of these long
sessions, is, they just look.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:03.560 align:middle line:84%
And they'll-- some
of them are crying.

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:04.940 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are laughing.

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:06.950 align:middle line:90%
Some of them can't talk.

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And generally, there
is just this, wow.

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:13.227 align:middle line:90%
I can't believe it.

00:25:13.227 --> 00:25:14.810 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, that's
what Steven Jobs

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:18.090 align:middle line:10%
said as he was dying, the
founder of Apple Computer.

00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:18.890 align:middle line:10%
"Wow.

00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:19.920 align:middle line:10%
Oh, wow.

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:20.430 align:middle line:10%
Oh, wow."

00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:20.990 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTINI: Oh, wow.

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:21.980 align:middle line:10%
Very good.

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And he appears in a
couple of my books.

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:28.010 align:middle line:84%
Mainly because while I
was doing a session--

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:30.920 align:middle line:84%
while I was filming a session
with a close friend of mine

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:33.110 align:middle line:84%
that I'd known
since high school,

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:36.110 align:middle line:84%
turns out that she had been
a science officer who worked

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:38.870 align:middle line:90%
both for Gates and Steve Jobs.

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And so while we were doing this
session, I slipped her a note--

00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:45.260 align:middle line:84%
slipped the
hypnotherapist a note

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:48.620 align:middle line:90%
to ask her, "So how is Steve?"

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And so he makes an
appearance, quote unquote.

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:55.430 align:middle line:84%
Because he says he
thought that the company

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:59.750 align:middle line:84%
was spending too much time on
the small, insignificant things

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:00.927 align:middle line:90%
and not the bigger picture.

00:26:00.927 --> 00:26:01.760 align:middle line:90%
Something like that.

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:02.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was him.

00:26:02.290 --> 00:26:03.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: But then
he showed up again

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:07.280 align:middle line:84%
when I was doing an interview
with Jennifer Shaffer.

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And she said,
apropos of nothing,

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:11.914 align:middle line:90%
"Steven Jobs has just appeared."

00:26:11.914 --> 00:26:13.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Out of the
blue, she says this?

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:14.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Out of the blue.

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And probably when we
were talking to Michael.

00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:17.720 align:middle line:84%
We were having a
conversation with Michael.

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:19.344 align:middle line:84%
Because he shows up
every now and then.

00:26:19.344 --> 00:26:20.855 align:middle line:90%
And I ask questions.

00:26:20.855 --> 00:26:23.210 align:middle line:90%
"What can you tell me, new?"

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And Steve Jobs, let's
just call it that.

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:29.220 align:middle line:84%
Because who knows what
that is, that frequency is.

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And I asked, "What
was the, "Oh, wow.

00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:32.510 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wow.

00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:33.710 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wow?"

00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "He saw how
it all was put together."

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:40.920 align:middle line:84%
It was going out of the
cocoon and into the universe

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:41.720 align:middle line:90%
and seeing--

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:42.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was just
laid out there for him.

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:43.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: --and time.

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:47.350 align:middle line:84%
How time-- he could see
the past and the present.

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:48.620 align:middle line:90%
And those things.

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:51.085 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why does this happen
at the moment of death, Rich?

00:26:51.085 --> 00:26:52.460 align:middle line:84%
These strange
things that happen.

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:54.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: It also
happens, obviously,

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:56.389 align:middle line:84%
when people have a
near-death event.

00:26:56.389 --> 00:26:58.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, but why do
we need that to see it?

00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:01.346 align:middle line:84%
Why can't it happen in
our lives right now?

00:27:01.346 --> 00:27:02.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well,
there are people

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.810 align:middle line:84%
that do that,
out-of-body experiences.

00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:06.980 align:middle line:90%
Hypnotherapy.

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:10.650 align:middle line:84%
You can have a near-death
experience doing hypnotherapy,

00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:11.900 align:middle line:90%
as Michael taught.

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.060 align:middle line:90%
And he has a Newton Institute.

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:15.560 align:middle line:90%
They're all trained there.

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:16.880 align:middle line:90%
Without the near-death part.

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:19.010 align:middle line:90%
So you can experience that.

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:21.860 align:middle line:84%
There are people who do
guided meditation who

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:23.240 align:middle line:90%
can experience that.

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And as we've talked about,
I've had this weird experience

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:32.270 align:middle line:84%
of just using the techniques,
that Michael and others have

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:35.630 align:middle line:84%
taught me, with people
who are fully conscious,

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:38.570 align:middle line:84%
that somehow are able to
access this information.

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:40.250 align:middle line:90%
Fully conscious.

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:42.680 align:middle line:84%
But I ask them some
event that happened

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:44.510 align:middle line:90%
to them, a dream, a nightmare.

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And we walk through and into
the flipside through the dream.

00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:49.845 align:middle line:90%
It sounds strange.

00:27:49.845 --> 00:27:50.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is weird.

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:51.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: It is weird.

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:53.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is weird.

00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:56.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: And I would argue
that if one person said

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:57.410 align:middle line:90%
that, it could be just made up.

00:27:57.410 --> 00:28:01.550 align:middle line:84%
But I've had dozens of
people say the same things,

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:04.400 align:middle line:84%
even though we're drinking
coffee across from each other.

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:07.520 align:middle line:84%
But about the councils
and classrooms

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:09.374 align:middle line:90%
and guides and all that stuff.

00:28:09.374 --> 00:28:11.540 align:middle line:84%
They just say the same
thing, even though they never

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:12.680 align:middle line:90%
heard of this work.

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:16.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can those of us who
believe in the other side,

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.460 align:middle line:90%
the afterlife--

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:19.850 align:middle line:84%
you, me, and so
many other people--

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:22.050 align:middle line:90%
can we be wrong?

00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:23.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: There's
an old saying.

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:25.350 align:middle line:84%
My old professor
used to say this.

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:26.960 align:middle line:90%
He was trained at Oxford.

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And he'd say, "I'd
agree with you,

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:32.810 align:middle line:90%
but then we'd both be wrong."

00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:34.670 align:middle line:90%
Data is data.

00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:37.370 align:middle line:84%
Science asks two
things of us, really.

00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:40.250 align:middle line:84%
One is that your
data's consistent.

00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:42.230 align:middle line:84%
That is consistently
over and over,

00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:43.880 align:middle line:90%
no matter who is saying it.

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:46.800 align:middle line:84%
And the other one is
that it's reproducible.

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:50.450 align:middle line:84%
So that I could take somebody,
anybody, out in the public.

00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:53.480 align:middle line:84%
Have them do the same process
with a hypnotherapist.

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And they would say
the same things.

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:57.520 align:middle line:90%
I have found that to be true.

00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:00.050 align:middle line:84%
In the 45 cases
that I've filmed,

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:02.690 align:middle line:84%
I've chosen people
for their skepticism,

00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:04.730 align:middle line:90%
for their disbelief.

00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:07.370 align:middle line:84%
I've known them maybe since
they were-- from their birth.

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And I've known that they don't
believe in the afterlife.

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:11.000 align:middle line:90%
They're not religious.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.390 align:middle line:84%
Or I've chosen people
who are super religious.

00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:17.729 align:middle line:84%
And they don't see religion
associated with any of this.

00:29:17.729 --> 00:29:19.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's spiritual,
but not religious.

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:21.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: It's
spiritual, but not--

00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:22.880 align:middle line:90%
no dogma.

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.130 align:middle line:84%
In fact, every dogma
that I've run across,

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:28.190 align:middle line:90%
it's contrary to those dogmas.

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:31.340 align:middle line:84%
But their stories are
consistent in terms

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:34.250 align:middle line:84%
of what happens to us
once we cross over.

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:38.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is amazing
what the other side may be.

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:39.740 align:middle line:90%
We'll get there one day.

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:41.170 align:middle line:90%
There's no rush.

00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:42.410 align:middle line:90%
There's no rush.

00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:43.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Rose.

00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:43.900 align:middle line:90%
There was for Rose.

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:44.800 align:middle line:90%
She's pitching tomorrow.

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:45.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She's pitching.

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:46.480 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.430 align:middle line:90%
A no hitter.

00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:48.749 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: [LAUGHTER]

00:29:48.749 --> 00:29:50.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you
have talked to a lot

00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:52.820 align:middle line:84%
of people about the
afterlife in your career.

00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And do you get similar
things from people?

00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:55.990 align:middle line:90%
Similar stories?

00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:59.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well, that's-- and
if I got multiple stories,

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:00.730 align:middle line:90%
that would make sense.

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:03.880 align:middle line:84%
You would think that with the
imagination that people have,

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.370 align:middle line:84%
they would have
different stories.

00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:08.980 align:middle line:90%
But in general, no.

00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:11.830 align:middle line:84%
When I talk to somebody who's
had a near-death experience,

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:15.280 align:middle line:84%
those experiences almost
always are unique.

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.780 align:middle line:84%
Someone experiencing going
to heaven, let's say.

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:18.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:19.240 align:middle line:90%
Or hell.

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Or hell.

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:21.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or hell.

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:22.330 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Rarely.

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:27.070 align:middle line:84%
But what I do is I then have
them examine hell, or examine

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:28.240 align:middle line:90%
heaven.

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.400 align:middle line:84%
And what I find is
that once I started

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:34.090 align:middle line:84%
to ask them questions about this
place, when they describe it--

00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:38.320 align:middle line:84%
so the hell place, it always
is associated with fear.

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And once we get
beyond the fear--

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:43.780 align:middle line:84%
or once I ask them the
question, "Why did you

00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:48.580 align:middle line:84%
choose to experience this
fear," it disappears.

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And then, when we talk
about the other place,

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:53.890 align:middle line:84%
they talk about the same things
that people under deep hypnosis

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:54.690 align:middle line:90%
say.

00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:56.860 align:middle line:84%
They talk about
unconditional love.

00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:58.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, unconditional
love is not a state

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:02.230 align:middle line:84%
of being that we
know on the planet.

00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:04.690 align:middle line:84%
Maybe between a parent
and a child, sometimes.

00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:08.620 align:middle line:84%
Between a pet and a
person, sometimes.

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:10.360 align:middle line:84%
But generally, we
don't experience--

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:13.030 align:middle line:90%
we experience conditional love.

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:14.600 align:middle line:90%
If you love me, I love you.

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:17.770 align:middle line:84%
If you're not going to run over
my toe, I won't run over yours.

00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:20.710 align:middle line:84%
Over there, consistently, people
having a near-death experience

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:24.790 align:middle line:84%
say, "I felt
unconditional love."

00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:25.590 align:middle line:90%
Love for everybody.

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is dramatic
for a lot of people.

00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:28.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: It's so dramatic.

00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:30.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, in one of the
cases where I'm

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:32.490 align:middle line:84%
filming someone
under deep hypnosis,

00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:33.490 align:middle line:90%
she asked this question.

00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:35.260 align:middle line:90%
What or who is God?

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:37.186 align:middle line:84%
And the answer came
from a guide who

00:31:37.186 --> 00:31:39.310 align:middle line:84%
said, "God's beyond the
capacity of the human brain

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:40.180 align:middle line:90%
to comprehend.

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:41.440 align:middle line:90%
It's too difficult."

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:43.690 align:middle line:84%
He said, "However,
you can experience God

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:46.870 align:middle line:84%
by opening your heart to
everyone and all things."

00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:49.270 align:middle line:84%
To me, that's what
unconditional love is.

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:54.670 align:middle line:84%
If you can open your heart
to everyone and all things,

00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:56.950 align:middle line:90%
then you will experience God.

00:31:56.950 --> 00:32:01.010 align:middle line:84%
But you'll also experience
unconditional love.

00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And if-- you were saying, how
come we can't experience that?

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:06.002 align:middle line:90%
Well, we can.

00:32:06.002 --> 00:32:07.210 align:middle line:90%
Not everybody wants to do it.

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:08.290 align:middle line:90%
It's not easy to do.

00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:09.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But we should
be able to do it.

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:10.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: We should
be able to do it.

00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:12.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you have
to wear a robe?

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:13.480 align:middle line:90%
Do you have to live in a cave?

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.430 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:17.320 align:middle line:90%
You can do it any time.

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:19.330 align:middle line:90%
Open your heart to everybody.

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:20.410 align:middle line:90%
Good luck with that.

00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:22.540 align:middle line:84%
But open your heart
to everybody, just

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:25.125 align:middle line:90%
for a minute, for 10 seconds.

00:32:25.125 --> 00:32:26.500 align:middle line:84%
You can experience
the afterlife.

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:30.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Stephen Hawking,
who is no longer with us,

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:33.470 align:middle line:84%
is probably experiencing
the afterlife right now.

00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:34.270 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Absolutely.

00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:36.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I would think.

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that he is shocked
with what he's learning now?

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: It's very funny,
because this morning I

00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:46.000 align:middle line:90%
texted Jennifer.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And said, "Can we
do a little mini

00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:51.320 align:middle line:84%
session before I come on
camera, and we talk about this?"

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:52.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And don't tell me
Stephen Hawking popped up.

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:53.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Well, I wish.

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:55.130 align:middle line:90%
She couldn't do it.

00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:55.930 align:middle line:90%
But I will.

00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:57.370 align:middle line:90%
I will talk to him this week.

00:32:57.370 --> 00:32:58.505 align:middle line:90%
Let's say, quote unquote.

00:32:58.505 --> 00:32:59.380 align:middle line:90%
Now here's the thing.

00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:00.520 align:middle line:90%
I don't know Stephen.

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:02.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't know anybody
who knew Stephen.

00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:04.690 align:middle line:84%
But over on the flipside,
there might be somebody

00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:06.960 align:middle line:90%
that I knew who knew Stephen.

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:09.160 align:middle line:84%
But I'll tell you what
people consistently say.

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:11.220 align:middle line:90%
I can fly.

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:12.570 align:middle line:90%
Bill Paxton said that.

00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:14.280 align:middle line:90%
Tony Scott said that.

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:16.200 align:middle line:84%
All these other people
say, "I can fly."

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:17.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we do that
at our dream state too.

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:19.491 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: And I ask
them, "How do you fly?

00:33:19.491 --> 00:33:21.180 align:middle line:90%
What's the-- how's the process?"

00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:23.397 align:middle line:84%
They say, "All I have
to do is think--"

00:33:23.397 --> 00:33:24.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they're gone.

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:26.105 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: And they
move to that place.

00:33:26.105 --> 00:33:27.420 align:middle line:90%
I think of the Paris.

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:30.090 align:middle line:90%
I think of outer space.

00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:31.110 align:middle line:90%
And I can be there.

00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:32.290 align:middle line:90%
I can go there.

00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:33.090 align:middle line:90%
So what is that?

00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:33.890 align:middle line:90%
What would that be?

00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:38.820 align:middle line:84%
That would be like a frequency
finding another frequency,

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:40.919 align:middle line:84%
and just like
quantum entanglement,

00:33:40.919 --> 00:33:42.960 align:middle line:84%
suddenly appearing where
that other frequency is.

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Be great
to be able to do it

00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:45.460 align:middle line:90%
while you're alive though.

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:47.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well, I'm
saying, I think people can.

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:48.335 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Shamans can.

00:33:48.335 --> 00:33:50.010 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Shamans can.

00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:53.790 align:middle line:84%
But again, you got the cave
issue, becoming a monk.

00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:54.870 align:middle line:90%
But listen.

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:57.620 align:middle line:84%
You're here to
experience things.

00:33:57.620 --> 00:33:59.437 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ritchie,
what are councils?

00:33:59.437 --> 00:34:00.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Councils.

00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:01.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are they?

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well, this came
from Michael Newton, initially.

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:06.420 align:middle line:90%
I was reading his books.

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And he was saying that people
would after a certain point--

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:13.650 align:middle line:84%
before you come to life, before
you choose your incarnation,

00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:16.650 align:middle line:84%
and once you get back,
there are at least two trips

00:34:16.650 --> 00:34:19.949 align:middle line:84%
that you take-- everyone
takes to a council.

00:34:19.949 --> 00:34:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And the council are
people anywhere, roughly,

00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:26.460 align:middle line:84%
from six to 12
people, generally,

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:31.530 align:middle line:84%
who sit, not in judgment of
you, but in guidance of you.

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:33.510 align:middle line:84%
So when you've
finished your lifetime,

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:35.040 align:middle line:84%
you show up in front
of the council.

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And that might be where
you have your life review.

00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And they may say, "Remember
you did that thing.

00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:41.940 align:middle line:84%
You really helped that--
you saved a lot of lives."

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:43.606 align:middle line:84%
And you might be
thinking, "No I didn't.

00:34:43.606 --> 00:34:44.460 align:middle line:90%
I hurt people."

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:45.310 align:middle line:90%
Or the opposite.

00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:46.306 align:middle line:90%
"Oh, I was fantastic."

00:34:46.306 --> 00:34:47.639 align:middle line:90%
And they go, "Oh, just a minute.

00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:48.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No you weren't.

00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:50.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: "Let's take
a look at your journey."

00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:53.250 align:middle line:84%
So those councils-- I
was fascinated by it.

00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And then, when I did
my first session,

00:34:55.530 --> 00:34:57.870 align:middle line:84%
I found myself in
front of a council,

00:34:57.870 --> 00:35:00.960 align:middle line:84%
asking questions just
like I had read about.

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:02.280 align:middle line:90%
And I was a skeptic.

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:04.170 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think I was
going to get anywhere.

00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:07.800 align:middle line:84%
But I had profound questions
that I got answered.

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:10.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I've found is
that I can ask anybody

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:13.140 align:middle line:90%
to take me to their council.

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:15.010 align:middle line:90%
I did it with--

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:16.350 align:middle line:90%
we might be talking about this.

00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:18.337 align:middle line:84%
I did it with a famous
doctor the other day.

00:35:18.337 --> 00:35:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Take
me to your council."

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:21.253 align:middle line:90%
And he said, "What's a council?"

00:35:21.253 --> 00:35:24.300 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "You don't know what
your council is, consciously.

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:25.365 align:middle line:90%
But your guides do."

00:35:25.365 --> 00:35:26.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was this Dr. Drew?

00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:26.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Yeah.

00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:28.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, here we are.

00:35:28.410 --> 00:35:30.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: --doing
something very profound,

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:32.530 align:middle line:84%
which is really important
for you to hear.

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:33.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:36.860 align:middle line:84%
I want you to go to the
first council member.

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:37.660 align:middle line:90%
Are there all--

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:37.812 align:middle line:90%
>>DREW PINSKY: Let me see.

00:35:37.812 --> 00:35:39.395 align:middle line:84%
I'm having trouble
seeing individuals.

00:35:39.395 --> 00:35:40.682 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: That's OK.

00:35:40.682 --> 00:35:41.640 align:middle line:90%
What's your impression?

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.440 align:middle line:84%
>>PINSKY: It's somehow like
Native Americans are here.

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:44.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Very good.

00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:45.110 align:middle line:90%
Are they all male?

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:46.310 align:middle line:90%
Are they female?

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.350 align:middle line:90%
>>PINSKY: Mix.

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:47.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Are they a combo?

00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:48.090 align:middle line:90%
Mix.

00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:48.610 align:middle line:90%
All right, let's go to the--

00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:49.526 align:middle line:90%
>>PINSKY: Mostly male.

00:35:49.526 --> 00:35:51.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: --first
person on the far left.

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:54.536 align:middle line:90%
What's this person look like?

00:35:54.536 --> 00:35:57.475 align:middle line:84%
>>PINSKY: [LAUGHTER]
Like a female pilgrim.

00:35:57.475 --> 00:35:58.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Very good.

00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to
go up close to her.

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:00.882 align:middle line:90%
>>PINSKY: OK.

00:36:00.882 --> 00:36:02.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: And
first of all, I want

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:04.612 align:middle line:84%
to thank this person
for being here.

00:36:04.612 --> 00:36:06.570 align:middle line:84%
>>PINSKY: She's one of
the only women in there.

00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:08.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Let's
give her a name.

00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:08.580 align:middle line:90%
Let's ask her.

00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:09.000 align:middle line:90%
>>PINSKY: Marie.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:09.330 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Marie.

00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:10.130 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:12.390 align:middle line:90%
And how is she dressed?

00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:13.190 align:middle line:90%
>>PINSKY: Like a--

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:14.190 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Like a pilgrim?

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:14.730 align:middle line:90%
Brown?

00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:15.896 align:middle line:90%
I'm just saying with colors.

00:36:15.896 --> 00:36:20.160 align:middle line:84%
>>PINSKY: Like a dark, with a
white apron and one of those

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:21.265 align:middle line:90%
bonnets that they would--

00:36:21.265 --> 00:36:22.140 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Very good.

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:22.590 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:23.490 align:middle line:90%
And so Marie--

00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:24.620 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHTER] I love this.

00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:26.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Marie is
her name, correct?

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:27.320 align:middle line:90%
>>PINSKY: Something like that.

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:30.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: OK, Marie, I want
you to put into Drew's mind

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:34.050 align:middle line:84%
how you earned your
position on the council.

00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:36.360 align:middle line:84%
What is the quality
in Drew's life

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:39.090 align:middle line:90%
that you bring to his council?

00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:44.040 align:middle line:84%
What is the overwhelming
important quality

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:45.210 align:middle line:90%
that you bring to him?

00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:46.920 align:middle line:90%
>>PINSKY: She brings history.

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:47.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Thank you.

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:48.720 align:middle line:90%
History.

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:49.520 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:50.770 align:middle line:90%
And hence, the pilgrim outfit.

00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:51.569 align:middle line:90%
We like that.

00:36:51.569 --> 00:36:52.380 align:middle line:90%
It's very clever.

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:53.546 align:middle line:90%
And I want you to reach out.

00:36:53.546 --> 00:36:55.090 align:middle line:84%
Can you reach out
and touch her hand?

00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:55.890 align:middle line:90%
>>PINSKY: Yep.

00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:56.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: OK.

00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:57.200 align:middle line:90%
Now look at her eyes.

00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:58.200 align:middle line:90%
What color are her eyes?

00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:58.980 align:middle line:90%
>>PINSKY: Blue.

00:36:58.980 --> 00:36:59.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Blue.

00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:01.360 align:middle line:90%
And what color is the hair?

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.160 align:middle line:90%
>>PINSKY: Bonnet.

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:02.950 align:middle line:90%
Bonnet-colored.

00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:03.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Bonnet?

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:04.440 align:middle line:90%
There's no hair under there?

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:04.860 align:middle line:90%
>>PINSKY: I can't see it.

00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:05.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: You can't see it?

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:05.700 align:middle line:90%
>>PINSKY: Light.

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:06.030 align:middle line:90%
Light hair.

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:07.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: So she's got
blue eyes and light hair.

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:08.630 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And now, I want you to describe
the emotion or the feeling

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:13.710 align:middle line:84%
you're getting from
holding this person's hand.

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:14.910 align:middle line:90%
>>PINSKY: Kindness.

00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:16.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Kindness.

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:18.000 align:middle line:90%
What kind of kindness?

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.100 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's a simple word.

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:21.930 align:middle line:90%
Is it overwhelming kindness?

00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:27.410 align:middle line:84%
>>PINSKY: No, it's gentle,
wise, deliberative.

00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:29.060 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Let me ask Marie.

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:31.080 align:middle line:84%
How do you feel
what we're doing?

00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:32.060 align:middle line:84%
Do you think this is
weird what we're doing?

00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:33.400 align:middle line:84%
>>PINSKY: Everyone thinks
it's weird in this room.

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:33.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: OK.

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:34.590 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:35.390 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate that.

00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:35.830 align:middle line:90%
>>PINSKY: And outside.

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I don't see--

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:37.580 align:middle line:90%
I don't think it's weird.

00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:39.245 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: No, no she's-- we're
talking about the council.

00:37:39.245 --> 00:37:39.870 align:middle line:90%
They think it's weird.

00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:40.760 align:middle line:90%
>>PINSKY: The council, not you.

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:41.600 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: So Marie--

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:42.600 align:middle line:84%
>>PINSKY: I think I'm
hypnotised, myself.

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Marie,
I want you to ask--

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:46.110 align:middle line:84%
I want you to say
something to Drew.

00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:46.910 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHTER]

00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:49.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: I want you
to give him a sentence,

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:50.334 align:middle line:90%
and to the people listening in.

00:37:50.334 --> 00:37:51.750 align:middle line:84%
I want you to give
him a sentence.

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:52.874 align:middle line:90%
>>PINSKY: Wisdom is wealth.

00:37:52.874 --> 00:37:53.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Thank you.

00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:55.010 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:55.927 align:middle line:90%
Wisdom is wealth.

00:37:55.927 --> 00:37:57.760 align:middle line:84%
Drew, is this something
you've heard before?

00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:58.310 align:middle line:90%
>>PINSKY: No.

00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:59.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: OK, thank you.

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:01.030 align:middle line:84%
So, Marie-- this is
coming from Marie.

00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:03.075 align:middle line:84%
I would call this
new information.

00:38:03.075 --> 00:38:05.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what was that
exercise all about, Rich?

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:07.365 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: How cool was that?

00:38:07.365 --> 00:38:09.700 align:middle line:90%
The exercise-- I mean, I asked--

00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:11.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was you
talking about what?

00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:12.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Now,
it's interesting.

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:13.778 align:middle line:84%
Because Drew said
to me afterwards,

00:38:13.778 --> 00:38:15.350 align:middle line:90%
"I feel like you hypnotized me."

00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Well, we were
sitting there live on the air.

00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:22.052 align:middle line:84%
And you said what
everybody says."

00:38:22.052 --> 00:38:23.510 align:middle line:84%
He talked about
his counsel the way

00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:25.730 align:middle line:90%
everybody talks about councils.

00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:28.430 align:middle line:84%
But that idea that I would
ask his council member--

00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:32.930 align:middle line:84%
everybody that's on your
council earned a position there.

00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:33.980 align:middle line:90%
I've learned this.

00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:35.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not appointed.

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:36.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: They're
not appointed.

00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:38.750 align:middle line:84%
But they might
represent courage.

00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And if you ask them to
show you the lifetime where

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:45.020 align:middle line:84%
you earned courage,
they'll show it to you.

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:47.090 align:middle line:84%
They'll show you,
well, in the 1400s,

00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:49.940 align:middle line:84%
you took on all of these--
you did this thing where

00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:51.560 align:middle line:90%
you showed courage.

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And that earned you
a council member.

00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:57.120 align:middle line:90%
So that's why-- he had 12.

00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:59.240 align:middle line:84%
So 12 would represent
somebody who's

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:01.730 align:middle line:84%
had many lifetimes
doing something.

00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:02.960 align:middle line:90%
In my case, I had eight.

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:05.360 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to people
who've had three or four.

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:08.480 align:middle line:84%
Each journey to the
council though-- but we

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:09.650 align:middle line:90%
heard something new there.

00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:13.340 align:middle line:90%
Wisdom is wealth.

00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:14.630 align:middle line:90%
So what does that mean?

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:16.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But we
always knew that.

00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:17.812 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: But I asked Drew.

00:39:17.812 --> 00:39:19.520 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever heard
that sentence before?

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:20.900 align:middle line:90%
He said no.

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:23.660 align:middle line:84%
So my point is you
learn new information

00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:25.246 align:middle line:90%
from people on the council.

00:39:25.246 --> 00:39:26.870 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, what's the
point of finding out

00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:28.070 align:middle line:90%
that we have councils?

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:30.560 align:middle line:84%
I think it's fascinating
to find out that--

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:33.500 align:middle line:84%
what I've discovered really
is, in Michael Newton's case,

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:38.120 align:middle line:84%
he's a trained psychologist
who listens to people.

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And he'll ask questions like,
where do you want to go?

00:39:40.850 --> 00:39:43.350 align:middle line:84%
In my case, I'm not
a trained anything.

00:39:43.350 --> 00:39:44.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm just a film dude.

00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:46.850 align:middle line:90%
And what I do is I say, "Hey.

00:39:46.850 --> 00:39:48.260 align:middle line:90%
Let's investigate.

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:49.760 align:middle line:90%
Let's be Columbo.

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:52.310 align:middle line:84%
Let's go over and hold the
hands of the council member."

00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:53.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
have council members

00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:56.060 align:middle line:84%
only when you're at that
near-death experience?

00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:58.730 align:middle line:84%
Or are they there
now for you and me?

00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:01.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Apparently,
they always exist.

00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:04.580 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a near-death
experience, you'll meet them.

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:05.890 align:middle line:90%
When you die, you'll meet them.

00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:07.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
you tap into them?

00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:09.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well, by doing
what I'm doing, you see.

00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:12.050 align:middle line:84%
You can do it through
a hypnotherapy session.

00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:12.850 align:middle line:90%
Or what I do--

00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:15.349 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can't just pray
to them, or anything like that?

00:40:15.349 --> 00:40:17.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well, what I do
is I'll say, during the--

00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:18.860 align:middle line:90%
because I learned this.

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:21.980 align:middle line:84%
I'll say, "Could you put a
sensation in our friend's body

00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:26.060 align:middle line:84%
somewhere that will let
you know, or let them

00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:28.490 align:middle line:90%
know, that you're connected?"

00:40:28.490 --> 00:40:31.130 align:middle line:84%
So they'll say, "I feel this
weird touch on my forehead."

00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:32.990 align:middle line:90%
Or, "My hands are warm."

00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:34.130 align:middle line:90%
And I say, "OK.

00:40:34.130 --> 00:40:36.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's-- it could be
your subconscious creating it.

00:40:36.830 --> 00:40:37.940 align:middle line:90%
It's possible.

00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:42.700 align:middle line:84%
But that's your signal to pay
attention to something that

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:44.950 align:middle line:90%
may be happening, to a dream."

00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:46.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm still confused.

00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:48.940 align:middle line:84%
Richie, who appoints
your council?

00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:49.900 align:middle line:90%
Do we do it?

00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:51.010 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: You earn those.

00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:51.968 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Am I doing it?

00:40:51.968 --> 00:40:54.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well, according
to the way it goes,

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:55.682 align:middle line:90%
is that you earn--

00:40:55.682 --> 00:40:57.640 align:middle line:84%
everybody that's on your
council you're earned.

00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:59.542 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you one example.

00:40:59.542 --> 00:41:00.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who's on my council?

00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:01.840 align:middle line:90%
Do you know?

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:03.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: I don't know.

00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:04.570 align:middle line:90%
Only you would know.

00:41:04.570 --> 00:41:06.490 align:middle line:84%
But Dave Schultz,
the famous Olympian

00:41:06.490 --> 00:41:10.450 align:middle line:84%
who was murdered by John Dupont,
his father, at his eulogy,

00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:13.570 align:middle line:84%
remembered that when his son was
five years old, he came to him.

00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:17.674 align:middle line:84%
And said, "Dad, I spoke to my
council before I came here."

00:41:17.674 --> 00:41:19.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The little
kid said this?

00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:20.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: The
little kid said that.

00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "But
I won't be here--

00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:24.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm here to teach
a lesson in love.

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:25.930 align:middle line:90%
But I won't be here very long."

00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:27.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He knew he
was going to be killed.

00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:28.483 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: So he was five.

00:41:28.483 --> 00:41:30.490 align:middle line:84%
He knew he was going to
be murdered or killed.

00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:32.156 align:middle line:84%
He knew he wasn't
going to be here long.

00:41:32.156 --> 00:41:35.080 align:middle line:84%
But that was the first
time I saw the word council

00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:37.210 align:middle line:90%
outside of Newton--

00:41:37.210 --> 00:41:40.240 align:middle line:84%
here was a kid
remembering his council.

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:43.210 align:middle line:84%
So I've obviously searched
and researched that.

00:41:43.210 --> 00:41:46.930 align:middle line:84%
So people do have this memory
of their council members

00:41:46.930 --> 00:41:48.030 align:middle line:90%
telling them--

00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:50.620 align:middle line:84%
and you go before your
council before you get here.

00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And you say-- let's
say George says,

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:54.780 align:middle line:90%
"I'm going to do these things.

00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:56.071 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to help these people.

00:41:56.071 --> 00:41:59.260 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm going to become
a guy who my voice will

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:01.600 align:middle line:90%
help change people's paradigms.

00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:02.950 align:middle line:90%
And that's my journey.

00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm hoping
it'll work out OK."

00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:07.870 align:middle line:84%
And then you come here, like
a student in a classroom.

00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:09.790 align:middle line:84%
And then, at the
end, you go back

00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:12.859 align:middle line:90%
to your PhD candidate group.

00:42:12.859 --> 00:42:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And they go, "So how
do you think you did?"

00:42:14.650 --> 00:42:15.490 align:middle line:90%
And you argue.

00:42:15.490 --> 00:42:17.770 align:middle line:84%
You say, "Well, I
think I did great."

00:42:17.770 --> 00:42:19.360 align:middle line:90%
Or, "I didn't do enough.

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:22.690 align:middle line:84%
I really-- I wish I had
gone and done that thing

00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:24.260 align:middle line:90%
I always wanted to do.

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:25.210 align:middle line:90%
I got afraid.

00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:26.950 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I hate that."

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:28.910 align:middle line:90%
And they'll go, "It's OK.

00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:33.670 align:middle line:84%
The next time out we'll make
sure that you accomplish that."

00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:35.610 align:middle line:90%
They're your guides.

00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:36.940 align:middle line:90%
But in a formalized sense.

00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:38.274 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they spirit guides?

00:42:38.274 --> 00:42:40.356 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: I guess you
would call them that, yeah.

00:42:40.356 --> 00:42:41.830 align:middle line:84%
They're
non-reincarnating people.

00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:44.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because
spirit guides I get.

00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:45.629 align:middle line:90%
Council is pretty new to me.

00:42:45.629 --> 00:42:47.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well,
here's what I asked.

00:42:47.170 --> 00:42:49.570 align:middle line:84%
My guide, I said,
"So what happens when

00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:51.100 align:middle line:90%
you're done being a guide?"

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:53.182 align:middle line:84%
I ask him how'd
you become a guide?

00:42:53.182 --> 00:42:54.640 align:middle line:84%
I said, "How'd you
become a guide?"

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:55.723 align:middle line:90%
And he explained it to me.

00:42:55.723 --> 00:42:57.520 align:middle line:84%
He said, "After
all my lifetimes,

00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:58.900 align:middle line:90%
I had a graduation party.

00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:00.370 align:middle line:90%
And you were the gift."

00:43:00.370 --> 00:43:01.990 align:middle line:90%
I was his graduation gift.

00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "So
now, when you get

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:06.527 align:middle line:84%
to the end of all
of my lifetimes,

00:43:06.527 --> 00:43:07.610 align:middle line:90%
what are you going to do?"

00:43:07.610 --> 00:43:11.270 align:middle line:84%
He said, "I might
serve on a council."

00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:13.870 align:middle line:90%
I suspect that council members--

00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:16.450 align:middle line:84%
because there's only two
trips that people take--

00:43:16.450 --> 00:43:18.530 align:middle line:84%
that they can be on
anybody's council.

00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:21.610 align:middle line:84%
So you might have
Dr. J. You might

00:43:21.610 --> 00:43:24.397 align:middle line:90%
have Einstein on your council.

00:43:24.397 --> 00:43:25.230 align:middle line:90%
So you see Einstein.

00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:26.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not a bad guy
to have on your council.

00:43:26.290 --> 00:43:27.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Not a
bad-- let's say.

00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:28.120 align:middle line:90%
Let's just pretend.

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:29.950 align:middle line:90%
Somebody famous.

00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:31.132 align:middle line:90%
Not that that Einstein's--

00:43:31.132 --> 00:43:32.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Julius Caesar.

00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:32.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Julius Caesar.

00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:33.550 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And so you see Julius
Caesar's on my council.

00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:37.870 align:middle line:90%
And wow, that's really cool.

00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And now you get this feeling
that he's your person who

00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:43.000 align:middle line:90%
helps guide you.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And then, you find
somebody else who goes,

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.190 align:middle line:84%
"I see Julius Caesar
on my council."

00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:50.580 align:middle line:90%
And then, I would ask Julius.

00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:51.580 align:middle line:90%
This is where I come in.

00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:53.900 align:middle line:84%
I go, "So Julius, you were
also on George's council.

00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:54.700 align:middle line:90%
What's up?"

00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:55.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
councils are you on?

00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:57.186 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: How many
councils are you on?

00:43:57.186 --> 00:43:59.462 align:middle line:84%
Are you maybe just
a little distracted?

00:43:59.462 --> 00:44:00.670 align:middle line:90%
Are you not paying attention?

00:44:00.670 --> 00:44:01.961 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Souls can do anything.

00:44:01.961 --> 00:44:03.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: That's right.

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:04.660 align:middle line:90%
Well, there is that thing.

00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:09.670 align:middle line:84%
It's disconcerting to think that
maybe my guide might be busy

00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:12.460 align:middle line:84%
doing something else when I
really need my guide's help.

00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:15.640 align:middle line:84%
Or my higher consciousness
might be busy

00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:17.730 align:middle line:84%
doing something
else in a classroom,

00:44:17.730 --> 00:44:19.750 align:middle line:90%
while I'm down here struggling.

00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:20.710 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:22.930 align:middle line:84%
How come you can't
hear my prayers?

00:44:22.930 --> 00:44:24.305 align:middle line:90%
What's the lottery numbers?

00:44:24.305 --> 00:44:25.930 align:middle line:84%
Or whatever it is
that you praying for?

00:44:25.930 --> 00:44:28.263 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we all have a
council attached to our lives?

00:44:28.263 --> 00:44:30.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Apparently we all do.

00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:31.330 align:middle line:90%
We all have a council.

00:44:31.330 --> 00:44:32.240 align:middle line:90%
We all have a guide.

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:34.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they guide us
now while we're still alive?

00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:37.995 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: They can, if you
ask for their intercession.

00:44:37.995 --> 00:44:40.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they that little
voice we hear in our heads?

00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:40.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Very good.

00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:42.710 align:middle line:84%
And I've asked this
question many times.

00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:45.160 align:middle line:90%
How can we ask for your help?

00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:48.760 align:middle line:84%
Because your guide, who
is a great help to you,

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:53.770 align:middle line:84%
has only had their lifetimes
and your lifetimes to access.

00:44:53.770 --> 00:44:55.912 align:middle line:84%
Those guides have had
many, many, many, more.

00:44:55.912 --> 00:44:56.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Opportunities.

00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:59.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: So if you can
ask for their intercession,

00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:01.600 align:middle line:90%
you can ask for their help.

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:03.730 align:middle line:90%
Show me the way.

00:45:03.730 --> 00:45:08.260 align:middle line:84%
Put in my mind's frame what it
is I'm supposed to be doing.

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:10.630 align:middle line:84%
How am I supposed to
react to these events?

00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:12.760 align:middle line:84%
Just give me some
knowledge in that area.

00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:14.860 align:middle line:84%
In my case, I'm
talking to my council.

00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Give me
something to tell people."

00:45:17.770 --> 00:45:20.380 align:middle line:84%
Because I had no
idea what this was.

00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:22.980 align:middle line:84%
But I said, "If I ever
get to talk to somebody--"

00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:25.480 align:middle line:90%
And they gave me a sentence.

00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And the sentence
was, just let go.

00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:30.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your wife had
a dream about something

00:45:30.970 --> 00:45:32.200 align:middle line:90%
I see all the time.

00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:34.420 align:middle line:90%
And that is 11:11.

00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:35.530 align:middle line:90%
All the time.

00:45:35.530 --> 00:45:37.570 align:middle line:84%
What do you think the
significance of that was?

00:45:37.570 --> 00:45:38.945 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well,
was fascinating,

00:45:38.945 --> 00:45:43.630 align:middle line:84%
because in the dream, my friend
Luana appeared to Sherry.

00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:45.511 align:middle line:90%
Now, I knew Luana for 20 years.

00:45:45.511 --> 00:45:46.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She's dead now?

00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:47.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Yes, she's dead.

00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:48.800 align:middle line:90%
She's dead.

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:50.233 align:middle line:90%
She passed in '96.

00:45:50.233 --> 00:45:51.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She's
dead on this side.

00:45:51.730 --> 00:45:53.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: She left in '96.

00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:56.380 align:middle line:84%
But my wife Sherry
knew her, had met her.

00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:58.660 align:middle line:84%
This is way before
we got married.

00:45:58.660 --> 00:45:59.860 align:middle line:90%
But they met each other.

00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:01.480 align:middle line:84%
And so now, she
appears in a dream.

00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:03.930 align:middle line:90%
And she says--

00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:05.140 align:middle line:90%
Sherry had made a prayer.

00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:06.190 align:middle line:90%
Our daughter was kind of sick.

00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:07.315 align:middle line:90%
We were getting on a plane.

00:46:07.315 --> 00:46:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And she was just saying,
I hope she's well.

00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And Luana showed up, and said,
"She's going to be fine."

00:46:11.830 --> 00:46:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And then, Sherry
said, "Well, how

00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:16.450 align:middle line:84%
is it that you can communicate
with me like this?"

00:46:16.450 --> 00:46:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And she said Luana
said, "Think of 11:11."

00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:22.270 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it's not
the analog 11:11.

00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:23.830 align:middle line:90%
It's the digital 11:11.

00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:25.870 align:middle line:84%
One looks like a hallway,
and the other one

00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:26.830 align:middle line:90%
looks like a hallway.

00:46:26.830 --> 00:46:28.570 align:middle line:90%
So think of it as two hallways.

00:46:28.570 --> 00:46:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And she said, "In
between is where we meet.

00:46:30.850 --> 00:46:34.750 align:middle line:84%
So I have to adjust my frequency
to meet and talk to you.

00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:37.800 align:middle line:84%
You have to adjust your
frequency--" she's asleep--

00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:39.590 align:middle line:90%
"--to talk to and hear from me."

00:46:39.590 --> 00:46:41.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look
at a video that marks

00:46:41.410 --> 00:46:42.580 align:middle line:90%
exactly what you're saying.

00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:44.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Cool.

00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Other than being a number
that's associated with dreams,

00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:52.780 align:middle line:84%
11:11 is the only time of the
day, using a 12-hour clock,

00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:56.030 align:middle line:84%
that all four digits on
the clock are the same.

00:46:56.030 --> 00:47:00.790 align:middle line:84%
However, some people see 11:11
more frequently than others.

00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:03.640 align:middle line:84%
According to numerology,
the number 11

00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:06.700 align:middle line:84%
is the link between the
mortal and the immortal.

00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:10.700 align:middle line:84%
Which explains the idea that
when the clock strikes 11:11,

00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:13.810 align:middle line:84%
a window to heaven opens
up to grant wishes.

00:47:13.810 --> 00:47:16.900 align:middle line:84%
Others connect
11:11 to a gateway

00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:21.720 align:middle line:84%
or a synchronistic portal
of any symbolic type.

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:24.670 align:middle line:84%
Or is there something
bigger happening here?

00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:28.060 align:middle line:84%
Using logic and science behind
this phenomenon of people

00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:31.750 align:middle line:84%
repeatedly seeing the same
number, what we end up with,

00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:32.890 align:middle line:90%
three reasons.

00:47:32.890 --> 00:47:37.090 align:middle line:84%
Chance, predisposition,
and acceleration.

00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:40.790 align:middle line:84%
Using illogic, we end
up with another reason.

00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:43.120 align:middle line:90%
Synchronicity.

00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:47.770 align:middle line:84%
Let's now examine
all of the reasons.

00:47:47.770 --> 00:47:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, I love
it when I see 11:11.

00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:52.540 align:middle line:84%
When I'm in the
studio in LA, Rich,

00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:54.790 align:middle line:84%
I've got a digital clock
right in front of me.

00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:56.350 align:middle line:90%
A huge clock.

00:47:56.350 --> 00:47:57.720 align:middle line:90%
And every once in a while--

00:47:57.720 --> 00:47:59.830 align:middle line:84%
and it marks down
to the seconds.

00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:03.430 align:middle line:90%
I'll see 11:11:11.

00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:04.630 align:middle line:90%
And it's bizarre.

00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:05.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Wow, that's great.

00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:07.750 align:middle line:90%
I've started to notice it too.

00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:09.400 align:middle line:90%
You glance at a clock.

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:10.630 align:middle line:90%
It's got to be digital.

00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:13.670 align:middle line:84%
But my point is, it could
be what he was just saying.

00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:19.120 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm getting is, it's
your higher consciousness--

00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:21.430 align:middle line:84%
because only a third of
our consciousness is here

00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:22.990 align:middle line:90%
and 2/3 is always home--

00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:25.090 align:middle line:90%
is saying, ding.

00:48:25.090 --> 00:48:26.270 align:middle line:90%
Pay attention.

00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And it might be
because someone's

00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:29.890 align:middle line:90%
trying to reach out to you.

00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:31.990 align:middle line:84%
Or someone's trying to
pat you on the back.

00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:34.519 align:middle line:84%
Or some other communication
is about to come through.

00:48:34.519 --> 00:48:35.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something's happening.

00:48:35.810 --> 00:48:37.101 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Yeah, pay attention.

00:48:37.101 --> 00:48:40.390 align:middle line:84%
It might be, when you get in
the car today, drive safely.

00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:43.900 align:middle line:84%
So that's never going to
be a harm to pay attention.

00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:45.130 align:middle line:90%
It's a good thing.

00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:47.500 align:middle line:84%
So I wouldn't-- we don't
have to wear a pyramid hat--

00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:49.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But what
does it tell you--

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:49.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: --to appreciate it.

00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:51.748 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --because I believe
more and more people are

00:48:51.748 --> 00:48:53.980 align:middle line:90%
seeing 11:11?

00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:56.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well, maybe
what Luana was saying.

00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:59.830 align:middle line:90%
She was saying, it's an example.

00:48:59.830 --> 00:49:01.720 align:middle line:84%
It's a physical
example of how we

00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:03.800 align:middle line:90%
communicate with the flipside.

00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:05.907 align:middle line:90%
So you have to lean in, though.

00:49:05.907 --> 00:49:07.240 align:middle line:90%
You have to lean to the decimal.

00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:08.350 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

00:49:08.350 --> 00:49:10.572 align:middle line:84%
It's the decimal's
what the story is.

00:49:10.572 --> 00:49:11.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In the middle.

00:49:11.530 --> 00:49:12.571 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: In the middle.

00:49:12.571 --> 00:49:14.620 align:middle line:84%
You have to lean in
the middle in order

00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:17.800 align:middle line:84%
to experience other
states of reality.

00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:21.370 align:middle line:84%
We have to lean in the middle in
order to communicate with you.

00:49:21.370 --> 00:49:24.640 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's slowing down their
frequency, or speeding it up,

00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:25.520 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it is.

00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:26.980 align:middle line:90%
However their process is.

00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:30.070 align:middle line:84%
So I would say,
yeah, pay attention.

00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:31.720 align:middle line:84%
Open yourself--
whatever that means.

00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:33.300 align:middle line:90%
Open your awareness up.

00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:35.500 align:middle line:90%
Is somebody talking to me?

00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:36.760 align:middle line:90%
Lottery numbers?

00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:37.600 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:39.467 align:middle line:90%
Whatever comes to mind.

00:49:39.467 --> 00:49:41.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It would seem to me
that dealing with the other

00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:42.340 align:middle line:90%
side--

00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:43.930 align:middle line:84%
and you've been doing it
for how many years now?

00:49:43.930 --> 00:49:44.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Too many!

00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Too many years.

00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:47.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: About 10 years.

00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:50.082 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has it made
you more enlightened?

00:49:50.082 --> 00:49:51.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: I wish it
had made me lighter.

00:49:51.790 --> 00:49:52.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Lighter.

00:49:52.590 --> 00:49:54.400 align:middle line:90%
Well, only you can control that.

00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:55.400 align:middle line:90%
Not your council.

00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:56.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: That's true.

00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:59.290 align:middle line:84%
I wish that I would spend
more time having them say,

00:49:59.290 --> 00:50:00.710 align:middle line:90%
"Put the sandwich down.

00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:01.540 align:middle line:90%
Do you really--"

00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:03.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: "Rich, stay
away from the pasta."

00:50:03.310 --> 00:50:08.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: No, like I say, my
experience coming out of a deep

00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:10.334 align:middle line:90%
hypnosis session was as if--

00:50:10.334 --> 00:50:11.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who hypnotized you?

00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:15.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: It was Jimmy Quast
from Easton Hypnosis, who

00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:18.160 align:middle line:84%
does the training
at Newton Institute.

00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like I had
taken the red pill.

00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:23.620 align:middle line:84%
I walked out of
that session feeling

00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:28.330 align:middle line:84%
that the entire gravitational
pull of the Earth had shifted.

00:50:28.330 --> 00:50:29.320 align:middle line:90%
The axis had shifted.

00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:30.279 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To your favor?

00:50:30.279 --> 00:50:31.111 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Well, no.

00:50:31.111 --> 00:50:31.930 align:middle line:90%
It just shifted.

00:50:31.930 --> 00:50:35.320 align:middle line:84%
Now I realized that
everything I thought,

00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:39.040 align:middle line:90%
everything, was inaccurate.

00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:41.780 align:middle line:90%
But also worth looking at again.

00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:43.210 align:middle line:90%
Like what?

00:50:43.210 --> 00:50:45.130 align:middle line:90%
How did I choose to come here?

00:50:45.130 --> 00:50:46.840 align:middle line:90%
I chose to be on the planet.

00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:48.640 align:middle line:90%
I chose to be Richard.

00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:50.210 align:middle line:90%
I chose to be a filmmaker.

00:50:50.210 --> 00:50:52.390 align:middle line:90%
I chose my parents.

00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:54.130 align:middle line:90%
What else did I choose?

00:50:54.130 --> 00:50:56.950 align:middle line:84%
It's completely transformed
who I am as a person.

00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:59.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did your wife not have
some bizarre dreams herself?

00:50:59.830 --> 00:51:04.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well, she's had
a number of unusual events

00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:06.980 align:middle line:90%
with me when I first met her.

00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:08.910 align:middle line:90%
I actually-- we met--

00:51:08.910 --> 00:51:10.410 align:middle line:84%
this is something
I talk to people--

00:51:10.410 --> 00:51:11.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was her in
that one clip we saw--

00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:11.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: That was
her in her clip--

00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:12.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --holding
the little baby.

00:51:12.290 --> 00:51:13.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: --holding the baby.

00:51:13.210 --> 00:51:13.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was that
your little baby?

00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:14.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Yeah, yeah.

00:51:14.530 --> 00:51:15.550 align:middle line:90%
That was our daughter.

00:51:15.550 --> 00:51:17.650 align:middle line:84%
What I try to say
to people is, you

00:51:17.650 --> 00:51:22.810 align:middle line:84%
can experience your
life planning session

00:51:22.810 --> 00:51:26.620 align:middle line:84%
when you examine how you've
met your significant other.

00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:28.630 align:middle line:84%
If you really
focus on the moment

00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:33.694 align:middle line:84%
when you actually went from,
I like this person, to this

00:51:33.694 --> 00:51:34.990 align:middle line:90%
is the person.

00:51:34.990 --> 00:51:35.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is the one.

00:51:35.350 --> 00:51:36.474 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: This is the one.

00:51:36.474 --> 00:51:37.600 align:middle line:90%
It's that moment.

00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:40.150 align:middle line:84%
Because everyone has a life
planning session, where

00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:42.840 align:middle line:84%
they say, you're going to
meet up at such and such point

00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:43.760 align:middle line:90%
in time.

00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:45.070 align:middle line:90%
Hopefully you remember it.

00:51:45.070 --> 00:51:47.350 align:middle line:84%
Free will allows
us to screw it up.

00:51:47.350 --> 00:51:49.319 align:middle line:84%
But generally, when you
have that experience,

00:51:49.319 --> 00:51:50.860 align:middle line:84%
you meet somebody
for the first time.

00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:51.818 align:middle line:90%
And you go, "Oh my God.

00:51:51.818 --> 00:51:53.140 align:middle line:90%
That's my wife."

00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:54.490 align:middle line:90%
My brother-in-law said that.

00:51:54.490 --> 00:51:55.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or my soul mate.

00:51:55.540 --> 00:51:57.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: And often they'll
say, when I really examine it--

00:51:57.850 --> 00:51:59.170 align:middle line:84%
I'll say, "So what
was the feeling you

00:51:59.170 --> 00:52:00.461 align:middle line:90%
had when you had that emotion?"

00:52:00.461 --> 00:52:03.670 align:middle line:84%
They'll say,
"unconditional love."

00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:04.750 align:middle line:90%
Again, there's that word.

00:52:04.750 --> 00:52:05.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It pops up again.

00:52:05.350 --> 00:52:06.516 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: It pops up again.

00:52:06.516 --> 00:52:07.930 align:middle line:90%
But it's the idea of--

00:52:07.930 --> 00:52:11.450 align:middle line:84%
and so I've had that with
Sherry, when I first met her.

00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:13.250 align:middle line:90%
I was sitting at a Starbucks.

00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:14.410 align:middle line:90%
We had this conversation.

00:52:14.410 --> 00:52:16.900 align:middle line:84%
Within two minutes, I
said to her, "Why don't we

00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:20.800 align:middle line:84%
just skip down, get married,
and have a couple of kids?"

00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:23.117 align:middle line:84%
And as I said it, I thought,
"What are you saying?"

00:52:23.117 --> 00:52:24.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
you saying, Martini?

00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:25.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: And of
course, my wife

00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:27.650 align:middle line:84%
says I say that to
everybody at Starbucks.

00:52:27.650 --> 00:52:30.002 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, then I
moved back to New York.

00:52:30.002 --> 00:52:31.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Only no one listens.

00:52:31.210 --> 00:52:32.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: I don't listen.

00:52:32.110 --> 00:52:33.280 align:middle line:90%
But I moved back to New York.

00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:35.080 align:middle line:84%
I was working on "The
Charles Grodin Show."

00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:38.840 align:middle line:90%
And she would appear in my room.

00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:39.640 align:middle line:90%
And I'd see her.

00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:41.765 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say-- I'd call her
up the next day and say,

00:52:41.765 --> 00:52:44.210 align:middle line:84%
"Well, were you were wearing
a pink t-shirt to bed

00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:45.010 align:middle line:90%
last night?"

00:52:45.010 --> 00:52:46.030 align:middle line:90%
"Yeah, why?"

00:52:46.030 --> 00:52:47.060 align:middle line:90%
Ah!

00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And then, when I was traveling
in Tibet, and our daughter

00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:51.530 align:middle line:90%
was born.

00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:53.120 align:middle line:90%
I was testing it.

00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:55.100 align:middle line:84%
I would just focus
on my daughter.

00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:58.365 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say, "Poke Mom,
and tell her I love you."

00:52:58.365 --> 00:52:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And then, I'd contact
her the next day.

00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:02.242 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say, "So did Olivia
do anything last night?"

00:53:02.242 --> 00:53:03.950 align:middle line:84%
"She poked me in the
middle of the night,

00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:04.850 align:middle line:90%
and said I love you."

00:53:04.850 --> 00:53:07.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have now
developed your career

00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:08.470 align:middle line:90%
around the afterlife.

00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:09.270 align:middle line:90%
Books--

00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:10.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Weird.

00:53:10.070 --> 00:53:11.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --documentaries, films.

00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:13.305 align:middle line:90%
Where does it take you next?

00:53:13.305 --> 00:53:14.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: [LAUGHTER]

00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:15.132 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's up?

00:53:15.132 --> 00:53:16.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: I'll be
pitching on that team.

00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:18.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, you will.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:19.330 align:middle line:90%
Not too soon, let's hope.

00:53:19.330 --> 00:53:21.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Not too
soon, my friend.

00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:22.610 align:middle line:90%
No, I think what it--

00:53:22.610 --> 00:53:25.280 align:middle line:84%
next up is, I've
got two projects.

00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:26.630 align:middle line:90%
One came from you.

00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:28.730 align:middle line:84%
"The Afterlife Expert
Project," where

00:53:28.730 --> 00:53:32.360 align:middle line:84%
I've been interviewing dozens
of people to their council--

00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:35.780 align:middle line:84%
introducing them to their
council, all walks of life.

00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:39.110 align:middle line:84%
But often mediums, who
aren't really aware of how

00:53:39.110 --> 00:53:40.040 align:middle line:90%
they became a medium.

00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And I ask them to
access that moment

00:53:43.130 --> 00:53:46.400 align:middle line:84%
when they first started talking
to people on the other side.

00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And they may not have
accessed it since it happened.

00:53:49.070 --> 00:53:51.650 align:middle line:84%
I did this with Tony Stockwell
and some other people,

00:53:51.650 --> 00:53:55.280 align:middle line:84%
where they got to actually
see who that person was.

00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:56.682 align:middle line:90%
Because we talked about it.

00:53:56.682 --> 00:53:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And then I walk them in
to visit their council.

00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:02.180 align:middle line:84%
And I ask-- in Tony's
case, his council member

00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:05.180 align:middle line:90%
was wearing a literal star.

00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:06.590 align:middle line:90%
And I asked, "What's that?"

00:54:06.590 --> 00:54:08.870 align:middle line:84%
He said, "It's a
portal where you

00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:10.520 align:middle line:90%
can go to different realms."

00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:12.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is stuff
I've never heard of.

00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:14.046 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you do
this in hypnotherapy?

00:54:14.046 --> 00:54:17.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: No, no, it's coffee
talk, just chit chat, just

00:54:17.010 --> 00:54:17.810 align:middle line:90%
like us.

00:54:17.810 --> 00:54:18.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it
just comes to you.

00:54:18.020 --> 00:54:19.061 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: It just comes.

00:54:19.061 --> 00:54:22.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm asking the questions, and
they're answering, fully awake.

00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:23.510 align:middle line:84%
Mediums, they're a
little bit easier

00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:27.050 align:middle line:84%
to deal with, because
they're used to seeing stuff

00:54:27.050 --> 00:54:28.940 align:middle line:90%
that isn't in the room.

00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:31.160 align:middle line:84%
But the other book
that I'm working on

00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:32.766 align:middle line:90%
is with Jennifer Shaffer.

00:54:32.766 --> 00:54:35.390 align:middle line:84%
It's called-- I think it's going
to be called "Backstage Pass,"

00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:38.300 align:middle line:84%
because somebody on
the flipside said, "Oh.

00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:41.119 align:middle line:84%
Being over here, it's like
having an all-access pass.

00:54:41.119 --> 00:54:42.410 align:middle line:90%
Because you can go everywhere."

00:54:42.410 --> 00:54:43.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love that.

00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:44.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Yeah.

00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:46.250 align:middle line:84%
But it's the idea of
talking to people.

00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And just the sessions where
we access friends of mine,

00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:51.500 align:middle line:84%
or people that I
knew or she knew.

00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:53.450 align:middle line:84%
What's it like for
you over there?

00:54:53.450 --> 00:54:56.579 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
afraid of dying?

00:54:56.579 --> 00:54:57.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: What am I afraid of?

00:54:57.870 --> 00:54:59.090 align:middle line:90%
It's a good question.

00:54:59.090 --> 00:55:02.630 align:middle line:84%
No, I'm not afraid
of dying at all.

00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:06.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm afraid of leaving
the planet before I've

00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:08.520 align:middle line:84%
done what I'm supposed
to be here to do.

00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:09.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Me too.

00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:11.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel like
I've accomplished

00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:12.870 align:middle line:90%
everything I want to do.

00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:14.270 align:middle line:90%
So I'm not ready yet for that.

00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:17.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: But the question is,
is there a moment where you go,

00:55:17.070 --> 00:55:17.870 align:middle line:90%
"Oh.

00:55:17.870 --> 00:55:18.170 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:19.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm done.

00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:19.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm out of here."

00:55:19.570 --> 00:55:20.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I hope not.

00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:21.708 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: No, I meant that--

00:55:21.708 --> 00:55:24.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But when it happens,
will you be ready for it?

00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:25.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Well, I think--

00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:27.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: God forbid if
it hits you right now.

00:55:27.380 --> 00:55:28.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: I'll be
really surprised

00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:31.730 align:middle line:84%
if it's not exactly what
I've been describing.

00:55:31.730 --> 00:55:33.110 align:middle line:90%
That'll be the surprise.

00:55:33.110 --> 00:55:34.400 align:middle line:84%
Somebody said that to
me on the flipside.

00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:35.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What if your wrong?

00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:36.463 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: Well, that's what
somebody said on the flipside.

00:55:36.463 --> 00:55:36.770 align:middle line:90%
He said--

00:55:36.770 --> 00:55:37.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if it's
fire and brimstone?

00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:39.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: --stay open
to the possibility

00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:41.680 align:middle line:84%
that it's going to be
more surprising than you

00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:42.480 align:middle line:90%
think it is.

00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:43.938 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But at
the same time, what

00:55:43.938 --> 00:55:47.595 align:middle line:84%
if it could be one of these
most illuminating places ever?

00:55:47.595 --> 00:55:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And you feel this energy
and this unconditional

00:55:50.570 --> 00:55:52.380 align:middle line:90%
love that you've talked about?

00:55:52.380 --> 00:55:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And that maybe it's the way
we can change this universe,

00:55:57.530 --> 00:55:59.104 align:middle line:90%
if people tap into it.

00:55:59.104 --> 00:56:00.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: I think so.

00:56:00.020 --> 00:56:02.519 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard this consistently
when I'm talking to people.

00:56:02.519 --> 00:56:06.260 align:middle line:84%
I say, "So why is it that
you're involved in this work?"

00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:09.860 align:middle line:84%
And they'll say, "We're
adjusting the consciousness

00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:11.150 align:middle line:90%
of people on the planet."

00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:12.410 align:middle line:90%
And I'd say, "Why?

00:56:12.410 --> 00:56:13.700 align:middle line:90%
Why is that important?"

00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And they say, "Because it's
going to heal the planet."

00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:19.384 align:middle line:90%
And they talk about this.

00:56:19.384 --> 00:56:21.800 align:middle line:84%
So the kind of work that I'm
doing, and that you're doing,

00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:23.750 align:middle line:84%
and that so many
people are doing,

00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:26.705 align:middle line:84%
is helping alter the
consciousness just subtly.

00:56:26.705 --> 00:56:27.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just a little bit.

00:56:27.830 --> 00:56:29.038 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Just a little bit.

00:56:29.038 --> 00:56:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And the whole planet--
so well, it'll

00:56:31.070 --> 00:56:35.170 align:middle line:84%
eventually become so that
we can access these realms,

00:56:35.170 --> 00:56:37.460 align:middle line:84%
talk to people who
are no longer here,

00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:40.370 align:middle line:84%
learn scientific
things from them.

00:56:40.370 --> 00:56:44.390 align:middle line:84%
How to turn fresh water
from salt water for pennies.

00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:47.220 align:middle line:84%
Things that we don't
have access to now.

00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:48.020 align:middle line:90%
But we will.

00:56:48.020 --> 00:56:52.400 align:middle line:84%
Because you and I and many of
your viewers are doing this

00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:54.314 align:middle line:90%
now, altering consciousness.

00:56:54.314 --> 00:56:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would like one day
for you to be on my council.

00:56:56.730 --> 00:56:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINI: [LAUGHTER] Oh,
wouldn't that be funny.

00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:00.380 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: But not yet.

00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:01.280 align:middle line:10%
Not yet.

00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:01.880 align:middle line:10%
Thanks, Rich.

00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:02.570 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTINI: Thank you, George.

00:57:02.570 --> 00:57:02.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For being
on the program.

00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:04.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINI: Always a treat.

00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:05.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:06.740 align:middle line:90%
Life after death.

00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:08.030 align:middle line:90%
Does it exist?

00:57:08.030 --> 00:57:08.990 align:middle line:90%
Does it not?

00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:11.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you talk to
people like Rich Martini,

00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:15.350 align:middle line:84%
well, you're convinced
that there is an afterlife.

00:57:15.350 --> 00:57:18.860 align:middle line:10%
But like I just told him,
I'm in no rush to get there.

00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:20.780 align:middle line:90%
And I hope you aren't either.

00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:22.980 align:middle line:84%
We'll see you on the
next "Beyond Belief."
