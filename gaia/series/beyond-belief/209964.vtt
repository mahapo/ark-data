00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.190 align:middle line:84%
>>TRICIA BARKER: On that fateful
day, I had a head-on collision,

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.970 align:middle line:84%
and I broke my back
in three places.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:16.845 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Ouch.

00:00:16.845 --> 00:00:19.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: At some point during
the surgery, I left my body.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.740 align:middle line:84%
It felt as if a different
portal had been opened up,

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.080 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly I had
sensory abilities

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.830 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't have
while in my body.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.640 align:middle line:84%
I was merging with this
unconditional love.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.729 align:middle line:84%
It was the most profound
love imaginable.

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:35.730 align:middle line:84%
Because of this experience,
I'm driven to help humanity,

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm driven to help people heal.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.030 align:middle line:90%
That's my motivation.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.107 align:middle line:90%


00:00:43.107 --> 00:00:45.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.090 align:middle line:10%
Tricia Barker experienced
her near-death experience

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.880 align:middle line:10%
as a college student, which
completely changed her life.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.070 align:middle line:84%
She is a teacher and author of a
book called "Angels in the OR,"

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.470 align:middle line:84%
and she hosts a YouTube
channel called "Be

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.862 align:middle line:90%
the Light of Your Own Healing."

00:00:59.862 --> 00:01:01.320 align:middle line:84%
Tricia, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: Thank you, George.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:03.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm so happy to be here.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.313 align:middle line:90%
I love your program.

00:01:04.313 --> 00:01:05.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Prior to
your near-death

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.130 align:middle line:84%
experience, tell us a little
bit about who Tricia was.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.450 align:middle line:10%
>>BARKER: I was an average
college student in many ways,

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.510 align:middle line:10%
but I had some deep
wounds from childhood,

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.350 align:middle line:10%
and I very much was
materialistically driven.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.450 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to be successful.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.950 align:middle line:10%
I loved academia.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.930 align:middle line:10%
I really didn't plan
on being a teacher.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.740 align:middle line:10%
But I was running the
Austin 10K as this symbol

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.775 align:middle line:10%
of strength and power and ending
my senior year with a bang.

00:01:32.775 --> 00:01:35.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that fateful
day, tell us what happened.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: On that fateful
day, I had a head-on collision

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.650 align:middle line:90%
pretty much.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.150 align:middle line:84%
So I was on my way
to run the race.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And when this happened, I knew
my life had changed forever

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.750 align:middle line:84%
because I could not
reach the glove box.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.260 align:middle line:84%
So I was slumped
over to one side.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.177 align:middle line:84%
My body was full
of pain and heat.

00:01:54.177 --> 00:01:56.385 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you driving,
or were you the passenger?

00:01:56.385 --> 00:01:58.620 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: I was driving, yes.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.010 align:middle line:90%
And I'll never know.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.020 align:middle line:84%
The accident was written
down as my fault,

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.630 align:middle line:84%
but I feel like it
was fated, that this

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.620 align:middle line:84%
was a moment that divinity
stepped in to alter my path.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.360 align:middle line:84%
The other people
were not harmed.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.620 align:middle line:90%
They were in a big SUV.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.270 align:middle line:90%
I was in a tiny car.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And I broke my back
in three places.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ouch.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: And had
spinal injuries and tons

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.105 align:middle line:90%
of internal injuries.

00:02:21.105 --> 00:02:23.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now this
experience that you had,

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.500 align:middle line:90%
the NDE, was it in the hospital?

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.075 align:middle line:90%
Was it still in the car?

00:02:27.075 --> 00:02:28.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: No, it
was in the hospital.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.620 align:middle line:84%
So eventually, after
17 hours of waiting

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.750 align:middle line:84%
in the ER, many CAT scans and
MRIs, I was taken into surgery.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.060 align:middle line:84%
They were a little worried
about the internal injuries,

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.710 align:middle line:84%
and I remember
signing this form that

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.424 align:middle line:90%
said "17% chance of death."

00:02:42.424 --> 00:02:43.632 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, "Hey, I'm 21."

00:02:43.632 --> 00:02:45.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They made you
sign it in that condition?

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.280 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: Yes.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.560 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, "Oh, OK.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.030 align:middle line:90%
There's a chance I could die."

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.300 align:middle line:84%
I was agnostic, and I didn't
think that I would continue on.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.660 align:middle line:84%
So I went into that surgery
thinking I'm strong.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm young.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.610 align:middle line:90%
Hopefully I make it.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.570 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine
my surprise when

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.760 align:middle line:84%
at some point during the
surgery I left my body.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened?

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:07.710 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: Yeah.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.190 align:middle line:84%
So somewhere, they
had me flipped over

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.960 align:middle line:90%
and there was a ton of blood.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.450 align:middle line:84%
I popped out of
my physical form,

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.380 align:middle line:84%
and I could see 360 degrees,
you're not limited by eyes,

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.990 align:middle line:84%
I could see the tops of
the heads of the surgeons

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.385 align:middle line:90%
as they're operating on me.

00:03:23.385 --> 00:03:25.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People scurrying
all over the place.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: Yes, there
was so much blood.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.450 align:middle line:84%
That's where I remember thinking
like, "Oh, surgery is brutal.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.290 align:middle line:90%
Look at that body."

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.290 align:middle line:84%
But I felt disconnected
from that body already.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.520 align:middle line:90%
I felt different.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.630 align:middle line:84%
There were these light beings
behind the surgeons working

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.330 align:middle line:84%
through them, and that
gave me so much peace.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.010 align:middle line:84%
I knew that these intelligent
beings were assisting

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.190 align:middle line:84%
with this surgery, that I'd
walk, that I'd later run,

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.190 align:middle line:84%
that I'd live a normal life
because I had lost feeling

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.620 align:middle line:84%
in my left leg before
going into the surgery,

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.455 align:middle line:84%
and I was deathly afraid
of being in a wheelchair.

00:03:58.455 --> 00:04:00.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was it
euphoric, Tricia,

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.625 align:middle line:90%
to be on the other side?

00:04:02.625 --> 00:04:05.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: That
consciousness was amazing.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.880 align:middle line:84%
So I was someone who paid
attention to breakthroughs

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:09.900 align:middle line:90%
in science.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.280 align:middle line:90%
I cared a lot about the brain.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: And I was
on this other side.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.800 align:middle line:84%
I felt so much smarter than
I'd ever felt in my own brain.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.339 align:middle line:84%
I felt as if my consciousness
was upgraded the minute

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:22.230 align:middle line:84%
I was out of my
physical form, that I

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.080 align:middle line:84%
was receiving
vibrational information,

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.430 align:middle line:84%
feeling information, beginning
to feel one with people

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.120 align:middle line:90%
in that operating room.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized I had died
because the monitor flatlined.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In the
death process, do you

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.520 align:middle line:90%
experience heaven, hell, Angels?

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.320 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.835 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: Yeah,
so it was quite--

00:04:44.835 --> 00:04:47.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Hence the book
"Angels in the OR," right?

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.820 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: Yeah.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, they were the
first image that

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.590 align:middle line:84%
was an added reality
to this reality.

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.730 align:middle line:84%
So people often say, how do
you know this wasn't a dream?

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.640 align:middle line:84%
It felt as if a different
portal had been opened up

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.610 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly I had
sensory abilities

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.450 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't have
while in my body.

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.080 align:middle line:84%
I could see that these
Angels were working

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.180 align:middle line:84%
through the surgeons, that
they were working on me

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.570 align:middle line:84%
on a physical level, a spiritual
level, an emotional level,

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.310 align:middle line:84%
that they were participating
with my healing.

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.820 align:middle line:84%
I also knew that they
told me I wouldn't die.

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.850 align:middle line:84%
I'd come back to this body
and live this experience.

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.600 align:middle line:84%
But when the monitor
flatlined, that's

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.775 align:middle line:84%
when I left the hospital,
had my verifiable event.

00:05:28.775 --> 00:05:31.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you realize
that you were dying?

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.455 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: I knew I was
dead at that point when

00:05:33.455 --> 00:05:33.530 align:middle line:90%
the monitor flatlined.

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:34.385 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You did?

00:05:34.385 --> 00:05:36.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: And at that point,
even though the Angels

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:37.480 align:middle line:90%
had said, you'll live.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.280 align:middle line:90%
You'll walk.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.780 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really
want to see how they

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.460 align:middle line:84%
were going to revive me because
there was so much blood.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.730 align:middle line:84%
I thought, this
isn't as interesting.

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.282 align:middle line:84%
Some people stay in their
near-death experiences

00:05:47.282 --> 00:05:48.240 align:middle line:90%
and look at their body.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.460 align:middle line:84%
I thought, let's see
what's out there.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.650 align:middle line:84%
Like, let's get out
of this hospital.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:53.610 align:middle line:90%
Let's travel.

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And so when I went on, I felt
this oneness with everyone.

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.050 align:middle line:84%
It was this beautiful
experience where suddenly I

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.415 align:middle line:84%
felt connected to
everyone in Austin.

00:06:06.415 --> 00:06:07.957 align:middle line:84%
This is where this
accident happened.

00:06:07.957 --> 00:06:08.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.707 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: I knew their souls.

00:06:09.707 --> 00:06:10.582 align:middle line:90%
I knew who they were.

00:06:10.582 --> 00:06:13.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Weren't you
aware of things much more?

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.420 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: Yes, much more.

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And I moved into the night sky,
kind of, like, into the stars.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.810 align:middle line:90%
It was just beautiful.

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.567 align:middle line:84%
And I felt one with
this consciousness

00:06:24.567 --> 00:06:25.650 align:middle line:90%
that was coming toward me.

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.080 align:middle line:84%
So I felt the light
of God reminding me

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.270 align:middle line:84%
of certain messages,
like love is all

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.130 align:middle line:90%
that we take with us when we go.

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:36.570 align:middle line:84%
Be like a little child
to enjoy this life more.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.460 align:middle line:84%
Other messages

to go to nature for the
truth and for healing.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And all of these
messages seemed simple

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.380 align:middle line:84%
and I remember
thinking, "Hmm, maybe I

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.345 align:middle line:90%
need a little bit more."

00:06:48.345 --> 00:06:49.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: How am I going to
bring this back to humanity?

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.115 align:middle line:84%
But over time, these messages
have meant a lot more.

00:06:56.115 --> 00:06:58.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's watch this clip
of Raymond Moody, an expert

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.770 align:middle line:84%
on near-death experiences,
on his Gaia Television

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.610 align:middle line:84%
program where he talked about
events going on at hospitals.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:09.690 align:middle line:84%
When you're in an NDE
situation, you become more aware

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:10.750 align:middle line:90%
of certain things.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:14.470 align:middle line:84%
Let's see what he says, and then
I want to get your reaction.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.980 align:middle line:10%
- One of the more puzzling
features of near-death

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:23.170 align:middle line:10%
experiences is that it happens
fairly regularly that while

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:26.230 align:middle line:10%
they are out of their
body in the hospital,

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:29.710 align:middle line:10%
the patients will tell us that
they go to some other part

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:33.250 align:middle line:10%
of the hospital or maybe
even someplace outside

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:37.850 align:middle line:10%
of the hospital entirely and are
able accurately to report what

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:38.650 align:middle line:10%
happened.

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:42.760 align:middle line:84%
For example, I had this
wonderful friend, Vi Horton,

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:48.250 align:middle line:84%
who had a cardiac arrest during
surgery for a gallbladder,

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:53.860 align:middle line:84%
and had a cardiac arrest that
lasted 20 minutes, according

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.420 align:middle line:90%
to her doctor.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.690 align:middle line:10%
Now when Vi was out
of her body, she

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:01.540 align:middle line:10%
was going out in the
hall in the hospital.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.000 align:middle line:84%
And in an area of
the hospital, she

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.900 align:middle line:84%
saw her brother-in-law who
was standing there alone.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And as she was watching him,
a friend of the brother-in-law

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.560 align:middle line:84%
came up and said, "What
are you doing here?"

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.620 align:middle line:84%
And her brother-in-law
said, "Well, I

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:20.590 align:middle line:84%
was going to Athens
today to see Uncle Henry,

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:24.200 align:middle line:84%
but it looks like Vi is
going to kick the bucket.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:28.330 align:middle line:84%
So I'm staying around to be
a pallbearer at her funeral."

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:31.030 align:middle line:10%
Several days later
when her brother-in-law

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:35.740 align:middle line:10%
came to the hospital to visit
her after she was revived,

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.350 align:middle line:10%
Vi said to him,
"Well, the next time

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:41.020 align:middle line:10%
I die, I want you
to go on to Athens

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.800 align:middle line:10%
to see Uncle Henry because
and I won't be fine."

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And I interviewed that
brother-in-law at depth

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:52.780 align:middle line:84%
about that, and he said that
event totally changed his life.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:55.270 align:middle line:84%
Now this is a
fairly common thing

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:58.510 align:middle line:84%
that patients will
tell us these things,

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:01.420 align:middle line:84%
seeing things about the
resuscitation saying

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:03.315 align:middle line:84%
that they shouldn't
have been able to see.

00:09:03.315 --> 00:09:04.115 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:09:04.115 --> 00:09:06.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did those
things happen to you too,

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:08.235 align:middle line:90%
like Raymond just described?

00:09:08.235 --> 00:09:09.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: They certainly did.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:14.700 align:middle line:84%
I felt my spirit form decide
to go through the doorway.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have
to open the door.

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.860 align:middle line:84%
You just move through into
the hallway of the hospital.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't want to
see myself revived,

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:25.110 align:middle line:84%
and I saw my stepdad
getting this candy bar down

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:27.030 align:middle line:90%
the hall out of a machine.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:29.430 align:middle line:84%
And I remember thinking,
he brags all the time

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:30.960 align:middle line:84%
about never eating
sugar and look

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.760 align:middle line:90%
at him eating that candy bar.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:37.050 align:middle line:84%
Later, I asked my mom if he
did indeed get that candy bar,

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:39.720 align:middle line:84%
and she said she was
certain and my dad was

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.400 align:middle line:84%
certain at that
moment that I died.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.063 align:middle line:84%
They felt this
overwhelming sadness,

00:09:44.063 --> 00:09:45.480 align:middle line:84%
and they both fell
to their knees,

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.490 align:middle line:84%
and they were praying
in the waiting room.

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And my stepdad came back in with
that candy bar, made a joke,

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:52.650 align:middle line:84%
and split his candy
bar with everyone,

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:54.130 align:middle line:90%
because it was a long surgery.

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:57.810 align:middle line:84%
So I told her, "You actually did
know the moment that I did die,

00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:59.610 align:middle line:90%
and you felt it psychically."

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:02.815 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What got
you to come back?

00:10:02.815 --> 00:10:06.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: I saw my
grandfather on the other side,

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:07.810 align:middle line:90%
in that heavenly realm.

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:10.360 align:middle line:84%
He was very loving,
very peaceful.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And then I had the
opportunity to go closer

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.230 align:middle line:90%
to that light of God.

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:17.120 align:middle line:90%
I did not get to choose.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.060 align:middle line:90%
I was told to come back.

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:20.830 align:middle line:90%
So at some point, I was stopped.

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:24.310 align:middle line:84%
I was merging with
this unconditional love

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:26.450 align:middle line:84%
that I had never
experienced before.

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:29.800 align:middle line:84%
It was the most profound
love imaginable.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.960 align:middle line:90%
Every wound felt healed.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:35.140 align:middle line:84%
Everything within
me felt so joyful,

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.930 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to keep
merging with that love.

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And then I was
stopped, and I was

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:41.800 align:middle line:90%
told, "No, you have a mission.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:42.610 align:middle line:90%
Look down."

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:44.410 align:middle line:90%
And I saw this river.

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:47.380 align:middle line:84%
In this river of light,
I saw different souls

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:51.040 align:middle line:84%
that had either their light
or their light was dimmed.

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And all I knew is
that there's love

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.570 align:middle line:84%
and there's fear, from
the soul perspective.

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:58.330 align:middle line:84%
And I was meant to
work with students

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:01.210 align:middle line:84%
and remind them to go in
the direction of their joy,

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:03.370 align:middle line:84%
go in the direction
of what they love,

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:06.520 align:middle line:84%
and add love to this world,
and let go of the pain

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.950 align:middle line:84%
that they may have
experienced in childhood

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:11.500 align:middle line:84%
or in various
situations in life.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And that would be my
mission, to teach.

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:19.575 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tricia, how close did
you come to witnessing God?

00:11:19.575 --> 00:11:21.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: In many traditions,
and it's certainly

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:26.400 align:middle line:84%
in the Christian tradition, it's
talked about as God as light.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.190 align:middle line:84%
What I experienced
was this light

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:32.520 align:middle line:84%
that was incredibly
healing and lifechanging

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:37.470 align:middle line:84%
So I felt that my soul was
almost back to infancy,

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:40.495 align:middle line:84%
if that makes sense, the purity
that we come into this world

00:11:40.495 --> 00:11:41.295 align:middle line:90%
with.

00:11:41.295 --> 00:11:41.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wholesomeness?

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:42.750 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: Yeah.

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:47.040 align:middle line:84%
Like, all of the pain,
the abuse, the drama,

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.310 align:middle line:84%
the negativity, the projection,
all of that was washed away

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:54.540 align:middle line:84%
and I was like this pure
infant in the presence of God.

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:57.120 align:middle line:84%
But I did retain some
of my consciousness

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.310 align:middle line:84%
because I was told
I would teach.

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:01.030 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Oh, no,
no, no, don't you

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:02.607 align:middle line:84%
know I was going
to be a lawyer?"

00:12:02.607 --> 00:12:03.690 align:middle line:90%
I was going to make money.

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:04.815 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was the plan?

00:12:04.815 --> 00:12:05.985 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: Yes.

00:12:05.985 --> 00:12:07.800 align:middle line:90%
And God kind of laughed at me.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:11.670 align:middle line:84%
I felt this booming
laughter when I argued

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:13.050 align:middle line:90%
with what my mission would be.

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:19.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The healing process for
a back is a very long process.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.090 align:middle line:84%
You're still
healing, aren't you?

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:24.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: I do take
good care of myself

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:28.270 align:middle line:84%
when I have to for maintenance,
to make it through this life.

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:29.145 align:middle line:90%
That type of injury--

00:12:29.145 --> 00:12:31.312 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've got a plate
in your back, don't you?

00:12:31.312 --> 00:12:33.600 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: I have very
large rods that attach.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.730 align:middle line:84%
In the '90s, they put the rods
above where you broke your back

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:37.530 align:middle line:90%
and below it.

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:39.202 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
by your spinal cord?

00:12:39.202 --> 00:12:40.744 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: Mhm, they
kind of surround.

00:12:40.744 --> 00:12:42.165 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How long are they?

00:12:42.165 --> 00:12:43.800 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: Over 6 inches.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.975 align:middle line:84%
So there's certain
yoga moves I can't do.

00:12:45.975 --> 00:12:47.535 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How many are in here?

00:12:47.535 --> 00:12:48.870 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: Two rods.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:49.795 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My God.

00:12:49.795 --> 00:12:50.595 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: Yes.

00:12:50.595 --> 00:12:51.615 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: About that long?

00:12:51.615 --> 00:12:52.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: Yeah.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.747 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Running up
and down your spine?

00:12:53.747 --> 00:12:55.530 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: Yes, yes.

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:57.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you feel
it when you bend over?

00:12:57.690 --> 00:12:58.740 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: Yeah.

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:00.480 align:middle line:84%
There's certain
movements I can't.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.397 align:middle line:90%
I can't touch my toes.

00:13:01.397 --> 00:13:03.345 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you let off
an airport detector?

00:13:03.345 --> 00:13:04.210 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: I do.

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:05.010 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:07.290 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes I have
to stand in that line

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:09.300 align:middle line:84%
with people who have
plates in their heads, who

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:10.220 align:middle line:90%
have all kind of--

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:12.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have to give
them a document or something?

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:14.370 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: They understand.

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:17.625 align:middle line:84%
But, yes, I do have pictures
on my phone of the MRI.

00:13:17.625 --> 00:13:19.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How are
you feeling now?

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: I work
with meditation.

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:26.070 align:middle line:84%
I work with my Angels
to basically help

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:27.210 align:middle line:90%
me deal with pain.

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:29.100 align:middle line:90%
And I take no pain medicine.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:33.570 align:middle line:84%
I believe in, for the most
part, just using consciousness,

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:34.560 align:middle line:90%
movement.

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And really, if I'm here, I
have a mission to spread love,

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.880 align:middle line:90%
and so I will be supported.

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And when it's my time to
go, it's my time to go.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.620 align:middle line:84%
I think near-death
experiences souls

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:46.470 align:middle line:84%
are totally at ease
with the dying process

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:47.325 align:middle line:90%
whenever it occurs.

00:13:47.325 --> 00:13:50.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is life
like for you now?

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:53.650 align:middle line:84%
Now that you've come back,
what have you experienced?

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:56.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, can you smell the
flowers a little better

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:58.170 align:middle line:90%
than you used to?

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: The first year after
the near-death experience,

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:04.920 align:middle line:84%
I was in love with
plants, animals, people.

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:08.490 align:middle line:84%
I just felt this oneness, this
consciousness that blended

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:09.600 align:middle line:90%
literally with everyone.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.690 align:middle line:84%
I had many psychic
flashes, many just

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:15.120 align:middle line:90%
moments of deep understanding.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.570 align:middle line:84%
I mainly channeled that
into my teaching profession,

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:20.880 align:middle line:84%
and that's what
I still do today.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.790 align:middle line:84%
But my mission has
expanded in the sense

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:27.240 align:middle line:84%
that I talk to people
beyond traditional academia.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And when my father died, my
mediumship abilities opened up,

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:34.980 align:middle line:84%
and I followed him
into the afterlife.

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:36.471 align:middle line:84%
And now I do some
medium readings

00:14:36.471 --> 00:14:37.638 align:middle line:90%
and some intuitive readings.

00:14:37.638 --> 00:14:39.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, good for you.

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:43.320 align:middle line:84%
What would you say is the most
dramatic change in your life

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.330 align:middle line:90%
since the NDE?

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:47.940 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: Absolute joy.

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm ecstatic about being here.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.830 align:middle line:84%
I think before that
near-death experience,

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:57.180 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't as ecstatic and
in love with being here

00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:59.730 align:middle line:90%
but also with this other side.

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:03.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I felt like my
consciousness was very much

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:05.530 align:middle line:84%
contained in my body before
that near-death experience.

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:06.330 align:middle line:90%
Now it's--

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:07.622 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Blossomed out, has it?

00:15:07.622 --> 00:15:08.430 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: Yeah.

00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:10.440 align:middle line:84%
It's hard not to blend
with other people.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.555 align:middle line:84%
It's hard not to want to
help people like that.

00:15:12.555 --> 00:15:15.540 align:middle line:84%
That empathy was
initially very deep.

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And then these
gifts were something

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.910 align:middle line:84%
that I was initially
only using with students.

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:23.550 align:middle line:90%
I never charged for this.

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:25.870 align:middle line:84%
But people found
out about my story.

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And I see that it
can really help,

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:31.390 align:middle line:84%
that grief is an intense
process for people.

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And when they're able to
connect with their loved ones,

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:37.470 align:middle line:84%
get verification, feel more
peace, feel that connection,

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:38.675 align:middle line:90%
it's healing for them.

00:15:38.675 --> 00:15:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tricia, let's go
back to Raymond Moody who

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.680 align:middle line:84%
talks about, as you
have just mentioned,

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.375 align:middle line:84%
some of the after-effects
of a near-death experience.

00:15:46.375 --> 00:15:47.175 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:15:47.175 --> 00:15:50.730 align:middle line:10%
- Near-death experiences
affect people very profoundly,

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:54.920 align:middle line:10%
and they have certain kinds
of predictable effects.

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:58.980 align:middle line:84%
The most dramatic
one is that whatever

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:00.750 align:middle line:90%
they are chasing in life--

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:03.750 align:middle line:84%
and I have spent my
life chasing knowledge.

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:07.170 align:middle line:84%
Some people spend their life
chasing power or money or fame

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:09.400 align:middle line:90%
or any of these other things.

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.940 align:middle line:84%
--but it's striking
to me that whatever

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:15.180 align:middle line:84%
they have been chasing in
life, when people come back

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:19.080 align:middle line:84%
from this experience, they say
that what this is all about

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:22.420 align:middle line:90%
is learning to love.

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And they say that is what comes
forward in your life review.

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:31.170 align:middle line:84%
Now I also immediately
want to say

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:36.520 align:middle line:84%
that they say also that it
doesn't make that any easier.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.990 align:middle line:84%
My friend George Ritchie,
the first living person

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:46.140 align:middle line:84%
I ever knew who had had this
experience, said, "Raymond,

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:49.680 align:middle line:84%
this experience makes
your humanity even more

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.570 align:middle line:90%
of a burden in a way.

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:56.040 align:middle line:10%
And to translate George's
words into my vernacular

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.410 align:middle line:10%
because I've heard this
from a lot of people,

00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:00.900 align:middle line:10%
what he was saying
is let's face it.

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:04.349 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult to get
through the average day

00:17:04.349 --> 00:17:09.180 align:middle line:84%
without wanting to choke
at least one other person,

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:12.540 align:middle line:90%
and that reality stays the same.

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:16.349 align:middle line:84%
So they come back realizing
the importance of the quest

00:17:16.349 --> 00:17:19.050 align:middle line:84%
to learn to love, and
yet still find themselves

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:20.410 align:middle line:90%
in a human situation.

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:23.130 align:middle line:90%
So that's one after-effect.

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:25.530 align:middle line:84%
The other after-effect
is people say that it

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:27.790 align:middle line:90%
eliminates the fear of death.

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:31.950 align:middle line:84%
Not that they would want to die
in a painful or unpleasant way,

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:36.840 align:middle line:84%
but from their experience, they
interpret death as a transition

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:41.340 align:middle line:84%
into some other and more
desirable realm of existence.

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:42.798 align:middle line:84%
So they have no
more fear of death.

00:17:42.798 --> 00:17:43.598 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:17:43.598 --> 00:17:45.375 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
afraid of dying again?

00:17:45.375 --> 00:17:46.810 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: Not at all.

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:47.940 align:middle line:90%
In fact, I've been tested.

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:49.830 align:middle line:84%
I was in a plane
that was going down,

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:52.110 align:middle line:84%
and we had to make
an emergency landing.

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:55.410 align:middle line:84%
And everyone around me
was screaming and crying.

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:56.925 align:middle line:90%
We were in crash position.

00:17:56.925 --> 00:17:58.800 align:middle line:84%
I grabbed the hands of
the people next to me,

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.440 align:middle line:84%
and I said, "Our souls
will leave our bodies.

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.030 align:middle line:90%
We will not feel this pain.

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:04.890 align:middle line:84%
We'll immediately
be in the light.

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:06.000 align:middle line:90%
Have no fear.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:06.966 align:middle line:90%
Meditate on God."

00:18:06.966 --> 00:18:08.091 align:middle line:90%
And I was just ready to go.

00:18:08.091 --> 00:18:09.045 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they
hold your hand?

00:18:09.045 --> 00:18:09.690 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: They did.

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:10.490 align:middle line:90%
They were crying.

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And one guy next to me
was saying, "I have kids."

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.910 align:middle line:84%
I was like, "You'll
meet them again.

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:16.170 align:middle line:90%
It will be fine."

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:17.315 align:middle line:90%
I was just at peace.

00:18:17.315 --> 00:18:18.940 align:middle line:84%
I thought, "Oh, this
is a little early.

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:19.830 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think I
would be dying."

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:21.382 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you're not
afraid of dying again?

00:18:21.382 --> 00:18:21.667 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: No.

00:18:21.667 --> 00:18:23.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you're in
no rush to get there?

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:24.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: No.

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:25.590 align:middle line:90%
No one likes physical pain.

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And to that first
part of his question,

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:31.800 align:middle line:84%
there are great difficulties
in the average day

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.000 align:middle line:90%
and in the average life.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.730 align:middle line:84%
And I think that spiritual
perspective, though,

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:38.070 align:middle line:90%
does add a little levity to it.

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:40.800 align:middle line:84%
You can choose the lighter
side of the darker things

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.700 align:middle line:90%
that we have to traverse here.

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And so I do find value
in having that one

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:47.617 align:middle line:90%
foot in the spiritual realm.

00:18:47.617 --> 00:18:49.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've always
wondered, Tricia,

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.660 align:middle line:84%
what it's like for
someone who dies,

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:55.390 align:middle line:84%
what they experience
instantly when that happens,

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:59.040 align:middle line:84%
when they are no longer
alive in their physical body.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.930 align:middle line:90%
What's that transition like?

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:03.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do they
realize, "I've died,"

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:05.685 align:middle line:90%
or something that's happened?

00:19:05.685 --> 00:19:07.590 align:middle line:10%
>>BARKER: There's
only in a few cases

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:10.440 align:middle line:10%
a trauma loop I've heard about
where people don't understand

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.530 align:middle line:10%
what's happened, but most
people feel enormous peace.

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:17.045 align:middle line:84%
They're met by people they
know over there who love them.

00:19:17.045 --> 00:19:18.510 align:middle line:90%
They're met by light beings.

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:22.260 align:middle line:84%
They're met with a consciousness
that gives them great peace.

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:25.030 align:middle line:84%
So when we're in
the body, of course,

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:27.030 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have fear
about losing this body.

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:30.760 align:middle line:84%
The minute we're out of this
body, we don't care anymore.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.140 align:middle line:90%
We're not attached to it.

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And that detachment,
that detached state,

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:39.300 align:middle line:84%
is amazing because you
realize, oh, I do go on.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:43.560 align:middle line:84%
There is something larger
than this consciousness

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:44.758 align:middle line:90%
that I contain right now.

00:19:44.758 --> 00:19:46.050 align:middle line:90%
There's something that goes on.

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:47.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
your family react

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:50.880 align:middle line:84%
to your near-death
experience, Tricia?

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.590 align:middle line:90%
Were they supportive?

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:56.160 align:middle line:84%
Did they think you
are part of the devil?

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.630 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what happened?

00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:59.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: At first,
they were supportive.

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:01.590 align:middle line:90%
My father was supportive.

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:04.560 align:middle line:84%
My mother was at first,
but her minister, she

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:07.770 align:middle line:84%
is an evangelical
Christian, and her minister

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:09.450 align:middle line:90%
feared near-death experiences.

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:12.430 align:middle line:84%
He gave her a pamphlet that
said that they're of the devil,

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:12.570 align:middle line:90%
and people--

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:13.445 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my gosh.

00:20:13.445 --> 00:20:16.050 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: --often get
divorced or commit suicide

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:17.423 align:middle line:90%
after near-death experiences.

00:20:17.423 --> 00:20:18.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He didn't
get it, did he?

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:19.640 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: No.

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Mom, even this
pamphlet reeks of fear."

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:24.870 align:middle line:84%
I said I can touch it,
and I can feel the fear.

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
there's only love

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.860 align:middle line:90%
and there's only fear here.

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And what I know is that
I'm a better person.

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:34.170 align:middle line:84%
because of this experience,
and I hope you see that.

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:36.660 align:middle line:84%
I hope you see that I'm
driven to help humanity.

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:38.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm driven to help people heal.

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:40.290 align:middle line:90%
That's my motivation.

00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:43.200 align:middle line:84%
Before this experience,
my motivation

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.270 align:middle line:84%
was how to make Tricia
rich, how to make

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:49.710 align:middle line:84%
Tricia look good throughout life
and heal everything within her.

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:53.200 align:middle line:84%
Now I flipped to how do I
help other people succeed?

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.600 align:middle line:90%
how do I help them shine?

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And through that, I feel the
light working through me.

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's a huge
change within an individual.

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:05.070 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, there
are people who fear

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:08.950 align:middle line:84%
that the devil creates some
sort of light and tricks people.

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And I want to say
to everyone who

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:14.840 align:middle line:84%
believes that give near-death
experiencers a chance.

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:19.245 align:middle line:84%
Our souls know the difference
between fakeness and truth

00:21:19.245 --> 00:21:20.045 align:middle line:90%
in that realm.

00:21:20.045 --> 00:21:24.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you on a
mission to educate, to teach?

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:29.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: I am, but my mission
is more around healing now.

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:32.200 align:middle line:84%
I think the more
we let go of pain

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.510 align:middle line:84%
and we connect to that
unconditional love,

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:36.520 align:middle line:84%
the more we live our
lives more joyfully.

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you tapping
into your soul to do that?

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:43.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: I'm tapping
into angelic information.

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:45.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm tapping into
energy that is simply

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:48.880 align:middle line:84%
here and available on
the planet right now,

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:52.720 align:middle line:84%
that people are
awakening at great rates

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:55.600 align:middle line:84%
in the last few years,
which is amazing.

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:57.790 align:middle line:84%
That there's more of a
language in younger people,

00:21:57.790 --> 00:22:00.415 align:middle line:84%
I'm noticing this at the
colleges, for spirituality.

00:22:00.415 --> 00:22:02.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
witnessed miracles

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.900 align:middle line:84%
since all this has
happened to you?

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:10.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: Yes, I've witnessed
many different life changes

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:13.600 align:middle line:84%
in students that I've worked
with where their paths have

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.520 align:middle line:90%
altered in one lecture.

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:18.280 align:middle line:84%
I felt the other side
talk through me, move

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:19.870 align:middle line:90%
through me, channeling perhaps.

00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:22.120 align:middle line:84%
And I don't even know
what I'm saying sometimes,

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:22.684 align:middle line:90%
but students after a lecture--

00:22:22.684 --> 00:22:24.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you aware of it?

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:27.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: Yeah, sometimes
I'm aware that there's

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:29.470 align:middle line:84%
this energy that's
moving through me.

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:31.960 align:middle line:84%
And one student in
particular came up,

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.540 align:middle line:84%
hugged me after a
lecture, and said, "I'm

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:36.040 align:middle line:90%
going to join the Peace Corps.

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:39.490 align:middle line:84%
I just felt that something
you said in lecture today

00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:41.027 align:middle line:90%
prompted me to do this."

00:22:41.027 --> 00:22:42.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you
recommend everybody

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:44.568 align:middle line:84%
go through an experience
that you went through?

00:22:44.568 --> 00:22:45.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: No.

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:46.825 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I didn't think so.

00:22:46.825 --> 00:22:48.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: Awaken
much more gently.

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:51.130 align:middle line:84%
I think meditation
can awaken you.

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:53.470 align:middle line:84%
I sometimes joke that
near-death experiencers

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:56.260 align:middle line:84%
are dramatic people
and stubborn people

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:58.660 align:middle line:84%
because we have
some big lessons.

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:02.350 align:middle line:84%
But we also bring back gifts
of how to heal the body too

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:05.380 align:middle line:84%
because that spirit
world does participate

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:07.220 align:middle line:90%
with the healing of the body.

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:11.470 align:middle line:84%
So I would recommend that people
meditate, that they open to it,

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:15.340 align:middle line:84%
ask for it, practice
with lucid dreaming.

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:19.090 align:middle line:84%
Find a simple way to simply
open to that knowledge

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:20.965 align:middle line:90%
and open to that intuition.

00:23:20.965 --> 00:23:23.566 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How has
this changed you?

00:23:23.566 --> 00:23:27.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: It's changed me
in so many different ways.

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:30.290 align:middle line:84%
But like Raymond Moody
said, one of the main ones

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:32.600 align:middle line:84%
is this absolute
acceptance of death.

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:35.340 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of times life
is like a grieving process.

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:37.715 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You would not have
accepted death prior to this?

00:23:37.715 --> 00:23:39.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: I think I would have
been on the same trajectory

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:40.820 align:middle line:90%
most people are.

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And when you're young,
you're in denial.

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:45.800 align:middle line:84%
You kind of get depressed
about it at some point

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:45.875 align:middle line:90%
and then you accept it.

00:23:45.875 --> 00:23:47.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or you don't
even think about it.

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:48.160 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: Yeah.

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And I just went
straight from denial

00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:54.050 align:middle line:84%
to acceptance, just
absolute acceptance.

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:55.080 align:middle line:90%
We all die.

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:56.370 align:middle line:90%
How can we be joyful?

00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:59.630 align:middle line:84%
How can we experience more
bliss here in this moment?

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And how can we live good
lives, do no harm to anyone?

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:05.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now you're
working with students

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:08.220 align:middle line:84%
since this near-death
experience.

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:10.610 align:middle line:84%
How have you given
them the ability

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:12.380 align:middle line:84%
to see what their
purpose in life

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:14.450 align:middle line:90%
is through your experience?

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:17.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: One student in
particular comes to mind.

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:21.620 align:middle line:84%
She lost her father, and
he came to me in spirit.

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Ask her if she's
open to receiving a message

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:26.660 align:middle line:90%
from you after class."

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And so I asked her
directly if she

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.940 align:middle line:84%
would mind if I gave her
a message from her dad.

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.100 align:middle line:84%
And her dad said, "Don't
take this personally,

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:37.050 align:middle line:84%
but academia is not where
she needs to be right now.

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:40.050 align:middle line:84%
She has a different dream,
and she needs to follow that."

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, "Do you have a
dream outside of academics?"

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And she said, "I'm
an amazing chef.

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:48.957 align:middle line:84%
I want to open a food truck,
and I want to do this."

00:24:48.957 --> 00:24:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "You're
meant to do this."

00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:51.998 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dad said
go for it, right?

00:24:51.998 --> 00:24:53.480 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: Yes, dad said do it.

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And she just burst
into a great smile,

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:59.570 align:middle line:84%
said, "I totally believe this,"
and ran out the door, drop

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:01.177 align:middle line:90%
classes and followed her dream.

00:25:01.177 --> 00:25:02.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And she's doing it now?

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:03.405 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: Yes, yes.

00:25:03.405 --> 00:25:04.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fantastic.

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:06.620 align:middle line:84%
On Gaia's "Open
Minds," Jean Slatter

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:10.790 align:middle line:84%
discusses four questions
that we can ask ourselves

00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:11.760 align:middle line:90%
about life's purpose.

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:12.560 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:16.250 align:middle line:84%
- Well, it all gets down to
asking the right question.

00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:17.260 align:middle line:90%
- Right.

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:18.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:21.800 align:middle line:84%
- Because I always
say, don't just

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:23.520 align:middle line:84%
stop at the most
obvious questions.

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:24.320 align:middle line:90%
Go deeper.

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.120 align:middle line:90%
Go deeper.

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:26.210 align:middle line:90%
Go deeper.

00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:30.530 align:middle line:84%
As you go deeper, you may get
the fullness of the picture

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:32.698 align:middle line:84%
and it's like little
pieces of the puzzle

00:25:32.698 --> 00:25:34.740 align:middle line:84%
that you're trying to
understand about your life.

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:36.860 align:middle line:84%
So the most important
thing is for you

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:40.340 align:middle line:84%
to remember that who you are
is a spiritual being having

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:42.420 align:middle line:90%
this human experience.

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:45.950 align:middle line:10%
So as a spiritual being,
it's understanding

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:48.320 align:middle line:10%
that you are a
creator of experience

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:54.050 align:middle line:10%
and you have in mind
certain experiences you want

00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:58.070 align:middle line:10%
to receive from
your life in order

00:25:58.070 --> 00:26:00.350 align:middle line:10%
to know the truth of something.

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:02.810 align:middle line:84%
For an example, before
your soul incarnated,

00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:04.430 align:middle line:84%
your soul might
have said, we want

00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:08.018 align:middle line:84%
you to really understand what
it's like to rescue yourself.

00:26:08.018 --> 00:26:09.560 align:middle line:84%
We want you to really
understand what

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.220 align:middle line:90%
it's like to love yourself.

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:14.390 align:middle line:84%
We want you to really
understand and experience

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:16.580 align:middle line:84%
what it's like to
love someone else.

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:19.040 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is that
your soul decided

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:21.380 align:middle line:84%
to experience when
it came here, it

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:25.170 align:middle line:84%
began to create experiences
that would support that.

00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:29.840 align:middle line:84%
So all of your life experience
is going to be molded

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:33.114 align:middle line:84%
into getting what it is your
soul desire to know that you

00:26:33.114 --> 00:26:33.914 align:middle line:90%
haven't.

00:26:33.914 --> 00:26:36.710 align:middle line:84%
- Which doesn't have anything
to do with your conscious mind's

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:36.980 align:middle line:90%
desire?

00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:38.050 align:middle line:90%
- No, no.

00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:40.755 align:middle line:84%
- You can be at counter
purposes in an entire lifetime?

00:26:40.755 --> 00:26:41.555 align:middle line:90%
- Right.

00:26:41.555 --> 00:26:43.790 align:middle line:84%
- And I hear that, even
when people are of age where

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:46.250 align:middle line:84%
they retire saying,
"I just haven't gotten

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:48.980 align:middle line:84%
to what it is I think I
want to do yet or the thing

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:50.255 align:middle line:90%
I think I'm here for yet."

00:26:50.255 --> 00:26:51.170 align:middle line:90%
- Right.

00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:54.600 align:middle line:84%
So there's different aspects
of when we ask ourselves,

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.330 align:middle line:90%
what's our purpose?

00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:58.395 align:middle line:84%
We're asking four
main questions really.

00:26:58.395 --> 00:26:59.195 align:middle line:90%
- Right, right.

00:26:59.195 --> 00:27:03.750 align:middle line:84%
- We're asking, what is it
that I want to know of myself?

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:06.430 align:middle line:84%
What is it that I want
to experience and express

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:07.230 align:middle line:90%
of myself?

00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:09.443 align:middle line:84%
What is it that I want
to do for a vocation?

00:27:09.443 --> 00:27:10.610 align:middle line:90%
That's only one of the four.

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And what is it my soul
desires above all else?

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:16.577 align:middle line:84%
So when we're asking that
question, what's my purpose,

00:27:16.577 --> 00:27:18.410 align:middle line:84%
and what is it I'm here
to do, and all that,

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:20.090 align:middle line:84%
we don't realize it,
but we're actually

00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:22.230 align:middle line:84%
asking four different
distinct questions.

00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:23.030 align:middle line:90%
- Absolutely.

00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:23.830 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:25.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She's got
a good handle on it.

00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:26.660 align:middle line:90%
You agree with her?

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:27.475 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: I do.

00:27:27.475 --> 00:27:28.430 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And I had an easy
go of it because I

00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:35.210 align:middle line:84%
was given a direct mission
for so long from creator.

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:37.040 align:middle line:84%
I was given this
mission to teach

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:40.700 align:middle line:84%
and that made the
process easy because I

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:42.650 align:middle line:84%
knew that as I was
helping others,

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:47.390 align:middle line:84%
I was channeling that light
that ended, though, for me.

00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:50.240 align:middle line:84%
I felt this booming voice
about five years ago,

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:52.280 align:middle line:84%
saying your mission is
complete, and I kind of

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:56.305 align:middle line:84%
laughed and thought, "Oh,
let's do a transition now?

00:27:56.305 --> 00:27:57.660 align:middle line:90%
Is this ending?"

00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And what I realized is that I
was in that place of freedom,

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:04.550 align:middle line:84%
that I understood that service
to humanity in some form,

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:08.960 align:middle line:84%
you know, using our gifts in
some way is helping humanity.

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:12.755 align:middle line:84%
So I've been opened up to
possibilities beyond teaching.

00:28:12.755 --> 00:28:16.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your book,
"Angels in the OR,"

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:18.350 align:middle line:84%
tell me a little bit
about that cover.

00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:19.730 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating.

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:22.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: That's what it
looked like looking down

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:24.600 align:middle line:90%
on the heads of the surgeons.

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.680 align:middle line:90%
I remembered that perspective.

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:29.730 align:middle line:84%
And then that light
from the light beings,

00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:33.780 align:middle line:84%
the Angels, when it went into
my body, it was information

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:35.040 align:middle line:90%
and it was also light.

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:38.380 align:middle line:84%
So it was communicating a
lot of things at one time.

00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:40.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's really one
of the first impressions

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.660 align:middle line:90%
I had outside of body.

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And as an agnostic, I was
so happy to see that scene,

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:46.920 align:middle line:90%
I have to tell you.

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:47.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a great cover.

00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:48.785 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: Thank you.

00:28:48.785 --> 00:28:49.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great cover.

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:50.737 align:middle line:84%
What was the mission
that you were

00:28:50.737 --> 00:28:52.305 align:middle line:90%
trying to portray to people?

00:28:52.305 --> 00:28:54.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: The
mission is whatever

00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:57.150 align:middle line:84%
it is that you are
encountering, there's

00:28:57.150 --> 00:28:59.620 align:middle line:84%
always healing that can
be brought to a situation,

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:01.170 align:middle line:90%
even if it's tough.

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:03.900 align:middle line:84%
In a school district
where one in five students

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:05.850 align:middle line:84%
are dealing with
some sort of abuse,

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:09.270 align:middle line:84%
what is the light that you can
bring to those students who

00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:12.630 align:middle line:84%
have emotional problems, who
have difficult home lives, who

00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:15.690 align:middle line:84%
have challenges that are hard
to wrap your head around?

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:17.640 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's just kindness.

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:21.030 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's just a
moment of belief in someone.

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:24.870 align:middle line:84%
Love expressed as a form
of service to humanity

00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:27.030 align:middle line:84%
can alter someone's
path, and we don't even

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:29.160 align:middle line:90%
know that we altered their path.

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:31.440 align:middle line:84%
That's what a lot of
near-death experiencers see.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.930 align:middle line:84%
It's these small
moments of kindness

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:37.350 align:middle line:84%
that prevent suicide
sometimes, that really

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:38.915 align:middle line:90%
alter people's existence.

00:29:38.915 --> 00:29:42.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tricia, why does it
take a near-death experience

00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:43.590 align:middle line:90%
to get to this point?

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:46.500 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: Ego.

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:50.500 align:middle line:84%
We're so ego-driven, I
think, here in this world.

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:52.860 align:middle line:84%
And the minute
you die to it, you

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:56.790 align:middle line:84%
die to this vehicle that's
transporting you through life,

00:29:56.790 --> 00:30:01.770 align:middle line:84%
then you realize that, oh,
that was a selfish desire.

00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:04.200 align:middle line:84%
It's OK to express
my personal joy.

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:08.920 align:middle line:84%
But how do I do this in a way
that works with the lighter

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:09.720 align:middle line:90%
side of things.

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:13.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you say
your mission is complete?

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:16.207 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: I would
die happy today.

00:30:16.207 --> 00:30:17.290 align:middle line:90%
I would feel like I made--

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:18.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Don't die.

00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:18.930 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: No.

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:19.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Don't die.

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:23.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: I would feel like I
made enough of a contribution

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:25.360 align:middle line:84%
through teaching and
through writing this book,

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:29.770 align:middle line:84%
but I feel that there's a lot
that the world is going through

00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:33.520 align:middle line:84%
and that people who are
spiritual can still be--

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:36.940 align:middle line:84%
we still can show the way,
shine the light on ways

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:39.055 align:middle line:84%
to bring humanity together
in different ways.

00:30:39.055 --> 00:30:42.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you tell
people you have an NDE,

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:44.832 align:middle line:90%
do they get it?

00:30:44.832 --> 00:30:49.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: Many people
do, and it is exciting.

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:51.210 align:middle line:84%
In random crowds,
say, I'm at a party,

00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:54.300 align:middle line:84%
and someone asks me about
the near-death experience.

00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:56.850 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly everyone looks
like a child to me.

00:30:56.850 --> 00:30:57.930 align:middle line:90%
They're curious.

00:30:57.930 --> 00:30:58.115 align:middle line:90%
They want to know more.

00:30:58.115 --> 00:31:00.282 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they know what
you went through, mostly?

00:31:00.282 --> 00:31:01.980 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: They want to know.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.760 align:middle line:90%
People are curious in general.

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:05.660 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's a story
that helps people.

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:07.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, do they
whisper in the corner,

00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:10.680 align:middle line:90%
"That's the one who died."?

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:13.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: Most people are
extroverted enough just to ask

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:14.815 align:middle line:90%
their questions, I think.

00:31:14.815 --> 00:31:15.615 align:middle line:90%
But maybe.

00:31:15.615 --> 00:31:18.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
know about your book?

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:21.420 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: I have students
who've read my book

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:23.410 align:middle line:90%
and asked me questions.

00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:26.200 align:middle line:84%
I do connect with people
who have read the book.

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.850 align:middle line:90%
So it's always fun.

00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:30.400 align:middle line:84%
We always grow and evolve
in a chain and change.

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.220 align:middle line:84%
So even after
writing the book, I

00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:35.850 align:middle line:84%
have continued to grow, release
more, connect to more light.

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:38.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's always an
evolution process.

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:39.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are your
psychic abilities

00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:42.585 align:middle line:90%
enhanced because of the NDE?

00:31:42.585 --> 00:31:43.800 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: Definitely.

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:47.430 align:middle line:84%
So I felt like I was outside
of time that first year

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:49.753 align:middle line:84%
and that was a
little disorienting.

00:31:49.753 --> 00:31:52.170 align:middle line:84%
I would know what was going
to happen 10 minutes before it

00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:53.340 align:middle line:90%
happened at times.

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And there were just
jumps and consciousness.

00:31:56.930 --> 00:32:00.680 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, I asked that
if I was given information,

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:02.420 align:middle line:84%
that it'd just be
given to me in a dream

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:04.760 align:middle line:84%
to prepare me the next
day or just in the moment

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:06.470 align:middle line:84%
that I needed it
working with the student

00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:08.630 align:middle line:84%
or talking with someone
who's cutting my hair

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:10.700 align:middle line:84%
or just someone
might need a message,

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:13.377 align:middle line:84%
that I asked that it not be
overwhelming because at first,

00:32:13.377 --> 00:32:14.210 align:middle line:90%
it was overwhelming.

00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:17.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do people believe
when you tell them you died?

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:21.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: My agnostic
friends, it took so long.

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.600 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until
I wrote this book

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:26.500 align:middle line:84%
that one of my agnostic
friends, she always said--

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:27.500 align:middle line:90%
this is how she puts it.

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:29.060 align:middle line:84%
She said, "I believe
that you believe

00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:30.440 align:middle line:90%
you had that experience."

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:31.716 align:middle line:90%
And that's her literal mind.

00:32:31.716 --> 00:32:33.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So do the
doctors, don't they?

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:35.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: Yeah,
the doctors tried

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:38.180 align:middle line:84%
to shut me down from
talking about it too much,

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:39.550 align:middle line:90%
and I can intuitively see.

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:40.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It scares them.

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: They did not
want to go down that path.

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:47.030 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, the agnostic
friends that read my book

00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:48.830 align:middle line:84%
said they have
contemplated death

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:50.330 align:middle line:84%
and they've
contemplated what it's

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:54.395 align:middle line:84%
like when they die a little
bit more because of knowing me.

00:32:54.395 --> 00:32:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, do you
remember and recollect things

00:32:57.050 --> 00:32:58.700 align:middle line:84%
that they were talking
about while they

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:02.270 align:middle line:84%
were performing the surgery
on you, trying to save you?

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:05.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: I remember that
there was an Elvis song playing

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:07.100 align:middle line:90%
on the Easy Listening station.

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:09.770 align:middle line:84%
I've never been able
to verify that or find

00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:12.260 align:middle line:84%
what was on the
radio at that time,

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:16.280 align:middle line:84%
but I know they had on Easy
Listening music or a CD that

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:17.405 align:middle line:90%
was kind of Easy Listening.

00:33:17.405 --> 00:33:20.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm going to guess
what the Elvis song was.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.810 align:middle line:84%
If I'm right, maybe
I had an NDE too.

00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:29.905 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: Yes.

00:33:29.905 --> 00:33:30.815 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a classic.

00:33:30.815 --> 00:33:31.415 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: Yes.

00:33:31.415 --> 00:33:32.735 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But you remember that?

00:33:32.735 --> 00:33:33.650 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: Yeah.

00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And I just remember thinking
he's a good musician.

00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:39.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
hear that song today,

00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:41.260 align:middle line:90%
what does that do for you?

00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:45.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: It transports me
into two different locations.

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:49.490 align:middle line:84%
It's like I'm outside of body,
hearing that, seeing that room,

00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:52.730 align:middle line:84%
and just remembering that
this really happened and this

00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:55.880 align:middle line:84%
changed my-- it was
such a massive turning

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:58.940 align:middle line:84%
point and physically
painful, to be honest.

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:03.080 align:middle line:84%
After the surgery, there was
a lot of pain within my body.

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:08.449 align:middle line:84%
So it brings back some of
the trauma, some of the PTSD,

00:34:08.449 --> 00:34:10.445 align:middle line:84%
but it also brings
back that light.

00:34:10.445 --> 00:34:13.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dr. Lauren
Cielo is on the program

00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:17.090 align:middle line:84%
and talked with us about
psychic abilities that help you

00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:18.765 align:middle line:90%
see the larger picture of life.

00:34:18.765 --> 00:34:19.565 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:34:19.565 --> 00:34:22.520 align:middle line:10%
- I think that the great
thing about being clairvoyant

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:26.960 align:middle line:10%
is it takes your awareness
from the daily things that

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:30.080 align:middle line:10%
are going on and it
gives you a bigger,

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:32.659 align:middle line:10%
overarching understanding.

00:34:32.659 --> 00:34:33.989 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you a good example.

00:34:33.989 --> 00:34:38.570 align:middle line:84%
I do end of the year
readings, helping people

00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:40.830 align:middle line:84%
look at the energy
for the next year.

00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:44.300 align:middle line:84%
And so when our lives
changed so quickly

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:48.020 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning of 2020, I
went back to those readings

00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:51.170 align:middle line:84%
and I'm like, "So what
was I picking up?"

00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:54.052 align:middle line:84%
And I do remember a
very interesting energy

00:34:54.052 --> 00:34:55.760 align:middle line:84%
that kept showing up
on people's readings

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.230 align:middle line:90%
that I'd never seen before.

00:34:57.230 --> 00:35:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And it was a global
community healer,

00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:04.520 align:middle line:84%
that the people I
was reading would

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:07.130 align:middle line:84%
be needed, for some
reason, to heal

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:09.740 align:middle line:84%
their community or the
world, and I never saw that

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:10.850 align:middle line:90%
in those readings before.

00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:13.910 align:middle line:84%
They might do healings
with their family

00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:15.890 align:middle line:84%
or maybe a professional
healer but nothing

00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:18.330 align:middle line:90%
on a worldwide scale.

00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:20.120 align:middle line:84%
So when I went back
and looked, I'm like,

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:22.920 align:middle line:84%
"That's the shift that
we're living through."

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:26.480 align:middle line:84%
But the way I saw it wasn't
that something terrible

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.980 align:middle line:90%
is going to happen, no.

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:29.630 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
get a chance to be

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:32.730 align:middle line:90%
a healer to the entire planet.

00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:34.400 align:middle line:84%
So that's what
clairvoyance does.

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:37.010 align:middle line:84%
It might take the
nitty-gritty of the day

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:41.570 align:middle line:84%
but then puts it into a really
big tapestry that you can maybe

00:35:41.570 --> 00:35:44.250 align:middle line:84%
get a better understanding of
your role in what's coming up.

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:45.050 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:47.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know what's
amazing about people who have

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:48.860 align:middle line:90%
had near-death experiences?

00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:52.030 align:middle line:84%
They all seem to have
very similar occurrences,

00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:52.830 align:middle line:90%
don't they?

00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:54.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: They do.

00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:58.070 align:middle line:84%
Many people feel that
unconditional love and that

00:35:58.070 --> 00:36:00.590 align:middle line:84%
changes them forever,
and many people

00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:02.810 align:middle line:84%
feel a greater
connection to others,

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:05.570 align:middle line:84%
that we're a global community,
that we're connected

00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:07.220 align:middle line:90%
to one another somehow.

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:10.550 align:middle line:84%
I think I felt so contained
within my own body

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:12.890 align:middle line:84%
and my own consciousness
before that, then

00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:15.290 align:middle line:84%
I could hardly tell the
difference between where

00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:17.900 align:middle line:84%
I ended and others
begin right after it.

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:21.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I was in that
room coming out of surgery,

00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:24.380 align:middle line:84%
I felt I was a part of the
nurse handing me ice chips,

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:26.150 align:middle line:90%
I was a part of my surgeon.

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:28.820 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't push all
that consciousness back

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:30.240 align:middle line:90%
into this body.

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And so that is a
meditation that I think

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:39.530 align:middle line:84%
is worthy, that we lose a lot of
the pain in this existence when

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:42.465 align:middle line:84%
we remember compassion for
all, compassion for all living

00:36:42.465 --> 00:36:43.265 align:middle line:90%
beings.

00:36:43.265 --> 00:36:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does the NDE help
your physical healing process?

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:48.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: Oh, yes.

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:52.370 align:middle line:84%
I got out of body many times
so that I could avoid the pain.

00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:55.640 align:middle line:84%
So in those first four
months of bed rest and I

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:58.220 align:middle line:84%
was in a body cast and
learning to walk again,

00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:01.590 align:middle line:84%
at night if I couldn't sleep
because of the red, hot pain,

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:02.720 align:middle line:90%
I would meditate.

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.490 align:middle line:90%
I'd connect with those Angels.

00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:07.340 align:middle line:84%
I'd see them continuing
to work on my spine.

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:09.710 align:middle line:90%
I'd have lucid dreams.

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:12.860 align:middle line:84%
I'd circle around the world
and really just kind of get

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:14.240 align:middle line:90%
away from the physical pain.

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:16.700 align:middle line:84%
But I was told not
to take painkillers

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:18.710 align:middle line:84%
and to work through
it at my body's

00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:20.250 align:middle line:90%
natural rate of progression.

00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:23.210 align:middle line:84%
So I would push myself each
day to do more, but not

00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:25.745 align:middle line:84%
more than I could actually
handle without medication.

00:37:25.745 --> 00:37:27.175 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do you feel today?

00:37:27.175 --> 00:37:31.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: I had a
wonderful run without pain.

00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:34.760 align:middle line:84%
This happened in my
20s until my late 30s.

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And then I begin to
have to do yoga and go

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:41.210 align:middle line:84%
to chiropractors in order to
manage pain throughout life.

00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:43.550 align:middle line:84%
But for the most
part, I feel great.

00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:45.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
tell you what things

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:47.930 align:middle line:84%
will be like when
you're 60 or 70

00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:50.450 align:middle line:90%
in terms of the healing process?

00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:52.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: My late
30s, early 40s,

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:54.890 align:middle line:84%
they told me I had the
back of a 60-year-old.

00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:59.460 align:middle line:84%
And so as I age,
that is a concern.

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:02.000 align:middle line:84%
But what I've heard
from Angels' guides,

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000 align:middle line:84%
and people are going
to start bringing

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.890 align:middle line:84%
in so many more
healing modalities,

00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:10.110 align:middle line:84%
physically, emotionally, and in
so many ways in the next five

00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:10.910 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:15.200 align:middle line:84%
Kind of pertaining to that
video, that don't be concerned.

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:17.600 align:middle line:84%
So much healing is
coming to this planet

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:18.815 align:middle line:90%
in so many different ways.

00:38:18.815 --> 00:38:19.615 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:38:19.615 --> 00:38:21.740 align:middle line:90%
So are Angels watching over you?

00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:23.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: They're
watching over everyone.

00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:27.611 align:middle line:84%
I believe we each have Angels
and we can call on me--

00:38:27.611 --> 00:38:29.975 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No question,
guardians too.

00:38:29.975 --> 00:38:31.010 align:middle line:90%
>>BARKER: Yes.

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:34.010 align:middle line:84%
If you are afraid, call
on them for protection.

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:35.660 align:middle line:10%
If you're driving
through a storm,

00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:39.380 align:middle line:10%
if you are in need
of healing, ask

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:41.420 align:middle line:10%
them to participate
with your healing.

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I tell people
about healing is a lot of times

00:38:44.490 --> 00:38:45.290 align:middle line:90%
we're irritated.

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:47.390 align:middle line:84%
We break our foot, we're
irritated at that foot.

00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:48.480 align:middle line:90%
How could you break?

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:51.320 align:middle line:84%
Send it love, ask the Angels
to send it love and it

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:52.135 align:middle line:90%
will heal faster.

00:38:52.135 --> 00:38:54.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How can
people find you?

00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:57.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BARKER: Yeah, so I'm pretty
easy to find on YouTube.

00:38:57.110 --> 00:39:00.380 align:middle line:10%
If you type in Tricia Barker
NDE or Tricia Barker YouTube,

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:04.691 align:middle line:10%
you will find me and my
website, triciabarkernde.com.

00:39:04.691 --> 00:39:06.980 align:middle line:84%

being on "Beyond Belief."

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:08.510 align:middle line:84%

so much, George.

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:09.427 align:middle line:90%
You have a great show.

00:39:09.427 --> 00:39:12.740 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I'm in no rush to
have a near-death experience,

00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:16.770 align:middle line:10%
but if it ever happens, I
think I'll be ready now.

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:19.600 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
