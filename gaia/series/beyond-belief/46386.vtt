00:00:05.274 --> 00:00:07.440 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.820 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.445 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.445 --> 00:00:13.220 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.540 align:middle line:84%
>>It felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.550 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.255 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:26.915 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.915 --> 00:00:29.040 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And welcome
back to another edition

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.960 align:middle line:10%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.970 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.240 align:middle line:10%
And our very special
guest, Richard Dolan,

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.460 align:middle line:10%
author of a number
UFO-related books including

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.320 align:middle line:10%
the latest, "UFOs For
the 21st Century Mind."

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.640 align:middle line:10%
It's pretty fascinating
work, especially when

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.140 align:middle line:10%
you look at who is behind
this kind of investigation.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.820 align:middle line:10%
Richard, you've done it again.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.153 align:middle line:10%
>>RICHARD DOLAN: Thanks, George.

00:00:51.153 --> 00:00:54.110 align:middle line:90%
I loved writing that book.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.770 align:middle line:10%
Every book that I do is
a mini-adventure for me,

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.980 align:middle line:10%
and that was certainly
an adventure writing it.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.510 align:middle line:10%
It gave me a chance
to rethink this field

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.150 align:middle line:10%
in as fresh and
comprehensive way as I could.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.180 align:middle line:90%
And I just love doing it.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When I think back
at all the old UFO books

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.060 align:middle line:84%
I read as a kid-- you
know, Flying Saucers

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.100 align:middle line:84%
are Here, Frank Edwards's books,
Edward Ruppelt who headed up

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.240 align:middle line:84%
Project Blue Book at the time,
J. Allen Hyneck with his books,

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.560 align:middle line:84%
including "Close Encounters
of the Third Kind,"

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.720 align:middle line:90%
which was turned into a movie.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And then we have folks
like Richard Dolan,

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.950 align:middle line:84%
the new evolution
of UFO researchers

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.760 align:middle line:84%
that carry the gauntlet to
try to get these answers.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.800 align:middle line:84%
For so many years,
we have been trying

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.295 align:middle line:84%
to figure out what the
heck has been going on.

00:01:43.295 --> 00:01:45.510 align:middle line:90%
Are we any closer, Richard?

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.420 align:middle line:10%
>>DOLAN: Well, I think that
our knowledge of this topic

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.350 align:middle line:10%
does continue to evolve, yes.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.132 align:middle line:10%
I don't think it's
true that we're never

00:01:54.132 --> 00:01:55.090 align:middle line:10%
going to make progress.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.260 align:middle line:84%
I think that as
each decade goes by,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.900 align:middle line:84%
we learn a little
bit something new.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:59.860 align:middle line:90%
The plot thickens.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.620 align:middle line:84%
The subject goes
deeper and deeper.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.350 align:middle line:84%
Back in the '50s, with
researchers like Donald Kehoe

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.250 align:middle line:84%
and Edward Ruppelt
and a few others,

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.010 align:middle line:84%
it was all new to our
consciousness at that time.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And you've got these
ideas of beings

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.370 align:middle line:84%
from another planet in big
metallic spaceships coming

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.780 align:middle line:84%
to surveil Earth
and maybe they're

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.950 align:middle line:90%
going to make an announcement.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there just wasn't
a whole lot of information.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And there was not a lot
of knowledge, either,

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.085 align:middle line:84%
about worldwide
sightings, for example.

00:02:29.085 --> 00:02:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And it was very
little discussion

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.100 align:middle line:84%
about things like abductions
or apparent encounters

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.150 align:middle line:90%
with other beings.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.270 align:middle line:84%
So every decade that we
go deeper into this field,

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.940 align:middle line:84%
we pick up new, more
information, and more things

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.190 align:middle line:90%
to think about and to analyze.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.606 align:middle line:84%
So I think we're actually moved
quite along down the road.

00:02:46.606 --> 00:02:49.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Years ago, I
remember incredible cases

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.465 align:middle line:84%
of UFO sightings and
close encounters.

00:02:52.465 --> 00:02:55.699 align:middle line:84%
You know, Pascagoula,
Mississippi cases,

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:57.115 align:middle line:84%
where a couple of
guys are fishing

00:02:57.115 --> 00:02:59.520 align:middle line:90%
and they spot these things.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.640 align:middle line:84%
The New Mexico police
officer who has

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.990 align:middle line:84%
died, but that talked about
some incredible sightings.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.260 align:middle line:84%
We don't seem to be getting
those kinds of stories anymore.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.770 align:middle line:90%
Or am I missing something?

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well, we don't get
a lot of these high profile

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.760 align:middle line:90%
cases.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.560 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned the
Lonnie Zamora case.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.140 align:middle line:90%
That's the New Mexico case--

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The police officer.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:25.645 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: --from 1964.

00:03:25.645 --> 00:03:28.360 align:middle line:84%
He sees-- right--
these small beings

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.600 align:middle line:90%
and they take off in a craft.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.830 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.620 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
there are actually

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.640 align:middle line:84%
quite a number of cases
that are quietly discussed.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.650 align:middle line:84%
They just don't get
a lot of publicity.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.610 align:middle line:84%
There are thousands of
reports made every year

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.200 align:middle line:90%
online to various websites.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And some of these
really do describe

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.930 align:middle line:84%
beings or apparent beings,
apparent interactions.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.500 align:middle line:84%
There are abductions, or
what seem to be abductions,

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.350 align:middle line:84%
that still do go on, at
least in my own judgment.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:00.280 align:middle line:90%
But, no.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.190 align:middle line:84%
These high profile cases, you
get them every now and then.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.130 align:middle line:84%
There was the great
case from 2008

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.290 align:middle line:84%
of Stephenville, Texas,
which you know about,

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.071 align:middle line:84%
many, many viewers know about,
where an enormous object

00:04:16.071 --> 00:04:18.570 align:middle line:84%
was seen coming in at a very
high rate of speed over Central

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.790 align:middle line:84%
Texas, pursued by
F-16 interceptors.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.139 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which they deny, right?

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:26.680 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well, they
denied initially.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.547 align:middle line:84%
They said no, no, we
had nothing out there.

00:04:28.547 --> 00:04:30.380 align:middle line:84%
But then there were
just too many witnesses,

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.880 align:middle line:84%
and the Air Force
did say, well, we

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.750 align:middle line:84%
were doing an F-16
training mission.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.774 align:middle line:84%
So they came to that much
of an acknowledgement,

00:04:37.774 --> 00:04:40.190 align:middle line:84%
but they wouldn't acknowledge
that there was this object--

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.523 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That they were chasing.

00:04:41.523 --> 00:04:44.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: In the words of one
witness, the size of a flying

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.794 align:middle line:90%
Walmart coming in.

00:04:48.794 --> 00:04:50.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, can you imagine
if Walmarts could fly.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.130 align:middle line:84%
That's the scariest
thing of all.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.070 align:middle line:90%
And then I'm out of the country.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It sounds like
the Phoenix Lights object,

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.030 align:middle line:90%
doesn't it?

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Yes, it was a
very large object for sure.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And a number of people said that
they got right underneath this

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.320 align:middle line:84%
and that it actually
blocked out the sky.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And these are solid
people from Central Texas.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.540 align:middle line:84%
One of the witnesses is a
licensed commercial aviator.

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And these are people who've
had a very good view of what

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.365 align:middle line:90%
they claim that they saw.

00:05:18.365 --> 00:05:20.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what's
incredible is you get stories

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.520 align:middle line:84%
like the Phoenix Lights,
where the governor

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.490 align:middle line:84%
at the time of Arizona,
Fife Symington,

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.010 align:middle line:84%
holds a news conference,
ridicules the event,

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:34.790 align:middle line:84%
has a alien-type guy dressed
up, and makes a big little joke

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:38.150 align:middle line:84%
about it-- and then
recants later on.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.120 align:middle line:84%
I was on Larry King's
show at the time with him,

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.970 align:middle line:84%
and he was a total
believer all of a sudden.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well, and what
Fife Symington said--

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.060 align:middle line:84%
and this is one of the most
interesting and, I would say,

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.966 align:middle line:84%
important statements
that we've had

00:05:51.966 --> 00:05:53.880 align:middle line:90%
in the last couple of decades.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.580 align:middle line:84%
The Phoenix lights in 1997
was a significant thing.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.180 align:middle line:84%
You have all of these citizens
seeing an object going down

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.210 align:middle line:84%
the state of Arizona-- many,
many very good sightings--

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.730 align:middle line:84%
and then something
significant that evening that

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:10.440 align:middle line:90%
was seen by many people.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.790 align:middle line:84%
So it got a lot of
attention and it

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.640 align:middle line:84%
threatened to spiral
out of control.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.992 align:middle line:90%
So here's Fife Symington.

00:06:16.992 --> 00:06:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And he holds that
press conference,

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.449 align:middle line:84%
and he brings the guy in
the big alien suit out.

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:24.210 align:middle line:84%
Ha, ha, ha, big joke,
and the story goes away.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:29.070 align:middle line:84%
But what he did say 10
years later, in 2007,

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.440 align:middle line:84%
was that he did
this specifically

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.620 align:middle line:90%
to avoid public panic.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, he was
a witness of the object,

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.370 align:middle line:84%
and he was a commercial
pilot-- a very qualified pilot.

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And he said, look,
there's nothing,

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.640 align:middle line:84%
nothing we have
that is like this.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.530 align:middle line:84%
So what does that tell
any rational person?

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:49.890 align:middle line:84%
This is a serious topic that
involves very exotic technology

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:53.090 align:middle line:84%
that we have got to keep
under wraps because this could

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:54.800 align:middle line:90%
get out of control really fast.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk
about the mystery.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And Zacharias Sitchin would have
said, had he been alive today,

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.610 align:middle line:84%
we were seeded by these
extraterrestrials.

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.850 align:middle line:84%
That's how life
on Earth started.

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.750 align:middle line:84%
They came here, genetically
manipulated what

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:13.600 align:middle line:84%
was on the planet,
and here we are today.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And whether you agree
with that theory or not,

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:21.810 align:middle line:84%
the point is is that over time,
this planet has been visited.

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:26.690 align:middle line:84%
We are an observation
deck for these UFOs.

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:29.420 align:middle line:84%
They keep coming
on and on and on.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.341 align:middle line:84%
But what's the
mystery, Richard, here?

00:07:31.341 --> 00:07:33.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well, my feeling,
I agree with that statement

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:35.560 align:middle line:84%
that we have been
here for a long time.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.340 align:middle line:84%
In my new book, I
have a whole chapter

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.540 align:middle line:84%
that deals with the
ancient aliens phenomenon.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And I try to explore
that as best as I can.

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.190 align:middle line:84%
Regarding Sitchin himself,
I go back and forth

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:49.050 align:middle line:84%
on some of the specifics of
what he has talked about.

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:51.680 align:middle line:84%
But I do think, as I
like to sometimes put it,

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.260 align:middle line:90%
we have a hole in our history.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:54.820 align:middle line:90%
A hole in our ancient history.

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:58.260 align:middle line:84%
There are a number
of very odd things

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:02.130 align:middle line:84%
about our own development as a
species and as a civilization

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:06.230 align:middle line:84%
that I do feel are not
really adequately explained

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:12.080 align:middle line:84%
by our conventional kind
of explanation, I think.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And it does seem to me
that it's reasonable

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:18.587 align:middle line:84%
that others, whoever they
are, have been watching us

00:08:18.587 --> 00:08:19.420 align:middle line:90%
for quite some time.

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.711 align:middle line:84%
I think we're an interesting
show here on planet Earth.

00:08:21.711 --> 00:08:23.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's the agenda?

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:25.370 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Well, I don't know.

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:27.740 align:middle line:90%
Are we their farm animals?

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.720 align:middle line:84%
Are we their private
reality show?

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:30.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they need us?

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:31.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Right.

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:32.030 align:middle line:90%
Do they need us?

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:35.799 align:middle line:84%
Do they have an interest in
the planet itself and they just

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:38.530 align:middle line:90%
don't want any hassle from us?

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:40.130 align:middle line:90%
All of these are possibilities.

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:44.970 align:middle line:84%
You've got claims, and
I've encountered my own.

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:46.520 align:middle line:84%
A number of
witnesses have talked

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:50.070 align:middle line:84%
about very strange
encounters with beings

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:53.820 align:middle line:84%
who kind of look normal, but
they're not quite normal.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And it leaves open
the possibility

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.700 align:middle line:84%
that there's another
group that's infiltrated.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.090 align:middle line:90%
Is this the case?

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:04.320 align:middle line:84%
They're kind of here,
but they're separate.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.440 align:middle line:84%
All of these I
think are possible.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And the problem that
we investigators have

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:10.490 align:middle line:84%
is getting good
evidence that really

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:13.310 align:middle line:84%
is going to stand up
in the public domain.

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:15.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: David Jacobs
believes that there's

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:21.260 align:middle line:84%
something very nasty going on
here, something evil at stake.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yes.

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:27.790 align:middle line:84%
David, he's a retired
professor at Temple University

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:28.936 align:middle line:90%
and a historian.

00:09:28.936 --> 00:09:30.935 align:middle line:84%
But he's done a lot of
training in hypnotherapy.

00:09:30.935 --> 00:09:35.350 align:middle line:84%
He's regressed hundreds
of individuals.

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:37.455 align:middle line:84%
Even going back to the
early 1990s, one thing

00:09:37.455 --> 00:09:39.580 align:middle line:84%
that David did that I
thought was quite interesting

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:43.950 align:middle line:84%
is he took all of the abduction
cases that he had done

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:46.150 align:middle line:84%
and he he tried to
break them all down

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:50.500 align:middle line:84%
and see patterns that
were from all of them.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And he put together, I
think, a very reasonable sort

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.750 align:middle line:90%
of abduction scenario.

00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:00.590 align:middle line:84%
He wrote about it in one of his
earlier books, "Secret Life,"

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:03.550 align:middle line:90%
and I think it's good work.

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:05.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all of this is
going to be inexact.

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:07.930 align:middle line:84%
We're dealing with a very
difficult phenomenon.

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:10.750 align:middle line:84%
But yes, his own conclusion
was that there are other beings

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:12.360 align:middle line:90%
and they're not all nice.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:16.660 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are almost like
psychopathic or sociopathic.

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:17.709 align:middle line:90%
They are here to use us.

00:10:17.709 --> 00:10:19.750 align:middle line:84%
They're here to create
their own hybrid species--

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:21.630 align:middle line:90%
this was his thesis.

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's not something that
everyone has agreed with.

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.250 align:middle line:90%
It's very controversial.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:28.790 align:middle line:84%
But when I read
some of his work,

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:32.620 align:middle line:84%
I think he does not
make a bad case.

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:37.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think if the public
knew what might be going on,

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.510 align:middle line:84%
I think there would
be widespread panic.

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that's a reason
why we don't have what you've

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:45.750 align:middle line:84%
been working at, and
Steve Bassett and others,

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:47.520 align:middle line:90%
and that's disclosure.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.900 align:middle line:84%
I think there's
something going on here.

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:53.190 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Panic is a big issue.

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:54.730 align:middle line:90%
I live in Upstate New York.

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And in the early
1980s, New York State

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.570 align:middle line:84%
had what were known as the
Hudson Valley sightings.

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And this went on
for several years.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And it got to be at such a point
that, again, public panic was

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:10.560 align:middle line:84%
a real issue, and it had
to be kaboshed at the time.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.510 align:middle line:84%
Fife Symington, we
talked about him.

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:13.910 align:middle line:90%
Public panic is a worry.

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:17.340 align:middle line:84%
Back in 1952, when there were
sightings over the capital,

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:18.930 align:middle line:90%
public panic was another issue.

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:20.940 align:middle line:84%
Periodically, you
see this happening

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:23.270 align:middle line:90%
and it has to be stopped.

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:25.360 align:middle line:90%
It's not hard to see why.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you or I were
in a position of being

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:30.480 align:middle line:84%
the president, and we had
to make some announcement

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.300 align:middle line:90%
that this is all real, my god.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:33.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And we can't stop it.

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:34.685 align:middle line:90%
And they're taking us.

00:11:34.685 --> 00:11:35.310 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Right.

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:37.140 align:middle line:84%
How do you talk
about this in a way

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:38.916 align:middle line:84%
that you're going
to maintain control?

00:11:38.916 --> 00:11:40.540 align:middle line:84%
Same thing with the
cattle mutilations.

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:44.330 align:middle line:84%
Same type of phenomenon where
if you get into the real nuts

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:47.020 align:middle line:84%
and bolts and you
acknowledge this is real, A,

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:49.220 align:middle line:84%
you're expected to do
something about it.

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.010 align:middle line:90%
And what if you can't?

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And what if you
can't control how--

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:57.450 align:middle line:90%
people are going to be upset.

00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:59.574 align:middle line:90%
Some won't, but some will.

00:11:59.574 --> 00:12:02.240 align:middle line:84%
This is the subject of one of my
books, "A.D. After Disclosure,"

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.570 align:middle line:84%
and we really try
to explore that.

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:05.028 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And speaking
of books, you

00:12:05.028 --> 00:12:09.260 align:middle line:84%
are also a publisher of books
of other UFO researchers,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:09.890 align:middle line:90%
are you not?

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:11.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: I love doing that.

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:13.330 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that I've really

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:14.970 align:middle line:84%
explored in the last
couple of years.

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And in the last year, I've
gotten more and more into this.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:22.580 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of great
thinkers and writers

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.420 align:middle line:84%
in this field who
need an audience.

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's sometimes hard for
them to find a publisher.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:32.490 align:middle line:84%
And I've learned the ropes in
doing this enough years myself

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:34.925 align:middle line:84%
that I figured out how
to do the publishing bit.

00:12:34.925 --> 00:12:35.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:36.000 align:middle line:90%
And you do it well.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: So a number of
authors have come to me

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:38.620 align:middle line:84%
and I've published
their work, yeah.

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:39.536 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: "Admissible."

00:12:39.536 --> 00:12:40.980 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about this.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: This is a book
that I'm so happy with.

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:47.894 align:middle line:84%
This is "The Field Manual for
Investigating UFOs, Paranormal

00:12:47.894 --> 00:12:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Activities, and
Strange Creatures.

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:50.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A field manual.

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:52.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: This is by a very
good friend and colleague

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:53.990 align:middle line:90%
of mine, Chase Kloetzke.

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:56.400 align:middle line:90%
And I'm listed as a co-author.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.410 align:middle line:84%
I did do a lot of
edits on the book.

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:02.100 align:middle line:84%
But Chase is a
fascinating individual.

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:05.950 align:middle line:84%
She's-- I guess what you'd
call her is a door kicker.

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:08.400 align:middle line:84%
She's a boots on the
ground investigator

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.930 align:middle line:84%
who has looked into all of these
types of strange phenomenon.

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:16.140 align:middle line:84%
She was what was known as the
Star Team leader for MUFON,

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:17.834 align:middle line:84%
the Mutual UFO
Network, when they

00:13:17.834 --> 00:13:19.500 align:middle line:84%
had a lot of money
to work with and they

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.730 align:middle line:84%
were doing high-level
investigations.

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And she created all
their protocols.

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And she's traveled
around the world.

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:28.214 align:middle line:84%
I think of her as like
Indiana Jones in the UFO field

00:13:28.214 --> 00:13:29.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The female Indiana.

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:30.810 align:middle line:90%
She's like Lara Croft.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:33.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Yes, I think
that's exactly right.

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:34.800 align:middle line:90%
I marvel at Chase.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.520 align:middle line:84%
She's traveled around
the world doing

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.370 align:middle line:84%
some very fascinating
investigation.

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And she wrote this
manual basically

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:43.670 align:middle line:84%
to show ordinary
people who just are

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:45.077 align:middle line:90%
interested how do you do it.

00:13:45.077 --> 00:13:46.660 align:middle line:84%
How do you do it in
a responsible way.

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:47.740 align:middle line:90%
How do you document this.

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And the idea of "Admissible" is
how do you document your case

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:54.360 align:middle line:84%
well enough,
professionally enough,

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:57.080 align:middle line:84%
that at least in theory, if you
do well enough, that it would

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:58.790 align:middle line:90%
be admissible in a court of law?

00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:59.980 align:middle line:90%
That's the whole concept.

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And she put it together
in a beautiful way.

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:05.365 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, Chase is
one of these people

00:14:05.365 --> 00:14:08.410 align:middle line:84%
who I think is doing
significant new work.

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:11.840 align:middle line:84%
I am so proud that I got to
work with her on this book.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
public perception,

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:16.660 align:middle line:84%
Richard, of people
who investigate UFOs?

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:18.310 align:middle line:90%
Has it changed over the years?

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:19.685 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: That's
a great question.

00:14:19.685 --> 00:14:21.360 align:middle line:10%
I think in terms
of-- there's a lot

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:25.477 align:middle line:10%
of mainstream media view
of the UFO investigator

00:14:25.477 --> 00:14:28.870 align:middle line:10%
as a kind of goofy, like we're
going to break the conspiracy.

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:33.900 align:middle line:10%
And I don't really think that's
how those UFO researchers are,

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:37.464 align:middle line:10%
or people who do any type
of bizarre investigation.

00:14:37.464 --> 00:14:39.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, you
folks are really serious.

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:40.590 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yes, absolutely.

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:43.270 align:middle line:84%
I've met so many people
who work this field.

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And the one disadvantage
that they have

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:48.320 align:middle line:90%
is simply a lack of money.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And to do this
scientifically, which

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:54.725 align:middle line:84%
I think everyone wants to do,
good science needs good money.

00:14:54.725 --> 00:14:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not getting
that, then the best thing

00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:58.880 align:middle line:84%
you can do is have
good protocols

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.860 align:middle line:84%
and to do this as
seriously as you can.

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:06.390 align:middle line:84%
I think most of the true field
investigators that I have met

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:10.070 align:middle line:84%
are very sober, rational,
cautious people,

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:11.840 align:middle line:90%
but brave people.

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.135 align:middle line:84%
I think you need that
combination of rational

00:15:14.135 --> 00:15:17.610 align:middle line:84%
and caution, with a
certain amount of courage,

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:21.660 align:middle line:84%
to be able to look into these
fields and subjects that

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:24.760 align:middle line:84%
are at and beyond the fringe of
what we're supposed to believe.

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
they trying to find?

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:27.910 align:middle line:90%
What's their mission?

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:30.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well, I
think of myself.

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:32.699 align:middle line:84%
I don't do a lot of
field investigation,

00:15:32.699 --> 00:15:34.490 align:middle line:84%
but I think I have the
same attitude, which

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:37.440 align:middle line:84%
is that it's an
innate curiosity.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.940 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of
these investigators

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:41.250 align:middle line:90%
realize they're onto something.

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:42.000 align:middle line:84%
They're onto something
that's really fascinating.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They can
feel it, can't they?

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:44.426 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: That's right.

00:15:44.426 --> 00:15:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And they'll have
enough of good cases

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:49.700 align:middle line:84%
that trigger that
imagination, make

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:51.750 align:middle line:84%
them think there
is something here.

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:53.420 align:middle line:90%
Let's find it.

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:57.090 align:middle line:84%
The problem that
we have is we're

00:15:57.090 --> 00:16:00.060 align:middle line:84%
really, when we study
things like UFOs or ghosts

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:03.410 align:middle line:84%
or a crypted, strange
creatures, sometimes

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:04.910 align:middle line:84%
I think that we're
really bumping

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:07.550 align:middle line:84%
into the edges,
the limits of what

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:12.180 align:middle line:84%
our own minds, our own way
of thinking are used to.

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:14.850 align:middle line:90%
And we have a hard time with it.

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:18.550 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're only
creatures with good brains,

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:21.110 align:middle line:84%
but they're still brains that
are set up in a certain way.

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:24.130 align:middle line:84%
Better than other animals
maybe, but with our own limits.

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And if our thinking
goes up to this level,

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:29.440 align:middle line:84%
but what might be here
and what might be there.

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.491 align:middle line:84%
It might be difficult
for us to comprehend

00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:32.490 align:middle line:90%
some of these mysteries.

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:35.700 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's important
and it's great that some of us

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:36.450 align:middle line:90%
do it.

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:38.240 align:middle line:84%
And I do think it's
not a waste of time.

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.940 align:middle line:84%
I think that by pressing
the boundaries of what

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:44.620 align:middle line:90%
is known to us, we're explorers.

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think the people who
are doing field investigations

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:49.720 align:middle line:90%
are the front line explorers.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your 20
year career, what

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:57.600 align:middle line:84%
has been for you the most
fascinating case that you've

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.670 align:middle line:84%
looked at, that
you've investigated,

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:02.910 align:middle line:90%
that has got that wow factor?

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:03.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Well, yeah.

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:04.706 align:middle line:90%
There have been a few.

00:17:04.706 --> 00:17:06.790 align:middle line:84%
One I wrote about
in my new book,

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:10.569 align:middle line:84%
in "UFOs For the
21st Century Mind."

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:12.470 align:middle line:84%
It's an ongoing
investigation, but I'm

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:14.720 align:middle line:84%
comfortable enough with it
that I wrote about it here.

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:18.929 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do with a Canadian
military case from 2008.

00:17:18.929 --> 00:17:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And this is the year
of Stephenville.

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:21.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not too long ago.

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:23.819 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: In fact, it was a few
weeks after the Stephenville,

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:26.430 align:middle line:84%
Texas case, so late
January of '08.

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And it was a military personnel,
the Canadian military,

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:34.570 align:middle line:84%
who was at the northernmost
military base in the world,

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:38.940 align:middle line:84%
a place called CFS Alert,
Canadian Forces Station Alert.

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:41.734 align:middle line:84%
So if you go to the tippy
tippy top of Greenland

00:17:41.734 --> 00:17:43.900 align:middle line:84%
and make a quick left,
you're on Canadian territory.

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:44.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And there it is.

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:46.318 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Right on
the Arctic Ocean.

00:17:46.318 --> 00:17:47.900 align:middle line:84%
This was an electronic
listening post

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:51.770 align:middle line:84%
that was developed in 1950's
to spy on the Soviets.

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:54.590 align:middle line:84%
It's still used to--
probably to do that as well,

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:57.820 align:middle line:84%
but also to communicate with
nuclear submarines up there.

00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:00.710 align:middle line:84%
It's a small base, usually
50 guys year round.

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:04.340 align:middle line:84%
In January, it's pitch black
year round in the wintertime

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:05.360 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.910 align:middle line:90%
And this man was there.

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And what happened at the base
was on this one particular day,

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:15.010 align:middle line:84%
the base commander took
about 10 or 12 guys

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:18.900 align:middle line:84%
to go on basically a hike just
to get some exercise outside.

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:21.810 align:middle line:84%
My witness stayed
inside in the mess hall,

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:25.740 align:middle line:84%
in the cafeteria, which had
large windows facing outside.

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:27.917 align:middle line:84%
So it's pitch
black, looking out.

00:18:27.917 --> 00:18:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And he's having lunch,
and he's sitting down

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:30.875 align:middle line:90%
with a bunch of other guys.

00:18:30.875 --> 00:18:34.807 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, the lights outside
are brighter than daylight.

00:18:34.807 --> 00:18:35.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everywhere.

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:37.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Everywhere outside,
and he's-- He doesn't think

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.310 align:middle line:90%
anything at first.

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:41.530 align:middle line:84%
He's like, oh, we must
have flood lights on.

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:42.550 align:middle line:90%
Didn't think about it.

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And then after 10 minutes,
those lights go off.

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:48.470 align:middle line:84%
About a half hour later,
the base commander

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:51.440 align:middle line:84%
and the other guys come in
and they're, like, ashen;

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.340 align:middle line:90%
they're deeply upset.

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:54.560 align:middle line:90%
He talks to a number of them.

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:59.320 align:middle line:84%
He finds out they were not
far from the base and they see

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:04.450 align:middle line:84%
a 200-foot-long, cigar-shaped
object silently come up from

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:08.560 align:middle line:84%
the south, hover over the base,
turn an intense beam of light

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.360 align:middle line:90%
on the base--

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:09.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:10.843 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: --for 10 minutes.

00:19:10.843 --> 00:19:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And then go off over
the Arctic Ocean.

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:15.560 align:middle line:90%
Gone.

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:17.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you look
at the map of this,

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:22.640 align:middle line:84%
there is nothing for hundreds
and hundreds of miles.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.972 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it just appears.

00:19:24.972 --> 00:19:26.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: And then it
actually didn't end there.

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:29.810 align:middle line:84%
The following day, the base
received an unscheduled visit

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:35.570 align:middle line:84%
from a US colonel, who is in the
cafeteria talking to the base

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:36.070 align:middle line:90%
commander.

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And my witness, who was
friends with the commander,

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:42.310 align:middle line:84%
foolishly comes up to
the American colonel.

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:47.170 align:middle line:84%
He says, oh, you must be
here for the UFO sighting

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:47.950 align:middle line:90%
we had yesterday.

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:49.680 align:middle line:90%
And the colonel got very upset.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.930 align:middle line:84%
Dressed him down in
front of everyone there.

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:53.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Put him down
or dressed him down?

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:54.606 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well,
basically said, who

00:19:54.606 --> 00:19:56.990 align:middle line:84%
do you think you are
talking like this?

00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:59.210 align:middle line:84%
You have no right, you
have no need to know.

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:02.717 align:middle line:84%
And he says, Commander, take
control of your men, and left.

00:20:02.717 --> 00:20:04.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As if there
was something going on?

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:05.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Absolutely.

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:05.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:06.540 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: What he did learn--

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:08.248 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So he wasn't
ridiculing the guy?

00:20:08.248 --> 00:20:08.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: No, no.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.990 align:middle line:84%
A few days later,
the base commander

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:14.362 align:middle line:84%
did say to him
privately, he said, look,

00:20:14.362 --> 00:20:15.570 align:middle line:90%
you should have known better.

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:17.906 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh yes,
I know I should have.

00:20:17.906 --> 00:20:19.280 align:middle line:84%
But he said, I
was told that this

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.821 align:middle line:84%
was the most serious violation
of airspace this base has ever

00:20:21.821 --> 00:20:22.900 align:middle line:90%
had.

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And we think of the
technologies that could do this.

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:29.710 align:middle line:84%
There's no helicopter that would
have the range of this object,

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:32.400 align:middle line:84%
much less be silent, much
less look like a cigar.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.360 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.550 align:middle line:90%
There's no drone we know.

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:37.093 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing we know of with
the range and capability that

00:20:37.093 --> 00:20:37.270 align:middle line:90%
can do this.

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:38.991 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And no other
country has this.

00:20:38.991 --> 00:20:39.490 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: No.

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:40.950 align:middle line:90%
Not the Russians, the Chinese.

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:42.640 align:middle line:90%
So what was this?

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.230 align:middle line:90%
Well, this is a true unknown.

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And this is just
from a few years ago.

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:48.569 align:middle line:84%
I've gotten to know this
witness very, very well.

00:20:48.569 --> 00:20:50.610 align:middle line:84%
I've got his military
information and everything.

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:53.556 align:middle line:84%
And we're continuing
to explore this case.

00:20:53.556 --> 00:20:56.180 align:middle line:84%
It's not the easiest one to look
into, but we've got some leads

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:57.530 align:middle line:90%
and we're going to keep going.

00:20:57.530 --> 00:20:58.620 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating case.

00:20:58.620 --> 00:20:59.453 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:20:59.453 --> 00:21:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: And it's
one that, I think,

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:03.840 align:middle line:90%
people had not known about.

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:08.320 align:middle line:84%
But it adds to this long
series of airspace violations

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:11.050 align:middle line:84%
of truly extraordinary
technology

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:13.910 align:middle line:84%
hanging out over very
sensitive places.

00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:18.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do we know
about the propulsion system?

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:20.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well, I think
what we're talking about

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:22.840 align:middle line:84%
is something a little bit
better than jet fuel, right?

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:26.160 align:middle line:84%
A little bit better
than fossil fuels.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:29.890 align:middle line:84%
I think the most reasonable
speculations center

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:32.530 align:middle line:84%
on what we would call
electrogravetics.

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:34.600 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
our own scientists

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:38.370 align:middle line:84%
have been looking at
since at least the 1950s.

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:42.360 align:middle line:84%
One American scientist named
Thomas Townsend Brown, well

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:45.850 align:middle line:84%
known to some researchers,
did experiments back

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:50.440 align:middle line:84%
in the 1950s in which he
would take a disc shape,

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:55.170 align:middle line:84%
tie it to a tether, and
have a positive and negative

00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:57.510 align:middle line:90%
intense charge at either end.

00:21:57.510 --> 00:22:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And what he discovered is that
created a propulsive effect

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:04.440 align:middle line:84%
and apparently a
gravity canceling

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:06.780 align:middle line:90%
effect to some extent.

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:08.590 align:middle line:84%
You need a lot of
power to do this.

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And it is at least the opinion
of a lot of more technically

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:16.390 align:middle line:84%
sophisticated people looking
at this that electrogravetics

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:19.910 align:middle line:84%
is probably a key
solution to this.

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:23.820 align:middle line:84%
You're still talking about
what's the source of power.

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:27.400 align:middle line:84%
Folks like Bob Lazar
talked about Element 115.

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:31.000 align:middle line:84%
Other people have talked about
things like zero-point energy.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what the true
answer in terms of the energy

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:34.830 align:middle line:90%
source is on this.

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:38.190 align:middle line:84%
But I think that there is
a source of energy that

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:41.830 align:middle line:84%
is involved in helping to create
this electrogravetic effect.

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:45.930 align:middle line:84%
My feeling is that within
the deep black budget

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:47.530 align:middle line:84%
classified world,
there are probably

00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:49.410 align:middle line:84%
some pretty good
answers on this.

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:53.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
traveling through wormholes

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:55.760 align:middle line:90%
and getting to spots instantly?

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.547 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: I love this
type of a topic.

00:22:57.547 --> 00:22:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is
something that I explored

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:01.420 align:middle line:84%
for the first time
in this new book.

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:04.140 align:middle line:84%
I think when you look
at the UFO phenomenon,

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:10.172 align:middle line:84%
it bumps into some really weird
science that 50, 60 years ago,

00:23:10.172 --> 00:23:12.130 align:middle line:84%
people would think that
doesn't make any sense,

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:13.516 align:middle line:90%
that an object could zigzag.

00:23:13.516 --> 00:23:15.890 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't make any sense that
you could do this or that.

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:17.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're at a point
now in our science

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:21.180 align:middle line:84%
where our science is
actually catching up

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:22.820 align:middle line:84%
to the UFO phenomenon,
as I see it.

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:25.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is, it is.

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:26.710 align:middle line:84%
To the infancy of
the UFO phenomenon.

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:27.550 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yeah.

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:30.330 align:middle line:84%
So when you talk about things
like wormholes or ideas

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:34.640 align:middle line:84%
of interstellar flight-- for
example, in the early 1990s,

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.590 align:middle line:84%
there was mathematician named
Miguel Alcubierre, who came up

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:40.460 align:middle line:84%
with his own mathematical
model of what we would call

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:42.800 align:middle line:90%
warp drive, like on "Star Trek."

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:47.130 align:middle line:84%
The idea of, no, we're not
exceeding the speed of light.

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:50.920 align:middle line:84%
But in a sense, it's
a loophole in which

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:55.660 align:middle line:84%
you do have the ability to
create the ability to warp

00:23:55.660 --> 00:24:00.814 align:middle line:84%
space and time to the extent
that you shrink it ahead of you

00:24:00.814 --> 00:24:02.480 align:middle line:84%
and you expand it
behind you, and you're

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.990 align:middle line:84%
kind of moving
through this bubble.

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:05.950 align:middle line:90%
He worked out the math.

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:08.110 align:middle line:84%
The math looks good,
according to physicists

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:09.320 align:middle line:90%
and mathematicians.

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:11.560 align:middle line:84%
What we don't have,
officially, is the source

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:15.140 align:middle line:84%
of energy significant
enough to do it.

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.230 align:middle line:84%
But I find it
fascinating that there

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:21.830 align:middle line:84%
are sciences that are available,
that exist, they're not fake,

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:24.890 align:middle line:84%
that move a long way
toward explaining some

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:28.590 align:middle line:84%
of these seemingly impossible
things like interstellar

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:29.510 align:middle line:90%
travel.

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:33.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And give a
society, a race of beings,

00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:37.570 align:middle line:84%
that are a million years ahead
of us, 200 million years ahead

00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:38.500 align:middle line:90%
of us.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:41.245 align:middle line:84%
Their technology
must be unbelievable.

00:24:41.245 --> 00:24:44.600 align:middle line:84%
Look where we've come
in the last 100 years.

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:46.750 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Right.

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:48.150 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely, George.

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And what are some of
the possibilities here?

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:54.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you go to
NASA and you ask them,

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:55.490 align:middle line:90%
could we travel to the stars?

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:57.220 align:middle line:84%
They might laugh,
ha ha, you now.

00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:01.840 align:middle line:84%
But then they would say,
well, not for maybe a century.

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:05.040 align:middle line:84%
But then they would say, yes,
in 100 years from now we really

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:06.426 align:middle line:90%
might have this capability.

00:25:06.426 --> 00:25:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And then think about
some other technologies,

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:10.530 align:middle line:84%
like advanced
computing, advanced

00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:12.800 align:middle line:90%
artificial intelligence.

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And one of my favorite
new things to look into,

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:17.900 align:middle line:84%
3D printing, where you
can literally create,

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:24.810 align:middle line:84%
layer by layer, objects
and even organic material.

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:25.957 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:25:25.957 --> 00:25:26.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Absolutely.

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:29.627 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're growing
noses with 3D material.

00:25:29.627 --> 00:25:30.710 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Think about this.

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:32.710 align:middle line:90%
Could they grow an actual being?

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:35.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as crazy as it
sounds, in a century

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:39.680 align:middle line:84%
or two, an artificially
intelligent being.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:44.110 align:middle line:84%
So would we have the ability in
a century-- maybe not you and I

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:45.630 align:middle line:90%
to make it to the nearest star.

00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:48.510 align:middle line:84%
But in 100 years, could we have
an artificially intelligent

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:51.940 align:middle line:84%
being or ship that could
make such a journey?

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:53.600 align:middle line:90%
I say, why not?

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:54.100 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:54.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love it.

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:55.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: All kinds
of possibilities.

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:57.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
drives you, Richard?

00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:59.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: I've
always been someone

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:02.870 align:middle line:84%
with this desire to
peek under the carpet.

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:06.360 align:middle line:84%
To look behind the closed
door and to get my peek.

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:08.090 align:middle line:84%
It's just I've
always been this way.

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:10.690 align:middle line:84%
Even before I did
UFOs, I was fascinated

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:12.510 align:middle line:84%
by studying the
intelligence community

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:17.060 align:middle line:84%
and all the secrecy behind
the official versions of truth

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:18.182 align:middle line:90%
that we're told.

00:26:18.182 --> 00:26:18.890 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:21.630 align:middle line:84%
It's just always been
something that drives me.

00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:24.330 align:middle line:84%
When I got hold
of the UFO topic--

00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:27.190 align:middle line:84%
I should say when
it got hold of me--

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:29.690 align:middle line:84%
I realized that this is
something that could drive me

00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:30.730 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of my life.

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:31.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it has.

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:32.605 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: It absolutely has.

00:26:32.605 --> 00:26:34.694 align:middle line:84%
And truthfully, I just
see myself as a lifer.

00:26:34.694 --> 00:26:36.860 align:middle line:84%
I think I'll take this right
to the end of the line,

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:37.840 align:middle line:90%
loving it all the way.

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:42.297 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And at this point,
what have you concluded to date?

00:26:42.297 --> 00:26:44.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: There are a
couple of basic things.

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:45.540 align:middle line:90%
A, it's real.

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:46.770 align:middle line:90%
They're here.

00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:50.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, I could say that
I know that there's

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:54.430 align:middle line:84%
a phenomenon that
militaries around the world

00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:56.470 align:middle line:84%
have encountered
that is enveloped

00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:59.150 align:middle line:84%
in some classification
and secrecy.

00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:01.680 align:middle line:90%
So there's something there.

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:05.520 align:middle line:84%
The rest, I try to fill in
the blanks as well as I can.

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:07.580 align:middle line:84%
I believe there's
exotic technology that

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:11.110 align:middle line:84%
exists that should be
available to our world

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:13.430 align:middle line:84%
and is not available
to our world.

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:15.180 align:middle line:84%
I think that's an
important issue.

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:18.640 align:middle line:84%
I think every new technology
can cause new problems,

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:22.140 align:middle line:84%
but it can also help us if
we use it intelligently,

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:24.910 align:middle line:84%
and I think that we should have
the opportunity to do that.

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:27.200 align:middle line:90%
But there's something going on.

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that there
are other intelligences.

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:32.930 align:middle line:84%
Whether they are from
another planet, I don't know.

00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:35.240 align:middle line:84%
Another dimension of reality,
whatever that even means.

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:38.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or from a
hollow Earth maybe?

00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:41.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: There are,
yeah, long-term visitors,

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:43.560 align:middle line:90%
long-term residents.

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.530 align:middle line:84%
When I think of
hollow Earth, I don't

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:47.770 align:middle line:84%
think that the Earth's
center is hollow,

00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:51.454 align:middle line:84%
but there could be large
underground caverns, bases,

00:27:51.454 --> 00:27:52.745 align:middle line:90%
in the crust of the Earth, yes.

00:27:52.745 --> 00:27:53.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, of course.

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:55.223 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Absolutely I
think that's possible.

00:27:55.223 --> 00:27:56.490 align:middle line:90%
Long-term presence.

00:27:56.490 --> 00:28:02.180 align:middle line:84%
So I don't have a sure answer
as to who I think is behind it.

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:04.850 align:middle line:84%
I think that they're
not our civilization.

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:06.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
the demonic theory?

00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:11.240 align:middle line:84%
That these are demons
and angels coming here.

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:12.830 align:middle line:90%
Look at Genesis.

00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:15.620 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, I think
they misinterpreted

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:19.467 align:middle line:84%
ET visitations for
angels and demons.

00:28:19.467 --> 00:28:21.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Yeah, there's a
couple of ways to look at that.

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:25.910 align:middle line:84%
One is this way, that there have
been other beings, another race

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:29.880 align:middle line:84%
that earlier people would
interpret as gods or demons

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:31.620 align:middle line:90%
and what have you.

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
other people who

00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:34.900 align:middle line:84%
put the shoe on the
other foot so to speak,

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:35.899 align:middle line:90%
and they say no, no, no.

00:28:35.899 --> 00:28:39.640 align:middle line:84%
What you're saying are
ETs are actually demons.

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:40.747 align:middle line:90%
Big debate.

00:28:40.747 --> 00:28:42.330 align:middle line:84%
Not everyone's going
to agree on this.

00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:49.360 align:middle line:84%
But I think that they
are other beings.

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:50.990 align:middle line:90%
I would say that.

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think I'm more in line
with what you suggested,

00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:57.506 align:middle line:84%
that we're inclined to
look at them as so exotic,

00:28:57.506 --> 00:28:58.880 align:middle line:84%
that that's how
we interpret them

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:02.055 align:middle line:84%
as angelic beings
or demonic beings.

00:29:02.055 --> 00:29:03.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: When they are not.

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:03.620 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: I don't know.

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:05.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't really have
a clear answer to this.

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:07.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will we
ever get the answer?

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:09.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: I think
that we're always

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:10.860 align:middle line:90%
going to get new answers.

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:12.910 align:middle line:84%
And those answers
will undoubtedly

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:14.140 align:middle line:90%
lead to new questions.

00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:16.220 align:middle line:84%
We're-- all of us are
on a long journey.

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:18.590 align:middle line:84%
I talk sometimes about
the idea of disclosure

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:19.590 align:middle line:90%
of the UFO phenomenon.

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:22.330 align:middle line:84%
It is something that I
believe in and support.

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:26.160 align:middle line:84%
That is, an official
recognition that there

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:28.010 align:middle line:90%
is a genuine phenomenon here.

00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:29.470 align:middle line:90%
I would call that disclosure.

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:31.922 align:middle line:84%
But does that mean that
with disclosure we're

00:29:31.922 --> 00:29:33.630 align:middle line:84%
going to get every
single answer we want?

00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:34.810 align:middle line:90%
I doubt it.

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:36.890 align:middle line:90%
I seriously doubt it.

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:40.540 align:middle line:84%
My feeling is that even
those secret keepers

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:43.070 align:middle line:84%
in our own society, in
the black budget world,

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:45.630 align:middle line:84%
they probably don't have
every answer either.

00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And that we are on a long,
long, long journey that

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:53.992 align:middle line:84%
may take many, many more
years until we continue

00:29:53.992 --> 00:29:55.450 align:middle line:84%
to get more answers
along the road.

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:58.990 align:middle line:10%
But I think just because we
don't get every single answer

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:02.210 align:middle line:10%
we want, that doesn't mean
that the journey itself

00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:04.425 align:middle line:10%
is not valuable.

00:30:04.425 --> 00:30:05.830 align:middle line:10%
Of course it's valuable.

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:08.770 align:middle line:10%
All of us are exploring.

00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:12.810 align:middle line:84%
Just because Galileo
didn't come up

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:14.350 align:middle line:84%
with Newton's three
laws of motion

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:17.090 align:middle line:84%
didn't mean that his
contribution wasn't important.

00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think
similarly, those of us

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.890 align:middle line:84%
who are exploring
this phenomenon now,

00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:22.220 align:middle line:90%
we make our own contributions.

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:24.050 align:middle line:84%
People in the future will
make other contributions.

00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:25.758 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The journey's
worth it, Richard.

00:30:25.758 --> 00:30:26.640 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Absolutely.

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:28.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: It was my
pleasure, George.

00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:29.430 align:middle line:90%
Loved it.

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:31.900 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: So the next time
you look in the skies,

00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:33.760 align:middle line:10%
be well assured that
there's somebody

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:35.280 align:middle line:10%
out there watching them for you.

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:37.920 align:middle line:10%
Richard Dolan, noted
publisher, researcher.

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:41.230 align:middle line:10%
His latest work, "UFOs For
the 21st Century Mind."

00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:42.620 align:middle line:10%
It's a great read.

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:43.540 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:46.030 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:30:46.030 --> 00:31:02.267 align:middle line:90%
