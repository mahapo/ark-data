00:00:24.568 --> 00:00:26.360 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.600 align:middle line:84%
Jim Bruton, our guest, worked
for "National Geographic"

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.900 align:middle line:84%
while living in Africa
making wildlife films.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.180 align:middle line:84%
He then rebuilt
vintage aircraft,

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.840 align:middle line:84%
with the last one sadly
crashing and delivering

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.210 align:middle line:84%
an unusual near-death
experience for him.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.490 align:middle line:10%
This led to his book,
"The In Between--

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:44.690 align:middle line:10%
A Trip of a Lifetime."

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.400 align:middle line:90%
Jim, welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.030 align:middle line:90%
>>JIM BRUTON: Hi, George.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.830 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:48.747 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a story.

00:00:48.747 --> 00:00:49.547 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: I know.

00:00:49.547 --> 00:00:50.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm very lucky to be here.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.585 align:middle line:84%
I thought about calling the
book, "Back by Popular Demand,"

00:00:53.585 --> 00:00:53.840 align:middle line:90%
but--

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.020 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.780 align:middle line:84%
That must have
been a scary time.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.060 align:middle line:84%
We'll get into that in
depth, but my God, I'm

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.877 align:middle line:90%
glad you're here.

00:00:59.877 --> 00:01:00.710 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: Thank you.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.252 align:middle line:84%
And it's great to be here, and
it's great to share the story.

00:01:03.252 --> 00:01:06.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Growing up, were you
into technology and things

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.920 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you built your own
airplane, for crying out loud.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.190 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: I know.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.700 align:middle line:10%
I grew up in the '60s, and
like many little boys then,

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.810 align:middle line:10%
as we watched the space race
unfold with the target 1969

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.090 align:middle line:10%
date for the moon,
many of us would

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.257 align:middle line:10%
look at "Popular Mechanics."

00:01:21.257 --> 00:01:23.257 align:middle line:84%
You know, we were going
to get the flying saucer

00:01:23.257 --> 00:01:25.700 align:middle line:84%
in the garage or the rocket
pack we could fly to school,

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.860 align:middle line:84%
or moon tourism
would be coming up.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.290 align:middle line:84%
And it was just an
easy time to be very

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.420 align:middle line:90%
optimistic about technology.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And being also a child
with a big imagination,

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.360 align:middle line:90%
I loved science fiction.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.830 align:middle line:84%
So that sort of fed some of
the work I would do later on.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And my father became a
pilot during this time,

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.140 align:middle line:84%
so I naturally had an
interest in aviation.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized how much I
loved early aviation, you know,

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.050 align:middle line:84%
when you had copper and
brass and wood and fabric,

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.228 align:middle line:84%
and the machines looked
like a work of art.

00:01:53.228 --> 00:01:55.520 align:middle line:84%
So I sort of fell in love
with that period of aviation.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.353 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was your father
a commercial pilot?

00:01:57.353 --> 00:01:58.760 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: Yes, he was.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.170 align:middle line:84%
He was-- with a private
charter firm, though, yes.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.350 align:middle line:90%
Did he ever take you on trips?

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUTON: Oh, gosh, I
probably logged 10,000 hours

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.430 align:middle line:84%
by the time I was in high
school as a passenger.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Unfortunately, you
couldn't get credit for it,

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.030 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.830 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: I know.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.215 align:middle line:90%
There was no logbook for that.

00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:14.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, let's talk
about building of this plane.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:15.990 align:middle line:90%
How did you construct it?

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.810 align:middle line:84%
It was made out of
wood, I recall, right?

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:18.610 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: Yes.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.660 align:middle line:84%
It was a reproduction of a 1933
Flying Flea, which was French,

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.262 align:middle line:84%
and it was designed
with the idea--

00:02:25.262 --> 00:02:26.720 align:middle line:84%
it was almost like
it was the birth

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.800 align:middle line:90%
of the ultralight movement.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Single engine?

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.925 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUTON: Yes, single engine
right in front of your face.

00:02:30.925 --> 00:02:32.640 align:middle line:84%
They used repurposed
motorcycle engines.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.300 align:middle line:84%
It was very small, like
a soapbox derby car.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And you had this wing above
you, one behind your head.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.000 align:middle line:84%
It was very tiny, hence
the name Flying Flea.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.742 align:middle line:84%
And when I was
young, I saw this,

00:02:43.742 --> 00:02:45.950 align:middle line:84%
and I thought how whimsical
it looked, like something

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.450 align:middle line:90%
out of a Disney cartoon.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.690 align:middle line:84%
So I thought this could be
fun to build and fun to fly.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And like you said, it
was all made out of wood.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.230 align:middle line:84%
It was a basic skeleton of
wood with plywood covering,

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.710 align:middle line:90%
a fabric covering.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.342 align:middle line:84%
And then I used a BMW
motorcycle engine as my engine.

00:03:02.342 --> 00:03:03.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a
good size engine.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.115 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: It is.

00:03:04.115 --> 00:03:05.540 align:middle line:90%
It's very powerful for that.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And because I'm bigger than the
average Frenchman in the 1930s,

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.180 align:middle line:84%
I added a little
extra to the wings

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.340 align:middle line:90%
to give me a bit more lift.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.260 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, my
first test flight,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.330 align:middle line:84%
It was a little more
unstable than I had expected.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.640 align:middle line:90%
So on the third--

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry-- on the
second test flight,

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.450 align:middle line:90%
I went out to master its quirks.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
I lost my engine.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.740 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't make it
back to the airfield,

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.140 align:middle line:84%
because being an
early-model aircraft,

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.020 align:middle line:84%
it didn't have a
huge glide ratio.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.020 align:middle line:90%
So it was a very steep--

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was weighted
down, wasn't it?

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.840 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: Yes.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.920 align:middle line:84%
And just not very
clean aerodynamically.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.150 align:middle line:90%
So with that, I--

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.590 align:middle line:84%
the only place I
could make it to

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.880 align:middle line:84%
was a small pond at a
nearby Boy Scout camp.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And because the front of the
aircraft was shaped like a boat

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.340 align:middle line:90%
anyway, I thought not too bad.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.680 align:middle line:90%
And so I aimed for the lake.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.760 align:middle line:84%
I got my engine
started one more time.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.010 align:middle line:90%
And then it quit again.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And I overshot the
bank and just crashed

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.780 align:middle line:84%
into all the tree trunks
at about 70 miles an hour,

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.590 align:middle line:84%
again in the equivalent
of a soapbox derby car.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:01.858 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Plane was destroyed.

00:04:01.858 --> 00:04:03.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUTON: There was no
plane left around me

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.210 align:middle line:84%
once I stopped
crashing, just what

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:06.650 align:middle line:90%
I was seat-belted to behind me.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you unconscious?

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUTON: I talked-- luckily
there was a man fishing nearby,

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.890 align:middle line:84%
because the park
was normally closed

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.710 align:middle line:84%
and it was peaceful
for him, but luckily he

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:20.000 align:middle line:84%
ran over to call 911
and keep me propped up.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.950 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him about
did I say anything?

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.000 align:middle line:84%
He said, yeah, you were
just in shock, delirious.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you bloody and--

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.050 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: Oh, yes.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.342 align:middle line:90%
Well, both lungs were ruptured.

00:04:27.342 --> 00:04:28.175 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my God.

00:04:28.175 --> 00:04:29.510 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: I broke all my ribs.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.770 align:middle line:84%
I had a hole in my lower
back from the engine battery

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.020 align:middle line:90%
breaking loose and hitting me.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And my right leg just
was multiple fractures.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And he said that I was not
able to really breathe.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.408 align:middle line:84%
I was just gasping, and
bloody foam was coming out.

00:04:41.408 --> 00:04:42.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
they even get to you

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.420 align:middle line:90%
to get you to the hospital?

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:45.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUTON: Well,
that's the thing.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.760 align:middle line:84%
If it hadn't been for this man
and him having a cell phone,

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.560 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't be here.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That
would have been it.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:49.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUTON: Because
my friends were

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.170 align:middle line:84%
flying around
looking for me, but I

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.950 align:middle line:90%
was up underneath the trees.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:52.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nobody would
have found you, right?

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:53.480 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: Exactly.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.950 align:middle line:90%
I was underneath a dense canopy.

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:55.790 align:middle line:90%
No one could see me.

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.540 align:middle line:84%
So he was able to guide
the helicopter in,

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.250 align:middle line:84%
and they landed as
close as they could.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And then, like I said, removing
me was pretty much just cutting

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.460 align:middle line:84%
my seat belt, because there
was no aircraft keeping

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.610 align:middle line:90%
me enclosed.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.450 align:middle line:84%
And so they flew me up to
Hartford's trauma center

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.120 align:middle line:84%
where a waiting team
received me and put me

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.720 align:middle line:84%
into a breathing
machine, intubated me

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.070 align:middle line:90%
with a breathing tube.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And finally family
members and friends

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.690 align:middle line:84%
started showing up two
or three hours later.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where did you have
the near-death experience?

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:26.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: It was--

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.730 align:middle line:90%
OK, we're right there.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.050 align:middle line:84%
They had me in restraints
so that in my delirium

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.712 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't start
removing tubing.

00:05:33.712 --> 00:05:34.920 align:middle line:90%
And I escaped the restraints.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:35.640 align:middle line:84%
You pulled yourself out
and stuff like that.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUTON: Yeah, and I
escaped the restraints.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:37.950 align:middle line:90%
So they put them--

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:38.910 align:middle line:90%
bigger restraints.

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And they told my
wife at the time to--

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.590 align:middle line:84%
that with multiple six-plus-hour
operations coming up

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:47.685 align:middle line:90%
for probably a week--

00:05:47.685 --> 00:05:47.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my god.

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:49.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUTON: --it was best
just put me into a coma.

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.480 align:middle line:84%
She agreed, so,
you know, in sort

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.120 align:middle line:84%
of trying to piece
it all together,

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.930 align:middle line:84%
my belief is that when they
put me into a coma here,

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.510 align:middle line:84%
that's when I had my
near-death experience.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was it like
for you on the other side?

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:04.140 align:middle line:90%
What can you describe?

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:05.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: Sure.

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:07.440 align:middle line:84%
Let me begin by
saying in contrast

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.900 align:middle line:84%
to many NDEs, where you have the
tunnel, deceased loved ones--

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:11.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The light.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:12.510 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: Exactly.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.010 align:middle line:84%
Some of these things
that are highly

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.230 align:middle line:90%
characteristic of most NDEs--

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:17.790 align:middle line:90%
mine was very different.

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:22.740 align:middle line:84%
Mine was more like I teleported,
and I teleported to a terrace

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.490 align:middle line:84%
on a tall building
in what I can only

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.740 align:middle line:84%
describe as a
post-apocalyptic landscape.

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:33.090 align:middle line:84%
Imagine New York
or LA 1,000 years

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.280 align:middle line:84%
after the meteor hits
or a nuclear blast.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's
left of it, right?

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:36.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: Exactly.

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.270 align:middle line:90%
It's just dead and gray.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.263 align:middle line:84%
And looming above me were
these massive storm clouds.

00:06:42.263 --> 00:06:44.430 align:middle line:84%
They just looked like they
were ready to break loose

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:45.755 align:middle line:90%
with the mother of all storms.

00:06:45.755 --> 00:06:47.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, I wasn't
afraid or anything.

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.010 align:middle line:84%
I would say, in fact, I was
depersonalized to some extent.

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:51.840 align:middle line:84%
There was no emotion,
just acceptance

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.280 align:middle line:90%
and taking it all in.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.720 align:middle line:84%
And while I was looking
around, all of a sudden,

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.690 align:middle line:84%
I was hit by this
wave of nausea.

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And I remember bending
over, and I thought,

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:01.510 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if I can take this.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I said that,
I heard this whispering

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.910 align:middle line:84%
like a light clacking
of gears off to my left.

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And as I looked, I saw this
massive four-story-high

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:12.210 align:middle line:90%
structure.

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:14.610 align:middle line:84%
It looked like an egg
standing on its end,

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:16.180 align:middle line:84%
but it was made
out of latticework,

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.380 align:middle line:90%
so you could see through it.

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And as I looked through
the open lattice,

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:21.480 align:middle line:84%
I could see slight
movements within.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.440 align:middle line:84%
So I was able to make
my way over to it.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And when I looked
through the latticework,

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:26.970 align:middle line:84%
I could see these
small gears that

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:30.060 align:middle line:84%
were freely suspended in
space just gently moving

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.470 align:middle line:90%
as if they were in idle.

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they would
pass through each other

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.400 align:middle line:84%
in a physically
impossible manner.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.260 align:middle line:90%
And some were more in focus.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:38.710 align:middle line:90%
Some were less in focused.

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.400 align:middle line:84%
But any time I looked at
one and focused on it,

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.930 align:middle line:90%
I could see what it meant.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:46.050 align:middle line:84%
And I realized they
each represented moments

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:46.920 align:middle line:90%
from my future.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.110 align:middle line:84%
Because if I saw
myself, I was older.

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:52.470 align:middle line:84%
If I saw my children, they might
be with children of their own

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:53.310 align:middle line:90%
who aren't here yet.

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:54.990 align:middle line:90%
So I realized this.

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought, yeah, I
wonder if I can touch them.

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And I put my hand through
the open latticework.

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.670 align:middle line:84%
And as I did, one
brushed by my hand.

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And when it did, I was
wracked with pain immediately.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.780 align:middle line:84%
And I just reflexively
grabbed it and pulled it out

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.670 align:middle line:90%
and threw it away.

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And when I did, all of the
gears started spinning around.

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And it was at that point
that I said, you know,

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:18.570 align:middle line:90%
what's happening now?

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:20.990 align:middle line:84%
And a disembodied
voice appeared,

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:22.740 align:middle line:84%
if you will, and stayed
with me throughout

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:23.657 align:middle line:90%
the entire experience.

00:08:23.657 --> 00:08:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And it said, this is
the process of becoming.

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:29.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do we know
that you weren't dreaming,

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:33.280 align:middle line:84%
hallucinating, your mind
wasn't making this up?

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: Sure.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.549 align:middle line:84%
And that's an
excellent question.

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:37.470 align:middle line:90%
And I totally understand it.

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:40.169 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, they estimate
that maybe 5% of the world's

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:43.020 align:middle line:84%
population has had a
near-death experience, which

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:45.917 align:middle line:84%
is about 60 million more people
than live in the United States.

00:08:45.917 --> 00:08:47.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a lot of people.

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUTON: So to have
that size of a population

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:54.150 align:middle line:84%
with a highly statistically
significant number

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:57.840 align:middle line:84%
of similarities, the light, the
tunnel, the life review, things

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.750 align:middle line:84%
like this, I think that right
there points to the fact

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.040 align:middle line:90%
that it's more than chance.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And I say chance because to me
a hallucination is something

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:07.230 align:middle line:84%
that I would think
is rather random,

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:09.150 align:middle line:84%
only in that I
haven't heard that,

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:12.180 align:middle line:84%
say, by taking LSD you have
the same types of hallmarks

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.520 align:middle line:84%
as you do with an NDE
or something like this.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.872 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't heard
of God telling anybody

00:09:16.872 --> 00:09:19.080 align:middle line:84%
to come back and be a serial
killer or something that

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:19.890 align:middle line:90%
random.

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:22.870 align:middle line:84%
Usually everybody comes back
and they're-- it's a reboot

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:24.420 align:middle line:90%
to version 2.0.

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.040 align:middle line:90%
It's a much improved version.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:30.510 align:middle line:84%
As I mention in my book, I
feel very depersonalized,

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:33.390 align:middle line:84%
like I was just stripped
down to the raw Jim,

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:34.890 align:middle line:90%
just as a conscious being.

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:36.540 align:middle line:84%
If someone had come
up to me and said,

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:38.460 align:middle line:84%
if you stay here any
longer you can't go back,

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:39.510 align:middle line:90%
I would say go back where?

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:40.310 align:middle line:90%
To your family.

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:41.310 align:middle line:90%
What family?

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:43.002 align:middle line:84%
Nothing of this world
I was attached to.

00:09:43.002 --> 00:09:44.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was
a no connection.

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:45.450 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: Not at all.

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:50.557 align:middle line:84%
And I think the reason that I
was taken that far into just

00:09:50.557 --> 00:09:52.140 align:middle line:84%
being a conscious
being and the reason

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:54.810 align:middle line:84%
there was no beautiful
scene around me

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:56.940 align:middle line:84%
is because I could have
been distracted by that.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.360 align:middle line:84%
I was given the opportunity
in reaching inside and finding

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.470 align:middle line:84%
these gears that hurt
to remove impediments

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:06.690 align:middle line:84%
to my spiritual
development in my future.

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:08.040 align:middle line:90%
It was like stacking the deck.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.387 align:middle line:90%
Now as I live--

00:10:09.387 --> 00:10:11.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying I won't
make wrong decisions,

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.620 align:middle line:84%
like I'll make a mistake,
but I have less likelihood

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.780 align:middle line:84%
of making a bad decision
for any reason that

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.760 align:middle line:84%
could be considered
morally ambiguous,

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.295 align:middle line:90%
as we all are tempted.

00:10:19.295 --> 00:10:20.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know,
I had a chance

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:23.490 align:middle line:84%
to interview Dr.
Eben Alexander about

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:25.820 align:middle line:90%
his near-death experience.

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:28.060 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN ALEXANDER: I grew
up in the '60s and '70s.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:31.060 align:middle line:10%
And like many others
in that generation,

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:34.100 align:middle line:10%
I always knew that science
is the pathway to truth.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:34.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.480 align:middle line:84%
>>ALEXANDER: And I
had wanted to believe

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.940 align:middle line:84%
what I heard in church, growing
up in a Methodist church

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:41.080 align:middle line:90%
in North Carolina.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:44.950 align:middle line:84%
But 20 years spent in
neurosurgery, I just

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:47.770 align:middle line:84%
wasn't sure how
conscious awareness could

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:50.300 align:middle line:84%
survive the death of
the brain and body.

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that's why my
experience, which happened back

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:56.530 align:middle line:84%
in November 2008,
shifted everything,

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:59.140 align:middle line:84%
because in fact,
such a severe case

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:01.870 align:middle line:84%
of gram-negative
bacterial meningitis

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:04.780 align:middle line:84%
should have disabled all but
the most rudimentary aspects

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:05.740 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And yet my consciousness
was greatly

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.850 align:middle line:84%
enhanced during
the experience when

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:12.070 align:middle line:84%
the human part of my
brain, the neocortex,

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:13.480 align:middle line:90%
was being devastated.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And that completely
violated everything

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.640 align:middle line:84%
I learned in neuroscience about
consciousness in the brain.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And it really has come to show
me that the material is wrong,

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:27.070 align:middle line:84%
and in fact, it's parallel to
a lot of what's happening today

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:29.560 align:middle line:84%
in the notion of
philosophy of mind

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.390 align:middle line:84%
and understanding
of consciousness

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:32.662 align:middle line:90%
that makes much more sense.

00:11:32.662 --> 00:11:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's what "Proof of
Heaven" and "Map of Heaven"

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:35.843 align:middle line:90%
are all about.

00:11:35.843 --> 00:11:37.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of
similarities with what

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:38.680 align:middle line:90%
happened to you, basically.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:39.555 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: Absolutely.

00:11:39.555 --> 00:11:41.710 align:middle line:84%
I feel like we're just
reading from the same page

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:42.920 align:middle line:90%
in different sections.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And I know Eben, and he's
actually reading my book now.

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:47.830 align:middle line:90%
So we do stay in communication.

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:53.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you welcome going
back to this environment again?

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:56.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUTON: Again, that's a great
question, because it was not

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.120 align:middle line:84%
pleasant, you know,
because you're

00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.203 align:middle line:90%
using pain as your guide.

00:11:59.203 --> 00:12:01.495 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you're using
a moral compass of scripture

00:12:01.495 --> 00:12:03.410 align:middle line:84%
or a mantra or
something like that.

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:06.370 align:middle line:84%
So I will say it was very
uncomfortable being there,

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:09.770 align:middle line:84%
but honestly, I think it was
the best version of myself.

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And if I was told I needed to
go back and continue that work,

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:13.750 align:middle line:90%
I'd go in a heartbeat.

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:15.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
glad you didn't stay?

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUTON: I am
glad I didn't stay.

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:20.590 align:middle line:84%
There was a point at watching--
every time I removed a gear,

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:23.440 align:middle line:84%
my whole destiny had to
recycle itself around something

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.948 align:middle line:90%
that now was missing, you know.

00:12:24.948 --> 00:12:27.490 align:middle line:84%
You can't just walk into a room
and there's a big black hole.

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And watching the gears
spin over and over

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:34.967 align:middle line:84%
and over and over
again, it was almost

00:12:34.967 --> 00:12:37.050 align:middle line:84%
like a little bit of mental
torture after a while.

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was
finally seeing them spin

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:44.290 align:middle line:84%
for the 10,000th time, I said, I
think I can live with this now.

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I had a wrap-up
summation of my experience

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:48.930 align:middle line:90%
and was booted out.

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:50.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dr. Raymond
Moody, the expert

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:54.150 align:middle line:84%
on near-death experiences
was on Gaia's "Legacy" show.

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:57.450 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at what he says
about near-death experiences

00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:00.030 align:middle line:84%
and compare it, Jim, to
what happened to you.

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:00.930 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: Sure.

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:03.040 align:middle line:10%
>>RAYMOND MOODY: From
their point of view,

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.970 align:middle line:10%
they feel that they
distanced themselves

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:07.770 align:middle line:10%
from their physical body.

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:10.620 align:middle line:84%
And they watch the scene
of the resuscitation

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:13.680 align:middle line:84%
typically from a point
of view above it.

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:17.190 align:middle line:84%
As this progresses, they
eventually wake up to the fact

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:20.700 align:middle line:84%
that, oh, this must be
something to do with death.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, they enter
into states of consciousness

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.360 align:middle line:84%
that, no matter how
articulate they may be,

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.520 align:middle line:84%
they say there are
no words for it,

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:33.960 align:middle line:84%
that it's ineffable
or indescribable.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:38.190 align:middle line:84%
They go through a passageway
into a beautiful light.

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:40.410 align:middle line:84%
They feel comfort,
peace, and joy.

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:44.460 align:middle line:84%
They meet relatives and friends
of theirs who have died,

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:48.480 align:middle line:84%
and they go through panoramic
memory in which everything

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.030 align:middle line:84%
they've ever done is
displayed around them

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:54.990 align:middle line:84%
in a sort of holographic,
three-dimensional panorama.

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:58.050 align:middle line:10%
And they come back
from these experiences

00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:00.930 align:middle line:10%
with a total new take
on life, thinking

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:03.930 align:middle line:10%
that the most important thing
we can do while we're here

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:06.930 align:middle line:10%
is to learn how to
love, and saying

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:09.240 align:middle line:10%
that they have no
more fear of death

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.220 align:middle line:10%
because they feel
that death is just

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:14.730 align:middle line:10%
a transition into
some other reality.

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:17.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not a lot of those
things happened to you.

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUTON: No, and to be
honest, in coming home from

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:22.120 align:middle line:84%
the hospital and
starting to realize, OK,

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.730 align:middle line:90%
what happened here--

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:25.980 align:middle line:84%
you know, I'm on my
computer doing research.

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:27.990 align:middle line:84%
I find out about
near-death experiences.

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:31.743 align:middle line:84%
And then I watched some YouTube
videos, or I might order books,

00:14:31.743 --> 00:14:33.660 align:middle line:84%
like audio books while
I'm out driving around.

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:36.772 align:middle line:84%
And it was actually
PMH Atwater's book,

00:14:36.772 --> 00:14:38.730 align:middle line:84%
"The Rest of the Story,"
I think it was called,

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:43.650 align:middle line:84%
that truly spoke to my type
of near-death experience.

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And what's amazing
is she even was

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:47.740 align:middle line:84%
using terms I learned on the
other side to describe it.

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.950 align:middle line:84%
So I knew this woman and
I are going to be friends,

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:50.750 align:middle line:90%
and we are.

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:52.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
have a spirit guide

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:53.542 align:middle line:90%
meet you or anything like that?

00:14:53.542 --> 00:14:55.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUTON: No, but
I had that voice.

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And it was with that voice--
like, I would say, you know,

00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:58.340 align:middle line:90%
what's happening now?

00:14:58.340 --> 00:14:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And it would say
what's happening now.

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say-- one time I
said, you know, I don't even

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:05.003 align:middle line:84%
know where or when
these futures are.

00:15:05.003 --> 00:15:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And it said, that's
not important.

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:08.790 align:middle line:84%
The answers to what come
tomorrow are a waste.

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:11.820 align:middle line:84%
It's better to understand how
things fit and refit together,

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:14.040 align:middle line:84%
basically how the
universe works.

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And at one time I
said, I'm seeing

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:18.250 align:middle line:90%
a growing pile of gears here.

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:19.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm worried.

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:21.600 align:middle line:84%
Am I going to have a shorter
life for doing all this?

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And it said, your number of
breaths are already counted.

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:26.760 align:middle line:90%
I worry about your last one.

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And for those who make
poor use of their choices

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:32.755 align:middle line:84%
offering fewer possibilities
could be called mercy.

00:15:32.755 --> 00:15:33.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:36.960 align:middle line:84%
Has this experience
changed your life?

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUTON: In every
possible way, down

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.683 align:middle line:90%
to the finest granular degree.

00:15:41.683 --> 00:15:43.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you a
better person for it?

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:44.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: I'd like to think so.

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.720 align:middle line:84%
That will be
something, probably,

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:46.845 align:middle line:90%
for other people to decide.

00:15:46.845 --> 00:15:48.690 align:middle line:90%
But I will say this.

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:52.800 align:middle line:84%
Many times when I'm sharing
my experience with people,

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.600 align:middle line:84%
I feel something
filling the room.

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.185 align:middle line:84%
And what's very
rewarding is when

00:15:56.185 --> 00:15:57.810 align:middle line:84%
a few people come up
afterwards and say

00:15:57.810 --> 00:15:59.050 align:middle line:90%
they felt the same thing.

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's because
one of the things that

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:04.770 align:middle line:84%
was said to me was
everything is interconnected,

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:07.270 align:middle line:84%
and it's important to pay
attention to our relationships.

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:11.193 align:middle line:84%
So I think that improved my
sense of empathy with people,

00:16:11.193 --> 00:16:13.110 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's what
they're responding to.

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:15.510 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Is there any fear
involved in this, Jim,

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:17.035 align:middle line:10%
when you're in this state?

00:16:17.035 --> 00:16:17.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: Not at all.

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:18.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing.

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:20.373 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUTON: No, for me, it
was just pure acceptance.

00:16:20.373 --> 00:16:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And like Dr. Moody says,
there's a loss of fear of death.

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:26.980 align:middle line:84%
I did notice
something interesting

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:28.500 align:middle line:84%
when I was first
sharing my story.

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:31.230 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to talk about
it in the present tense.

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:33.210 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Moody, one morning
on an interview,

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:35.520 align:middle line:84%
said a lot of people who
have this experience use

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:36.360 align:middle line:90%
the present tense.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.740 align:middle line:90%
It's called [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:39.030 align:middle line:90%
And it's an odd--

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:42.990 align:middle line:84%
I think Plato used this
turn of phrase, if you will.

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:45.210 align:middle line:84%
But it was really interesting
how it is an instinct.

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's because that
moment always lives for us.

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:49.050 align:middle line:90%
It does not fade.

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:50.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At what
point did the pain,

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:52.980 align:middle line:90%
the physical pain go away?

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:55.792 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUTON: Well, when I awoke,
when I came out of the coma,

00:16:55.792 --> 00:16:57.750 align:middle line:84%
I would say it was another
week before I really

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.700 align:middle line:84%
had much of a memory,
because still coming out

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:00.270 align:middle line:90%
of the anesthesia.

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:01.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, you're groggy
and stuff like that.

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:02.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: Oh, gosh, yes.

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And so my first
memory was actually

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:06.000 align:middle line:90%
in a rehabilitation hospital.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.349 align:middle line:84%
And by now, I'm on all
kinds of painkillers.

00:17:08.349 --> 00:17:10.349 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you on your
own lungs by this time?

00:17:10.349 --> 00:17:10.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: Yes.

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:11.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:12.588 align:middle line:84%
The only thing I
really noticed was

00:17:12.588 --> 00:17:16.440 align:middle line:84%
this huge scar running down my
leg and a cage my leg was in.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.420 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't even aware of
some of the injuries

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:19.770 align:middle line:90%
until they told me them.

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:21.750 align:middle line:84%
I was having no
trouble breathing.

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:22.550 align:middle line:90%
My ribs--

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:24.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm amazed
you're still alive.

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:25.109 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUTON: [LAUGHS]
I know, right?

00:17:25.109 --> 00:17:25.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's incredible.

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:27.359 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUTON: Still this
side of the grass.

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:28.159 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:28.159 --> 00:17:30.165 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But would you
go through this again?

00:17:30.165 --> 00:17:32.970 align:middle line:10%
>>BRUTON: You know,
someone asked me--

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:34.172 align:middle line:10%
let me answer it this way.

00:17:34.172 --> 00:17:35.880 align:middle line:84%
Someone asked me--
someone who's actually

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.880 align:middle line:84%
a vice president of the American
Psychical Institute in New York

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:42.570 align:middle line:84%
that William James in the 1800s
founded, she said on that day,

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:44.472 align:middle line:84%
did you have a bad
premonition about flying?

00:17:44.472 --> 00:17:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And I said, that's a perfect
question for you to ask.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.750 align:middle line:84%
I said, but let's take
it out a little further.

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:52.230 align:middle line:84%
Beyond premonition, if I'd
had full knowledge of what

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:53.775 align:middle line:84%
was getting ready
to happen, would I

00:17:53.775 --> 00:17:56.250 align:middle line:84%
have had the guts to get
into the cockpit anyway?

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:59.657 align:middle line:84%
Because if God says, I need
to bring you over here,

00:17:59.657 --> 00:18:01.740 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to give you
personal one-on-one time

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:03.780 align:middle line:84%
for a week, what price
is too great to pay?

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:06.670 align:middle line:84%
And do you think you're
really getting out of it?

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:10.710 align:middle line:84%
So all I can say is I'm
grateful for having gone.

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:12.930 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that I could
make the right decision

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:14.250 align:middle line:90%
to get in the cockpit anyway.

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:16.900 align:middle line:84%
But I think at least being able
to articulate the question may

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:17.880 align:middle line:90%
be enough for now.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.588 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What message
do you think you've

00:18:19.588 --> 00:18:21.330 align:middle line:10%
learned from all of this?

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:24.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUTON: I think
the big message is--

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:26.790 align:middle line:84%
one thing I was told--
it said, all the force

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:31.200 align:middle line:84%
of will you'll ever need is
found in the art of letting go.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:34.860 align:middle line:84%
Always live life in celebration
of the individual spirit,

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:39.900 align:middle line:84%
for no one and no thing can
stand before the brilliance

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:42.690 align:middle line:90%
of a truly naked soul.

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:43.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's poetic.

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:45.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUTON: That's going to be
the subject of my second book,

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:46.830 align:middle line:90%
"The Practice in Between--

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:48.000 align:middle line:90%
The Art of Letting Go."

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.440 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Are you
scared of dying?

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.610 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: Not at all.

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:51.410 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:52.918 align:middle line:84%
Because it's like
changing channels.

00:18:52.918 --> 00:18:54.960 align:middle line:84%
You know, when you change
channels on television,

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.000 align:middle line:84%
you even think about what
you just left behind.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.460 align:middle line:84%
You're thinking about, OK,
this is what's in front of me.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:00.550 align:middle line:90%
And it's a lot like that.

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's
also almost a waking up

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:05.430 align:middle line:90%
into who you more really are.

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And you realize this
was like a dream

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:10.200 align:middle line:84%
and we were reading from a
script, and the lights came up

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.120 align:middle line:90%
and the curtains closed.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:15.600 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: For some people
who have these experiences,

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.730 align:middle line:10%
they see loved ones.

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:20.430 align:middle line:90%
They see Jesus.

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:22.290 align:middle line:90%
They think they see God.

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:24.600 align:middle line:90%
They definitely see angels.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.010 align:middle line:90%
You had none of that.

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:27.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: Right.

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And I have a
particular perspective

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:33.780 align:middle line:84%
I want to vet out on that,
in that we see life here

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:35.070 align:middle line:90%
through the filters we want.

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:35.830 align:middle line:84%
You know, when we
look in a mirror,

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:38.820 align:middle line:84%
we see the best-looking person,
and there's no sweeter sound

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:40.200 align:middle line:90%
to our ears than our own name.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.330 align:middle line:84%
But on the other
side, we see life

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:43.730 align:middle line:90%
through the filters we need.

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And when we look through
the mirror there,

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:48.960 align:middle line:84%
we see an image based
on truth, warts and all.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And I've wondered if,
on the other side,

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:56.640 align:middle line:84%
if we really are seeing
those we think we know,

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.710 align:middle line:84%
or if they're just helping
spirits that are there

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:01.710 align:middle line:84%
to kind of tell you to stop
hyperventilating, you know,

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:02.683 align:middle line:90%
talk you off the ledge.

00:20:02.683 --> 00:20:04.350 align:middle line:84%
You're dead, but
you're alive, you know.

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:05.130 align:middle line:90%
It's just your body.

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:05.430 align:middle line:90%
You're OK.

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:05.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Don't worry.

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:06.290 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry.

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:07.090 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: Exactly.

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And I've really wondered if
it's that, because personally,

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:12.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, unless we
believe in some type

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.160 align:middle line:84%
of simultaneous
multiple universe thing

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.680 align:middle line:84%
where you can be everywhere
there is to be instantly,

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:20.730 align:middle line:84%
I wonder do my grandmother and
grandfather have nothing better

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:23.340 align:middle line:84%
to do than wait around
for me to show up?

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:27.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't seem like
a bad guy at all, Jim, at all.

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.910 align:middle line:90%
So let me preface all that.

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:32.910 align:middle line:84%
What are the possibilities
you see the devil?

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:34.110 align:middle line:10%
Is that conceivable?

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUTON: I think
that we project

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:38.700 align:middle line:90%
a lot of that ourselves.

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:41.280 align:middle line:84%
There's an old saying where a
mystic could meditate and rise

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.090 align:middle line:90%
above the body.

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:44.430 align:middle line:90%
And one day he went to hell.

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And he's standing on
the cliffs looking up

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:47.550 align:middle line:90%
out upon the plains below.

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:49.410 align:middle line:84%
And he sees all
these tiny fires.

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And he looked beside
him and he saw Lucifer.

00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, what
are all the fires?

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And Lucifer said, these are the
individual souls in torment.

00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And the man said, I guess
you stay pretty busy.

00:20:58.500 --> 00:20:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And Lucifer said,
what do you mean?

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.290 align:middle line:84%
Because keeping
those fires going.

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:03.180 align:middle line:84%
Lucifer said, you
don't understand.

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:06.370 align:middle line:90%
They bring the fires themselves.

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:08.350 align:middle line:90%
We create our reality.

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And if we-- and we
go to where our--

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:13.710 align:middle line:84%
to use one phrase, a
vibrational frequency.

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:15.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know when
you're around people

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.070 align:middle line:90%
who make you feel really good.

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:19.740 align:middle line:84%
They believe in you, and
you feel a certain way.

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And then you're
around people who

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.043 align:middle line:84%
may be trying to bring you
down, and you feel that way too.

00:21:24.043 --> 00:21:26.460 align:middle line:84%
And some people just don't
seem to be happy unless they're

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:27.813 align:middle line:90%
miserable about something.

00:21:27.813 --> 00:21:29.730 align:middle line:84%
These are the people who
take their own fires.

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:31.188 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Do you
wish you would have

00:21:31.188 --> 00:21:36.240 align:middle line:10%
had one of the typical
near-death experiences?

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.100 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUTON: I think I was
given exactly what I

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:39.400 align:middle line:90%
needed at the time.

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that place
only existed for the time

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:47.220 align:middle line:84%
I was there, and I'm pretty
sure that one of these days when

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:50.910 align:middle line:84%
it's finally time to either
go short-term or go long-term,

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:53.550 align:middle line:84%
I'll have again what I
need, and it'll probably

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:56.388 align:middle line:84%
fall in line, perhaps, with
more of what has been reported.

00:21:56.388 --> 00:21:58.180 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: When you get
out of the coma, Jim,

00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:02.130 align:middle line:10%
do you meet with a therapist
or a psychiatrist or anybody

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:05.372 align:middle line:10%
like that to kind of
take you through this?

00:22:05.372 --> 00:22:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUTON: See, that's
the important part,

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:10.147 align:middle line:84%
is after you have a near-death
experience-- remember

00:22:10.147 --> 00:22:12.730 align:middle line:84%
how you were asking how do you
know it wasn't a hallucination?

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:13.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:14.837 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUTON: Well, one
of the after-effects

00:22:14.837 --> 00:22:16.350 align:middle line:90%
are, you blow up light bulbs.

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:17.550 align:middle line:90%
Your computer acts strange.

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:19.110 align:middle line:90%
The television turns on and off.

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:21.360 align:middle line:84%
I have a friend who has an
NDE who has electric car,

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.517 align:middle line:84%
and the dashboard is
going crazy all the time.

00:22:23.517 --> 00:22:25.350 align:middle line:10%
These are the things
that certainly tell you

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:26.090 align:middle line:10%
it's not a hallucination.

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:26.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: After the fact.

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:28.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: After the fact.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And then following that,
as you sort of say, OK,

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:33.570 align:middle line:90%
what happens now?

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:36.000 align:middle line:84%
Is what was true
yesterday true today?

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.800 align:middle line:90%
This is the integration phase.

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:41.430 align:middle line:84%
And while PMH says this
could be seven to 10 years,

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:43.020 align:middle line:84%
honestly, I think
it's a lifetime.

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:44.940 align:middle line:84%
I think you're
every day waking up

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:48.210 align:middle line:84%
to being a new person
with new insights

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:52.380 align:middle line:84%
and just everything
is new all the time.

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:54.480 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's
important to remember

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:59.850 align:middle line:84%
that as you're processing
the integration phase.

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:01.890 align:middle line:84%
The challenge is
finding a therapist

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:04.950 align:middle line:84%
who will recognize the
validity of your experience.

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And I will say this, that
with a 78% divorce rate

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.010 align:middle line:84%
in the near-death world,
because you change so--

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:11.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: After the fact?

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:11.970 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: Yes.

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:13.005 align:middle line:90%
You change so fundamentally.

00:23:13.005 --> 00:23:13.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUTON: It
introduces an ambiguity

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:15.888 align:middle line:90%
into the relationship.

00:23:15.888 --> 00:23:17.430 align:middle line:84%
There's no relationship
that welcomes

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:18.970 align:middle line:90%
this type of ambiguity.

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:21.900 align:middle line:84%
So when you go to see
a marriage therapist

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:26.010 align:middle line:84%
and try to find a way to
reconcile these differences,

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:29.430 align:middle line:84%
if you don't find
a therapist who

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:32.160 align:middle line:84%
does recognize that validity,
it can be a little bit

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.210 align:middle line:90%
two against one.

00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:34.560 align:middle line:90%
I would say don't go.

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:38.730 align:middle line:84%
Do not go until you find
someone who can be open to that

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:43.090 align:middle line:84%
and help you understand
what you're going through.

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:45.480 align:middle line:84%
IANDS, the International
Association of Near-Death

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.010 align:middle line:90%
Studies, does have a website.

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:50.580 align:middle line:84%
They do have a
page that indicates

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:52.140 align:middle line:84%
where some of these
therapists who

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:54.850 align:middle line:84%
are NDE-friendly, we'll call,
are throughout the United

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:55.890 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:57.450 align:middle line:84%
I would say it's
well worth your time

00:23:57.450 --> 00:23:59.880 align:middle line:84%
trying to find someone like
that who can sort of speak

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.950 align:middle line:84%
both languages, you know,
who can understand what

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:03.467 align:middle line:90%
your spouse is going through.

00:24:03.467 --> 00:24:05.550 align:middle line:84%
Because in this, there are
no good and bad people,

00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:06.810 align:middle line:90%
just overwhelmed people.

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:08.935 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's interesting,
though, that the divorce

00:24:08.935 --> 00:24:09.990 align:middle line:90%
rate is that high.

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:11.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUTON: Which is
about 50% higher

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:12.570 align:middle line:90%
than an already epidemic rate.

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:13.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Because you've changed.

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:14.400 align:middle line:90%
They haven't.

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:15.000 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: That's right.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.618 align:middle line:84%
And they're just
like, where are you?

00:24:16.618 --> 00:24:17.910 align:middle line:90%
Where are our hopes and dreams?

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:22.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who initiates
the divorce, generally?

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:23.377 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: I don't know.

00:24:23.377 --> 00:24:25.960 align:middle line:84%
You know, I would say generally,
probably the person who feels

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:27.730 align:middle line:84%
left behind, because
the person who's

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:30.040 align:middle line:84%
had the experience, many
times they don't recognize

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.565 align:middle line:90%
just how much they've changed.

00:24:31.565 --> 00:24:33.190 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the person
who is left behind--

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:34.065 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They see it.

00:24:34.065 --> 00:24:35.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUTON: To very
subtle degrees.

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:36.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I see.

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:37.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUTON: And they're
like, OK, I thought

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:38.380 align:middle line:90%
we were going to do this.

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:40.088 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's not
important to me anymore.

00:24:40.088 --> 00:24:41.170 align:middle line:90%
My values have changed.

00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:44.410 align:middle line:84%
Or something big
happens, and the way

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:46.420 align:middle line:84%
you all would have
responded to it as a team

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:47.960 align:middle line:90%
has now changed as well.

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:49.930 align:middle line:84%
So just add that up
over days and days,

00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:52.090 align:middle line:84%
and you can see where
this schism can occur.

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:55.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Author Anita
Moorjani was on the Gaia show

00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:56.430 align:middle line:90%
"Inspirations."

00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:57.230 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at her.

00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUTON: She's
an amazing story.

00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:01.510 align:middle line:10%
>>ANITA MOORJANI: When I
started to open my eyes,

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:03.760 align:middle line:10%
everybody was really
shocked that I

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:05.360 align:middle line:10%
was coming out of the coma.

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:06.160 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Was that your
vitals started coming back

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:08.590 align:middle line:90%
and your--

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:09.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Yep.

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:14.290 align:middle line:10%
And within a day, I didn't
need the oxygen anymore.

00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:16.060 align:middle line:10%
By the following day,
I was telling them

00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:18.310 align:middle line:10%
they can remove the
food tube, that I

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:20.410 align:middle line:10%
was ready to eat solid foods.

00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:22.420 align:middle line:90%
The doctors wouldn't believe me.

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And they said, no, we've got
to keep the food tube in.

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.650 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no, I'm ready.

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:28.430 align:middle line:90%
I know I'm going to be fine.

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:30.580 align:middle line:84%
And I started to
tell them things,

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:34.780 align:middle line:84%
like I recognized the doctor
who was there to see us

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:36.370 align:middle line:90%
when we entered the hospital.

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:38.350 align:middle line:84%
You know, when he walked
in the room, I said,

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:39.730 align:middle line:90%
good afternoon, Dr. Chan.

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And he said, how did
you recognize me?

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And I said, aren't
you the doctor

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:47.600 align:middle line:84%
that was there when we
came into the hospital?

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And he said, but
you were in a coma.

00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:50.790 align:middle line:90%
How could you have seen me?

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And things like
that were happening.

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And then I was
saying to my husband,

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:56.650 align:middle line:84%
isn't he the doctor
that said I'm not going

00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:58.180 align:middle line:90%
to make it through the night?

00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And my husband said he didn't
even say that in the room.

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:03.567 align:middle line:84%
He said that outside,
down the corridor

00:26:03.567 --> 00:26:04.525 align:middle line:90%
in the nurses' station.

00:26:04.525 --> 00:26:05.525 align:middle line:90%
>>GARR: Oh, my goodness.

00:26:05.525 --> 00:26:08.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: And so all kinds
of these things were happening.

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And I was telling them all
the procedures they did.

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:15.020 align:middle line:84%
I said, oh, at 5:00
AM yesterday morning--

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:15.820 align:middle line:90%
>>GARR: Wow.

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:18.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: --you were
removing fluid from my lungs.

00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:20.300 align:middle line:84%
You put a needle
through my back.

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And again, the doctor said,
but how did you even know that?

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.010 align:middle line:84%
So they knew that
something had happened.

00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:32.035 align:middle line:84%
But within four days, my
tumors had shrunk by 70%.

00:26:32.035 --> 00:26:33.490 align:middle line:90%
>>GARR: 70%?

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:35.230 align:middle line:90%
What were the doctors saying?

00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:36.813 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: They
didn't even know what

00:26:36.813 --> 00:26:38.560 align:middle line:90%
to write in my medical records.

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:41.813 align:middle line:84%
My oncologist who was treating
me, he actually said that.

00:26:41.813 --> 00:26:43.480 align:middle line:84%
He said, I don't even
know what to write

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.220 align:middle line:90%
in your medical records.

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And he kind of joked
and made this gesture

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.880 align:middle line:84%
of throwing it in the
dustbin, in the waste bin.

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:51.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GARR: Because science
couldn't explain it.

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:51.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MOORJANI: Couldn't.

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:52.840 align:middle line:90%
And he couldn't explain it.

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:54.130 align:middle line:90%
Science couldn't explain it.

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:54.930 align:middle line:90%
>>GARR: Yeah.

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:55.755 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:55.755 --> 00:26:57.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MOORJANI: But
the feeling I had

00:26:57.130 --> 00:27:02.260 align:middle line:84%
in me was not that my body
was going to heal quickly.

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:04.990 align:middle line:84%
It was that I was
already healed,

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:07.540 align:middle line:90%
but my body had to catch up.

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:08.800 align:middle line:90%
That was the feeling.

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:11.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She had an amazing
experience, didn't she?

00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:11.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: She did.

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:14.380 align:middle line:84%
I listened to all of her books
when I was first digging in.

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:16.618 align:middle line:84%
And she's an amazing person
with an amazing story.

00:27:16.618 --> 00:27:18.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
see any similarities

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:20.170 align:middle line:90%
between your situation and hers?

00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:21.610 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: Not so much, really.

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:22.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're all
different, aren't they?

00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:24.917 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUTON: They are different,
but what's interesting

00:27:24.917 --> 00:27:27.160 align:middle line:84%
is how the effects can
be the same, from not

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:30.190 align:middle line:84%
being afraid of death to
a greater sense of empathy

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:31.630 align:middle line:90%
and wanting to help.

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you any
more psychically inclined

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:36.610 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that?

00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUTON: I've had a few
really interesting experiences.

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:42.550 align:middle line:84%
I'll say there have been some
experiences along the lines

00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:45.910 align:middle line:84%
of healing, but what's
interesting is I've actually

00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:50.003 align:middle line:84%
seen my two children and
my wife change appearance

00:27:50.003 --> 00:27:51.670 align:middle line:84%
in front of me, like
their faces change.

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:52.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Shapeshifting.

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:53.400 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: Yes.

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And I realized in
all three cases,

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:58.180 align:middle line:84%
the children were going
to her office party,

00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:01.180 align:middle line:84%
and she would lease
jets, so it was going

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:03.048 align:middle line:90%
to be a very good office party.

00:28:03.048 --> 00:28:05.590 align:middle line:84%
But they had to be on their best
behavior and nicely dressed.

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:08.617 align:middle line:84%
So in that case, their
energy state was heightened,

00:28:08.617 --> 00:28:11.200 align:middle line:84%
and they were having to be other
people than who they normally

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.000 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.900 align:middle line:84%
With my former wife, she was
going to a community play.

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:18.100 align:middle line:90%
She had a starring role.

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And as she walked up the
sidewalk with her clothes

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:22.690 align:middle line:84%
for her scene changes, the
same thing was going on.

00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:24.180 align:middle line:90%
She looked Spanish.

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:25.180 align:middle line:90%
Then she looked Italian.

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:26.912 align:middle line:90%
And I knew what was going on.

00:28:26.912 --> 00:28:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized her
energy state is higher,

00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:31.090 align:middle line:84%
and she's having to be someone
else other than who she is.

00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:32.420 align:middle line:90%
She has to be her characters.

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:35.493 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's almost
like a visual component

00:28:35.493 --> 00:28:36.910 align:middle line:84%
to empathy, where
you can actually

00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:40.120 align:middle line:84%
see the emotional state within
someone, and it projects out

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:42.160 align:middle line:84%
and appears to
change their shape.

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:45.160 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Do you have any
nightmares or anything

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.680 align:middle line:10%
like that, after effects?

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:46.930 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: Not at all.

00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:47.420 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:47.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing.

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:48.220 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: I do not.

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:48.500 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:50.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that
unusual that you don't?

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:51.280 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: No.

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:55.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that
a lot of NDEers do.

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:56.230 align:middle line:90%
But I will say this.

00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:59.260 align:middle line:84%
Most of us wake up at odd
hours of the night, 2:00, 3:00,

00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:00.730 align:middle line:90%
4:00 AM in the morning.

00:29:00.730 --> 00:29:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very aware
that I'm coming back

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:06.250 align:middle line:84%
from somewhere else, not that
I have a lot of memories of it,

00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:08.600 align:middle line:84%
but just that my mind
works very differently.

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:11.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm perceiving information
in a more non-linear fashion

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:12.460 align:middle line:90%
than a linear fashion.

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:13.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it emotional?

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:13.450 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: No.

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:15.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, do you
find yourself crying

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:16.390 align:middle line:90%
more or anything like that?

00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:18.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUTON: Well,
that's interesting.

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:21.990 align:middle line:84%
I would, overall, say I'm
not that emotional a person.

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:25.640 align:middle line:84%
However, there are some stories
I hear, usually about sacrifice

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:27.797 align:middle line:84%
that people are making
for others, that really

00:29:27.797 --> 00:29:28.880 align:middle line:90%
goes straight to my heart.

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think I probably have
shed a tear or two unexpectedly

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:35.060 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly in
hearing these stories,

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:37.370 align:middle line:84%
because it is such a
beautiful side of humanity.

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:38.870 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Were the
medical personnel

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:40.850 align:middle line:10%
interested in your NDE?

00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:42.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: My nurse was.

00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:44.420 align:middle line:84%
She's the first person
I told my experience to.

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And when I did,
she started crying.

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:46.880 align:middle line:90%
And I said, why are you crying?

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.450 align:middle line:84%
She said, I don't
want you to die.

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:50.180 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, you're a nurse
in a hospital, you know.

00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:51.180 align:middle line:90%
You see it all the time.

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:52.740 align:middle line:90%
She goes, but you're magical.

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:53.540 align:middle line:90%
She knew already.

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:54.330 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK.

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:54.620 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean by that?

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:55.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She'd
heard this before,

00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:56.420 align:middle line:90%
though, I take it, from others.

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:57.680 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: She might have.

00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:00.260 align:middle line:84%
But in my case, she
said, everybody here

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:02.780 align:middle line:84%
gets one doctor a day
for, like, 10 minutes,

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:03.788 align:middle line:90%
because we're all busy.

00:30:03.788 --> 00:30:06.080 align:middle line:84%
For some reason, you have
three to five doctors in here

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.288 align:middle line:90%
for up to an hour and a half.

00:30:07.288 --> 00:30:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And I walk by
listening, and you're

00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:11.390 align:middle line:84%
talking about life, the
universe, and everything,

00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:12.890 align:middle line:84%
and nothing about
your medical case.

00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:14.400 align:middle line:84%
She says, I've never
seen anything like it.

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:15.320 align:middle line:90%
They want to be in your space.

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:17.112 align:middle line:84%
And one of them wants
you to be in business

00:30:17.112 --> 00:30:20.240 align:middle line:84%
so badly he has you at night
on international conference

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.400 align:middle line:84%
calls with your leg up
in the air in its cage,

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:24.590 align:middle line:84%
and you're doped
up on painkillers.

00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:26.540 align:middle line:84%
So I think that
was where I started

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:29.900 align:middle line:84%
to see the emergence of this
hyper empathy, if you will.

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:33.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jim, Regina Meredith
interviewed author Rajiv Parti,

00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:35.900 align:middle line:84%
who talked about his
near-death experience

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:38.200 align:middle line:90%
and how it changed his life.

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.960 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
When you came back--

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:43.450 align:middle line:10%
let's kind of go through a
little bit chronologically.

00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:46.157 align:middle line:10%
First of all, you had to
go through withdrawals--

00:30:46.157 --> 00:30:46.990 align:middle line:10%
>>RAJIV PARTI: Yeah.

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:49.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: --from all of the
drugs that you had been on.

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:51.610 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: But it was
not that difficult.

00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:52.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Because you'd
been through this experience.

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:54.130 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: Through
this experience.

00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:54.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah.

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:55.695 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: I could-- yeah.

00:30:55.695 --> 00:30:57.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: And
another thing you

00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:59.740 align:middle line:84%
did that was interesting to
start making your life more

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:02.950 align:middle line:84%
manageable so you could even
imagine how you could continue

00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:07.120 align:middle line:84%
to afford to do what you
do without your job was you

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:08.800 align:middle line:90%
swapped houses with somebody.

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.840 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah, there was a--

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:15.280 align:middle line:84%
the way the universe
works, you know, my house

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:17.680 align:middle line:84%
was almost a $3
million house, which

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.458 align:middle line:90%
is a big house in Bakersfield.

00:31:19.458 --> 00:31:20.750 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to sell those houses.

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:22.127 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:31:22.127 --> 00:31:24.220 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: And there
was a plastic surgeon

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:28.060 align:middle line:84%
who had a small house
from his residency days.

00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to downsize my
lifestyle and everything.

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:34.062 align:middle line:90%
And he wanted to upscale--

00:31:34.062 --> 00:31:35.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Super size.

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:36.520 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Super size it.

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:38.360 align:middle line:84%
So we literally
exchanged our houses.

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:40.900 align:middle line:84%
There was no real
estate agent involved.

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:43.040 align:middle line:84%
We just went to
an escrow company,

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:45.520 align:middle line:90%
and we did the paperwork.

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:48.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Now,
after that happened,

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:50.260 align:middle line:84%
how did your wife
feel on the news

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:52.480 align:middle line:84%
that you were going to be
leaving your job, which you

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:56.305 align:middle line:90%
did, and downsizing your life?

00:31:56.305 --> 00:31:58.180 align:middle line:84%
Because she'd gotten
used to all these perks.

00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:00.260 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: She was
used to these perks.

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:05.020 align:middle line:84%
But in the beginning part,
because of her marriage

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:07.270 align:middle line:90%
and everything she supported me.

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And marriage was much,
much better also,

00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:11.530 align:middle line:84%
because I was a
different person.

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:12.730 align:middle line:90%
I was more sympathetic.

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:16.820 align:middle line:90%
I was more listening to her.

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:20.840 align:middle line:84%
But then second part will
come when we reach there.

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:21.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yes.

00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:23.600 align:middle line:90%
And then your son--

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:26.030 align:middle line:84%
finally one day you were
all in the kitchen together,

00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:30.680 align:middle line:84%
and you finally asked him, do
you even want to be a doctor?

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:32.700 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: I finally asked
him, and he said, no.

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And he had just
flunked his exam.

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:35.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah.

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:39.410 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: And he was expecting
me to be very angry.

00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:41.225 align:middle line:90%
But I said, no, beta.

00:32:41.225 --> 00:32:42.740 align:middle line:90%
Beta means my son.

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:45.080 align:middle line:90%
Beta do whatever you want to do.

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And he said he wants
to go in computers.

00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:50.120 align:middle line:84%
And fast-forwarding
to now, he's just

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:53.510 align:middle line:84%
graduated from computers in
University of San Francisco,

00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:55.850 align:middle line:84%
and found his job
and his passion.

00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:56.810 align:middle line:90%
And he's very happy.

00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:57.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah,
that's wonderful.

00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:00.188 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: He's not making
the money he would have made

00:33:00.188 --> 00:33:01.160 align:middle line:90%
as a doctor, but--

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: But
he loves his life.

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:04.130 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: He loves his
life, and he's happy.

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:04.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah.

00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:05.570 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:09.440 align:middle line:84%
And so now you've
informed everyone.

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:11.540 align:middle line:84%
You've informed your
colleagues you're leaving.

00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:12.340 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah.

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:15.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: And now you
start meditating regularly.

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:15.860 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah.

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:17.652 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: And you
start finding your way.

00:33:17.652 --> 00:33:19.330 align:middle line:84%
How am I supposed
to help people?

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:20.720 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah.

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:23.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some people go through
a tremendous metamorphosis,

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:24.630 align:middle line:90%
don't they?

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:25.430 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: They do.

00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:27.120 align:middle line:84%
He nailed it, too,
in so many ways.

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:27.920 align:middle line:90%
You do.

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:29.990 align:middle line:84%
You tend to want to
simplify your life.

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:33.605 align:middle line:84%
And the things that had
more importance, that

00:33:33.605 --> 00:33:36.260 align:middle line:84%
are, we can say, kind
of on the peripheral,

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:38.120 align:middle line:90%
don't have quite as much luster.

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:40.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why did his
marriage get better?

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.065 align:middle line:90%
Yours did not.

00:33:42.065 --> 00:33:45.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUTON: Not everyone is ready
to walk this path, even as

00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:46.190 align:middle line:90%
a companion.

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:49.195 align:middle line:84%
And people deal with
that type of stress

00:33:49.195 --> 00:33:50.570 align:middle line:84%
and that type of,
as I mentioned,

00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:52.350 align:middle line:90%
ambiguity in different ways.

00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:54.980 align:middle line:84%
Some people are in
greater need of certainty.

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:58.250 align:middle line:84%
I will say, noticing
that their culture is

00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:00.290 align:middle line:84%
Indian, that's
much more friendly

00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:03.140 align:middle line:90%
to a non-dual mentality.

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:04.168 align:middle line:90%
Here we're very dual.

00:34:04.168 --> 00:34:05.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From the get-go.

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:05.930 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: Very binary.

00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:07.070 align:middle line:90%
You either are or you aren't.

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:08.612 align:middle line:84%
You're either on
board or you're not.

00:34:08.612 --> 00:34:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And ambiguity, there's
no room for that.

00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:12.679 align:middle line:84%
So I think that introduces
a certain challenge

00:34:12.679 --> 00:34:13.699 align:middle line:90%
from a cultural level.

00:34:13.699 --> 00:34:17.822 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jim, what did you
learn about life since your NDE?

00:34:17.822 --> 00:34:19.239 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUTON: He touched
on one thing,

00:34:19.239 --> 00:34:23.949 align:middle line:84%
and I could mention this,
that the problem in trying

00:34:23.949 --> 00:34:27.010 align:middle line:84%
to figure out what we're
doing here, you know, what

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:31.780 align:middle line:84%
our purpose in life is, many
times through our parents

00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:36.290 align:middle line:84%
or our friends or other social
influences, they'll try to say,

00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:39.469 align:middle line:84%
well, this is what you should
do based on you're good at this.

00:34:39.469 --> 00:34:41.889 align:middle line:84%
But the challenge
there is that you

00:34:41.889 --> 00:34:44.903 align:middle line:84%
could be in danger of
living someone else's life.

00:34:44.903 --> 00:34:46.820 align:middle line:84%
And if instead, you don't
want to be a doctor,

00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:49.000 align:middle line:84%
but say, you want to be
an artist or a dancer,

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.679 align:middle line:84%
you know you're going to hear
about it from most families.

00:34:51.679 --> 00:34:53.110 align:middle line:90%
But what if that's your destiny?

00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:55.150 align:middle line:84%
What if that's your
contribution to making

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:56.980 align:middle line:90%
the world a much better place?

00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:00.105 align:middle line:84%
And we need to be much more
supportive of each other

00:35:00.105 --> 00:35:01.480 align:middle line:84%
and be each other's
cheerleaders.

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:04.390 align:middle line:84%
We really have nothing to
lose in the end by doing this,

00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:06.640 align:middle line:84%
because you can go
out there and feel

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:10.420 align:middle line:84%
free to find your own answers
and wherever life takes you,

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:12.610 align:middle line:84%
and if that's not
the right direction,

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:13.750 align:middle line:90%
it'll become self-evident.

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:15.095 align:middle line:90%
You're a conscious human being.

00:35:15.095 --> 00:35:15.970 align:middle line:90%
You'll change course.

00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:17.428 align:middle line:84%
And again, with
our support, you'll

00:35:17.428 --> 00:35:18.770 align:middle line:90%
get to where you need to be.

00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:19.500 align:middle line:90%
That's what we need to do.

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:20.958 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Are you
in a support group

00:35:20.958 --> 00:35:23.785 align:middle line:10%
now, other people who had
NDEs, or anything like that?

00:35:23.785 --> 00:35:25.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUTON: You know,
it's interesting.

00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:27.850 align:middle line:84%
Thank heavens for our
social media today

00:35:27.850 --> 00:35:30.880 align:middle line:84%
and programs like yours, because
we do discover each other,

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:32.720 align:middle line:90%
and we find each other.

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:36.370 align:middle line:84%
And so for myself, I'd say
it's sort of been a support

00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:37.600 align:middle line:90%
group I've built myself.

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:37.990 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:38.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've
noticed that you've

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:41.410 align:middle line:84%
gotten to know a lot of
people who have written books

00:35:41.410 --> 00:35:43.540 align:middle line:84%
about NDEs and
things like that, who

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:45.700 align:middle line:84%
have gone through similar
things than you have.

00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:46.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: True.

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:47.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've kind
of migrated together.

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:48.543 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: It's true.

00:35:48.543 --> 00:35:50.128 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's part of--

00:35:50.128 --> 00:35:52.670 align:middle line:84%
I would almost say that when
you have a near-death experience

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:55.690 align:middle line:84%
it reharmonizes you to live in
the natural order of things,

00:35:55.690 --> 00:35:57.970 align:middle line:84%
whether you choose to
or not, but your feet

00:35:57.970 --> 00:35:59.720 align:middle line:84%
are pointed in the
right direction.

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And I think when
you live that truth

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:04.690 align:middle line:84%
and you walk in that
direction, you suddenly

00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:06.668 align:middle line:84%
realize other people
are walking next to you,

00:36:06.668 --> 00:36:07.960 align:middle line:90%
and you make friends with them.

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's symbolic of, like
I said, the sense of community

00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:13.600 align:middle line:84%
I've been able to build with
so many wonderful people who

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:16.270 align:middle line:84%
have this experience, and we
can speak the same language.

00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:19.330 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: If you were on
the other side already

00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:23.710 align:middle line:10%
and somebody passes on and
has a near-death experience

00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:26.980 align:middle line:10%
and you're there to greet
them, what do you tell them?

00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:29.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUTON: Again, I think
there, you actually

00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:32.020 align:middle line:84%
can see things
much more clearly.

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:33.520 align:middle line:84%
Like you can see
the life in things.

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:34.937 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
people can just

00:36:34.937 --> 00:36:36.740 align:middle line:90%
read you very well over there.

00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:39.517 align:middle line:84%
So I think in reading
this person showing up,

00:36:39.517 --> 00:36:41.350 align:middle line:84%
I would have an innate
understanding of what

00:36:41.350 --> 00:36:42.590 align:middle line:90%
they need right now.

00:36:42.590 --> 00:36:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And as I mentioned
before, if it's showing up

00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:46.600 align:middle line:84%
as a grandmother or
grandfather or Fluffy

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:49.300 align:middle line:84%
the dog or whatever,
an angelic being,

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:51.520 align:middle line:84%
I think those
helping spirits can

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:54.670 align:middle line:84%
do that in order to just
help you adjust and calm down

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:56.950 align:middle line:84%
say, OK, you know,
here's what's happened.

00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:58.420 align:middle line:90%
Here's where you are.

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:00.943 align:middle line:90%
Everything is fine.

00:37:00.943 --> 00:37:02.860 align:middle line:84%
Let me know when you
start remembering things.

00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:05.027 align:middle line:84%
I would do everything I
could to make it comfortable

00:37:05.027 --> 00:37:06.610 align:middle line:84%
for them to realize
where they are

00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:08.710 align:middle line:84%
and that they're really
much better off now.

00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:10.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When the
day comes when you

00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:14.620 align:middle line:84%
do die, will you say to
yourself, here we go again?

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:16.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUTON: [LAUGHS]
You know, you wonder.

00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:17.980 align:middle line:84%
I think someone
predicted one day

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:20.710 align:middle line:84%
I'd be 92 years old walking
across a green field

00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:23.350 align:middle line:84%
and have a stroke, so it's
just like the switch goes off.

00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:26.330 align:middle line:84%
But I'm sure that
when it happens,

00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:27.970 align:middle line:90%
I'll be totally fine with it.

00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:29.110 align:middle line:90%
I will be.

00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:30.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have another book
you said you're working on.

00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:31.510 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: I am.

00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:32.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm very excited about it.

00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:33.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's
it going to be on?

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:35.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUTON: Well, a
lot of people were--

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:39.790 align:middle line:84%
as they read the book or through
sharing it through talks,

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:41.920 align:middle line:84%
people would say, how do
we put this into practice?

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:43.420 align:middle line:90%
It resonates with us.

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And so I really
meditated a lot on that.

00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And I started pulling out
more of the experience that

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:52.990 align:middle line:84%
addresses how to create
the space in which to live

00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:54.250 align:middle line:90%
these truths, if you will.

00:37:54.250 --> 00:37:57.100 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, we can always
back it into meditation.

00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:58.990 align:middle line:84%
But the second
book will be called

00:37:58.990 --> 00:38:00.670 align:middle line:90%
"The Practice In Between--

00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:02.240 align:middle line:90%
The Art of Letting Go."

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:03.040 align:middle line:90%
And as I--

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:03.915 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I like that.

00:38:03.915 --> 00:38:04.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: Yeah.

00:38:04.850 --> 00:38:05.725 align:middle line:90%
Well, think about it.

00:38:05.725 --> 00:38:07.900 align:middle line:84%
In our world today,
there's never enough.

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:09.250 align:middle line:90%
You need that one more thing.

00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:11.083 align:middle line:84%
I need that one more
degree or that one more

00:38:11.083 --> 00:38:14.105 align:middle line:84%
car or that one more suit
or that one more job status

00:38:14.105 --> 00:38:14.905 align:middle line:90%
increase.

00:38:14.905 --> 00:38:16.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we
don't need any of it.

00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:17.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: And we don't.

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:17.880 align:middle line:90%
We have everything.

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:19.600 align:middle line:84%
When you hold a
baby, you're holding

00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:21.880 align:middle line:84%
someone who has all the
answers in the world to being

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:23.440 align:middle line:90%
a happy spiritual being.

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:24.550 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:26.840 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] What
happened is in that

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:30.850 align:middle line:84%
as we socialize, as
we go into puberty,

00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:34.215 align:middle line:84%
we're driven by this need to
conform and not stand out.

00:38:34.215 --> 00:38:36.590 align:middle line:84%
Don't be the smartest kid in
class or something like that

00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:38.630 align:middle line:84%
and embarrass your
friends or whatever.

00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And so in that
desire to conform,

00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:43.060 align:middle line:84%
I think we really bury a
lot of our individual gifts

00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:46.040 align:middle line:84%
that we have to contribute
to life around us.

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:48.730 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's important
just stop for a moment

00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:51.925 align:middle line:84%
and just, again, rather than
chase that one more thing,

00:38:51.925 --> 00:38:53.800 align:middle line:84%
which we'll be chasing
with our last breath--

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:54.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:56.975 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUTON: --let's go on an
assumption you have everything

00:38:56.975 --> 00:38:57.910 align:middle line:90%
you need right now.

00:38:57.910 --> 00:39:00.580 align:middle line:84%
You have the native
intelligence to figure out

00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:02.590 align:middle line:84%
whatever faces you
during the day,

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:04.570 align:middle line:84%
you don't always need
a degree in this.

00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:07.760 align:middle line:84%
Look, I didn't study journalism,
and I was an NBC News war

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:08.560 align:middle line:90%
correspondent.

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:10.360 align:middle line:84%
I didn't study
satellite engineering,

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:12.730 align:middle line:84%
and I shrunk a TV
truck into a backpack.

00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:14.260 align:middle line:90%
I didn't study filmmaking.

00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:17.010 align:middle line:84%
I have an Emmy for work
on "National Geographic."

00:39:17.010 --> 00:39:17.810 align:middle line:90%
There I go.

00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:18.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There you go.

00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:19.430 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: There we go.

00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:20.330 align:middle line:90%
Proof positive.

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:22.670 align:middle line:10%
It's just about being
eternally curious

00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:24.470 align:middle line:10%
and never taking
no for an answer.

00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:25.543 align:middle line:10%
And I mean curious--

00:39:25.543 --> 00:39:27.210 align:middle line:10%
be interested in the
people you're with.

00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:30.240 align:middle line:10%
Be interested in what's going
on in other people's cultures.

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And ask them and invite them to
your house to show them yours

00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:34.860 align:middle line:84%
and go to their
house and see theirs.

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:37.867 align:middle line:84%
This is how we fix the
world, one person at a time.

00:39:37.867 --> 00:39:39.950 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Jim, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:40.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUTON: Thank you, George.

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:41.210 align:middle line:90%
It's been a pleasure.

00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:42.752 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What an
amazing story, going

00:39:42.752 --> 00:39:44.780 align:middle line:84%
through his
near-death experience.

00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:46.220 align:middle line:90%
What's on the other side?

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:47.460 align:middle line:90%
Coming back.

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:51.680 align:middle line:10%
It teaches us lessons what we
can expect when that day comes.

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:52.640 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:55.370 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:58.420 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]
