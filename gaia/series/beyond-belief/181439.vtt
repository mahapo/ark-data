Edgar Cayce, with
Kevin Todeschi.

You have generated
so much publicity

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.020 align:middle line:84%
when you're on the "Coast

bit about your involvement

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.110 align:middle line:84%
with Edgar Cayce, a
fascinating individual.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.750 align:middle line:90%
We call him the American profit.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.910 align:middle line:84%
We'll get into some
of the things he did.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.392 align:middle line:90%
But how did you get involved?

00:01:13.392 --> 00:01:15.100 align:middle line:10%
>>TODESCHI: When I
was in the 11th grade,

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.940 align:middle line:10%
I went to a week-long program
at Colorado State University.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.075 align:middle line:10%
And while there, I
went to a bookstore.

00:01:20.075 --> 00:01:21.450 align:middle line:10%
And the book that
stood out to me

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.020 align:middle line:10%
was a book by Jess Stearn,
"A Profit in his Own Country,

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.430 align:middle line:10%
The Story of Young Edgar Cayce."

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And when I read
that book, I knew

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.670 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to work at
ARE from that time on.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.420 align:middle line:84%
So after I graduated from
the University of Colorado,

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.950 align:middle line:90%
I moved right to Virginia Beach.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And I have been on staff
there for the last 36 years.

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:39.450 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: I was hooked.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.971 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us a little bit
about who Edgar Cayce was.

00:01:41.971 --> 00:01:44.220 align:middle line:84%

the most documented psychic

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.180 align:middle line:90%

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.910 align:middle line:90%
He lived between 1877 and 1945.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.230 align:middle line:84%
For 43 years of his adult
life, he put himself to sleep,

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.250 align:middle line:90%
closed his eyes.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.620 align:middle line:84%
He could be given the
name and address of anyone

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.140 align:middle line:84%
anywhere in the world,
tune into that person.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And he could outline any kind
of questions they might ask.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.950 align:middle line:90%
How can I get well?

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.210 align:middle line:84%
How can I improve
my relationships?

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.180 align:middle line:90%
What's my soul's purpose?

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.980 align:middle line:90%
What can I do about this issue?

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And the responses to those
questions are called readings.

The Cayce Database consists

doctor, a simple person.

You wouldn't turn around in
the street if you saw him.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.000 align:middle line:84%
But once you spoke to
him, his voice was soft.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.730 align:middle line:90%
It was direct.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:32.690 align:middle line:90%
It was honest.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.070 align:middle line:90%
It was embracing.

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I always saw a
double pupil, a superimposure,

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.570 align:middle line:84%
as if he were looking
through eternity.

uncomfortable at times.

you had done yesterday

the real deal, wasn't he?

was the real deal.

And his desire was to
be helpful to people.

00:03:53.727 --> 00:03:56.060 align:middle line:84%
Toward the end of his life,
he actually got overwhelmed.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.619 align:middle line:84%
They used to deliver sacks
of mail to the Cayce home.

00:03:58.619 --> 00:04:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And his own readings had told
him never to give more than two

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.060 align:middle line:90%
a day.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And he told his
secretary that, just

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.510 align:middle line:84%
by walking by the sacks of
mail, he could feel the pain.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.660 align:middle line:84%
So he asked her to
book in advance.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And when he had a stroke, he
was giving eight readings a day.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And when he died, they were
book two years in advance.

>>NOORY: Didn't these
readings and the intensity

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:18.161 align:middle line:84%
of the readings
eventually do him in?

00:04:18.161 --> 00:04:19.160 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: That was it.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.690 align:middle line:84%
It was very much him
tuning into a higher

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.500 align:middle line:84%
source of consciousness,
I guess kind of

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.620 align:middle line:84%
like plugging your finger
into a light socket.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.150 align:middle line:90%
And that just wore him down.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And the demand for his help
toward the end of his life

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.680 align:middle line:90%
was really overwhelming.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.055 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He used to talk a
lot about the Akashic records.

00:04:33.055 --> 00:04:33.854 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: He did.

00:04:33.854 --> 00:04:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are they?

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.180 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: Well, Akashic comes
from the Sanskrit word Akasha,

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.662 align:middle line:90%
which means boundless space.

00:04:39.662 --> 00:04:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And according to
Edgar Cayce, there

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.730 align:middle line:84%
is this etheric field
around the Earth that

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.040 align:middle line:84%
basically contains
everything that has ever

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.360 align:middle line:90%
been done in the Earth.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.054 align:middle line:84%
And according to Cayce,
your thoughts, your deeds,

00:04:51.054 --> 00:04:52.220 align:middle line:90%
everything's recorded there.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.332 align:middle line:84%
And as unusual as
that may sound--

00:04:54.332 --> 00:04:55.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure many of
your listeners are

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.220 align:middle line:84%
aware of that near-death
experience, where someone dies,

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.840 align:middle line:84%
and then they have
a life review.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:00.950 align:middle line:84%
Cayce would say,
you're actually tuning

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.180 align:middle line:90%
into your own Akashic record.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.790 align:middle line:84%
It's a record of everything
that the soul has done

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.200 align:middle line:90%
since its come into the Earth.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.959 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we
change those records?

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:09.750 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: That's an
interesting question.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.500 align:middle line:84%
And I think it is possible that
you can change those records.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.470 align:middle line:84%
Another topic in the
readings is essentially

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:16.550 align:middle line:90%
the illusion of time.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.970 align:middle line:84%
But Cayce suggests
it's possible to alter

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.010 align:middle line:84%
the records of the
future, what's happening

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:23.190 align:middle line:90%
to you in the present.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's even
possible somehow to change

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.330 align:middle line:90%
the records of the past.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.205 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What's fascinating,
Kevin, is that--

00:05:28.205 --> 00:05:31.280 align:middle line:10%
I was growing up as
a Roman Catholic,

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.680 align:middle line:10%
going to catechism
classes, they always

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.080 align:middle line:10%
talked to us about
"The Good Book,"

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.380 align:middle line:10%
that when you died there'd
be that book of your records.

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:40.630 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing, isn't it?

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: The Bible
calls it The Book of Life

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.770 align:middle line:90%
or God's Book of Remembrance.

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.630 align:middle line:90%
It's definitely the same thing.

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:46.670 align:middle line:90%
It's the soul's journey.

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you pass and
you get up to that point

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.500 align:middle line:84%
before they decide to send
you to heaven or hell,

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.380 align:middle line:84%
is there somebody there,
like a spirit guide, who

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.700 align:middle line:84%
flips through the pages going,
George, when you were eight,

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.310 align:middle line:90%
remember you did this?

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:04.310 align:middle line:90%
Is it like that?

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.192 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: Well, perhaps
not exactly like that.

00:06:07.192 --> 00:06:08.900 align:middle line:84%
But I would say it's
kind of like you get

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.550 align:middle line:90%
to see a review of your life.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And thankfully, Cayce said that
you get credit for your intent.

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.040 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, we have
the right intent,

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.340 align:middle line:90%
but things don't work out.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.590 align:middle line:90%
We get credit for your intent.

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.180 align:middle line:90%
You get credit for the try.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think, very often, we
try to do the right thing,

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:24.170 align:middle line:90%
but it doesn't work out.

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:27.080 align:middle line:84%
He also said that, if we do
something with the wrong intent

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.600 align:middle line:84%
and it works out great, we
don't get credit for that.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We don't
get credit for that.

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:31.280 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: No, we don't
get credit for that.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But if somebody--

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.300 align:middle line:84%
let's just say a serial killer,
for lack of a better phrase--

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.310 align:middle line:84%
is doing what they
do on this planet,

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.230 align:middle line:90%
which are horrendous things--

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.770 align:middle line:84%
horrendous things-- what
happens when they die?

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.154 align:middle line:84%
And what is their
Akashic record look like?

00:06:48.154 --> 00:06:49.570 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: Well,
my understanding

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.670 align:middle line:84%
is that you get to see
your normal life review.

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.070 align:middle line:84%
And then you get to see
the life review again,

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:59.130 align:middle line:84%
feeling the pain that you cause
for every individual involved.

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:01.064 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
if you kill someone,

00:07:01.064 --> 00:07:02.980 align:middle line:84%
you get to experience
the pain of their family

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.060 align:middle line:90%
and their friends.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And to me, the
intensity of that pain

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:08.500 align:middle line:84%
would be a horrendous
experience.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.530 align:middle line:84%
So the soul has to
of its own accord

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.690 align:middle line:84%
take account for
everything its done

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.890 align:middle line:90%
and learn to do differently.

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:18.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you make amends
for your Akashic record?

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:20.740 align:middle line:84%
By that I mean,
let's assume they

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:25.150 align:middle line:84%
do some kind of dastardly deed
in their life, but they change.

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:26.590 align:middle line:90%
They become good people.

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.060 align:middle line:90%
Can that be erased?

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.590 align:middle line:90%
Or is it in that record forever?

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:34.235 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: Well, I think you
have to meet the experience so

00:07:34.235 --> 00:07:35.860 align:middle line:84%
that there is an
awareness of something

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:36.818 align:middle line:90%
that you did was wrong.

00:07:36.818 --> 00:07:38.440 align:middle line:84%
One example that
comes to mind-- there

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.630 align:middle line:84%
was a woman who had been
crippled in the hip.

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:44.549 align:middle line:84%
She had a real problem in
her hip, pain all her life.

00:07:44.549 --> 00:07:46.090 align:middle line:84%
Cayce gave her a
reading and told her

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:49.450 align:middle line:84%
that one of her favorite things
to do during the time of Nero

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:53.290 align:middle line:84%
was go to the arena and watch
the persecution of people

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:55.690 align:middle line:90%
in the arena being torn apart.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And Cayce said, and lo that
selfsame thing returns to you.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.870 align:middle line:84%
So I think there is
an aspect of karma--

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:04.300 align:middle line:84%
that we have to have an
awareness of something we

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.820 align:middle line:84%
did was wrong, and then
choose differently.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who came up with this?

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:09.180 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: Who came
up with the system?

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:09.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.680 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: I think it was God.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.170 align:middle line:84%
It's the system, essentially,
that enables every soul

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:15.494 align:middle line:90%
to gain enlightenment.

00:08:15.494 --> 00:08:16.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's well-designed.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:17.951 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: It's well-designed.

00:08:17.951 --> 00:08:20.020 align:middle line:90%
There is no loopholes.

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.310 align:middle line:84%
Cayce suggested that,
eventually, every single soul

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:23.110 align:middle line:90%
will make it.

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:24.340 align:middle line:90%
It's only a matter of time.

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:28.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did Cayce ever say
how he got to understand this

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:30.490 align:middle line:90%
and how he got his abilities?

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:31.290 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: He did.

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:33.520 align:middle line:84%
Actually, he had a
series of lifetimes

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.520 align:middle line:90%
where he was extremely psychic.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And one experience
in ancient Persia,

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:40.450 align:middle line:84%
he said he had been a
desert nomad who had nearly

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:41.470 align:middle line:90%
been killed in a battle.

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:43.929 align:middle line:84%
He had a near-death
experience, left his body.

00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And because of that
experience, his mind

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.400 align:middle line:90%
could leave his body now.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.670 align:middle line:84%
In another experience
in ancient Egypt,

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:52.480 align:middle line:84%
he had been a high priest that
really worked with attunement,

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.850 align:middle line:84%
and meditation, and could
tune into the secrets

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:55.880 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.200 align:middle line:84%
And those two experiences really
came with him in the present.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.720 align:middle line:84%
There was also another one,
where, in the Old West,

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.690 align:middle line:84%
he had been what he called a
ne'er-do-well, who used his

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:07.510 align:middle line:84%
psychic ability to pick
up women and gamble.

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And for that reason,
this time around,

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:10.930 align:middle line:84%
whenever he gave
a reading, he had

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:13.990 align:middle line:84%
to put himself to sleep on a
couch to put himself aside.

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:17.092 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, that seems like
it was the bad part of his life.

00:09:17.092 --> 00:09:18.550 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: That
was the worst one.

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:19.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that was the worst.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:20.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:21.627 align:middle line:84%
Well, see, so you
can make amends.

00:09:21.627 --> 00:09:22.960 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: You can make amends.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.016 align:middle line:84%
You just have to meet everything
and have a change in awareness.

00:09:26.016 --> 00:09:27.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did he have
guides or helpers?

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.314 align:middle line:90%


00:09:30.314 --> 00:09:32.230 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: We all have
guides, spirit guides.

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:33.354 align:middle line:90%
We all have angelic guides.

00:09:33.354 --> 00:09:35.580 align:middle line:84%
But he was not
acting like a medium.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.810 align:middle line:84%
He said he went straight
to the Akashic records

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:40.430 align:middle line:84%
himself and got the
information firsthand.

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And that way, there
was no intermediary.

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:45.160 align:middle line:84%
There was no one trying
to decipher or understand

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.290 align:middle line:90%
the information for him.

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:48.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When he was
in this trance state,

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:51.312 align:middle line:84%
Kev, was he aware of
what he was saying?

00:09:51.312 --> 00:09:52.270 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: He was not.

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:55.120 align:middle line:84%
In fact, because he put
himself to sleep, he'd wake up,

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.490 align:middle line:84%
and he'd say, oftentimes,
did you get anything?

00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And they'd read them the
transcript of what he did.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:09:59.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:01.990 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: Now, later on
towards the end of his life,

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:03.880 align:middle line:84%
he became very psychic
in the waking state.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.174 align:middle line:90%
He could see auras.

00:10:05.174 --> 00:10:07.090 align:middle line:84%
He could look at someone
and sometimes pick up

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:08.379 align:middle line:90%
on their past lives.

00:10:08.379 --> 00:10:10.670 align:middle line:84%
But most of the psychic
ability was in the sleep state.

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:12.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Later on
in the show, we're

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:14.800 align:middle line:84%
going to have a
reading from Cayce.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:18.400 align:middle line:84%
You can actually hear him
in pretty dramatic stuff.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.282 align:middle line:84%
How long would he stay
under this trance state?

00:10:21.282 --> 00:10:22.990 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: It was
usually under an hour.

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And he would do a reading
in the morning and a reading

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:27.220 align:middle line:90%
in the afternoon.

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:29.110 align:middle line:84%
Much of the material
is about health.

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:31.270 align:middle line:84%
I often say that the
organization is really

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:33.220 align:middle line:84%
one of the first
self-help organizations,

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.690 align:middle line:84%
helping people transform
themselves physically,

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:36.850 align:middle line:90%
mentally, and spiritually.

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:40.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: His health reports are
more accurate than most things

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:41.350 align:middle line:90%
I've ever seen.

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:44.560 align:middle line:90%
His other ones, ah, so-so--

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:48.280 align:middle line:84%
like the Edgar Cayce Map of
North America will look like--

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.560 align:middle line:84%
it floods in and
everything else.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.162 align:middle line:90%
But maybe it's timing.

00:10:52.162 --> 00:10:53.620 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: Well,
I also say that I

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:55.245 align:middle line:84%
think there's a lot
of misunderstanding

00:10:55.245 --> 00:10:58.210 align:middle line:84%
about the Cayce information
on, quote, "Earth changes."

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:00.550 align:middle line:84%
From my premise,
Edgar Cayce didn't

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:03.790 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of predictions about
problems with Earth changes

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:04.920 align:middle line:90%
and earthquakes.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.670 align:middle line:84%
It's just a few
readings that I think

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:07.990 align:middle line:90%
have been taken out of context.

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:11.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Back to the Akashic
records for just a second--

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.417 align:middle line:84%
when does that book start,
the minute you're born?

00:11:13.417 --> 00:11:15.500 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: It started the
minute we were created,

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.749 align:middle line:84%
not just this lifetime but
the moment we were created.

00:11:17.749 --> 00:11:18.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:21.889 align:middle line:84%
So if you've had three
reincarnated lives or 50,

00:11:21.889 --> 00:11:22.930 align:middle line:90%
they're all in this book.

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:25.690 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: They're all
in there, everything,

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:28.150 align:middle line:84%
every thought, every
word, every intent.

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And Cayce would say
that, most often, we

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:32.650 align:middle line:90%
pick up on our karmic memory.

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:34.354 align:middle line:84%
And it's the memory
we respond to.

00:11:34.354 --> 00:11:35.770 align:middle line:84%
Different people
don't necessarily

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:36.620 align:middle line:90%
have the same memory.

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:38.590 align:middle line:84%
It's like, if you have
a spouse and you're both

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:40.900 align:middle line:84%
describing an incident
that happened 10 years ago,

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.180 align:middle line:84%
you have very different
memories of that experience.

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:45.670 align:middle line:84%
So we take with this
our own karmic memory.

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:48.190 align:middle line:90%
And one of my favorite stories--

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:50.600 align:middle line:84%
John Jay was a founder
of this country.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.440 align:middle line:84%
He was one of the writers
of the Federalist Papers.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.907 align:middle line:84%
He was a Chief Justice
of the US Supreme Court.

00:11:55.907 --> 00:11:57.490 align:middle line:84%
There is a biography
about him written

00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:59.590 align:middle line:90%
by a guy named Monaghan.

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And they talk about
the conch shell beauty,

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:03.861 align:middle line:84%
where the true story is
he went into a tavern.

00:12:03.861 --> 00:12:05.860 align:middle line:84%
And he saw one of the
most beautiful young woman

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.090 align:middle line:90%
he'd ever seen.

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:09.160 align:middle line:84%
He joked her face was
a color a conch shell--

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.540 align:middle line:90%
this is in the biography.

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And he swore an oath at
the Continental Congress

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:14.276 align:middle line:84%
he'd never tell anyone
where she worked,

00:12:14.276 --> 00:12:15.580 align:middle line:90%
because she was so pretty.

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:16.870 align:middle line:90%
Move forward-- 20th century.

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:18.940 align:middle line:84%
A four-year-old boy's
walking along a beach

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:21.400 align:middle line:84%
in southern Florida, looks
down and sees a shell,

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.450 align:middle line:84%
turns to his nanny
and says, what's that?

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And she says, honey,
that's a conch shell.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And the boy looks
at it and says,

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:29.280 align:middle line:84%
can a lady's face be a
color of a conch shell?

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:29.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:30.900 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: And two years
later, that boy had a reading

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:32.650 align:middle line:90%
and was told he'd been John Jay.

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's how
karmic memory works.

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:37.510 align:middle line:84%
We take with us memories of
things that happened to us.

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:39.320 align:middle line:84%
And we respond to
them in the present.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you end,
Kevin, your Akashic records?

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.552 align:middle line:84%
How does that book
finally close?

00:12:43.552 --> 00:12:45.010 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: Well,
I think it closes

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:46.384 align:middle line:84%
when we reach
enlightenment, when

00:12:46.384 --> 00:12:49.019 align:middle line:84%
we reach perfection,
when we become all

00:12:49.019 --> 00:12:50.060 align:middle line:90%
that we were meant to be.

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:51.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that
the heavenly state?

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:55.180 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: I think it's a state
of an awareness of our oneness

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:56.430 align:middle line:90%
with God--

00:12:56.430 --> 00:13:00.370 align:middle line:84%
might refer to it as the
Buddha's Bodhisattva vow,

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:02.350 align:middle line:84%
as Jesus' reaching
enlightenment,

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:03.260 align:middle line:90%
becoming the Christ.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.050 align:middle line:84%
I think that's where
we're all headed.

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:07.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because I've always
believed that reincarnation

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:11.470 align:middle line:84%
stops when you reach
that level of perfection

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:13.140 align:middle line:84%
when there's no
need to reincarnate.

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:13.940 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: Yeah.

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:16.420 align:middle line:84%
Then I think, at some point,
you think, you know what?

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go back and help
some of those who haven't yet

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:19.260 align:middle line:90%
made it.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:20.407 align:middle line:90%
So it's an ongoing process.

00:13:20.407 --> 00:13:22.990 align:middle line:84%
I kind of joke sometimes that,
if you can think of the dumbest

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:25.240 align:middle line:84%
person you know-- until
everyone's made it,

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.650 align:middle line:90%
we're probably not finished yet.

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:28.358 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what's it
mean if you pass on

00:13:28.358 --> 00:13:30.040 align:middle line:84%
and your Akashic
records is maybe

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.930 align:middle line:84%
that thick as opposed
to somebody else's

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:34.360 align:middle line:90%
who might be that thick?

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.220 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: Well, I
think it's unlikely

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:38.260 align:middle line:84%
that we have very
few experiences.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.300 align:middle line:84%
I think we've all come
back many, many times.

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:43.920 align:middle line:84%
But I think that, if you haven't
had a lot of experiences,

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.360 align:middle line:84%
the universe will give you
the opportunity at some point.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why can't somebody
from the other side step

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:55.639 align:middle line:84%
in and solve some problems
here before they occur?

00:13:55.639 --> 00:13:57.430 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: Well, I
think, on the one hand,

00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:59.590 align:middle line:84%
even God doesn't interfere
with our free will.

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:02.200 align:middle line:84%
But I also think that each and
every one of us at all times

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.929 align:middle line:90%
are provided with guidance.

00:14:03.929 --> 00:14:05.720 align:middle line:84%
Cayce would say, we're
wired with guidance.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.680 align:middle line:84%
So I think we, oftentimes, have
the sense of what we should do,

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.210 align:middle line:84%
but we don't necessarily
always follow through on it.

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:11.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: Sometimes,
we're afraid to speak up.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.440 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, we don't think
we can do anything about it.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.560 align:middle line:84%
But I think each of us
can truly have a hand

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:18.700 align:middle line:90%
in transforming the world.

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:20.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Back in my
Los Angeles office,

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.720 align:middle line:84%
Kevin, I have a book
from Edgar Cayce,

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:26.490 align:middle line:84%
of course, on some of
his health readings.

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:27.610 align:middle line:90%
And it's uncanny.

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:30.550 align:middle line:84%
And as you well know,
there are companies now

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:35.660 align:middle line:84%
that produce health products
based on Cayce's readings,

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:37.660 align:middle line:84%
which are all natural and
holistic, aren't they?

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:38.535 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: They are.

00:14:38.535 --> 00:14:40.740 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if you go
to edgarcayce.org,

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:42.580 align:middle line:84%
there's over 400
treatment protocols

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:45.190 align:middle line:84%
on any illness, arthritis
to varicose veins,

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:47.690 align:middle line:84%
that people can look up
to see what Cayce what

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:49.840 align:middle line:84%
a recommended 70,
80, 90 years ago.

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How accurate was he?

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:53.350 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: Well,
from what we can tell,

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:56.230 align:middle line:84%
he had at least a
95% accuracy rate.

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:57.400 align:middle line:90%
He could tune into a person.

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.440 align:middle line:90%
He could diagnose their illness.

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.110 align:middle line:84%
He did say, however, that the
intent of the person getting

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:04.420 align:middle line:84%
a reading had a great deal
to do with the accuracy.

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:06.970 align:middle line:84%
So a mother looking for
help for her sick child

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:09.160 align:middle line:84%
would have a higher
caliber of accuracy

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.920 align:middle line:84%
than someone wanting to know
where to dig for an oil well.

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.766 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why was he called the
Father of Holistic Medicine?

00:15:14.766 --> 00:15:17.140 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: Because he drew
from every school of medicine

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:18.015 align:middle line:90%
that you can imagine.

00:15:18.015 --> 00:15:20.830 align:middle line:84%
He drew from a
pharmacopoeia, from surgery,

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:24.770 align:middle line:84%
from allopathic medicine,
homeopathy, acupuncture,

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:26.170 align:middle line:90%
massage, everything.

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And his dream was to have a
hospital, which was originally

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:30.320 align:middle line:84%
built in Virginia
Beach, Virginia,

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.770 align:middle line:84%
where doctors and physicians
from every background--

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:35.110 align:middle line:84%
nurses, therapists-- would
carry out the treatment.

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:36.264 align:middle line:90%
And he would give readings.

00:15:36.264 --> 00:15:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's really why he moved
to Virginia Beach-- because

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:39.540 align:middle line:90%
of the hospital.

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:43.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I got to tell you,
I practice a lot of things he

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:44.800 align:middle line:90%
said about health--

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:45.716 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: Excellent.

00:15:45.716 --> 00:15:49.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --eating almonds
every day and items like that.

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:50.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm into this.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:53.150 align:middle line:84%
I have been since I
was 11 or 12, too.

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:58.474 align:middle line:90%
And it's remarkable.

00:15:58.474 --> 00:16:00.890 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: Our current spa
has a lot of health protocols.

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:02.620 align:middle line:90%
We do about 300 services a week.

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:05.674 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing how many
older people are in ARE.

00:16:05.674 --> 00:16:07.090 align:middle line:84%
I think people who
are ARE members

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:09.360 align:middle line:84%
tend to live longer for
following some of the Cayce

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:09.910 align:middle line:90%
health protocols.

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:11.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, what are
your demographics like--

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:12.330 align:middle line:90%
membership?

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:15.170 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: I would say that,
if you were at a conference--

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:17.170 align:middle line:84%
we have conferences year
round in Virginia Beach

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:18.336 align:middle line:90%
and throughout the country--

00:16:18.336 --> 00:16:21.040 align:middle line:84%
I would say, about 65%
to 70% of the conferees

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:25.670 align:middle line:84%
are women and mostly between
the ages of 55 and higher.

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And so I think women are
generally more enlightened

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:29.762 align:middle line:90%
to things like this than man.

00:16:29.762 --> 00:16:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there are
men there, absolutely.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.880 align:middle line:90%
But it's mostly women over 55.

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:37.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is remarkable
how many women are into this.

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:38.480 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: Absolutely.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Guys are starting to.

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:42.000 align:middle line:90%
But women-- it's huge, isn't it?

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: I think women
are much more in touch

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.484 align:middle line:90%
with the spiritual realms.

00:16:45.484 --> 00:16:47.150 align:middle line:84%
We have study groups
around the country,

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.790 align:middle line:84%
around the world, ecumenical
groups from all backgrounds.

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And most often, members of the
group are made up of women.

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:58.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now when Cayce was
giving his health readings,

00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:00.640 align:middle line:84%
he seemed to specialize
in health readings.

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.020 align:middle line:90%
Why was it that?

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:06.220 align:middle line:84%
Why did he specialize in
health as opposed to financial

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:07.054 align:middle line:90%
or things like that?

00:17:07.054 --> 00:17:08.636 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: Well,
he did give readings

00:17:08.636 --> 00:17:09.960 align:middle line:90%
on everything you can imagine.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:10.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everything.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.200 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: Originally, what
happened was so many people

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.829 align:middle line:84%
came to Mr. Cayce
as a last resort--

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:17.187 align:middle line:84%
they'd been to doctors
and couldn't get help.

00:17:17.187 --> 00:17:18.520 align:middle line:90%
They'd gone to their physicians.

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:20.079 align:middle line:84%
They'd gone to
specialized hospitals.

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:21.430 align:middle line:90%
And no one could help them.

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And there was this physician
in Hopkinsville, Kentucky

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:26.800 align:middle line:84%
that wrote a paper
about Cayce and how he

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.630 align:middle line:90%
became a doctor under hypnosis.

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And that was picked up
by "The New York Times."

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And after that, Cayce was
really seen as a place

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:34.570 align:middle line:90%
to go as a last resort.

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:38.920 align:middle line:84%
And about 9,000 of the
14,000 readings we have

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:39.979 align:middle line:90%
are about health.

00:17:39.979 --> 00:17:41.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is amazing.

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:41.590 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: It is amazing.

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:43.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you say the
accuracy rate is pretty high?

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:44.900 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: It is very high.

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:46.960 align:middle line:84%
He could tune into a person's
blood pressure, temperature,

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:47.410 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:49.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did he have
any medical background?

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:51.098 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: He had no
medical background,

00:17:51.098 --> 00:17:52.344 align:middle line:90%
no medical background.

00:17:52.344 --> 00:17:54.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nowadays, they'd nail
him for practicing medicine

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.051 align:middle line:90%
without a license or something.

00:17:56.051 --> 00:17:58.180 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: He was actually
falsely arrested once

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.390 align:middle line:84%
for practicing medicine
without a license when

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:01.510 align:middle line:90%
he was in Detroit.

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:05.140 align:middle line:84%
But he talked a lot about
other topics, like vibrations.

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:07.060 align:middle line:84%
There's a wealth of
information on how

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:10.210 align:middle line:84%
our thoughts, our activities
create a vibrational resonance.

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:11.980 align:middle line:84%
And one of the examples
he gave-- that,

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:14.310 align:middle line:84%
if you go into a church--
even if it's empty--

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:17.020 align:middle line:84%
and then go into a post
office-- even if it's empty--

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.120 align:middle line:84%
that there's a different
energy in that room.

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And one of our jobs
as a human creature

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:23.950 align:middle line:84%
is to create a higher level
of vibration that can help

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:25.725 align:middle line:90%
eventually transform the world.

00:18:25.725 --> 00:18:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
why we're here,

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:29.260 align:middle line:90%
to bring spirit into the Earth.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:32.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would you say
he was like as a human being?

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: He loved to garden.

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:36.730 align:middle line:90%
He loved to golf.

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:37.660 align:middle line:90%
He loved to bowl.

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:41.350 align:middle line:84%
He loved to pull together
fruits, and berries, and jams.

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:43.330 align:middle line:90%
He loved to read the Bible.

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:45.040 align:middle line:90%
He was a great photographer.

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:49.510 align:middle line:84%
He loved to talk to
people and have friends.

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:51.340 align:middle line:84%
He had pictures of
all kinds of people

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:52.540 align:middle line:90%
all over his office wall.

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:56.950 align:middle line:84%
So he was very much a people
person, down to Earth,

00:18:56.950 --> 00:19:00.170 align:middle line:84%
loved to read the Bible,
loved to teach Sunday school--

00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:00.970 align:middle line:90%
just a regular--

00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:01.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So a nice guy.

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:03.166 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: He was
a very nice guy

00:19:03.166 --> 00:19:04.549 align:middle line:90%
who had this incredible gift.

00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:07.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Had a son, Edgar Evans,
who passed away a few years.

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:08.256 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: He had two sons.

00:19:08.256 --> 00:19:10.360 align:middle line:10%
He had an older son,
Hugh Lynn Cayce--

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:13.174 align:middle line:10%
who really took the organization
that had 300 members when his

00:19:13.174 --> 00:19:15.340 align:middle line:10%
father died and turned it
into one that's now around

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:16.140 align:middle line:10%
the world--

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:18.130 align:middle line:10%
And Edgar Evans Cayce,
the younger son,

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:20.269 align:middle line:10%
who actually was
a lifelong member

00:19:20.269 --> 00:19:21.310 align:middle line:10%
of our board of trustees.

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:22.768 align:middle line:84%
And he passed away
a few years ago.

00:19:22.768 --> 00:19:24.790 align:middle line:84%
He worked for the
energy company.

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:28.272 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they possess
their father's reading ability?

00:19:28.272 --> 00:19:30.730 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: Neither one of them
were professional psychics.

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:32.710 align:middle line:84%
But the Cayce material
talks about how

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:35.790 align:middle line:84%
we are all psychic and
gives a lot of information

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:38.650 align:middle line:84%
on how we could work with
psychic ability in our dreams,

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:41.530 align:middle line:84%
improve our intuition,
work with synchronicity.

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:43.240 align:middle line:84%
So lots of what we
do is teach people

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.414 align:middle line:84%
how they can access their
own intuitive gifts.

00:19:45.414 --> 00:19:47.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, if you want to
hear what Edgar Cayce sounds

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:50.289 align:middle line:90%
like, listen to this.

00:19:50.289 --> 00:19:52.684 align:middle line:10%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:19:52.684 --> 00:19:54.121 align:middle line:10%


00:19:54.121 --> 00:20:02.836 align:middle line:10%
- To rub the
alcohol, add 2 ounces

00:20:02.836 --> 00:20:12.020 align:middle line:10%
of witch hazel, 2 ounces
of Russian white oil,

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:28.790 align:middle line:10%
1 ounce of tincture of benzoin,
1/4 ounce of oil of sassafras,

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:35.020 align:middle line:10%
1/4 ounce of pure olive oil.

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Shake these together each
time before a small quantity

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:49.035 align:middle line:84%
to be massaged into this
portion of the body,

00:20:49.035 --> 00:20:55.360 align:middle line:84%
as indicated, from the
sixth, seventh dorsal

00:20:55.360 --> 00:21:01.500 align:middle line:84%
to the first and second
cervical and in that direction,

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:07.360 align:middle line:84%
not from the cervical
area towards the dorsal,

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:13.790 align:middle line:84%
but from the sixth and seventh
dorsals towards the cervical--

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:18.566 align:middle line:84%
just what the body
will absorb, see?

[END PLAYBACK]

00:21:19.366 --> 00:21:21.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A little scratchy,
Kevin, but it gets the message.

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: It's one
of those old cylinders.

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:24.351 align:middle line:90%
It's one of those old cylinders

00:21:24.351 --> 00:21:26.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Too bad he
wasn't around when

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.320 align:middle line:90%
we had today's technology.

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:27.800 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: Incredible.

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We would
be able to videotape

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:30.650 align:middle line:90%
him and everything else.

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:32.330 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: The
reinventions massage.

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:34.413 align:middle line:84%
There's hundreds of readings
that mention massage.

00:21:34.413 --> 00:21:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And today, we have
a massage school

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:38.054 align:middle line:90%
that trains people in massage.

00:21:38.054 --> 00:21:39.470 align:middle line:84%
Actually, if you're
on staff, I'll

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:41.710 align:middle line:84%
pay you to go get a
massage once a week.

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:43.460 align:middle line:84%
We also have another
school, a university,

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:46.070 align:middle line:84%
that offers two accredited
master's degrees, one

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:48.840 align:middle line:84%
in trans-personal psychology
and one in leadership.

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:52.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was a booster in
rubbing things into the body.

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:53.690 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: He was.

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:57.500 align:middle line:84%
One of the acronyms we
often use is CARE, C-A-R-E.

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.350 align:middle line:84%
Circulation is for the C.
And if you work with massage

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:04.270 align:middle line:84%
or exercise, it really helps
the body's circulation.

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:06.740 align:middle line:84%
A is assimilation, what
you eat into your body.

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:08.420 align:middle line:90%
R is relaxation.

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:09.570 align:middle line:90%
And E is elimination.

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:11.162 align:middle line:84%
If you get those
four things going,

00:22:11.162 --> 00:22:12.620 align:middle line:84%
the body doesn't
have a good chance

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:15.380 align:middle line:84%
to become a medium
for a germ or illness.

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:17.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You would say--
what's his percentage of health

00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:20.480 align:middle line:84%
readings as opposed
to other readings?

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:24.080 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: It's about 75%, 80%.

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That high?

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:26.480 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:30.357 align:middle line:84%
All kinds of ailments, too,
from cancer to arthritis.

00:22:30.357 --> 00:22:31.940 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: When I
first got involved,

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:33.800 align:middle line:84%
I had a horrible
problem with allergies.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:36.620 align:middle line:84%
I used to get six shots a week
at the University of Colorado

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:37.310 align:middle line:90%
Health Center for allergies.

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:38.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For everything, right?

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:38.990 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: For everything.

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:41.156 align:middle line:84%
And by working with the
Cayce material on allergies,

00:22:41.156 --> 00:22:42.544 align:middle line:90%
I don't even take pills anymore.

00:22:42.544 --> 00:22:43.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Isn't that amazing?

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:44.751 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: It's amazing.

00:22:44.751 --> 00:22:45.820 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:48.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not that the mainstream
medicine is bad by any means.

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:49.760 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: No,
he draws from it.

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:51.134 align:middle line:84%
He draws from it
in lots of ways.

00:22:51.134 --> 00:22:53.450 align:middle line:84%
But he draws from every
school of medicine.

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:56.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, I've always
felt that, if you add holistic

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:59.070 align:middle line:84%
with mainstream medicine,
you're on your way to taking

00:22:59.070 --> 00:22:59.870 align:middle line:90%
care of yourself.

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:00.828 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: Absolutely.

00:23:00.828 --> 00:23:02.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How old was
when he died, Kevin?

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:03.640 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: He was 66.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, that's young.

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:05.570 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: He was very young.

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:06.694 align:middle line:90%
Again, he wore himself out.

00:23:06.694 --> 00:23:08.360 align:middle line:90%
He died in January, 1945.

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And his wife, who had been
the conductor of the reading--

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:12.530 align:middle line:90%
she died three months later.

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, 66
today is like 45 then.

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.720 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: Yeah,
it's middle aged.

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.070 align:middle line:90%
So he wore himself out.

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:19.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He did.

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:20.750 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: And
when he passed away,

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:23.030 align:middle line:84%
they really took the
organization of the readings

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:25.040 align:middle line:84%
and began a project of
going through all of them

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:27.515 align:middle line:84%
to see what topics
he talked about.

00:23:27.515 --> 00:23:29.330 align:middle line:90%
And this was before computers.

00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't really
until 1971 that they had

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:34.010 align:middle line:90%
indexed all 14,000 readings.

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does anybody
else possess his ability

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:37.580 align:middle line:90%
to do what he did?

00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:39.080 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: There
is no one on staff

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:40.163 align:middle line:90%
currently giving readings.

00:23:40.163 --> 00:23:41.549 align:middle line:84%
But we do have a
list of psychics

00:23:41.549 --> 00:23:43.340 align:middle line:84%
we work with that have
been on our programs

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.320 align:middle line:90%
and are hopeful and positive.

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And I've met many intuitives
who are extremely talented.

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:50.240 align:middle line:84%
So yes, I think there are
people who help people.

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't know of anybody who
does the range of topics

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:53.610 align:middle line:90%
that he did, though.

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:55.040 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How many books
does he have out there--

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:55.840 align:middle line:10%
Cayce?

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:58.580 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: Cayce only
wrote one book on auras.

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:01.910 align:middle line:84%
But there have been about 300
books written about Mr. Cayce.

00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:03.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is this story true?

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:06.710 align:middle line:84%
He was about to get
in an elevator, looked

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:08.300 align:middle line:90%
at people in the elevator.

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:09.800 align:middle line:90%
They had no aura.

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:11.450 align:middle line:90%
He backed out.

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:12.770 align:middle line:90%
He was scared.

00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:14.850 align:middle line:84%
The elevator crashed,
and they died.

00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:15.650 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:17.300 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: The story is
true, but it's not a story

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:18.350 align:middle line:90%
that Edgar Cayce told.

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:20.540 align:middle line:84%
It's a story another
psychic told Edgar Cayce.

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And Edgar Cayce tells that
story in the book on auras--

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:25.370 align:middle line:84%
about how the person
couldn't see any auras.

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:27.910 align:middle line:84%
But it is a true story, but it
wasn't when Edgar Cayce said.

00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:29.810 align:middle line:90%
It was a friend of his told him.

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:33.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you had a
friend who had an ailment,

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.882 align:middle line:84%
would you go through the Cayce
regimen to help that person?

00:24:36.882 --> 00:24:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: In
addition to whatever

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:40.080 align:middle line:84%
their doctors
recommended, absolutely.

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's happened over,
and over, and over again.

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:44.145 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because the
natural, holistic things

00:24:44.145 --> 00:24:46.950 align:middle line:84%
that Cayce talks
about, you can augment

00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:48.150 align:middle line:90%
with mainstream medicine.

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:49.520 align:middle line:90%
It won't do anything wrong.

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:50.680 align:middle line:90%
It won't hurt you at all.

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:51.330 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: Absolutely.

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:52.200 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.590 align:middle line:90%
And it's extremely helpful.

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:56.355 align:middle line:84%
And it helps actually
accelerate the healing process.

00:24:56.355 --> 00:24:57.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Now, I truly do--

00:24:57.850 --> 00:25:00.960 align:middle line:84%
I look at this one
book I have that

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:04.830 align:middle line:84%
has been written about some
of his readings of health.

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:06.220 align:middle line:90%
And it's uncanny.

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And then I go and
find a company--

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:09.330 align:middle line:84%
like there's a
company called Baar--

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:10.746 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: Baar
Products, uh-huh.

00:25:10.746 --> 00:25:14.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --that supplies a
lot of things that you can do.

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:16.100 align:middle line:90%
What did he mean by--

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:18.630 align:middle line:84%
I've always wanted to
ask you this, Kevin--

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:20.550 align:middle line:90%
take a coin.

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:22.680 align:middle line:90%
They call it a cold coin.

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.450 align:middle line:90%
And put it in your pocket.

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:25.780 align:middle line:90%
What does that do?

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:28.650 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: Well,
the metal in the coin

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:30.630 align:middle line:84%
somehow has an
energetic vibration

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:34.750 align:middle line:84%
that makes it much harder for
you to be prone to a cold.

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think it somehow help
your body stay alkaline.

00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:39.180 align:middle line:90%
I've actually used it before.

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:40.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's like the
size of a nickel.

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:41.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You just put
it in your pocket.

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:42.270 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: You just
put it in your pocket,

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:43.103 align:middle line:90%
and carry it around.

00:25:43.103 --> 00:25:47.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think it helps somehow
stimulate your own healing

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:48.700 align:middle line:90%
processes.

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:49.890 align:middle line:84%
So it's much harder
to catch a cold.

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:52.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think the
Earth, like, radiates to it

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:53.280 align:middle line:90%
or something like that?

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:54.650 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: I just think it's--

00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:58.301 align:middle line:84%
if you eat a well-balanced
diet that's alkaline in nature

00:25:58.301 --> 00:25:59.800 align:middle line:84%
and you have a cold
coin, it's going

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:01.650 align:middle line:84%
to be very hard for
you to get a cold.

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:03.025 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
would you recommend

00:26:03.025 --> 00:26:06.870 align:middle line:84%
people do in order to learn
more about the Cayce health

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:07.680 align:middle line:90%
readings?

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.300 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: I would
go to edgarcayce.org.

00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And on our search engine,
write in any topic

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:12.046 align:middle line:90%
you'd like to look at.

00:26:12.046 --> 00:26:14.520 align:middle line:84%
Because like I said,
there's over 400 illnesses

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:17.070 align:middle line:84%
that have been compiled
for easy reference.

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:19.890 align:middle line:84%
There's also a number of
books we have on our website.

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:22.230 align:middle line:84%
Probably the one you have
is Dr. Reilly's book,

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:23.250 align:middle line:84%
"Health Through
Drugless Therapy."

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:24.090 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I think that's it.

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:24.570 align:middle line:10%
>>TODESCHI: Yeah.

00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:26.403 align:middle line:10%
And there's a wealth
of information in there

00:26:26.403 --> 00:26:28.840 align:middle line:10%
that people can do on their
own at home to stay well.

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:30.215 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
would you say might

00:26:30.215 --> 00:26:33.240 align:middle line:84%
be some of his most
successful health stories

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:37.810 align:middle line:84%
that have been completed--
that he helped people with?

00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:39.990 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: Well, I think
one of the illnesses

00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:43.410 align:middle line:84%
that people have had a lot
of help with is psoriasis.

00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:46.080 align:middle line:84%
There is no known
cure for psoriasis.

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:49.440 align:middle line:84%
It causes eruptions on your
skin-- itchy eruptions.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And there is that there's a
Cayce protocol about diet,

00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:55.320 align:middle line:84%
about different kinds of
chiropractic adjustments.

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And anyone has who
has used that protocol

00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:59.094 align:middle line:90%
has been cured of psoriasis.

00:26:59.094 --> 00:27:00.510 align:middle line:84%
We actually had a
doctor who tried

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:02.970 align:middle line:84%
to go to the National
Psoriasis Foundation

00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:04.680 align:middle line:90%
to give them the information.

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.720 align:middle line:84%
And they just
weren't interested.

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:10.990 align:middle line:84%
Part of it is there's no
money in free healing.

00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:12.840 align:middle line:90%
There's no way to sell that.

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:15.050 align:middle line:84%
But actually, the Japanese
have been working with it

00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:16.650 align:middle line:90%
to a great deal of success.

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:18.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does he
recommend creams and stuff

00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:21.000 align:middle line:90%
for that kind of affliction?

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.240 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: Mostly, it's a
change of diet, a change in--

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:26.020 align:middle line:90%
no tomatoes, no tomato products.

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:26.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:28.680 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: Tomatoes
have a problem somehow

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.320 align:middle line:84%
with your digestion that
really helps promote psoriasis

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.669 align:middle line:84%
if you have psoriasis-- and
then some osteopathic or

00:27:33.669 --> 00:27:34.710 align:middle line:90%
chiropractic adjustments.

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:35.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't, thank god.

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:37.260 align:middle line:84%
I knew somebody who
did, who ended up

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:39.450 align:middle line:90%
having to quit their job.

00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:41.490 align:middle line:84%
Because they were in
the public, and they

00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:44.260 align:middle line:90%
had scaly skin and stuff.

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And that was not
conducive, obviously.

00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:47.940 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: There had
been children, also,

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:49.500 align:middle line:84%
who had psoriasis
all over their body.

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:51.166 align:middle line:84%
And they worked with
the diet and stuff.

00:27:51.166 --> 00:27:53.172 align:middle line:84%
And they were cured
within just several weeks.

00:27:53.172 --> 00:27:54.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Truly amazing.

00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:55.171 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: It's amazing.

00:27:55.171 --> 00:27:58.036 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did Cayce ever show
emotion or anything like that?

00:27:58.036 --> 00:27:59.160 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: Oh, absolutely.

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.840 align:middle line:90%
He loved a good joke.

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:02.990 align:middle line:90%
He loved to tell stories.

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:04.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He liked children.

00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:06.300 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: He loved children.

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:07.920 align:middle line:90%
He had a very strong faith.

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.360 align:middle line:84%
Very often, when
someone would be

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:12.990 align:middle line:84%
cured after giving
a reading, he could

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:15.720 align:middle line:84%
be found in prayer, saying,
thank you, thank you,

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:16.710 align:middle line:90%
thank you.

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:19.590 align:middle line:84%
He encouraged people to
work with their dreams.

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:21.640 align:middle line:84%
Because that somehow
could help them, as well.

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:24.370 align:middle line:84%
And he was grateful that he
provided that information.

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:26.490 align:middle line:84%
There's more than 900
readings on dreams and dream

00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:28.077 align:middle line:84%

very interesting.

00:28:28.077 --> 00:28:30.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, let's talk about
that for a moment and his work

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:31.460 align:middle line:90%
on dreams.

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:34.530 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, from the
ARE documentary about Cayce,

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:37.260 align:middle line:84%
they talked about
his work with dreams.

- Dreams are given
to us for our benefit

00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:44.160 align:middle line:10%
to learn from, to grow with.

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.290 align:middle line:84%
- The dreams as we see
that come to the entity

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:50.400 align:middle line:84%
are those correlations of the
physical with the subconscious

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.430 align:middle line:90%
forces of the body.

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And from same,
there may be gained

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:58.810 align:middle line:84%
those truths, those
lessons which, used aright,

00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:02.380 align:middle line:84%
may be for the development
of the body spiritually,

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:05.560 align:middle line:90%
mentally, financially.

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:07.330 align:middle line:84%
- Hundreds of
Cayce readings deal

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:11.140 align:middle line:84%
with the subject of dreams
and dream interpretation.

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:14.320 align:middle line:84%
The dream state is one
of self-examination.

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:17.500 align:middle line:10%
But it is also much
more, a storehouse

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:23.090 align:middle line:10%
of all of our wishes, hopes, and
memories of past experiences.

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:26.330 align:middle line:84%
Dreams can diagnose the
cause of physical ailments.

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:28.310 align:middle line:84%
They can point out
thoughts and emotions

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:30.930 align:middle line:84%
that we have perhaps
tried to overlook.

00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And they can make suggestions
for improving our relationships

00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:34.760 align:middle line:90%
with others.

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:37.980 align:middle line:84%
Dreams can be a catalyst
for change in our lives.

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:39.980 align:middle line:10%
They can also be
reaffirming that we

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:41.600 align:middle line:10%
are headed in the
right direction--

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:46.130 align:middle line:10%
that they can give us sort
of a spiritual upliftment

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:49.820 align:middle line:10%
that we might really
need at a given time.

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:52.010 align:middle line:10%
- Perhaps one of the most
significant statements

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:54.740 align:middle line:10%
regarding dreams from
the Cayce readings

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:56.870 align:middle line:10%
is that nothing of
significance ever

00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:59.420 align:middle line:10%
happens to us without
it first being

00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:01.310 align:middle line:10%
foreshadowed in our dreams.

00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:11.510 align:middle line:10%
>>TODESCHI: Back in the
'70s, before computers,

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:14.780 align:middle line:10%
before the internet, we had
a ARE member in Australia

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:16.730 align:middle line:10%
who was in one of
these study groups.

00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And she had been
sick for a long time.

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:21.630 align:middle line:84%
Every time she ate, she had gas
problems, digestion problems,

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:23.060 align:middle line:90%
stomach problems.

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:24.041 align:middle line:90%
She was always tired.

00:30:24.041 --> 00:30:25.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She was a mess.

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:25.940 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: She was a mess.

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:27.830 align:middle line:84%
And she told one of
her study group members

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:30.288 align:middle line:84%
that, sometimes she was so sick
and so tired of being sick,

00:30:30.288 --> 00:30:31.760 align:middle line:90%
she just wanted die.

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And the member said, well,
why don't you ask for a dream.

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.090 align:middle line:84%
Cayce suggested you could
write out a question,

00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:36.087 align:middle line:90%
ask for a dream.

00:30:36.087 --> 00:30:37.170 align:middle line:90%
And she asked for a dream.

00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle
of the night, she

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:39.846 align:middle line:84%
had a dream that Edgar
Cayce came to her

00:30:39.846 --> 00:30:42.780 align:middle line:84%
with a piece of paper with
a number 1880 written on it.

00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:43.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 1880.

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:44.720 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: So she woke up.

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.340 align:middle line:84%
She wrote to Virginia
Beach and says,

00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:47.780 align:middle line:90%
is there a reading number 1880?

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:49.400 align:middle line:90%
And if there is, can I have it?

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.480 align:middle line:90%
And there was.

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.750 align:middle line:90%
And they sent it to her.

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:53.375 align:middle line:84%
And she was amazed,
because the guy who

00:30:53.375 --> 00:30:55.399 align:middle line:84%
had asked for the reading
had the same symptoms.

00:30:55.399 --> 00:30:57.190 align:middle line:84%
He had problems with
his kidney, his liver.

00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:58.200 align:middle line:90%
He was always nauseous.

00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.000 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't eat.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:30:59.889 align:middle line:90%
He was tired.

00:30:59.889 --> 00:31:01.430 align:middle line:84%
Cayce gave him a
reading and told him

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:03.150 align:middle line:90%
he had mercury poisoning.

00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:05.760 align:middle line:84%
So the woman went to
her mother and said,

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:08.540 align:middle line:84%
is it possible that I could
have had mercury poisoning?

00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And the mother told her that,
when she was a little girl,

00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:11.960 align:middle line:84%
she had bitten off the
end of a thermometer

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.084 align:middle line:90%
and swallowed its contents.

00:31:13.084 --> 00:31:14.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my god.

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:15.860 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't take much.

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:16.530 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: It
doesn't take much.

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:18.129 align:middle line:84%
And she followed
the Cayce outline.

00:31:18.129 --> 00:31:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And she was cured
within four months.

00:31:19.670 --> 00:31:22.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, this was incredible use
of dreams and psychic ability,

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:25.790 align:middle line:84%
tuning into an actual reading
number that could be helpful.

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:27.467 align:middle line:90%
And it's just an amazing story.

00:31:27.467 --> 00:31:28.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That defies odds.

00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:29.390 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: It defies odds.

00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And people have told me
over and over again--

00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:32.505 align:middle line:84%
and I've had my
own experiences--

00:31:32.505 --> 00:31:34.880 align:middle line:84%
that you write out a question,
you can get an answer.

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When Cayce
started dabbling

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:39.590 align:middle line:84%
in dreams, what was it
about the dream state that

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:41.240 align:middle line:90%
got him interested in that?

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.820 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: Well, I think
the main proponent of dreams

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:46.550 align:middle line:84%
was a young Jewish
stockbroker named

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:49.490 align:middle line:84%
Morton Blumenthal, who really
helped underwrite the hospital.

00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:50.630 align:middle line:90%
And he had lots of dreams.

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:53.180 align:middle line:84%
And every time he had a dream,
he sent it to Edgar Cayce.

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:55.610 align:middle line:84%
In fact, of the 900 dream
interpretation readings

00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:58.820 align:middle line:84%
we have, 368
belonging to Morton.

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:00.860 align:middle line:84%
And Morton was very
interested in dreams

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:02.105 align:middle line:90%
and what they were about.

00:32:02.105 --> 00:32:03.650 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of
my favorite dreams

00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:06.320 align:middle line:84%
in the archives as one of
importance is a short one.

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:09.420 align:middle line:84%
He was a young guy in his
20s, had a New York apartment.

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:10.670 align:middle line:90%
He's sitting in the apartment.

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:12.225 align:middle line:90%
And there's a knock on the door.

00:32:12.225 --> 00:32:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And the maid goes
and answers the door.

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:15.225 align:middle line:84%
And there's a very
distinguished,

00:32:15.225 --> 00:32:17.717 align:middle line:84%
elderly gentleman with a
briefcase, a business suit.

00:32:17.717 --> 00:32:19.175 align:middle line:84%
And the maid turns
around and said,

00:32:19.175 --> 00:32:20.654 align:middle line:84%
God's come to New
York for a visit.

00:32:20.654 --> 00:32:21.695 align:middle line:90%
Morton gets real excited.

00:32:21.695 --> 00:32:24.830 align:middle line:84%
He goes up and embraces God,
welcomes him to New York.

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And he decides to give him
a tour of the apartment.

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And as he's giving the tour, he
realizes, in the living room,

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.440 align:middle line:84%
he's left his
liquor cabinet open.

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.356 align:middle line:84%
And he thinks, maybe I
should avoid this room.

00:32:32.356 --> 00:32:33.680 align:middle line:90%
But no, God, knows everything.

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:35.660 align:middle line:84%
So he points it out to
God and says, ah, this

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:37.250 align:middle line:90%
is in case of sickness.

00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:39.404 align:middle line:84%
And God says, you are
very well prepared.

00:32:39.404 --> 00:32:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
end of the dream.

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:43.010 align:middle line:84%
So Morton fired that
off to Virginia Beach.

00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And Cayce said it meant two
things, that the divine will

00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:48.020 align:middle line:84%
come to each one of us
in the way we can best

00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:49.430 align:middle line:90%
recognize the divine.

00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:51.740 align:middle line:84%
So Morton was a
distinguished businessman.

00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:54.290 align:middle line:84%
And the divine will accept
each and every one of us

00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:56.240 align:middle line:90%
in spite of our frailties.

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Cayce was remarkable.

00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:58.370 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: He was remarkable.

00:32:58.370 --> 00:33:00.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was it
about the dreams that

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:02.090 align:middle line:90%
got him involved in that state?

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:03.680 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: In terms of why
he started giving the dream?

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:04.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.664 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: Well, he
had his own dreams

00:33:05.664 --> 00:33:08.030 align:middle line:84%
that he was trying to
understand what they meant.

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:11.420 align:middle line:84%
He also came to understand
that, lots of times, past lives

00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:14.027 align:middle line:90%
can come up in dreams.

00:33:14.027 --> 00:33:16.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, lots of times, adults will
tell me experiences they have

00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:18.410 align:middle line:84%
where they dream they're
back in high school.

00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:20.743 align:middle line:84%
And they dream they're in an
English class, for example.

00:33:20.743 --> 00:33:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And teacher's
passing out a test.

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't know
there'd be a test that day.

00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:25.728 align:middle line:84%
Or they're in the
hallway, and they can't

00:33:25.728 --> 00:33:26.870 align:middle line:90%
remember their combination.

00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:28.453 align:middle line:84%
Well, those are
memory pattern dreams.

00:33:28.453 --> 00:33:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is
our soul mind looks

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:32.730 align:middle line:84%
for a period in our past
when we didn't feel prepared

00:33:32.730 --> 00:33:33.530 align:middle line:90%
for something.

00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:35.390 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what's
happening now in the present.

00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And so we dream about a
past experience like that.

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:40.020 align:middle line:84%
That's the same way
past life dreams happen,

00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:42.170 align:middle line:84%
that we're involved in
a similar relationship

00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:43.730 align:middle line:90%
or a similar experience.

00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And the soul mind looks
for a period in our past

00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:47.929 align:middle line:90%
where the same thing happened.

00:33:47.929 --> 00:33:49.220 align:middle line:90%
And we dream about a past life.

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:51.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did Cayce say
specifically about dreams,

00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:52.540 align:middle line:90%
Kevin--

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:55.490 align:middle line:84%
that they are very
powerful to use as a tool?

00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:57.470 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: That they
can be used for guidance.

00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:59.210 align:middle line:84%
He suggested-- like
the film said--

00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:00.710 align:middle line:84%
that nothing of
significance ever

00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:03.830 align:middle line:84%
happens to us without it first
being foreshadowed in a dream.

00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:05.960 align:middle line:84%
I know we've all had
the experience where

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:06.980 align:middle line:90%
we're driving somewhere.

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:07.580 align:middle line:90%
And we think, wait a minute.

00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:08.690 align:middle line:90%
I've already driven here.

00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:10.900 align:middle line:84%
Or we're talking to someone,
and we think, wait a minute.

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:12.233 align:middle line:90%
I already had this conversation.

00:34:12.233 --> 00:34:14.030 align:middle line:84%
And we have an experience
called deja vu.

00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:16.790 align:middle line:84%
Cayce would say, most of
our deja vu experiences

00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:18.380 align:middle line:90%
are fragmentary dream recall.

00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:20.750 align:middle line:84%
Because nothing ever
significant ever happens to us.

00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:22.330 align:middle line:84%
We dream about it
before it happens.

00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:24.730 align:middle line:84%
Because we're constantly
tuning into our Akashic records

00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:25.650 align:middle line:90%
of the future.

00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And we don't write
down our dreams.

00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:28.550 align:middle line:84%
So we don't know that
that's what happened.

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:30.040 align:middle line:84%
But when we're in the
middle of the experience

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.150 align:middle line:90%
we think, wait a minute.

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:32.199 align:middle line:90%
This is somehow familiar.

00:34:32.199 --> 00:34:34.157 align:middle line:84%
And it's familiar, because
we dreamed about it.

00:34:34.157 --> 00:34:36.219 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When he was
in his dream state,

00:34:36.219 --> 00:34:40.439 align:middle line:84%
did he come up with a
lot of readings, as well?

00:34:40.439 --> 00:34:42.730 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: He didn't give
readings in the dream state.

00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:44.188 align:middle line:84%
What would often
happen, though, is

00:34:44.188 --> 00:34:45.639 align:middle line:90%
he would be asleep on the couch.

00:34:45.639 --> 00:34:46.930 align:middle line:90%
And he'd be giving the reading.

00:34:46.930 --> 00:34:48.852 align:middle line:90%
And he'd be having a dream.

00:34:48.852 --> 00:34:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And then he'd wake up, and he'd
tell him that dream he had.

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:53.010 align:middle line:84%
And they'd tell him
the reading he had.

00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:56.530 align:middle line:84%
What would often happen is,
when he'd interpret a dream,

00:34:56.530 --> 00:34:58.280 align:middle line:84%
his wife would hold
the dream in her hand.

00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:59.480 align:middle line:90%
They'd never read it.

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And she'd say, you'd interpret
this dream in my hand.

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:03.220 align:middle line:90%
And he'd interpret the dream.

00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And on about a half
dozen occasions, he says,

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:06.880 align:middle line:90%
they're asleep on the couch.

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:09.490 align:middle line:84%
The dreamer has forgotten
a portion of their dream.

00:35:09.490 --> 00:35:11.662 align:middle line:84%
And he'd remind the person
what they had forgotten,

00:35:11.662 --> 00:35:13.120 align:middle line:84%
and then interpret
the whole thing.

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:14.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, that is an
amazing talent, to be

00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:16.780 align:middle line:84%
able to remind someone
of the dream they forgot.

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:18.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would he
have prophetic dreams

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:23.470 align:middle line:84%
and foretell the future
in a dream state?

00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:25.280 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: All of us
have prophetic dreams

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.197 align:middle line:84%
and that we tune into
our own personal future.

00:35:27.197 --> 00:35:28.655 align:middle line:84%
So they would see
things that we're

00:35:28.655 --> 00:35:30.610 align:middle line:84%
going to happen in the
Cayce household, things

00:35:30.610 --> 00:35:32.568 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to happen
in their own family,

00:35:32.568 --> 00:35:34.060 align:middle line:90%
having to move.

00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:36.370 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, Blumenthal
withdrew funding

00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:38.129 align:middle line:90%
because of the Depression.

00:35:38.129 --> 00:35:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And they knew ahead
of time that they

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:40.660 align:middle line:84%
were going to have
to move, because they

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:43.210 align:middle line:84%
had had a dream that they were
moving into a smaller house.

00:35:43.210 --> 00:35:45.550 align:middle line:84%
So I think we all get insights
into our prophetic future

00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:46.716 align:middle line:90%
if we just watch our dreams.

00:35:46.716 --> 00:35:48.716 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So he had a lot
of precognitive dreams.

00:35:48.716 --> 00:35:50.632 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: He had as
many precognitive dreams

00:35:50.632 --> 00:35:51.440 align:middle line:90%
as we all do.

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:52.690 align:middle line:90%
We all have precognitive dreams.

00:35:52.690 --> 00:35:53.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We do.

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:53.810 align:middle line:90%
We just have to--

00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:55.840 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: We just don't
know that's what we're doing.

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:56.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:35:56.770 --> 00:35:57.200 align:middle line:90%
That is true.

00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:58.000 align:middle line:90%
How about yourself?

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.877 align:middle line:90%
Do you dream these things?

00:35:59.877 --> 00:36:01.960 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: One of my
favorite precognitive dreams

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:04.126 align:middle line:84%
was-- my wife and I
were building a home out

00:36:04.126 --> 00:36:05.500 align:middle line:84%
in the country in
Virginia Beach.

00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:09.230 align:middle line:84%
And it was on a irregular-sized
3.5 acre piece of property.

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And I had taken a pencil and
drawn lines for every corner

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:13.900 align:middle line:84%
and said, this is
where I want the house.

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:15.571 align:middle line:90%
And this was before cell phones.

00:36:15.571 --> 00:36:17.320 align:middle line:84%
So the builder called
me one day and said,

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:18.280 align:middle line:90%
the surveyors are out there.

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:19.900 align:middle line:84%
They've marked where we're
going to put the foundation.

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:21.430 align:middle line:90%
It will happen later tomorrow.

00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:22.360 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK, great.

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:24.165 align:middle line:90%
That night, I had a dream.

00:36:24.165 --> 00:36:25.540 align:middle line:84%
My wife and I go
up to the house.

00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:26.789 align:middle line:90%
And we walk in the front door.

00:36:26.789 --> 00:36:28.081 align:middle line:90%
And we hear this chewing sound.

00:36:28.081 --> 00:36:29.789 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder, what is
that chewing sound?

00:36:29.789 --> 00:36:30.779 align:middle line:90%
And I go to the back.

00:36:30.779 --> 00:36:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And the neighbors in
the dream have horses.

00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And they're eating
off my back porch.

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And I wake up, and I
realize, if we have 3.5 acres

00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:39.209 align:middle line:84%
and the horses are eating
off the back porch,

00:36:39.209 --> 00:36:41.500 align:middle line:84%
somehow the house is too far
back to the other property

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:42.130 align:middle line:90%
line.

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:43.838 align:middle line:84%
So I drove out to that
piece of property,

00:36:43.838 --> 00:36:45.520 align:middle line:90%
which was 40 minutes from work.

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And the surveyors had made a
mistake and put it back 50 feet

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:49.570 align:middle line:90%
than it was supposed to be.

00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:52.350 align:middle line:84%
So I drove to the 7-Eleven,
and I called the contractor.

00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:55.190 align:middle line:84%
I said, stop the cement, because
it's been laid out wrong.

00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:56.740 align:middle line:84%
But I think we all
have that ability

00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:57.960 align:middle line:90%
if we just watch our dreams.

00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:59.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who gives it to us?

00:36:59.290 --> 00:36:59.850 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: Our higher self.

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:01.224 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where
does it come from?

00:37:01.224 --> 00:37:03.580 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: I think it comes
from our own higher self.

00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:05.549 align:middle line:84%
Cayce would say we
have a conscious mind.

00:37:05.549 --> 00:37:07.090 align:middle line:84%
We have a super-conscious
mind, which

00:37:07.090 --> 00:37:09.177 align:middle line:90%
is our higher, higher self.

00:37:09.177 --> 00:37:10.510 align:middle line:90%
And we have a subconscious mind.

00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:13.310 align:middle line:84%
That super-conscious mind
is actually our through way

00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:14.800 align:middle line:90%
to the Akashic records.

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:17.300 align:middle line:84%
We are constantly tuning into
Akashic records all the time.

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:18.780 align:middle line:84%
We just don't know
that we're doing that.

00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:20.613 align:middle line:84%
And we meet someone for
the very first time,

00:37:20.613 --> 00:37:22.060 align:middle line:90%
and we don't like that person.

00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:23.980 align:middle line:84%
Or we meet someone for
the very first time,

00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:25.717 align:middle line:84%
and we love and
admire that person.

00:37:25.717 --> 00:37:26.800 align:middle line:90%
Where does that come from?

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:28.240 align:middle line:84%
We're picking up on
our relationships

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:29.250 align:middle line:90%
exactly where we left them off.

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:31.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some people give
off different kinds of energy

00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:32.732 align:middle line:90%
that we pick up, I think.

00:37:32.732 --> 00:37:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: Absolutely.

00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:34.870 align:middle line:90%
And people have vibrations.

00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:37.669 align:middle line:90%
So you can be around someone.

00:37:37.669 --> 00:37:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, people
make you feel uneasy.

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:41.657 align:middle line:90%
Or you're just drawn to people.

00:37:41.657 --> 00:37:43.240 align:middle line:84%
There was one woman
who had a reading.

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:44.799 align:middle line:90%
Her nickname was The Angel.

00:37:44.799 --> 00:37:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And people said that just,
being in her presence,

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:48.610 align:middle line:84%
they could feel the
presence of love.

00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And I think the goal is that--
well, not only the goal.

00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:54.400 align:middle line:84%
But whatever we constantly think
or whatever we're putting out,

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.170 align:middle line:90%
it has an energy field.

00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:58.240 align:middle line:84%
Hugh Lynn Cayce, Edgar
Cayce's eldest son,

00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:03.585 align:middle line:84%
used to say that, ultimately,
we heal or harm everybody

00:38:03.585 --> 00:38:05.710 align:middle line:84%
even walking next to them
because of our own energy

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:06.510 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:08.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did Cayce have
a lot of energy himself?

00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:10.000 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: He did.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I bet you could
just feel it coming off.

00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:12.560 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: You could feel it.

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:14.717 align:middle line:84%
People drew to
him like a magnet,

00:38:14.717 --> 00:38:15.800 align:middle line:90%
drew to him like a magnet.

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:20.160 align:middle line:84%
He was extremely popular
with people in his household,

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:23.020 align:middle line:84%
in the community that
came to get readings.

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:25.690 align:middle line:84%
He was a very popular
Sunday school teacher.

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:28.570 align:middle line:90%
He told a good story.

00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:32.650 align:middle line:84%
I think he was a really
outspoken, upbeat optimist.

00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:35.650 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that I
don't think people realize is,

00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:37.630 align:middle line:84%
during the 1930s,
Cayce suggested

00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:39.485 align:middle line:84%
that, whenever there's
turmoil in the earth,

00:38:39.485 --> 00:38:41.110 align:middle line:84%
there would be turmoil
in the universe.

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:42.526 align:middle line:84%
And he even suggested
that, if you

00:38:42.526 --> 00:38:44.410 align:middle line:84%
wanted to do a
study of sunspots,

00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:45.826 align:middle line:84%
you would see that,
whenever there

00:38:45.826 --> 00:38:47.470 align:middle line:84%
was an increase in
sunspot activity,

00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:50.140 align:middle line:84%
there had been some kind
of turmoil in the earth.

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:54.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think our thoughts and our
activities put out a vibration.

00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And so if you have half the
country in the United States

00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:59.840 align:middle line:84%
thinking bad of the other half,
it's going to create turmoil.

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:06.250 align:middle line:84%
It's going to create lava in
Hawaii because of all of that--

00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:08.531 align:middle line:84%
under pressure
anger and animosity

00:39:08.531 --> 00:39:10.030 align:middle line:84%
that's just bubbling
to the surface.

00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:10.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tension.

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:11.230 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: Tension, yeah,

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:12.438 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tension, to be sure.

00:39:12.438 --> 00:39:15.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, Cayce was one
of a kind, to be sure.

00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:17.380 align:middle line:84%
Will there ever be
another Edgar Cayce?

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:18.760 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: I think that--

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:21.492 align:middle line:84%
he told many people that
you can do this, too,

00:39:21.492 --> 00:39:22.950 align:middle line:84%
if you're willing
to pay the price.

00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think the price is
to put the needs of others

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:30.107 align:middle line:84%
before your own, which
is not always easy to do.

00:39:30.107 --> 00:39:31.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would have
loved to have met him.

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:32.570 align:middle line:90%
How about you?

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:33.430 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: I would have
loved to have met him.

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:34.620 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to have
dinner with him,

00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:35.540 align:middle line:90%
have a conversation with him.

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:37.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
had a Cayce dream?

00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:39.296 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: I've had lots
of Cayce dreams, actually.

00:39:39.296 --> 00:39:41.300 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:44.750 align:middle line:84%
I've had dreams of his
eldest son, too, Hugh Lynn.

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:47.012 align:middle line:84%
I think whether
they're guides or dream

00:39:47.012 --> 00:39:49.470 align:middle line:84%
figures, that they've been in
my life for a very long time.

00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:50.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have they
given you advice,

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:52.020 align:middle line:90%
any others from the other side?

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: They
have given me advice

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.050 align:middle line:90%
from the other side, yes.

00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:55.799 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Anything you
could share with us?

00:39:55.799 --> 00:39:58.040 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: I have never
told this dream on air.

00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:58.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Here we go.

00:39:58.910 --> 00:40:00.210 align:middle line:90%
This is the first.

00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:01.168 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: Here we go.

00:40:01.168 --> 00:40:04.640 align:middle line:84%
When Charles Thomas Cayce
decided to retire in 2006,

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:07.520 align:middle line:90%
I decided to apply to be CEO.

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:10.110 align:middle line:84%
And there were about 40
different applicants.

00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And I had this dream that I was
in Hugh Lynn Cayce's office.

00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:16.220 align:middle line:90%
And he was still alive.

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And he was going through some
papers about the ARE Board.

00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And there was a board member
standing in the doorway.

00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And he invited me look at
the papers on the desk.

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And he goes over to the
board member and points at me

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:29.612 align:middle line:90%
and says, he's finally ready.

00:40:29.612 --> 00:40:31.820 align:middle line:10%
And I woke up, and I thought,
I wonder if Hugh Lynn's

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:33.080 align:middle line:10%
going to help me on this?

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:35.540 align:middle line:10%
And the Board had hired
an outside search firm

00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:37.370 align:middle line:10%
to narrow down the candidates.

00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:39.020 align:middle line:84%
And they had picked
me as their number

00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:40.640 align:middle line:84%
one choice right
after that dream.

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:42.560 align:middle line:84%
So I think, somehow,
he was there

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:44.930 align:middle line:84%
to reassure me that I was
headed in the right direction.

00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:45.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Isn't that amazing?

00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:47.390 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: I was very
impressed with that, yeah.

00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:49.348 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you sometimes
pinch yourself going,

00:40:49.348 --> 00:40:50.270 align:middle line:90%
how does this work?

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:51.770 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: I
sometimes pinch myself

00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:53.353 align:middle line:84%
thinking how lucky
I am to be involved

00:40:53.353 --> 00:40:56.490 align:middle line:84%
in the work that's about helping
people change their lives.

00:40:56.490 --> 00:40:59.990 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Do you find that the
people are becoming more tuned

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:03.865 align:middle line:10%
in, Kevin, with what Cayce did?

00:41:03.865 --> 00:41:05.240 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: When
Cayce was alive,

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:06.570 align:middle line:84%
people used to think
some of the things he did

00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:07.610 align:middle line:90%
were very unusual.

00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:11.960 align:middle line:84%
We're very mainstream now
in terms of the normal diet,

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:14.330 align:middle line:84%
in terms of people being open
to reincarnation, in terms

00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:17.120 align:middle line:84%
of people being aware of
the fact that they really

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:18.560 align:middle line:90%
create their lives.

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:21.050 align:middle line:84%
Our life is not created
by the things that

00:41:21.050 --> 00:41:24.230 align:middle line:84%
happen to us, but instead by how
we respond to the things that

00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:25.310 align:middle line:90%
happen to us.

00:41:25.310 --> 00:41:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think more and more
people are aware of the fact

00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:29.300 align:middle line:84%
that they co-create
the life they lead.

00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:32.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sidney Kirkpatrick
wrote a book about Edgar Cayce.

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:32.740 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: A great book.

00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:34.430 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Called him the
sleeping prophet, basically.

00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:36.140 align:middle line:10%
>>TODESCHI: "American
Profit" is a great book.

00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:37.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was Cayce a prophet?

00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:39.590 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: Prophecy
suggests constantly tuning

00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:40.790 align:middle line:90%
into things of the future.

00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:43.442 align:middle line:84%
And to be honest, most
people, like you and I,

00:41:43.442 --> 00:41:44.900 align:middle line:84%
when they went to
Edgar Cayce, they

00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:47.060 align:middle line:84%
were not interested so
much in global future.

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:48.557 align:middle line:84%
They were not
interested in, who's

00:41:48.557 --> 00:41:50.390 align:middle line:84%
going to win the next
presidential election?

00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:53.660 align:middle line:84%
They were more interested in,
how can I heal this problem?

00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:55.490 align:middle line:10%
And so, by far, most
of the reading's

00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:59.690 align:middle line:10%
about individual problems, how
to transform your relationship,

00:41:59.690 --> 00:42:03.230 align:middle line:10%
how to work on healing, how to
have a closer walk with God,

00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:04.932 align:middle line:10%
how to understand
your soul's purpose.

00:42:04.932 --> 00:42:06.390 align:middle line:84%
So they're very
much self-directed.

00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:09.680 align:middle line:84%
But on occasion, Cayce did
give prophetic information

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:11.900 align:middle line:90%
that was just incredible.

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:14.240 align:middle line:84%
In the early 1930s,
there was a young guy

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:18.350 align:middle line:84%
involved in international
trade who asked for a reading

00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:20.930 align:middle line:84%
on his business,
international trade.

00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:23.780 align:middle line:84%
And Cayce said that things were
being put in motion that would

00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:25.880 align:middle line:84%
draw together-- and
he uses this phrase--

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:29.690 align:middle line:84%
"the Austrians, the
Germans, and the Japanese.

00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:32.360 align:middle line:84%
And unless there is
divine interference,

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:35.122 align:middle line:84%
the whole world will
be set on fire."

00:42:35.122 --> 00:42:36.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was right--

00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:37.070 align:middle line:90%
World War II.

00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:38.480 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: World War II, yeah.

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:43.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In his readings, he had
a lot of non-health readings,

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:43.800 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:44.190 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: He did.

00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:45.564 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So let's
talk about some

00:42:45.564 --> 00:42:49.110 align:middle line:84%
of those, where he predicted
where the Hall of Records were.

00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:54.930 align:middle line:84%
I believe he said they were
in Bimini, Central America

00:42:54.930 --> 00:42:56.686 align:middle line:90%
and at the base of the Sphinx.

00:42:56.686 --> 00:42:57.810 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: That's perfect.

00:42:57.810 --> 00:42:58.470 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:42:58.470 --> 00:42:59.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I study Cayce.

00:42:59.370 --> 00:43:00.578 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: That's excellent.

00:43:00.578 --> 00:43:03.690 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, he suggested that there
had been a civilization called

00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:07.110 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis that had reached
a height of civilization

00:43:07.110 --> 00:43:09.450 align:middle line:84%
that we probably
couldn't even imagine now

00:43:09.450 --> 00:43:11.970 align:middle line:84%
and that they knew that their
civilization was sinking.

00:43:11.970 --> 00:43:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And so they had buried
records of their civilization

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:16.260 align:middle line:90%
in those three places.

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And actually, over the years
ARE has sponsored research

00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:23.850 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt, in Bimini trying
to look for remnants

00:43:23.850 --> 00:43:25.320 align:middle line:90%
of an ancient civilization.

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:29.730 align:middle line:84%
And the Cayce readings
suggest that, at some point,

00:43:29.730 --> 00:43:31.800 align:middle line:84%
records of the
civilization will be found.

00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, the
researcher, Richard Schrock,

00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:41.820 align:middle line:84%
through his studies, has found,
with some of his colleagues,

00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:43.860 align:middle line:84%
something at the
base of the Sphinx.

00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:45.470 align:middle line:90%
There is a cavern down there.

00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:47.310 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: There is a cavern,
an anomaly of some kind.

00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:48.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
something there.

00:43:48.310 --> 00:43:49.110 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: Yeah.

00:43:49.110 --> 00:43:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And Cayce suggested one
place was beneath the Sphinx.

00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:55.170 align:middle line:90%
And it's just a matter of time.

00:43:55.170 --> 00:43:59.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm convinced that
Zahi Hawass, who, at the time--

00:43:59.250 --> 00:44:00.870 align:middle line:90%
he's not there anymore--

00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:03.300 align:middle line:84%
was running to
Egypt's antiquities--

00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:06.420 align:middle line:84%
probably went down there and
found out what's in there.

00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:09.190 align:middle line:84%
There's no way they would
say there's a cavern

00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:12.124 align:middle line:84%
and the Egyptians not
try to figure it out.

00:44:12.124 --> 00:44:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: Well,
the challenge is

00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:14.996 align:middle line:90%
is the site is mostly bedrock.

00:44:14.996 --> 00:44:16.620 align:middle line:84%
So how you would get
there-- you either

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:19.664 align:middle line:84%
have to drill a hole big enough
to get into it or something.

00:44:19.664 --> 00:44:21.330 align:middle line:84%
But I'm sure they put
cameras down there

00:44:21.330 --> 00:44:22.400 align:middle line:90%
to see what was going on.

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:23.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's amazing.

00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:24.093 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: It is amazing.

00:44:24.093 --> 00:44:26.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He talked
about North America

00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:29.310 align:middle line:84%
and what it will
look geographically.

00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's a dramatic change
from where we are today,

00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:36.910 align:middle line:84%
almost where Saint Louis is
the West Coast, for crying out

00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:37.710 align:middle line:90%
loud.

00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:39.293 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: I will
disagree with that.

00:44:39.293 --> 00:44:42.450 align:middle line:84%
I will say that there are only
20 readings that mentioned

00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:44.220 align:middle line:90%
Earth changes out of 14,000.

00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:46.660 align:middle line:84%
Of that 20, most are
changes of the past.

00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:48.810 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
notorious readings

00:44:48.810 --> 00:44:50.409 align:middle line:90%
says something like this.

00:44:50.409 --> 00:44:52.200 align:middle line:84%
The Earth will be broken
up in many places.

00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:53.658 align:middle line:84%
The early portion
will see a change

00:44:53.658 --> 00:44:55.960 align:middle line:84%
in the physical aspect of
the West Coast of America.

00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:56.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is
a Cayce reading?

00:44:56.610 --> 00:44:56.970 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: Yeah.

00:44:56.970 --> 00:44:59.010 align:middle line:84%
Europe will change in
the twinkling of an eye.

00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And the greater portion of
Japan must fall into the sea.

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:05.072 align:middle line:84%
Now ARE, for years,
quoted that reading.

00:45:05.072 --> 00:45:07.030 align:middle line:84%
What they didn't quote
is, during that reading,

00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:08.370 align:middle line:90%
there's a question asked.

00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:10.950 align:middle line:84%
What changes can we
expect for this year?

00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:13.177 align:middle line:90%
That was 1934 was their year.

00:45:13.177 --> 00:45:15.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, some people might say,
well, Edgar Cayce was wrong.

00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:17.343 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's two things
about that reading.

00:45:17.343 --> 00:45:21.180 align:middle line:84%
One, later on, the person
says, I, Halaliel, have spoken.

00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:22.740 align:middle line:90%
Cayce's asleep on the couch.

00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:24.180 align:middle line:84%
It's basically
giving information

00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:25.810 align:middle line:84%
from someone else
named Halaliel.

00:45:25.810 --> 00:45:27.600 align:middle line:84%
According to the Cayce
readings, Halaliel

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.029 align:middle line:90%
is the archangel of karma.

00:45:29.029 --> 00:45:30.570 align:middle line:84%
So hopefully, there's
a better source

00:45:30.570 --> 00:45:32.940 align:middle line:84%
of information about Earth
changes than our own karma.

00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:36.990 align:middle line:84%
But what I often point out
about that reading is, in 1936,

00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:38.280 align:middle line:90%
Hitler invaded the Rhineland.

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:39.900 align:middle line:90%
There was civil war in Spain.

00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:41.850 align:middle line:90%
And China and Japan went to war.

00:45:41.850 --> 00:45:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And events were laid
for World War II.

00:45:44.490 --> 00:45:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And Europe was changed in
the twinkling of an eye.

00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And the Empire of Japan
went into the sea.

00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:51.780 align:middle line:84%
So my sense is that it
was a vibrational overview

00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:54.360 align:middle line:84%
of what was about to
transpire during World War II.

00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:56.040 align:middle line:90%
It's not about earthquakes.

00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:59.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did Cayce predict
anything about a World War III

00:45:59.610 --> 00:46:00.797 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that?

00:46:00.797 --> 00:46:02.880 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: He actually
has a much more-- overall,

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:05.760 align:middle line:84%
there's a much more
hopeful look at our future.

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:08.340 align:middle line:84%
He suggested that,
eventually, we would

00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:10.620 align:middle line:90%
enter into an age of purity.

00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:12.126 align:middle line:90%
I don't think we're there yet.

00:46:12.126 --> 00:46:13.500 align:middle line:84%
But it would be
a time when we're

00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:16.050 align:middle line:84%
very much aware of our
responsibility toward one

00:46:16.050 --> 00:46:16.870 align:middle line:90%
another.

00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:18.600 align:middle line:84%
People would be working
on self-improvement.

00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:20.310 align:middle line:84%
People would be working
on understanding

00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:22.710 align:middle line:84%
their responsibility
toward one another.

00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And the readings suggests that,
when enough people get together

00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:28.260 align:middle line:84%
working on their
own soul growth,

00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:30.090 align:middle line:84%
there will be a
resonance that makes

00:46:30.090 --> 00:46:32.640 align:middle line:84%
it impossible for
any soul who has not

00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:36.080 align:middle line:84%
chosen that as an ideal to
incarnate into the earth.

00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:38.947 align:middle line:84%
And for 1,000 years, we
will have purity on Earth.

00:46:38.947 --> 00:46:39.780 align:middle line:90%
We're not there yet.

00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:41.029 align:middle line:90%
But that's where we're headed.

00:46:41.029 --> 00:46:42.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So he is positive.

00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:45.000 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: He's very positive.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.310 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he told members of
the original prayer group

00:46:47.310 --> 00:46:50.520 align:middle line:84%
that they should pray to
be among those people that

00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:52.410 align:middle line:84%
are really here to help
transform the world.

00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: From the ARE
documentary about Edgar Cayce,

00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:57.450 align:middle line:84%
let's look at his
thoughts on prophecy.

00:46:57.450 --> 00:46:58.920 align:middle line:10%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:02.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Our world is going through an
extraordinary shift as we move

00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:04.380 align:middle line:10%
into the new millennium.

00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:08.040 align:middle line:84%
A whole new set of values and
beliefs is starting to emerge.

00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:11.100 align:middle line:84%
But the process is
filled with confusion.

00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:14.280 align:middle line:84%
For the last 200 years,
we have treated the Earth

00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:17.370 align:middle line:84%
as our possession
ready to be exploited.

00:47:17.370 --> 00:47:19.980 align:middle line:84%
Now we're discovering
the living Earth

00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:23.460 align:middle line:84%
and are aware that only with
a commitment to ecology can

00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:26.090 align:middle line:90%
humanity hope to survive.

00:47:26.090 --> 00:47:29.180 align:middle line:84%
For centuries, we have assumed
that national boundaries

00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:30.560 align:middle line:90%
separated us.

00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:34.580 align:middle line:84%
But now we're discovering that
we all have much more in common

00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:37.850 align:middle line:84%
than we ever thought,
that we are fundamentally

00:47:37.850 --> 00:47:39.980 align:middle line:90%
one human family.

00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:42.920 align:middle line:84%
In spite of religious
beliefs, most people

00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:45.620 align:middle line:84%
have lived in fear
of physical death.

00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:48.350 align:middle line:84%
But as science and
religion grow closer,

00:47:48.350 --> 00:47:50.510 align:middle line:84%
there is mounting
evidence of the reality

00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:53.330 align:middle line:84%
of an invisible,
spiritual world.

00:47:53.330 --> 00:47:55.880 align:middle line:84%
That new awareness
will free humanity

00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:59.030 align:middle line:84%
to experience the healing
connection of spirit

00:47:59.030 --> 00:48:01.430 align:middle line:90%
in mind with the body.

00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And it will allow peace to be
a realistic hope for the world.

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:09.850 align:middle line:84%
This inward transformation of
the hearts and minds of people

00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:13.300 align:middle line:84%
everywhere was predicted by
the clairvoyant and spiritual

00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:17.200 align:middle line:84%
philosopher, Edgar Cayce,
more than 60 years ago.

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:19.210 align:middle line:84%
It was back then
that Cayce foresaw

00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:23.340 align:middle line:84%
other kinds of turbulent
times just ahead for humanity.

00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:24.830 align:middle line:90%
He predicted four decades--

00:48:24.830 --> 00:48:29.540 align:middle line:84%
1958 to 1998-- of
radical transformation.

00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:32.300 align:middle line:84%
We have experienced and
are still experiencing

00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:34.300 align:middle line:90%
that transformation.

00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:37.660 align:middle line:84%
Culminating in 1998,
Cayce envisioned

00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:40.480 align:middle line:84%
that the world would be
ready to take a quantum leap

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:42.760 align:middle line:90%
into a new way of thinking.

00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:44.860 align:middle line:84%
It is at this time
that our connections

00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:48.280 align:middle line:84%
to the Earth, to each other,
and to the spiritual realm

00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:52.650 align:middle line:84%
would begin to play a more
powerful role in our survival.

00:48:52.650 --> 00:48:55.800 align:middle line:84%
As we stand in the midst
of this transformation,

00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:58.350 align:middle line:84%
it's important to remember
that these ideas are

00:48:58.350 --> 00:49:02.020 align:middle line:84%
not just for a handful
of innovators or leaders

00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:05.160 align:middle line:84%
but that they are ideas
and ideals that all of us

00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:08.524 align:middle line:84%
can apply to our
everyday living.

00:49:08.524 --> 00:49:09.790 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:49:09.790 --> 00:49:12.034 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kevin, was he
particularly religious?

00:49:12.034 --> 00:49:13.450 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: He was
very religious.

00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:16.990 align:middle line:84%
He was a member of the
Disciples of Christ Church.

00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:19.345 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't have
that denomination when

00:49:19.345 --> 00:49:20.470 align:middle line:90%
he moved to Virginia Beach.

00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:22.390 align:middle line:84%
So he became a member
of the Episcopal Church

00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:23.830 align:middle line:90%
we have there in Virginia Beach.

00:49:23.830 --> 00:49:26.020 align:middle line:84%
But he taught Sunday
school all his life--

00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:28.762 align:middle line:90%


00:49:28.762 --> 00:49:30.850 align:middle line:84%
had a very strong
connection to Jesus.

00:49:30.850 --> 00:49:32.290 align:middle line:84%
The readings are
very ecumenical.

00:49:32.290 --> 00:49:35.442 align:middle line:84%
But Cayce personally was
very, very much a member

00:49:35.442 --> 00:49:36.400 align:middle line:90%
of the Christian faith.

00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:40.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was he involved in his
day politically with people?

00:49:40.570 --> 00:49:45.970 align:middle line:84%
Was he vocal to newspapers
and media outlets?

00:49:45.970 --> 00:49:48.520 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: Not about
politics or anything.

00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:51.010 align:middle line:84%
But definitely, there were
newspaper stories about him

00:49:51.010 --> 00:49:52.720 align:middle line:84%
and his work all
throughout his life.

00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:56.050 align:middle line:84%
The archives we just have
literally hundreds of articles

00:49:56.050 --> 00:49:57.490 align:middle line:90%
about Cayce's life and work.

00:49:57.490 --> 00:50:00.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would people just
lineup to try to talk to him

00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:01.570 align:middle line:90%
or to get readings?

00:50:01.570 --> 00:50:03.130 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: People
would line up.

00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:05.440 align:middle line:90%
In 1943, two things happened.

00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:07.540 align:middle line:84%
His biography, "There
is a River," came out.

00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And "Coronet Magazine,"
which was kind

00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:10.670 align:middle line:84%
like the "Life
Magazine" of its day,

00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:13.390 align:middle line:84%
carried an article called "The
Miracle Man of Virginia Beach."

00:50:13.390 --> 00:50:16.014 align:middle line:84%
And from then on, the
requests for readings

00:50:16.014 --> 00:50:18.430 align:middle line:84%
were just hundreds-- hundreds,
and hundreds, and hundreds.

00:50:18.430 --> 00:50:21.417 align:middle line:84%
And that's really when he became
so overwhelmed with his work

00:50:21.417 --> 00:50:22.750 align:middle line:90%
that he eventually had a stroke.

00:50:22.750 --> 00:50:24.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He tried to
accommodate everybody.

00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:25.645 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: He tried
to help everyone.

00:50:25.645 --> 00:50:26.445 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:50:26.445 --> 00:50:28.340 align:middle line:84%
What would Edgar
Cayce say about today?

00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:30.048 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: Well, he'd
have a lot to say.

00:50:30.048 --> 00:50:33.580 align:middle line:84%
I think, on the one hand-- like
the documentary suggested--

00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:35.860 align:middle line:84%
toward the end of
the 20th century,

00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:38.200 align:middle line:84%
we actually became much
more global than ever

00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:39.590 align:middle line:90%
before in our history.

00:50:39.590 --> 00:50:43.182 align:middle line:84%
I don't think our grandparents
had any idea that the day would

00:50:43.182 --> 00:50:45.640 align:middle line:84%
come when something happens on
the other side of the world,

00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:48.010 align:middle line:84%
and we hear about
that very same second.

00:50:48.010 --> 00:50:50.200 align:middle line:84%
So things like the
internet and technology

00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:51.700 align:middle line:84%
has banded us
together as a world

00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:53.830 align:middle line:84%
community that I don't
believe Edgar Cayce could

00:50:53.830 --> 00:50:54.630 align:middle line:90%
have foreseen.

00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:57.640 align:middle line:84%
So that's, perhaps, a
positive thing that we're

00:50:57.640 --> 00:50:59.290 align:middle line:90%
connected as a global people.

00:50:59.290 --> 00:51:01.930 align:middle line:84%
I think he'd be somewhat
disappointed with how

00:51:01.930 --> 00:51:06.040 align:middle line:84%
fractured the United States has
become, especially politically.

00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:10.240 align:middle line:84%
From Cayce's premise,
the purpose of politics

00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:11.230 align:middle line:90%
was twofold.

00:51:11.230 --> 00:51:14.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually, he said that the
United States had a birthright.

00:51:14.650 --> 00:51:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And that birthright was
to let people have freedom

00:51:17.290 --> 00:51:19.840 align:middle line:84%
of religion-- not freedom
from religion but freedom

00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:22.120 align:middle line:84%
of religion-- and
to be aware that we

00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:23.810 align:middle line:90%
are our brother's keeper.

00:51:23.810 --> 00:51:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And he suggested
that, in the 1930s--

00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:27.370 align:middle line:84%
he said in a couple
of readings--

00:51:27.370 --> 00:51:29.396 align:middle line:84%
that, if the United States
lost that birthright

00:51:29.396 --> 00:51:31.270 align:middle line:84%
and didn't focus on the
importance of helping

00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:34.570 align:middle line:84%
its citizens and helping people
understand their relationship

00:51:34.570 --> 00:51:37.090 align:middle line:84%
to the divine, that the
height of civilization

00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:38.530 align:middle line:90%
would move to China.

00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:42.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, when he said that, China
was a third-world country.

00:51:42.970 --> 00:51:46.870 align:middle line:84%
That is looking more and more
like it could be a possibility.

00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would you say
might be Cayce's most prophetic

00:51:51.310 --> 00:51:54.395 align:middle line:90%
reading about the future?

00:51:54.395 --> 00:51:56.770 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: I think it's the
one about that we are headed

00:51:56.770 --> 00:52:01.827 align:middle line:84%
for a global renaissance, where
there'll be an age of purity,

00:52:01.827 --> 00:52:03.910 align:middle line:84%
where we'll be very much
aware of our relationship

00:52:03.910 --> 00:52:05.380 align:middle line:90%
with one another.

00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:08.140 align:middle line:84%
For me personally, the
most important material

00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:12.939 align:middle line:84%
has been that the reading
suggests the oneness of God,

00:52:12.939 --> 00:52:14.230 align:middle line:90%
that there is only one creator.

00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:15.550 align:middle line:90%
We're all a part of that.

00:52:15.550 --> 00:52:17.110 align:middle line:84%
The spiritual nature
of humankind--

00:52:17.110 --> 00:52:21.790 align:middle line:84%
that we are human beings,
but we are actually

00:52:21.790 --> 00:52:24.519 align:middle line:84%
spiritual beings having
a physical experience--

00:52:24.519 --> 00:52:26.060 align:middle line:84%
and the purposefulness
of life, that,

00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:28.610 align:middle line:84%
regardless of what's happening
in our life right now,

00:52:28.610 --> 00:52:31.570 align:middle line:84%
it has the opportunity to
be a purposeful experience

00:52:31.570 --> 00:52:34.140 align:middle line:84%
not only for us but for perhaps
other people in our family,

00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:34.600 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:37.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think there are
Edgar Cayces on other planets

00:52:37.210 --> 00:52:38.890 align:middle line:90%
out there somewhere?

00:52:38.890 --> 00:52:43.510 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: I think there are
probably other beings in tune

00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:46.780 align:middle line:90%
with guidance on other planets.

00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:49.240 align:middle line:84%
Because I think the universe
wants us to succeed.

00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:51.580 align:middle line:84%
Our job is to bring
spirit into the Earth.

00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:54.130 align:middle line:84%
Our job is to bring spirit
into the third dimension.

00:52:54.130 --> 00:52:55.240 align:middle line:90%
And that's why we're here.

00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:57.370 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Do you think
mainstream science would

00:52:57.370 --> 00:53:01.510 align:middle line:10%
grasp what Edgar Cayce said
about his health readings,

00:53:01.510 --> 00:53:02.720 align:middle line:10%
for example?

00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:06.340 align:middle line:84%
Would they look at those things
that he said, and go, my gosh,

00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:07.210 align:middle line:90%
it's right there.

00:53:07.210 --> 00:53:08.212 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:53:08.212 --> 00:53:10.420 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: There are a lot
of physicians and doctors

00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:12.170 align:middle line:84%
who have looked at the
material, actually,

00:53:12.170 --> 00:53:15.460 align:middle line:84%
and are very much impressed
with his being ahead of time

00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:17.890 align:middle line:84%
in terms of how the body
works, how attitudes

00:53:17.890 --> 00:53:21.460 align:middle line:84%
and emotions affect us, how
our diet very much impacts

00:53:21.460 --> 00:53:22.930 align:middle line:90%
who we become.

00:53:22.930 --> 00:53:24.790 align:middle line:84%
The information, like
I said, on psoriasis

00:53:24.790 --> 00:53:27.380 align:middle line:90%
is way ahead of its time--

00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:30.760 align:middle line:84%
the information on how we can
overcome things like arthritis

00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:33.190 align:middle line:84%
or stay away from
getting a common cold.

00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:35.440 align:middle line:84%
So honestly, however,
though, I think

00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:37.600 align:middle line:84%
that the bulk of the
information on health

00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:40.060 align:middle line:84%
has not yet been tapped
by the medical community.

00:53:40.060 --> 00:53:42.760 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How much
of his readings

00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:44.650 align:middle line:10%
are just pure
common sense, Kevin?

00:53:44.650 --> 00:53:47.380 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: Well, obviously,
much of it is common sense.

00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:50.890 align:middle line:84%
But I think that he
was so exact in terms

00:53:50.890 --> 00:53:53.090 align:middle line:84%
of how we can transform
our lives physically,

00:53:53.090 --> 00:53:55.845 align:middle line:84%
mentally, and spiritually that
it goes beyond common sense.

00:53:55.845 --> 00:53:58.220 align:middle line:84%
I would have never thought
before that I could write down

00:53:58.220 --> 00:54:00.220 align:middle line:84%
to a question, and
dream on it, and get

00:54:00.220 --> 00:54:01.750 align:middle line:90%
insights that were valid.

00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:03.460 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't have thought that--

00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:05.200 align:middle line:84%
I have a challenging
relationship--

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:08.091 align:middle line:84%
that I have the capacity
to transform that.

00:54:08.091 --> 00:54:10.590 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have thought that,
through meditation and prayer,

00:54:10.590 --> 00:54:13.230 align:middle line:84%
that I can come to a true
understanding, a better

00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:15.442 align:middle line:84%
understanding of my
relationship with the divine.

00:54:15.442 --> 00:54:17.400 align:middle line:84%
So I think there are very
helpful insights that

00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:19.230 align:middle line:90%
go way beyond common sense.

00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:20.907 align:middle line:84%
And he would often
say, come and see.

00:54:20.907 --> 00:54:21.990 align:middle line:90%
Try this in your own life.

00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:23.864 align:middle line:84%
And see if it helps make
you a better person.

00:54:23.864 --> 00:54:25.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you were
to write his epitaph,

00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:28.270 align:middle line:90%
his legacy, what would you say?

00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:30.930 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: I would say
that, ultimately, the Cayce

00:54:30.930 --> 00:54:33.630 align:middle line:84%
information is about
the fact that we

00:54:33.630 --> 00:54:38.490 align:middle line:84%
can transform our own lives and,
in turn, transform the world.

00:54:38.490 --> 00:54:41.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kevin, what drives
you to keep doing what you do?

00:54:41.130 --> 00:54:41.970 align:middle line:90%
And you do it well.

00:54:41.970 --> 00:54:42.770 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:54:42.770 --> 00:54:45.154 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: I continue to
find new and exciting insights

00:54:45.154 --> 00:54:46.320 align:middle line:90%
in the Edgar Cayce material.

00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:48.750 align:middle line:84%
I briefly mentioned
the illusion of time.

00:54:48.750 --> 00:54:51.570 align:middle line:84%
About six or seven years
ago, I noticed in the reading

00:54:51.570 --> 00:54:53.659 align:middle line:84%
he talked about time
being an illusion.

00:54:53.659 --> 00:54:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And I've gone back
through, and there

00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:58.020 align:middle line:84%
are hundreds of references
to the illusion of time

00:54:58.020 --> 00:55:01.890 align:middle line:84%
and how actually all of time is
happening at the same moment.

00:55:01.890 --> 00:55:04.300 align:middle line:84%
Past, present, and future
are all occurring right now.

00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And what actually moves is our
awareness or our consciousness.

00:55:07.830 --> 00:55:09.690 align:middle line:84%
So what keeps me what
motivated is not only

00:55:09.690 --> 00:55:12.205 align:middle line:84%
does the information work, but
there's always new insights

00:55:12.205 --> 00:55:14.580 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't see the last
time I went through something.

00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:16.788 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You think if world
leaders would have looked

00:55:16.788 --> 00:55:18.510 align:middle line:84%
at the prophecies
of Cayce they might

00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:21.420 align:middle line:84%
have been able to change
some of the things

00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:22.590 align:middle line:90%
for their own country?

00:55:22.590 --> 00:55:23.548 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: I think so.

00:55:23.548 --> 00:55:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think that, if individuals
became aware of the fact

00:55:26.010 --> 00:55:28.830 align:middle line:84%
that everything we put out
or do to another person

00:55:28.830 --> 00:55:30.484 align:middle line:84%
is going to come
back to us, I think

00:55:30.484 --> 00:55:32.400 align:middle line:84%
they'd change some of
the things that they do.

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:34.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that saying
about karma is truly true.

00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:35.160 align:middle line:90%
>>TODESCHI: Absolutely.

00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:36.250 align:middle line:90%
What goes around comes around.

00:55:36.250 --> 00:55:37.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:55:37.410 --> 00:55:40.380 align:middle line:84%
The better you are to people,
the more it comes back to you.

00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:42.030 align:middle line:84%
I have found that
in my case, Kevin,

00:55:42.030 --> 00:55:45.690 align:middle line:84%
all the time, that when you
treat people with kindness

00:55:45.690 --> 00:55:48.610 align:middle line:90%
or generosity, it comes back.

00:55:48.610 --> 00:55:50.730 align:middle line:90%
It comes back in volumes.

00:55:50.730 --> 00:55:52.710 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how it
works, but it does.

00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:54.330 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: It's
a universal law.

00:55:54.330 --> 00:55:56.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's Cayce
doing right now?

00:55:56.820 --> 00:56:01.380 align:middle line:10%
>>TODESCHI: My guess is he is
on the other side wondering

00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:04.240 align:middle line:10%
about when he wants to come in
next and what kind of a work

00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:05.607 align:middle line:10%
he wants to be involved in.

00:56:05.607 --> 00:56:07.440 align:middle line:10%
I think he's very much
interested in helping

00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:08.910 align:middle line:10%
transform human consciousness.

00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:10.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kevin, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:56:10.830 --> 00:56:12.160 align:middle line:84%
>>TODESCHI: Thanks for
having me on the program.

00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:14.820 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The late American
profit, Edgar Cayce--

00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:17.910 align:middle line:10%
his readings are
unbelievably poignant to what

00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:19.500 align:middle line:10%
is happening today.

00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:20.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:56:20.370 --> 00:56:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
