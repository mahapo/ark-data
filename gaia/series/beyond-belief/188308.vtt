>>GEORGE NOORY: A
real G-man with us

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.390 align:middle line:10%
on "Beyond Belief," John DeSouza
was a former FBI Special Agent

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.100 align:middle line:10%
working counterterrorism and
paranormal cases for 25 years.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.750 align:middle line:84%
He is also an attorney
and maintained

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.360 align:middle line:84%
a top-secret security
clearance during his time

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.900 align:middle line:90%
with the US government.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.070 align:middle line:84%
He collected the true-life
X-Files and shares many

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.190 align:middle line:84%
of these in his bestselling
book The "Para-Investigators."

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.960 align:middle line:84%
John, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:49.710 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN DESOUZA:
Thank you, George.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.760 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be here with you.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was it
like being an FBI agent?

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.450 align:middle line:10%
>>DESOUZA: It was
crazy at times.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.250 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.500 align:middle line:10%
>>DESOUZA: It was fascinating.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.680 align:middle line:10%
It was overwhelming sometimes.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.030 align:middle line:10%
It was amazing.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.520 align:middle line:10%
It was a great experience,
and it taught me

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.550 align:middle line:10%
the investigative techniques
that I have used now

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.388 align:middle line:10%
for the rest of my life in
bringing a lot of these cases

00:01:08.388 --> 00:01:09.930 align:middle line:10%
to people and making
them understand.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These so-called
X-File cases, are they real?

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.990 align:middle line:90%
Are they in the FBI cases?

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Well, they
are in the FBI cases.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And anyone can go look at them
at FBI Vault, at vault.fbi.gov.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.150 align:middle line:84%
Those are the
declassified repository

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.270 align:middle line:84%
of all the declassified
cases that are existing.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.340 align:middle line:84%
And there's a big
old button there

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.560 align:middle line:90%
that says unexplained phenomena.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.330 align:middle line:84%
You could just
smash that button,

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.080 align:middle line:84%
and you can get a review of all
the unexplained phenomena, all

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.550 align:middle line:84%
the X-File-type cases
on cattle mutilations,

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.360 align:middle line:84%
on phenomena,
spiritual phenomena,

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.010 align:middle line:84%
extra-sensory perception
cases, and UFO cases as well.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.420 align:middle line:90%
Those are all in there.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.240 align:middle line:84%
And they're available for
people to download and acquire

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.080 align:middle line:90%
for free.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
were with the FBI

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.250 align:middle line:84%
and you saw these cases
come across your desk

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.710 align:middle line:84%
or you looked at the
files, what did you think?

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.199 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: I thought that the
world is not what we are told.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:14.460 align:middle line:84%
I thought that there is a sieve,
there is leaking of information

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.860 align:middle line:84%
about what really is
going on and what's

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.450 align:middle line:90%
really happening out there.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.070 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't
know where to look,

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.490 align:middle line:84%
if you don't know exactly
where to see these things,

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.470 align:middle line:84%
then most people
in the mainstream

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.098 align:middle line:84%
will just simply pass by this
information and never see it.

00:02:28.098 --> 00:02:29.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you've
turned this into

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.670 align:middle line:84%
your own investigative
style, which

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.660 align:middle line:90%
you call para-investigations.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.770 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Para-investigations
is a normal system

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.990 align:middle line:84%
of investigative
inquiry which utilizes

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.470 align:middle line:84%
regular rational
scientific means at first

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.000 align:middle line:84%
but then goes beyond the
normal investigative methods

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.510 align:middle line:84%
and utilizes the intuitive
abilities of the investigator

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.660 align:middle line:84%
in order to uncover
truth at a level that

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.533 align:middle line:84%
is unknown to regular
investigators.

00:03:03.533 --> 00:03:05.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't teach
you that at the FBI, John.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.862 align:middle line:90%
Where'd you learn this?

00:03:06.862 --> 00:03:08.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: I learned this
through my experience

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.190 align:middle line:84%
with paranormal cases and cases
that just didn't make sense

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.590 align:middle line:84%
in the physical
world, cases that

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.220 align:middle line:84%
needed a little more, a
little more inquiry in order

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.280 align:middle line:84%
to be uncovered, to be truly
revealed for what they really

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.080 align:middle line:90%
were.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, during the
cases of investigations,

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.590 align:middle line:84%
we have what they-- we are
called true investigators.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.180 align:middle line:90%
We have fact finders.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.010 align:middle line:84%
Is there a difference
here between them?

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Yes, there's
a huge difference.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.675 align:middle line:84%
And fact finders
are very important.

00:03:39.675 --> 00:03:40.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And what are they?

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Fact finders
are scientists, analysts,

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.930 align:middle line:84%
researchers, which
all investigators work

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:47.730 align:middle line:90%
with these people.

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.530 align:middle line:90%
We work with them.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.280 align:middle line:84%
They can even be members of
a jury or a judge in a court.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.330 align:middle line:90%
They are fact finders.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.280 align:middle line:90%
They find facts.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.790 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that we have
too many fact finders posing

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.740 align:middle line:90%
as investigators these days.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.470 align:middle line:84%
Investigations, investigators
is a very different thing.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.150 align:middle line:84%
Investigators actually
have to probe truth,

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.030 align:middle line:84%
go beyond the surface
level of truth.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.460 align:middle line:90%
They don't just gather facts.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.440 align:middle line:84%
They actually have
to find truth.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.040 align:middle line:84%
And they have to connect data,
connect facts, to one another,

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.420 align:middle line:90%
connect clues--

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.330 align:middle line:84%
clues, very important--
recognize patterns,

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.530 align:middle line:90%
build profiles.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.325 align:middle line:84%
This is what true
investigators have to do.

00:04:28.325 --> 00:04:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And then at the end of all
that, true investigators

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.840 align:middle line:84%
have to provide an
investigative conclusion.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's what fact
finders cannot do.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's more important,
a true investigator or a fact

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:39.500 align:middle line:90%
finder?

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.830 align:middle line:90%
Or are they all important?

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: They're
both very important.

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.270 align:middle line:84%
The problems come up when
you have fact finders that

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.160 align:middle line:84%
are posing as investigators
pretending that they know how

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.960 align:middle line:90%
to--

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To deceive?

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: It provides
deceitful information at the end

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.460 align:middle line:90%
because it really doesn't--

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.470 align:middle line:84%
it really doesn't
get people to where

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.450 align:middle line:84%
they need to get
to find out what's

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.532 align:middle line:90%
really going on in these cases.

00:05:05.532 --> 00:05:07.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you call
yourself a true investigator?

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:08.850 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yes, absolutely.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.517 align:middle line:84%
I would call myself
a true investigator,

00:05:10.517 --> 00:05:13.270 align:middle line:84%
and there's many of
them out there as well.

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And we need them to really
pierce the veil of deception

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.360 align:middle line:84%
that is being put upon
us in a society where

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.320 align:middle line:84%
we have information
warfare going on against us

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.120 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.662 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: John, how
easy is it for you

00:05:26.662 --> 00:05:28.040 align:middle line:84%
to put your foot
in the door when

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.970 align:middle line:84%
you start investigating a
case, or does that door close?

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Well, it
depends on where you are.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.840 align:middle line:84%
But anybody can get a foot in
the door on any investigation

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.810 align:middle line:84%
wherever they are because
of the information society

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.160 align:middle line:90%
that we live in now.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.950 align:middle line:84%
You can always research
anything, basically.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:46.910 align:middle line:90%
You can get in.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.550 align:middle line:84%
And so much information
is out there

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.210 align:middle line:84%
in the open at
this point, so you

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.690 align:middle line:84%
don't need to go into
top-secret confidential files.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.440 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to go into
the black side of things,

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.490 align:middle line:84%
because so much information
is out there these days

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.340 align:middle line:84%
that people can really find
out about just about anything

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:08.510 align:middle line:90%
on the open side.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are some of the
cases you've looked at lately?

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Many of the cases
I've looked at have been--

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.450 align:middle line:84%
well, especially for
"The Para-Investigators,"

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:22.100 align:middle line:84%
has been the Richard Jewell
case, the security guard

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.467 align:middle line:90%
in 1996 at the Olympic games.

00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:26.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was accused
of bombing, right?

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Yes, who
actually discovered a bomb

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.530 align:middle line:84%
and was able to save
many, many lives.

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And he did it by using
his intuitive abilities,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.845 align:middle line:84%
because he discovered
a bomb where he never

00:06:39.845 --> 00:06:40.970 align:middle line:90%
looked inside the package--

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.277 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They accused
him of this, didn't they?

00:06:43.277 --> 00:06:44.360 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: That's correct.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And that was exactly
because we had

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.030 align:middle line:84%
fact finders posing
as investigators,

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:50.630 align:middle line:90%
and they investigated him.

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And instead of finding
what really went on,

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.340 align:middle line:84%
because they had no ability to
go beyond the physical world

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.870 align:middle line:84%
and see that this individual
used his intuitive ability,

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.450 align:middle line:84%
paranormal abilities,
to discover

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:06.980 align:middle line:90%
that bomb in that case.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:08.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And saved a lot of
lives by doing that, didn't he?

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.672 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Saved many,
many lives that day, yeah.

00:07:10.672 --> 00:07:13.765 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Must have been
frustrating for him.

00:07:13.765 --> 00:07:15.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: It
crushed his spirit.

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.503 align:middle line:84%
And he actually-- he
actually died shortly after--

00:07:17.503 --> 00:07:18.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It ruined
him, didn't it?

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:19.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: --that
entire incident.

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:20.685 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it did.

00:07:20.685 --> 00:07:22.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you
have a new technique

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.160 align:middle line:84%
for your investigative
techniques.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.390 align:middle line:90%
Explain that.

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:28.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah, I've come
up with a system that I am

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:32.390 align:middle line:84%
basically taking all over
the country to show them

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:36.320 align:middle line:84%
a stripped-down simple
investigative technique that

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.543 align:middle line:84%
anybody can use in
all of these areas--

00:07:39.543 --> 00:07:40.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For anything.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.720 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: For anything.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.820 align:middle line:84%
But it's only
appropriate for areas

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:47.737 align:middle line:84%
where things don't add up,
where there is deception afoot.

00:07:47.737 --> 00:07:49.070 align:middle line:90%
That's a good way of putting it.

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:49.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: --where
there is deception that

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:52.850 align:middle line:90%
is going on a massive level.

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's when my system
is appropriate for that

00:07:55.430 --> 00:08:01.370 align:middle line:84%
because it involves elements
that include examination

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:07.250 align:middle line:84%
of cover story, usual suspects,
connecting and collecting

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:10.100 align:middle line:84%
dispositive clues,
and then knowledge

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.405 align:middle line:90%
from investigative conclusion.

00:08:11.405 --> 00:08:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you use this
for ghost investigations,

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.000 align:middle line:90%
UFO cases, Bigfoot searches--

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:18.800 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yes.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:19.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --all the
things like that?

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Yes, you can use
it for all of those areas

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:24.710 align:middle line:84%
because those areas
especially are the areas where

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:28.970 align:middle line:84%
the mainstream has absolutely
presented nothing but deception

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:32.390 align:middle line:84%
towards us who are truth
seekers, who want to find out

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:33.870 align:middle line:90%
what's really happening.

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And so yeah, my system
of investigation

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.919 align:middle line:84%
is very good for
those kinds of areas.

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:40.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: John, talking about
investigations, the Navy

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:44.300 align:middle line:84%
and the Pentagon have released
a video called the Tic Tac

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:48.230 align:middle line:84%
incident, which shows a
couple Navy fighter jets,

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:52.220 align:middle line:84%
the best in the world,
chasing an object

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:54.770 align:middle line:84%
that looks like one of
those little Tic Tac mints.

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:56.120 align:middle line:90%
That's why they call it Tic Tac.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:56.540 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They can't
catch this thing.

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And you've got the
pilots on video.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.560 align:middle line:84%
You could hear their voices
saying, what is this?

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.370 align:middle line:90%
Oh my gosh.

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:06.140 align:middle line:90%
Look at it go.

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:08.450 align:middle line:84%
How do you apply your
investigative techniques

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:10.820 align:middle line:90%
into covering a story like that?

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Well, I have to
apply my investigative system

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.190 align:middle line:90%
to the Tic Tac videos.

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:19.215 align:middle line:84%
They're also called the
Gimbal videos for some reason.

00:09:19.215 --> 00:09:20.015 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:09:20.015 --> 00:09:24.230 align:middle line:84%
But it's a system where
there's a lot of things

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:29.480 align:middle line:84%
going on that just don't add up,
things that don't make sense.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:33.260 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you spent
some time in the Navy, George,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.390 align:middle line:84%
so you're going to
empathize to these points

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:37.430 align:middle line:90%
when I point them out.

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to understand
what I'm talking about.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:43.048 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you provided a
video about your investigation.

00:09:43.048 --> 00:09:45.543 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:45.543 --> 00:09:58.520 align:middle line:90%


00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:05.390 align:middle line:84%
>> November 2004 off
the coast of San Diego,

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:09.230 align:middle line:90%
a training exercise has begun.

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:13.910 align:middle line:84%
The USS Nimitz supercarrier,
the largest aircraft carrier

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:17.450 align:middle line:84%
in the world, designed
for one purpose--

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:21.620 align:middle line:84%
to infiltrate and
annihilate enemy forces.

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:24.530 align:middle line:10%
>>DESOUZA: The Nimitz
is one of the largest

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:26.750 align:middle line:10%
ships we have in the US Navy.

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:30.130 align:middle line:84%
It's so big it has enough
firepower to basically take

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:31.830 align:middle line:90%
over an entire country.

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:34.010 align:middle line:84%
Add to that that
the Nimitz is always

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:37.820 align:middle line:84%
accompanied by smaller ships
of all shapes and sizes.

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.010 align:middle line:90%
You're talking about a flotilla.

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:43.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Housing over 6,000 soldiers,
the Nimitz can launch one

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.425 align:middle line:84%
of its 90 deadly warplanes
every 20 seconds.

00:10:46.425 --> 00:10:49.800 align:middle line:90%


00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:53.360 align:middle line:84%
This is the US Navy
at its most extreme.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:57.770 align:middle line:84%
No one and no thing would
dare cross it's path,

00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:59.510 align:middle line:90%
until November 14.

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:03.390 align:middle line:90%


00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:05.760 align:middle line:90%
A blip appears on the radar.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.150 align:middle line:84%
An unknown object crosses
the screen pushing speeds

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:12.060 align:middle line:90%
at over 3,000 miles per hour.

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:15.359 align:middle line:84%
Radar operators assume it's
a technical malfunction.

00:11:15.359 --> 00:11:20.149 align:middle line:84%
But then, another object
appears, and another,

00:11:20.149 --> 00:11:23.023 align:middle line:90%
and another.

00:11:23.023 --> 00:11:24.940 align:middle line:90%
[ALARM]

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:27.160 align:middle line:90%
The Nimitz goes into high alert.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.900 align:middle line:84%
Not only are these
foreign objects

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.540 align:middle line:84%
appearing near a Navy
aircraft carrier,

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:35.320 align:middle line:84%
but they're also invading
United States airspace.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Truly a
remarkable case, John.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.400 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:44.800 align:middle line:84%
George, I know that you're
aware that the Nimitz is

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.890 align:middle line:84%
one of the great
powers on the Earth.

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:47.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is.

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:50.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: It is an
enormous structure.

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:52.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's our deterrent.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:52.500 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:53.542 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, really is.

00:11:53.542 --> 00:11:55.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: It's a
tremendous power.

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
is that if you look up

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:02.750 align:middle line:84%
the primary functions
of the Nimitz, of course

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:05.170 align:middle line:84%
it's to protect
national security,

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:08.950 align:middle line:84%
to defend against enemies
of the United States,

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:11.890 align:middle line:84%
foreign and domestic, seek
out and destroy threats

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:13.070 align:middle line:90%
to the United States.

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it gets fighter
jets close to your target.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.240 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yes.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:19.660 align:middle line:84%
It has an ability to
project power that's--

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:21.930 align:middle line:90%
it's almost unimaginable.

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:26.293 align:middle line:84%
There's actually a TV show
that speculates on what

00:12:26.293 --> 00:12:28.210 align:middle line:84%
if all the military power
of the United States

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:31.810 align:middle line:84%
disappeared except for
the Nimitz carrier group.

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:34.030 align:middle line:84%
And it shows that the
United States would still

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:35.482 align:middle line:90%
be a world-dominating power.

00:12:35.482 --> 00:12:36.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just with
that unit alone.

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:39.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Just with
that battle group.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.590 align:middle line:84%
That's how enormous
their power is.

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And however, I looked up a
lot of the primary missions

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.420 align:middle line:90%
of the Nimitz.

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:47.920 align:middle line:90%
And we saw those.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.370 align:middle line:84%
Those primary functions are
defending national security,

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:53.230 align:middle line:84%
seeking out enemies
of the United States,

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:54.680 align:middle line:90%
and seeking and destroying.

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.760 align:middle line:84%
But one of the secondary
missions of the Nimitz carrier

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:05.650 align:middle line:84%
group is to provide a safe
and protected environment

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:09.620 align:middle line:84%
for friendly operations,
training operations.

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:11.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And put
that in quotes too--

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:12.275 align:middle line:90%
friendly operations.

00:13:12.275 --> 00:13:13.240 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Exactly.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When they saw
this Tic Tac incident

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:18.580 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't realize
what it was initially,

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.920 align:middle line:84%
like they thought it was
some kind of blip on radar

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.932 align:middle line:84%
by mistake, and then all
of them started popping up,

00:13:23.932 --> 00:13:25.390 align:middle line:84%
what do you think
went through some

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:28.150 align:middle line:90%
of those military folks' minds?

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:31.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Well, the
rank-and-file people

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:33.980 align:middle line:84%
were probably
amazed and shocked.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:34.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Scared?

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:36.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Very much so.

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:37.000 align:middle line:90%
Very much so scared.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.690 align:middle line:84%
However, one of the red
flags, curious things

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:43.780 align:middle line:84%
about this incident,
is that the appearance

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:48.700 align:middle line:84%
of the anomalies over the
ocean, these Tic Tacs,

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:52.780 align:middle line:84%
went on for two weeks
before anything was done.

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:55.580 align:middle line:84%
It went on for two weeks,
not two days but two weeks.

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:56.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My god.

00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:01.738 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: So that shows
that something from the top

00:14:01.738 --> 00:14:06.310 align:middle line:84%
was being manipulated, something
where they were being held back

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:08.260 align:middle line:90%
from investigating this thing.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And makes me believe
that maybe there

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:18.040 align:middle line:84%
was more to this than some
unknown possible enemy

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.748 align:middle line:84%
doing maneuvers in
front of the Nimitz.

00:14:19.748 --> 00:14:21.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's get into
that more for this, John.

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:25.510 align:middle line:84%
But first, Navy pilot
commander David Fravor

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:30.520 align:middle line:84%
led the F-18s as they were
trying to deploy and find out

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:32.970 align:middle line:90%
what these Tic Tacs were.

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:36.790 align:middle line:84%
>> F-18 fighters are deployed,
led by top-gun Navy pilot

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:38.680 align:middle line:90%
Commander David Fravor.

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.930 align:middle line:84%
With over 16 years
flight experience

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:44.050 align:middle line:84%
and over 3,500
flight hours, Fravor

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:47.140 align:middle line:84%
had more qualifications than
any other pilot in the United

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:48.172 align:middle line:90%
States at the time.

00:14:48.172 --> 00:14:50.380 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID FRAVOR: So we were
running training exercises

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:53.200 align:middle line:10%
before our deployment to
Iraq when we got the call

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.020 align:middle line:10%
about these foreign objects.

00:14:56.020 --> 00:15:00.920 align:middle line:10%
So I ordered my guys to
suit up and go check it out.

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:05.010 align:middle line:84%
But we never could have expected
what we were about to see.

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:07.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Flying high above
the ocean surface,

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:11.910 align:middle line:84%
the F-18s intercept the location
of contact 180 miles west

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:13.920 align:middle line:90%
of the San Diego coastline.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.440 align:middle line:84%
When Commander Fravor
reaches the contact point,

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.420 align:middle line:84%
he looks out of
his cockpit window

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:22.570 align:middle line:84%
and is astonished at
what he sees below.

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:27.870 align:middle line:84%
A craft hovers above the ocean
surface, floating in midair.

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:31.860 align:middle line:84%
It has no exhaust, no wings or
rotors, and no apparent means

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:33.810 align:middle line:90%
of mechanical lift.

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:36.960 align:middle line:84%
Fravor described the
craft as an elongated egg

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:42.300 align:middle line:84%
or Tic Tac-shaped craft, unlike
anything in the US armada.

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>>FRAVOR: See, the craft didn't
have any flight surfaces on it.

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:48.490 align:middle line:84%
There was no wings, no
tail, no jet engine.

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:53.150 align:middle line:84%
It was just solid and white, and
it hovered like a helicopter,

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:56.250 align:middle line:84%
so there was no rotor wash
on the surface of the water.

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:59.230 align:middle line:84%
>> And if the presence of the
craft wasn't strange enough,

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:02.930 align:middle line:84%
what happens next defies
all known physical laws.

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:06.440 align:middle line:84%
The craft began moving
at instantaneous speeds,

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:09.170 align:middle line:84%
starting and stopping
without any acceleration

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:10.880 align:middle line:90%
or deceleration.

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:14.270 align:middle line:84%
Commander Fravor said it looked
like a ping-pong ball scanning

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:17.960 align:middle line:84%
across the water and that the
G-Forces of such maneuvers

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:20.840 align:middle line:84%
should have been enough to
destroy the craft itself

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:25.220 align:middle line:84%
or at least instantly kill
any human occupants inside.

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:27.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: John, those
F-18 fighter pilots

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.040 align:middle line:90%
are the best in the military.

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:31.250 align:middle line:90%
They were baffled by all this.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:32.370 align:middle line:90%
Was it ours?

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:34.730 align:middle line:90%
Was it some other country's?

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:36.560 align:middle line:90%
Was it extraterrestrial?

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:37.738 align:middle line:90%
What was it?

00:16:37.738 --> 00:16:40.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: That's interesting
that you bring that up, George,

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:44.720 align:middle line:84%
because the Nimitz's primary
function is to make sure

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.552 align:middle line:84%
whether something is a
threat, a national threat,

00:16:47.552 --> 00:16:49.010 align:middle line:84%
a threat to the
national security--

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:49.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.057 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: --of
the United States.

00:16:51.057 --> 00:16:56.090 align:middle line:84%
And so that's another sign that
things don't quite add up here,

00:16:56.090 --> 00:17:00.750 align:middle line:84%
because their response
was not hostile.

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:02.630 align:middle line:90%
It was less than hostile.

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:04.550 align:middle line:84%
The procedures
that they followed

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:07.819 align:middle line:84%
did not appear to be
the procedures that

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:10.280 align:middle line:84%
would have been
followed by the Nimitz

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.470 align:middle line:90%
doing their primary functions.

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:14.869 align:middle line:84%
It was more like they
were just curious.

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:16.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These objects
were showing off.

00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:17.390 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yes.

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:18.470 align:middle line:90%
Yes, they were.

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And our pilots just appeared
to be curious about it,

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.050 align:middle line:84%
about the thing,
instead of treating it

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:27.440 align:middle line:84%
as a potential threat
against the United States.

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:30.620 align:middle line:84%
So that also, again,
brings up more clues

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:33.560 align:middle line:84%
that don't quite add up to the
situation that we're seeing.

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:36.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could this be
a black ops program?

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:39.720 align:middle line:84%
Could this be something
that we have, technology

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:43.970 align:middle line:84%
we have created, or maybe
it's reversed UFO technology,

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:45.120 align:middle line:90%
but it's ours?

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:45.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.030 align:middle line:90%
I believe it is, George.

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:52.400 align:middle line:84%
I believe that in 2004 this
was experimental technology,

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:56.690 align:middle line:84%
and it was really nothing more
than an experimental training

00:17:56.690 --> 00:18:02.240 align:middle line:84%
mission with these stealth
technology drones that

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:05.540 align:middle line:90%
are going forward in this area.

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:09.620 align:middle line:84%
Today, we have drones,
stealth technology drones,

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:13.340 align:middle line:84%
in the open under
military service right now

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:16.770 align:middle line:84%
that resemble these
Tic Tacs that we saw.

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:17.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:20.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Very much so,
especially the one called

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:22.640 align:middle line:90%
X-47B--

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:26.570 align:middle line:84%
the X-47B-- those are the
names they give these things--

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:31.610 align:middle line:84%
and variants of the X-47B, which
are stealth technology drones

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:33.860 align:middle line:90%
that do not show on infrared.

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:35.690 align:middle line:90%
They do not show a signature.

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:40.550 align:middle line:84%
They do not show an exhaust
or rotor wash on infrared

00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:42.680 align:middle line:84%
because they're
stealth technology.

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:45.410 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I'm
looking at this,

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:47.450 align:middle line:84%
and I'm looking at the
responses of the pilots.

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:50.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at the
response of the Nimitz.

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:55.910 align:middle line:84%
The response of the Nimitz
was more like a battle group

00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:58.843 align:middle line:84%
protecting an experimental
training mission.

00:18:58.843 --> 00:19:00.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I
was going to say,

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:05.970 align:middle line:84%
do you think the captain of the
Nimitz was told don't worry.

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:07.880 align:middle line:90%
This is just an exercise.

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:11.700 align:middle line:84%
We want to see how our
pilots handle this stuff.

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.390 align:middle line:84%
This is not a foreign attack
or anything like that.

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:15.830 align:middle line:90%
Did they know that?

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: I believe perhaps
at the level of the captain,

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:20.780 align:middle line:90%
he may have been told that.

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:23.540 align:middle line:84%
Definitely above the
level of the captain,

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:24.980 align:middle line:90%
people did know that.

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:27.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because we didn't
fire on these objects at all.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah, they
didn't fire on them.

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:32.450 align:middle line:84%
They didn't lock on them
really for weapons systems.

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:36.570 align:middle line:84%
They didn't really treat
them as a hostile power.

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:37.580 align:middle line:90%
That's why I believe--

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:38.497 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's weird.

00:19:38.497 --> 00:19:40.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah, it's weird,
and it doesn't add up.

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:44.000 align:middle line:84%
That's why I believe that
this was really nothing

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.690 align:middle line:84%
more than a training mission--
an experimental training

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:51.187 align:middle line:90%
mission for friendly powers.

00:19:51.187 --> 00:19:52.020 align:middle line:90%
That's what it says.

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:54.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The commander
that we just saw on video,

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:58.200 align:middle line:84%
do you think he and his other
pilots knew what was going on?

00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.000 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Oh, no.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:19:59.810 align:middle line:90%
Definitely not.

00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:00.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They did not?

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:00.740 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: No.

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:02.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They weren't
brought into this thing.

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:03.650 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: No, definitely not.

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:08.583 align:middle line:84%
I would say anyone from the
captain on down of the Nimitz

00:20:08.583 --> 00:20:10.250 align:middle line:84%
was not brought in
to what was going on.

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:12.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So the commander is
being very honest when he talks

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:14.403 align:middle line:90%
about what he thinks he saw.

00:20:14.403 --> 00:20:15.320 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Absolutely.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:18.890 align:middle line:84%
The commander and everyone
else in the rank and file

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:21.470 align:middle line:84%
aboard the Nimitz,
surely they did

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:26.330 align:middle line:84%
believe that this was actually
a potentially hostile action.

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:29.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would you say
would be your red flag which

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:33.650 align:middle line:84%
led you to believe, eh, this
isn't exactly what people think

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:34.460 align:middle line:90%
it is?

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:36.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Well,
there's so many.

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.760 align:middle line:90%
There's so many.

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:41.330 align:middle line:84%
One thing is the fact
that-- well, the fact

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:45.320 align:middle line:84%
that we basically
have these drones now

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:49.680 align:middle line:84%
in the open that are very
similar to the Tic Tacs.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:51.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Style, looks,
the way they move--

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:52.520 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:53.320 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Exactly.

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:55.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, we did this
recreation, and we

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:59.030 align:middle line:90%
filled in the way they move.

00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:02.130 align:middle line:84%
We did a lot of
fill-ins for this

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:05.970 align:middle line:84%
because there's several
of these Tic Tac videos.

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:09.780 align:middle line:84%
But they haven't provided
the wide-angle camera lens

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:12.420 align:middle line:84%
showing the movements
of these things.

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.510 align:middle line:84%
Anyone who watches these videos
instinctively knows something's

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:18.630 align:middle line:84%
wrong, because they're just
showing these things moving

00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:22.710 align:middle line:84%
in a straight line doing
nothing really extraordinary,

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:28.380 align:middle line:84%
nothing really amazing on
the infrared Canon camera

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:29.447 align:middle line:90%
that they're showing.

00:21:29.447 --> 00:21:30.780 align:middle line:90%
And that really tells you a lot.

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:33.000 align:middle line:84%
That's your first great
red flag right there.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.908 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How big is
the objects apparently?

00:21:34.908 --> 00:21:37.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: The objects were
60 feet around of diameter.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 60 feet.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.405 align:middle line:90%
That's a pretty good size.

00:21:40.405 --> 00:21:42.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah,
that's an amazing size

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:43.447 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a
big drone, John.

00:21:43.447 --> 00:21:44.850 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: It's a huge drone.

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And those are the ones that
we have in operation now

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:50.490 align:middle line:84%
very similar to those, with
the stealth technology,

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:54.600 align:middle line:84%
with the cold metal alloy
that covers up signature

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:58.440 align:middle line:84%
so that the things
basically appear invisible.

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:01.560 align:middle line:84%
They can be invisible
to instrumentation

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:04.010 align:middle line:90%
of any foreign power whatsoever.

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:06.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is it that I want
to believe that these objects

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:08.040 align:middle line:90%
are extraterrestrial?

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: For the same reason
everyone wants to believe it--

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:12.540 align:middle line:84%
because it makes it
more fascinating,

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:13.920 align:middle line:90%
makes it more interesting.

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:17.280 align:middle line:84%
It makes it something
more amazing to us.

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:20.150 align:middle line:84%
That's why these videos
have been shopped around.

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:23.730 align:middle line:84%
They've been taken around
and along with the tagline

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:27.268 align:middle line:84%
"this proves that
we are not alone."

00:22:27.268 --> 00:22:28.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did this come out?

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:30.510 align:middle line:84%
How did this come to
the public's attention?

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:34.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: It was released by
the Pentagon, these videos.

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:35.377 align:middle line:90%
And there's many of them.

00:22:35.377 --> 00:22:36.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's not
like the Pentagon.

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:37.847 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Exactly.

00:22:37.847 --> 00:22:38.930 align:middle line:90%
It's not like them at all.

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:41.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So there's
another clue there.

00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:42.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Usual suspects, yeah.

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:45.850 align:middle line:84%
You have to look and examine
the actions, the actions

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:47.760 align:middle line:90%
that usual suspects are taking.

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's not something that
the Pentagon would normally do.

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:55.650 align:middle line:84%
But I think this was such
a massive exercise that

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:59.250 align:middle line:84%
was so big, it involved
so many moving pieces,

00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:02.700 align:middle line:84%
that they figured they had
to release something on it.

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:05.460 align:middle line:84%
And so they decided to control
the information this way.

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When these
pilots get together

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:11.640 align:middle line:84%
after the fact, what do
you think they talk about?

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: I think they talk
about the fascinating aspect

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:17.580 align:middle line:84%
of this and the fact
that they believe

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:21.250 align:middle line:84%
that this means we are possibly
not alone in the universe.

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:23.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yes, the
pilots believe that they

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:26.205 align:middle line:84%
are coming from some other
extraterrestrial source.

00:23:26.205 --> 00:23:27.330 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: I think they do.

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:28.163 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think so.

00:23:28.163 --> 00:23:29.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:31.142 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wonder if
we've pulled everybody

00:23:31.142 --> 00:23:35.230 align:middle line:84%
from the Nimitz or the 6,000
other military folks who

00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:41.110 align:middle line:84%
are in the battlefield
with them in that command,

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:42.430 align:middle line:90%
I wonder what they'd say.

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:45.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: I'll tell
you what they'd say.

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:47.440 align:middle line:84%
George, if you're in
the Navy and you're

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.950 align:middle line:84%
on a carrier group
like this, there's

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:53.050 align:middle line:84%
one thing that you
really care about

00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:55.720 align:middle line:84%
that you never want to
hear, and that's call

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.288 align:middle line:90%
to general quarters.

00:23:57.288 --> 00:23:58.330 align:middle line:90%
Call to general quarters.

00:23:58.330 --> 00:23:59.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No, you
don't want that.

00:23:59.240 --> 00:23:59.360 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:00.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: You never
want to hear that.

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:03.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That means there's
something big happening, fast.

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:04.180 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Exactly.

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:08.440 align:middle line:84%
So I think all of-- you do those
polls of the rank and file that

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:11.720 align:middle line:84%
were aboard the Nimitz, that's
what they felt-- rank terror,

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:12.520 align:middle line:90%
absolute terror.

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us about the
investigation and the cover

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:16.360 align:middle line:90%
story that came with this.

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:19.060 align:middle line:10%
>>DESOUZA: The cover
story is the first thing

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:22.780 align:middle line:10%
you need to identify when
you come up on incidences

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:26.830 align:middle line:10%
like this that are steeped
in some kind of red flags

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:27.970 align:middle line:10%
and deception.

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And the cover story
apparently is the one

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:32.830 align:middle line:90%
that's identified by the media.

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And it is, OK, folks, we have
here an incident of technology

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:44.410 align:middle line:84%
that has become apparent to the
Nimitz that is extraordinary

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:46.970 align:middle line:84%
and possibly
extraterrestrial in nature.

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:47.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:48.600 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: That is
the cover story.

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's
unprecedented to release that.

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:52.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Also,
it's unprecedented

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:56.680 align:middle line:84%
that the media reported
that all over the world.

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:59.290 align:middle line:84%
When's the last time you saw Fox
and CNN agreeing on anything?

00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:00.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Never.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.000 align:middle line:90%
Never.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.440 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Exactly.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was this
done intentionally

00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:08.360 align:middle line:84%
because they want us to believe
they're extraterrestrial?

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And if so, they're hiding the
technology because of that?

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:14.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:17.450 align:middle line:90%
The answer is yes to that.

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:21.170 align:middle line:84%
I believe-- and you're
jumping ahead here.

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:26.330 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that once you
really examine this situation

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:30.050 align:middle line:84%
carefully, you'll see that
it is basically a deep-state

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:32.900 align:middle line:90%
operation to take over--

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:37.640 align:middle line:84%
it's a massive, massive
operation, a disinformation

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:39.535 align:middle line:84%
operation, to take
over, basically,

00:25:39.535 --> 00:25:43.400 align:middle line:84%
ufology for the
cabal, to take over

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.740 align:middle line:90%
the entire system of ufology--

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:49.610 align:middle line:84%
the agenda, the issue of
ufology-- directly and put it

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:52.173 align:middle line:84%
directly under the
control of cabal elements.

00:25:52.173 --> 00:25:53.090 align:middle line:90%
That's what I believe.

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:56.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does the cabal
admit that we're being

00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:58.280 align:middle line:90%
visited by extraterrestrials?

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:01.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Well, they
want to talk about it,

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:06.530 align:middle line:84%
and they want to gin up
fear about this in general.

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:09.380 align:middle line:84%
That's why we see the language
being perpetuated here--

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:12.680 align:middle line:90%
unknown alien phenomena, UAP--

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:17.595 align:middle line:84%
unknown alien phenomena--
and unknown alien threat,

00:26:17.595 --> 00:26:18.470 align:middle line:90%
unknown alien threat.

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:20.762 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, would they
rather have the public, John,

00:26:20.762 --> 00:26:23.130 align:middle line:84%
think we're being visited
by extraterrestrials?

00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:25.688 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe we
probably are in some cases.

00:26:25.688 --> 00:26:27.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: They
figure that knowledge

00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:29.450 align:middle line:84%
is going to come forward
anyway, that there's

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:31.040 align:middle line:90%
nothing they can do to stop it.

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:34.160 align:middle line:84%
So they may as well
take control of it,

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:36.373 align:middle line:84%
and that's what they're
working on right now.

00:26:36.373 --> 00:26:37.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How will
they control it?

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:40.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: By putting
forward the Gimbal videos,

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:45.450 align:middle line:84%
the Tic Tac videos and saying
that we're on top of this are.

00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:50.210 align:middle line:84%
Our military and the United
States power is on top of this,

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:51.950 align:middle line:84%
and we know what
we're doing with this.

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:53.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And giving
us a false impression

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:55.220 align:middle line:90%
that it's extraterrestrial?

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:56.300 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yes, exactly.

00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:58.040 align:middle line:90%
That's what's going on here.

00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What benefit
would that be for them?

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:02.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: The benefit
to them is basically

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:05.270 align:middle line:84%
to take control of
an issue that they're

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:08.450 align:middle line:84%
going to be perpetuating
more in the future

00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:10.670 align:middle line:84%
because I've got
news for you, George.

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:12.790 align:middle line:84%
There's one of these
videos coming out.

00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:14.940 align:middle line:84%
But they've got three
so far that have

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:16.190 align:middle line:90%
been released by the Pentagon.

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:18.200 align:middle line:84%
But they're going to be
releasing a lot more of them--

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:18.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Similar?

00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:20.052 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: --and
different varieties.

00:27:20.052 --> 00:27:22.208 align:middle line:90%
Similar and different varieties.

00:27:22.208 --> 00:27:24.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you continue
to do a great job producing

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:26.940 align:middle line:90%
these videos.

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:29.250 align:middle line:84%
>>FRAVOR: At this point,
all I could think about

00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:32.940 align:middle line:84%
was, I want to get a
better look at this thing.

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:36.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Fravor pilots within a half
mile of the craft and chases it

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:38.040 align:middle line:90%
throughout the sky.

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And once he locked on,
his heat-activated camera

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:44.655 align:middle line:84%
picked up this
extraordinary footage.

00:27:44.655 --> 00:27:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a whole
fleet of them.

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:47.400 align:middle line:90%
Look on the SA.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:49.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Commander Fravor and
his co-pilot converse over

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:51.586 align:middle line:84%
their private
communication line.

00:27:51.586 --> 00:27:53.169 align:middle line:84%
>> They're all going
against the wind.

00:27:53.169 --> 00:27:55.316 align:middle line:90%
The wind's 120 knots west.

00:27:55.316 --> 00:27:57.395 align:middle line:90%
>> Look at that thing, dude.

00:27:57.395 --> 00:27:58.470 align:middle line:90%
>> My gosh.

00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:01.130 align:middle line:84%
>> The seasoned pilots
are completely baffled

00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:04.040 align:middle line:84%
by the craft's speed,
lack of heat exhaust,

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:06.170 align:middle line:90%
and impossible maneuverability.

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:08.210 align:middle line:90%
Then, something amazing happens.

00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:09.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Look at that thing.

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:12.180 align:middle line:84%
>> The craft begins
rotating on its side.

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:13.460 align:middle line:90%
>> It's rotating.

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:15.200 align:middle line:90%
>> The pilots are shocked.

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.920 align:middle line:84%
It becomes clear to
these professional pilots

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:20.900 align:middle line:84%
that what they're witnessing
is not of this world.

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:21.852 align:middle line:90%
>> My gosh.

00:28:21.852 --> 00:28:24.710 align:middle line:84%
>>FRAVOR: I've never seen
anything move like that.

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:27.080 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it had no exhaust.

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.030 align:middle line:90%
Every aircraft has exhaust.

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:32.300 align:middle line:84%
Even drones have contrails that
you can see on the flare beam.

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:35.000 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing coming
out of this to make it move.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.382 align:middle line:84%
I've seen every
aircraft on Earth,

00:28:37.382 --> 00:28:39.200 align:middle line:84%
and this thing was
not from Earth.

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.950 align:middle line:10%
>>JAN HARZAN: You can
believe that there's

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:42.440 align:middle line:10%
other life out there,
and you can believe

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:43.710 align:middle line:10%
that it's coming here to visit.

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:45.627 align:middle line:10%
But it's much different
than when you actually

00:28:45.627 --> 00:28:49.425 align:middle line:10%
are staring at it, because your
entire world view is shattered.

00:28:49.425 --> 00:28:51.300 align:middle line:84%
This thing shows up out
of nowhere that's not

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:53.010 align:middle line:90%
part of your current reality.

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:54.970 align:middle line:90%
You can't deny it.

00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:57.123 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's no question
the pilot was baffled.

00:28:57.123 --> 00:28:58.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Absolutely.

00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's not
playing a game here.

00:28:59.430 --> 00:28:59.820 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Oh, no.

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:00.620 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:03.300 align:middle line:84%
He honestly believes
what he is seeing

00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:05.490 align:middle line:90%
is possibly not of this world.

00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:06.810 align:middle line:90%
And George, you know me.

00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:09.450 align:middle line:84%
I wrote an entire book,
"The Extra-Dimensionals."

00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:15.040 align:middle line:84%
I actually believe that
some UFOs can be real.

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:16.837 align:middle line:84%
They can be
extra-dimensional in nature.

00:29:16.837 --> 00:29:17.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:21.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: And so I believe
alien visitor cases,

00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:22.560 align:middle line:90%
a lot of these cases are real.

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:23.830 align:middle line:90%
They're true.

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:29.790 align:middle line:84%
However, in this case, I
can see what adds up there.

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:33.060 align:middle line:84%
You're watching basically
a drone just traveling

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:33.982 align:middle line:90%
in a straight line.

00:29:33.982 --> 00:29:35.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Looked like a
flying whale, didn't it?

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:36.840 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:37.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In that video?

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:38.450 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And however, but there's
no wide camera angle

00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:44.970 align:middle line:84%
to see all these
amazing maneuvers.

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:48.600 align:middle line:84%
We did the recreation,
and we showed

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:49.780 align:middle line:90%
some of the crazy maneuvers.

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:51.420 align:middle line:90%
But we don't see it on camera.

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:55.050 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't reported on
camera from the Nimitz.

00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:57.630 align:middle line:84%
So these things start
to add up, and we

00:29:57.630 --> 00:30:01.290 align:middle line:84%
start to see that there's
something not right

00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:02.920 align:middle line:90%
about what's going on here.

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:05.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why didn't
the pilots get ordered

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:06.745 align:middle line:90%
to fire on these objects?

00:30:06.745 --> 00:30:08.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: That's a
very good question.

00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:09.630 align:middle line:90%
That's a very good question.

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:12.362 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the primary
mission of the Nimitz carrier

00:30:12.362 --> 00:30:13.162 align:middle line:90%
crew.

00:30:13.162 --> 00:30:15.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, you're not going
to have some unidentified craft

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:19.230 align:middle line:84%
flying around the Nimitz
and its battle group

00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:21.810 align:middle line:84%
and not do anything and
not take any action.

00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:24.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Or attempt to
establish communication,

00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:25.825 align:middle line:90%
attempt to intercept.

00:30:25.825 --> 00:30:27.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we didn't
see any of that.

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:28.825 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: None
of that happened.

00:30:28.825 --> 00:30:31.470 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, all
of their actions were--

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:34.380 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure they were
ordered from the top.

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:36.840 align:middle line:84%
These are not-- the pilots
are not making these decisions

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:38.332 align:middle line:90%
on their own independently.

00:30:38.332 --> 00:30:40.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right, they're
on radio communication.

00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:41.100 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Exactly.

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:43.830 align:middle line:84%
So I think that they were
ordered from the top basically

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:48.690 align:middle line:84%
to treat this as a
friendly training mission,

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:50.550 align:middle line:84%
and that's the
environment they had--

00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:53.640 align:middle line:84%
they had to provide a
safe, protected environment

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:54.830 align:middle line:90%
for a training mission.

00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I think
was going on here.

00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:59.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If that
was 15 years ago,

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:01.300 align:middle line:90%
what do you think we have today?

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:03.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Oh, I know
that we have-- and some

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:07.560 align:middle line:84%
of the abilities of similar
drones we have today,

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:13.110 align:middle line:84%
like the X-47B, some of their
abilities are still top secret.

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:17.070 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we have
pictures of the X-47B

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:24.180 align:middle line:84%
that people can actually compare
to these craft, the Tic Tacs.

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And you can put
them side by side

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:29.040 align:middle line:84%
and see great
similarities there,

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:32.600 align:middle line:84%
but a lot of their abilities
are still top secret.

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:34.270 align:middle line:90%
They're still not revealed.

00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
those abilities

00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:40.500 align:middle line:84%
are the same abilities that we
saw on display here in 2004.

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:44.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, 15 years later, the
black world is always--

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:48.540 align:middle line:84%
we're always behind
technology about 15 years--

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:49.980 align:middle line:90%
15 to 20 years.

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:52.410 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that these
things are in common use now.

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:54.327 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
this video was released,

00:31:54.327 --> 00:31:57.480 align:middle line:84%
John, to show the Russians
and the Chinese, ha ha,

00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:58.703 align:middle line:90%
look what we have?

00:31:58.703 --> 00:32:00.370 align:middle line:84%
Do you think it was
something like that?

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:02.245 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: That's an
excellent point, George,

00:32:02.245 --> 00:32:06.300 align:middle line:84%
because yeah, I do believe
that the great military powers

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:10.440 align:middle line:84%
around the world, they actually
see these Gimbal videos,

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:13.890 align:middle line:84%
these Tic Tac videos, and they
know exactly what's going on.

00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:16.670 align:middle line:84%
And yes, they do have
that response of,

00:32:16.670 --> 00:32:19.340 align:middle line:90%
wow, the Americans have this.

00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:20.930 align:middle line:90%
They have it in use right now.

00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:25.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: 60-foot-long
craft, drone or otherwise,

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:29.640 align:middle line:84%
was there an occupant or
occupants inside, or was it

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:30.780 align:middle line:90%
strictly done by remote.

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:31.580 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: No.

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:34.770 align:middle line:84%
No, they can't have occupants
inside these things because

00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:36.507 align:middle line:84%
of the maneuvers that
they're capable of.

00:32:36.507 --> 00:32:37.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're too fast.

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:40.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: It would be just
too much for a human occupant.

00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:42.360 align:middle line:84%
That's why they
have to be drones.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:43.800 align:middle line:90%
They have to be unmanned.

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:45.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There'd be 10
Gs against the human body

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:46.650 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:48.233 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah, it
would be too much.

00:32:48.233 --> 00:32:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's why-- because the
technology has gone forward so

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:54.000 align:middle line:84%
tremendously that
what we have now

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.930 align:middle line:84%
is just amazing in
comparison to 15 years ago.

00:32:57.930 --> 00:33:00.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
the deep state really wants?

00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:03.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: The deep
state wants to acquire--

00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:04.650 align:middle line:84%
they've always had
indirect control,

00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:08.825 align:middle line:84%
but they want to acquire
direct control over ufology

00:33:08.825 --> 00:33:11.130 align:middle line:90%
as an issue, as an agenda.

00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And they want to manage
it, steer it, and push it

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:17.280 align:middle line:90%
in the direction that they want.

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:18.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they doing that?

00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:19.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: They are doing it.

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:20.490 align:middle line:90%
They're doing it right now.

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:22.200 align:middle line:84%
They're doing it with
the Gimbal videos.

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:24.360 align:middle line:84%
They're doing with the
Tic Tac videos, yes.

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:26.410 align:middle line:84%
And they're being
very successful.

00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:28.755 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many millions
of people saw these videos?

00:33:28.755 --> 00:33:30.720 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Oh, it's hard to say.

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.810 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people
have seen it.

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:35.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We had it up on the
coasttocoastam.com website.

00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:36.820 align:middle line:90%
We got like 3 million hits.

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:37.770 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Exactly.

00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:38.570 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:39.995 align:middle line:90%
And that's just one piece of it.

00:33:39.995 --> 00:33:41.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One piece,
that's right.

00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:42.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah, and
there's going to be--

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:44.218 align:middle line:84%
so many people are going
to see these videos,

00:33:44.218 --> 00:33:46.010 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to
listen to what they're

00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:48.620 align:middle line:84%
told about the videos,
because if you just

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:51.260 align:middle line:84%
see the videos on their
own, you instinctively

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:54.410 align:middle line:84%
can tell there's nothing that
extraordinary about them.

00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you
do think UFO, though,

00:33:56.730 --> 00:33:58.650 align:middle line:84%
when you see that--
zh, zh, zh, zh.

00:33:58.650 --> 00:33:59.450 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
part of the reason they

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:02.937 align:middle line:90%
were designed that way.

00:34:02.937 --> 00:34:04.020 align:middle line:90%
That's part of the reason.

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:05.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's the plan?

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.130 align:middle line:90%
What do you think the plan is?

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:11.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: I think the plan for
the cabal is to continue using

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:14.900 align:middle line:84%
these videos and many more that
are going to be coming out very

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:15.960 align:middle line:90%
soon--

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.239 align:middle line:90%
they're going to be released.

00:34:17.239 --> 00:34:18.229 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Different?

00:34:18.229 --> 00:34:20.449 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Different,
but showing the same type

00:34:20.449 --> 00:34:23.224 align:middle line:84%
of technology, the
Tic Tac formation--

00:34:23.224 --> 00:34:24.835 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Being
Chased by military?

00:34:24.835 --> 00:34:25.120 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:25.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:27.485 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Possibly
being chased by military,

00:34:27.485 --> 00:34:30.920 align:middle line:84%
but actually being kept safe
by military, because that's

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:32.030 align:middle line:90%
what really went on here.

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:34.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
interview that commander?

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:35.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: No, I
have not-- not yet.

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:36.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was not--

00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:39.560 align:middle line:90%
what possessed him to go public?

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:41.393 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: That's
another red flag.

00:34:41.393 --> 00:34:42.310 align:middle line:90%
He's not the only one.

00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:43.699 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because
they never go public.

00:34:43.699 --> 00:34:45.366 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Right,
he's not the only one.

00:34:45.366 --> 00:34:47.389 align:middle line:84%
And why are these
Navy commanders

00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:50.300 align:middle line:84%
being allowed to
publicly talk about this

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:55.010 align:middle line:84%
and to push forward this agenda
of "these videos demonstrate

00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:58.880 align:middle line:84%
that we are not alone," using
that mind-control language?

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.550 align:middle line:84%
That's very important to push
forward an operation like this.

00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: John, the
pilot seems legit.

00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:06.200 align:middle line:84%
If we would hook him up
to a lie detector test,

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:07.550 align:middle line:90%
I think he would pass.

00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:08.633 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Oh, absolutely.

00:35:08.633 --> 00:35:12.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But is it possible with
this day and age of computer

00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:15.680 align:middle line:84%
animation and everything
else, this whole thing

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:17.940 align:middle line:90%
has been faked?

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:19.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: No, no, it's not.

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.560 align:middle line:84%
First, that's one
of the red herrings

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:25.150 align:middle line:84%
that we see in this case
is that a lot of-- there

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:27.710 align:middle line:84%
have been people who
say, oh, this was CGI.

00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:33.170 align:middle line:84%
This was a CGI operation
where the drone, the craft,

00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:34.500 align:middle line:90%
is not really there.

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's not-- that's
absolutely not true.

00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:38.335 align:middle line:90%
That's absolutely not true.

00:35:38.335 --> 00:35:40.970 align:middle line:84%
The physical reality
of the drone being

00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:42.740 align:middle line:90%
there is actually-- it's real.

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:43.730 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:45.260 align:middle line:90%
And this really happened.

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:47.720 align:middle line:84%
The Navy pilots are
telling the truth.

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:50.870 align:middle line:90%
So there's no CGI involved here.

00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:52.288 align:middle line:84%
A cursory examination
shows that.

00:35:52.288 --> 00:35:54.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's take a look
at some of the theories that

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:57.320 align:middle line:90%
are tied into this incident.

00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:00.950 align:middle line:10%
>> When the footage was released
in 2017 by the Pentagon,

00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:04.580 align:middle line:10%
the military classified
the object as an AAV,

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:09.080 align:middle line:10%
an anomalous aerial vehicle,
the new military term for UFO.

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:10.940 align:middle line:84%
But this wasn't
the first sighting.

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:12.870 align:middle line:84%
Over the following
two-week period,

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:15.830 align:middle line:84%
the Nimitz continued to
spot hundreds of craft,

00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:18.171 align:middle line:90%
and new footage kept rolling in.

00:36:18.171 --> 00:36:19.726 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh my gosh, dude!

00:36:19.726 --> 00:36:20.526 align:middle line:10%
>> Wow!

00:36:20.526 --> 00:36:21.468 align:middle line:10%
>> What is that?

00:36:21.468 --> 00:36:22.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Look at it fly!

00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Why is it that even people
in our military who are fighter

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:31.920 align:middle line:84%
pilots with 17 years experience,
they don't know what advanced

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.360 align:middle line:90%
technology is being used?

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:36.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Within days, internet
commenters suggested the video

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:41.430 align:middle line:10%
might be the work of clever CGI
artists or an elaborate hoax.

00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:43.830 align:middle line:84%
But the nature of the
footage and its release

00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:45.392 align:middle line:90%
suggests otherwise.

00:36:45.392 --> 00:36:47.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Let's say,
could it be a fake?

00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:48.330 align:middle line:90%
Let's say yes.

00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:50.340 align:middle line:90%
OK, it's a fake.

00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:54.450 align:middle line:84%
If it is something like CGI,
then you have to consider,

00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:58.100 align:middle line:84%
that means that every
single pilot involved

00:36:58.100 --> 00:36:59.390 align:middle line:90%
is in on the fake.

00:36:59.390 --> 00:37:03.200 align:middle line:84%
The people on the Nimitz
are also in on the fake.

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:07.010 align:middle line:10%
People at the Pentagon who
authorized this to be released

00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:09.320 align:middle line:10%
are in on the fake.

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:12.650 align:middle line:84%
Either way, this is
a monumental story

00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:14.740 align:middle line:84%
because you're talking
about either this

00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:18.680 align:middle line:84%
is aliens visiting us with
tech that we can't imagine

00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:22.700 align:middle line:84%
or this is a fake from the
government that somehow has

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:26.180 align:middle line:84%
some extraordinary agenda
going forward to make

00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:28.640 align:middle line:90%
us believe in alien life.

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:32.150 align:middle line:10%
>> To this day, the Pentagon has
no explanation for the event,

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:35.030 align:middle line:10%
and the military's executive
report assesses that

00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:38.990 align:middle line:10%
the anomalous aerial vehicle
was no known aircraft or air

00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:42.350 align:middle line:10%
vehicle currently in the
inventory of the United States

00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:43.642 align:middle line:10%
or any foreign nation.

00:37:43.642 --> 00:37:45.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HARZAN: This is an
extraordinary event.

00:37:45.350 --> 00:37:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And taken in context with
the eyewitness testimony

00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:50.690 align:middle line:84%
of the pilot flying
the jet chasing

00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:54.260 align:middle line:84%
this thing and the
radar data from the ship

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:56.690 align:middle line:84%
itself tracking
this thing, you've

00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:59.690 align:middle line:84%
got not only an
image but radar data

00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:01.700 align:middle line:84%
and the pilot giving
his personal testimony.

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:04.340 align:middle line:84%
You've got three
different triangulations

00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:06.803 align:middle line:84%
that this is something
not from Earth.

00:38:06.803 --> 00:38:08.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's something
strange here, John.

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:12.450 align:middle line:84%
They're being too
aboveboard with this video.

00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:13.250 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:15.083 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not
happened like this before.

00:38:15.083 --> 00:38:16.360 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Exactly.

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And it never has in the modern
history of the Western world

00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:23.090 align:middle line:90%
that I've ever seen.

00:38:23.090 --> 00:38:25.940 align:middle line:84%
The media has
always been ordered

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:31.940 align:middle line:84%
to treat UFOs shows as
nonsense, as not possible--

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:34.525 align:middle line:84%
not even in the
realm of reality.

00:38:34.525 --> 00:38:35.900 align:middle line:84%
They've always
been ordered to do

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:37.340 align:middle line:90%
that in the mainstream media.

00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:40.820 align:middle line:84%
However, suddenly this has
changed with this operation.

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:44.900 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, you see Fox, and CNN,
and all the other news services

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:49.520 align:middle line:84%
suddenly agreeing that UFOs
could be real, and especially

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:50.720 align:middle line:90%
in this case.

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:54.650 align:middle line:84%
So that's more red flags
that something is going on,

00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:57.390 align:middle line:84%
something that doesn't
really make sense,

00:38:57.390 --> 00:39:00.020 align:middle line:84%
that there is some
enormous group

00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:03.573 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of moving parts that
is pushing forward this agenda.

00:39:03.573 --> 00:39:05.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There is a
bigger picture here.

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:07.040 align:middle line:84%
What about this
possibility, John,

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:11.870 align:middle line:84%
that they know, our government
knows and the deep state knows,

00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:15.440 align:middle line:84%
that there's going to be some
major revelation with UFOs,

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:17.750 align:middle line:84%
maybe some encounter,
maybe something

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:22.460 align:middle line:84%
that is so big and so
public they can't hide it?

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:26.030 align:middle line:84%
What if they are using something
like this as an example

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:28.130 align:middle line:90%
to say, no, folks, it's ours.

00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:29.120 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry about it--

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:29.420 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Exactly.

00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:30.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --a false flag.

00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:31.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Exactly, George.

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:35.150 align:middle line:84%
I believe that's exactly
what is going on.

00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:38.840 align:middle line:84%
They already know that
something is coming forward

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:43.740 align:middle line:84%
in the world of ufology and in
contact with alien visitors.

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:45.110 align:middle line:90%
They know it's coming forward.

00:39:45.110 --> 00:39:49.160 align:middle line:84%
So they are trying to
use these videos to push

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:52.580 align:middle line:84%
forward, to take control
of the entire agenda,

00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:55.910 align:middle line:84%
and to be able to
say, we've got this.

00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:57.170 align:middle line:90%
We're on top of this.

00:39:57.170 --> 00:39:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And you need to think
about this the way

00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:01.670 align:middle line:84%
that we are telling
you to think.

00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:05.382 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As an investigator,
what does this do for you?

00:40:05.382 --> 00:40:07.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: As an
investigator, it just gives me

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:11.120 align:middle line:84%
a great opportunity
to demonstrate

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:15.980 align:middle line:84%
the people my investigative
system for piercing deception,

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:21.110 align:middle line:84%
for showing that we are in an
information warfare situation

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:23.720 align:middle line:84%
where mainstream
authorities, they're not

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:26.000 align:middle line:84%
in the business of telling
us the truth, of giving us

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.690 align:middle line:84%
the truth, of showing us the
truth, ever, in our situation

00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:30.697 align:middle line:90%
where we are right now.

00:40:30.697 --> 00:40:32.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: John, in your
investigations and the work

00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:36.320 align:middle line:84%
you do, what percent
of that is UFO related?

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:37.520 align:middle line:90%
Break it down for me.

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:40.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: I would say about
a quarter of the work I

00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:41.637 align:middle line:90%
do is related to UFOs.

00:40:41.637 --> 00:40:42.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's all?

00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:43.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:45.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: And then
maybe another quarter

00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:49.070 align:middle line:84%
with government
operations of other kinds.

00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:50.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:40:50.090 --> 00:40:52.110 align:middle line:90%
What could those other kinds be?

00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:54.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Oh,
there's so many areas.

00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:56.300 align:middle line:90%
There's false flags.

00:40:56.300 --> 00:41:01.910 align:middle line:84%
There's operations
where we have situations

00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:05.220 align:middle line:84%
where things appear
to be a certain way,

00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:06.290 align:middle line:90%
and they're just not.

00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:07.370 align:middle line:90%
They're not.

00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And once you pierce
that top level,

00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:12.075 align:middle line:84%
that top level of deception,
you go beneath that.

00:41:12.075 --> 00:41:13.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
concerned about what's

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:15.227 align:middle line:90%
happening out there today?

00:41:15.227 --> 00:41:16.310 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Oh, absolutely.

00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:20.900 align:middle line:84%
I am very concerned because
I'll give you a prediction

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:23.930 align:middle line:84%
that I know is going to
come true, because there are

00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:27.680 align:middle line:84%
going to be more of these videos
coming out and similar videos--

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:28.565 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Released by?

00:41:28.565 --> 00:41:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Released
by the Pentagon--

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:31.550 align:middle line:90%
released by the Pentagon.

00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And they are going to
show similar things.

00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:35.760 align:middle line:84%
They're going to show
extraordinary maneuvers.

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:37.250 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
show capabilities,

00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:39.950 align:middle line:84%
because our technology
is still going forward.

00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:43.280 align:middle line:84%
It's still going to higher
levels in the black world

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:46.100 align:middle line:84%
and in the open
military world as well.

00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:48.957 align:middle line:84%
So what I predict is that
we're going to be seeing more

00:41:48.957 --> 00:41:51.290 align:middle line:84%
of these videos, and they're
going to be associated with

00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:55.350 align:middle line:84%
the same group using the
same mind-control phrases--

00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:57.740 align:middle line:84%
"this shows that
we are not alone."

00:41:57.740 --> 00:41:59.460 align:middle line:84%
That's the source
for my concern.

00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:02.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this happening
because of Tom DeLonge's group

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:03.950 align:middle line:90%
and others like that?

00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:05.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: They are
a part of it, sure.

00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:10.040 align:middle line:84%
Because of his group, they are
a part of this massive system.

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:14.170 align:middle line:84%
But there's other parts
to this system too.

00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:19.910 align:middle line:84%
There's the deputy commander
for Naval operations, who just

00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:22.160 align:middle line:90%
made a statement yesterday.

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:23.900 align:middle line:90%
And I don't have his name handy.

00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:26.720 align:middle line:84%
But he actually made a
statement yesterday or the day

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:30.590 align:middle line:84%
before yesterday that
he said, this video,

00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:35.690 align:middle line:84%
the Tic Tac videos, the Gimbal
videos, are actually real.

00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:37.970 align:middle line:84%
They are not CGI or
anything of that sort.

00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:39.200 align:middle line:90%
We already knew that.

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:43.160 align:middle line:84%
He also said, oh,
the Pentagon is sorry

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:45.040 align:middle line:90%
that this ever was released.

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:46.290 align:middle line:90%
We shouldn't have released it.

00:42:46.290 --> 00:42:47.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sorry?

00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:47.970 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:42:47.970 --> 00:42:49.245 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:49.245 --> 00:42:50.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who released it?

00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:53.113 align:middle line:84%
Some individual
do it by mistake?

00:42:53.113 --> 00:42:54.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: That's
a good question,

00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:57.800 align:middle line:84%
but he didn't answer
that question.

00:42:57.800 --> 00:42:59.560 align:middle line:84%
He only said, oh, it
should probably never

00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:00.360 align:middle line:90%
have been released.

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:05.270 align:middle line:84%
We shouldn't have seen it, and
we regret that these things--

00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:08.690 align:middle line:84%
and yet they're going
to release more.

00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:09.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:43:09.490 --> 00:43:10.280 align:middle line:90%
Intentionally.

00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:11.360 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: That's my point, yes.

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:12.160 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:14.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Interesting
take on all of this.

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:17.680 align:middle line:84%
When do you think
this breaks loose?

00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:19.343 align:middle line:84%
More videos come
out and more stories

00:43:19.343 --> 00:43:21.010 align:middle line:84%
come out-- when is
that going to happen?

00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:22.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: In the
next few months.

00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:22.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That close?

00:43:22.690 --> 00:43:22.930 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:23.220 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:24.370 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:43:24.370 --> 00:43:26.740 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have more
of these videos released,

00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:28.450 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
have more activity

00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:31.930 align:middle line:84%
from all the different groups
that are pushing forward

00:43:31.930 --> 00:43:37.510 align:middle line:84%
the fear factor on this, having
us talk about this in terms

00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:41.040 align:middle line:90%
of unknown aerial threats--

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:43.780 align:middle line:90%
UATs, unknown aerial threats--

00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:47.230 align:middle line:84%
to not just to our military
but to the entire nation.

00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:50.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If, John,
this is a deception,

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:51.790 align:middle line:90%
does that bother you?

00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:54.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Absolutely,
because it's going

00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:57.670 align:middle line:90%
to be towards a wider agenda.

00:43:57.670 --> 00:44:02.560 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be spiraling into
something much, much larger

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:05.440 align:middle line:84%
where I believe that Wernher
Von Braun's prediction is

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:06.850 align:middle line:90%
going to come true.

00:44:06.850 --> 00:44:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And the cabal is going
to ultimately use

00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:13.750 align:middle line:84%
this agenda towards their
ultimate goal, which is going

00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:16.900 align:middle line:90%
to be fake alien invasion.

00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:17.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:18.660 align:middle line:90%
For control?

00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Yes, because
there's no greater way--

00:44:21.450 --> 00:44:23.250 align:middle line:90%
Ronald Reagan said--

00:44:23.250 --> 00:44:24.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Save us.

00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:24.870 align:middle line:90%
Save us, please.

00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:26.912 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: --said in front
of the United Nations,

00:44:26.912 --> 00:44:31.880 align:middle line:84%
what would unify the world
more than an alien invasion

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:32.680 align:middle line:90%
on the Earth?

00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:33.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, he was right.

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:34.600 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:36.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they used
that phrase, I think,

00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:38.500 align:middle line:90%
as a textbook case--

00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:39.300 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --to say we need to
control-- look what's happening

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:43.950 align:middle line:90%
around this planet today.

00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:45.390 align:middle line:90%
Look at Hong Kong.

00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:50.940 align:middle line:84%
Whoever thought a
Chinese-controlled town would

00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:53.040 align:middle line:84%
go that nuts with
people who want

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:54.530 align:middle line:90%
democracy and independence?

00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:54.750 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Exactly.

00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:55.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who would think that?

00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:56.630 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Exactly.

00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:58.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So the
cabal is probably

00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:00.670 align:middle line:90%
saying this could happen here.

00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:03.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're on the verge of
some issues in this country

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:05.840 align:middle line:84%
as well with everything
that's been going on.

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:06.640 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Exactly.

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:09.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe this is their
way of trying to control us

00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:12.420 align:middle line:84%
by scaring the living
daylights out of us,

00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:15.878 align:middle line:84%
and they're talking
about holographic UFOs.

00:45:15.878 --> 00:45:17.170 align:middle line:90%
They're going to do everything.

00:45:17.170 --> 00:45:19.470 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be a
full-blown campaign, isn't it?

00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:20.270 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Exactly.

00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And what better way to
unify the entire world

00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:28.380 align:middle line:84%
behind the cabal
than alien invasion,

00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:30.240 align:middle line:90%
whether it's true or not--

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:32.350 align:middle line:90%
hostile alien invasion?

00:45:32.350 --> 00:45:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that's what
we're facing ultimately

00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:35.620 align:middle line:90%
down the road.

00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:37.050 align:middle line:90%
That's what's so alarming.

00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:39.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we have
that technology

00:45:39.210 --> 00:45:42.100 align:middle line:90%
that you saw on that video?

00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:44.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Right now I
believe that we do, yes.

00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:46.690 align:middle line:90%
And it is in the military.

00:45:46.690 --> 00:45:50.110 align:middle line:84%
It is in Navy
operations right now.

00:45:50.110 --> 00:45:53.140 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of the abilities,
though, are still classified,

00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:54.040 align:middle line:90%
top secret.

00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:58.270 align:middle line:84%
We can see pictures of the
drones that resemble these

00:45:58.270 --> 00:46:02.380 align:middle line:84%
very much so, but a lot of
this stuff is still classified.

00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:05.210 align:middle line:84%
So we have to look at it
from that angle as well.

00:46:05.210 --> 00:46:08.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you were going to
be telling younger people--

00:46:08.410 --> 00:46:13.410 align:middle line:84%
15-year-olds,
20-year-olds-- about this,

00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:15.190 align:middle line:84%
and they look at
it, and all of them

00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:17.230 align:middle line:84%
will think this is
real and authentic,

00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:19.170 align:middle line:90%
what would you tell them?

00:46:19.170 --> 00:46:20.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: I would
tell them, it's

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:24.850 align:middle line:84%
great that they are looking at
these things with an open mind,

00:46:24.850 --> 00:46:29.850 align:middle line:84%
open heart to really see
what it potentially could be.

00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:32.940 align:middle line:84%
But that's exactly what the
cabal is using against us--

00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:36.120 align:middle line:84%
our creative imagination,
our creative ability.

00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And so I would tell
them also to look

00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:43.320 align:middle line:84%
at these things with an
investigative eye as well--

00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:45.720 align:middle line:84%
not just collecting
the data, not just

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:50.010 align:middle line:84%
collecting the facts, but
to examine these things

00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:52.950 align:middle line:84%
with an investigative bent
so that they can actually

00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:55.960 align:middle line:84%
ferret out the truth of
what's really going on.

00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:57.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
track your work, John?

00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:02.038 align:middle line:10%
>>DESOUZA: Oh, they track me on
my website, johntamabooks.com.

00:47:02.038 --> 00:47:03.330 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Spell that out for us.

00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:09.021 align:middle line:10%

And also on my
Facebook, my Twitter.

00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:15.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm traveling all
over the country,

00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:19.330 align:middle line:84%
doing these conferences and
taking the investigative word

00:47:19.330 --> 00:47:20.130 align:middle line:90%
forward.

00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:21.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you keep
doing what you're doing.

00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:22.770 align:middle line:90%
We need you, John.

00:47:22.770 --> 00:47:24.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Thank you
very much, George.

00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:26.057 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's an amazing
story, whether that's

00:47:26.057 --> 00:47:28.440 align:middle line:10%
real, faked, or otherwise.

00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:29.880 align:middle line:10%
What do you think?

00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:33.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
