>>KEN HANSON: There's
always something new

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.550 align:middle line:84%
to talk about when
it comes to the world

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:15.850 align:middle line:90%
of biblical scholarship.

>>GEORGE NOORY: These constant
discoveries are amazing.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: They were
put in these caves

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.500 align:middle line:90%
at different periods of time.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.840 align:middle line:84%
They're literally
rappelling down the side

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.600 align:middle line:90%
of cliffs, 250 feet down--

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.090 align:middle line:84%
this is dangerous-- in
order to get into some

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.440 align:middle line:90%
of these ancient caves.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.550 align:middle line:84%
The most important biblical
document ever discovered.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.360 align:middle line:84%
We're thinking about 800 to
900 BCE, Before the Common Era.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: If this is not
authentic, I will eat it.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.390 align:middle line:90%
You could not make this up.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.305 align:middle line:90%
It's beyond belief.

00:00:46.305 --> 00:00:51.600 align:middle line:90%

more fascinating to me

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.800 align:middle line:10%
than ancient history,
and Dr. Ken Hanson

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.550 align:middle line:10%
is back with us, a scholar of
Hebrew language and literature

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.240 align:middle line:10%
and the history of the Jewish
people, from ancient times

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.800 align:middle line:10%
through the
Holocaust and beyond.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.450 align:middle line:84%
Ken, welcome back
to "Beyond Belief."

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.380 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Good to be back.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.505 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How have you been?

00:01:08.505 --> 00:01:10.980 align:middle line:10%
>>HANSON: I have been very
well, and very excited,

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.810 align:middle line:10%
because there's
always something new

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.240 align:middle line:10%
to talk about when
it comes to the world

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.660 align:middle line:10%
of biblical scholarship.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These
constant discoveries

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.980 align:middle line:90%
are amazing, aren't they?

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:20.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Absolutely.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.330 align:middle line:10%
Just when we think that
everything that could possibly

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.820 align:middle line:10%
be found has already been found,
then voila, something else

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:28.620 align:middle line:10%
comes up.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do they
find these artifacts?

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Well,
we've been undergoing

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.970 align:middle line:84%
for the last several
years now, over in Israel,

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.670 align:middle line:84%
an entire excavation
known as Operation Scroll.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.028 align:middle line:84%
The government of Israel
launched Operation Scroll--

00:01:44.028 --> 00:01:45.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
combing the country.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: --in 2017 combing the
Western shore of the Dead Sea,

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.530 align:middle line:84%
because 75 years ago, the first
of the famous Dead Sea Scrolls

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.330 align:middle line:90%
were discovered.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.700 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they're
being now commemorated

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.430 align:middle line:84%
in the current issue
of "Life" magazine.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.680 align:middle line:84%
75th anniversary of the
discovery of the Dead Sea

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.480 align:middle line:90%
Scrolls back in--

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 1947.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.060 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: 1947.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Same year as the
Roswell crash, by the way.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.983 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: What do
you know, same year.

00:02:12.983 --> 00:02:14.490 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that interesting?

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.780 align:middle line:84%
Discovered, to begin with,
by a Bedouin shepherd lad--

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.340 align:middle line:84%
the name was Muhammed
edh-Dhib, who was tending--

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In a cave.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: --his flock
of goats-- right--

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.700 align:middle line:84%
and stumbled in a cave upon a
whole row of earthenware jars.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.120 align:middle line:84%
Found a bundle of oddly
wrapped parchments inside.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.770 align:middle line:90%
Didn't know what they were.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.590 align:middle line:84%
Took them off and
ended up selling them

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.950 align:middle line:90%
to a shopkeeper in Bethlehem.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.690 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know what
they were either.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.560 align:middle line:84%
They turned out to be the
most important biblical find,

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.430 align:middle line:90%
at that time--

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ever.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:48.350 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: --ever.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:49.150 align:middle line:90%
Ever.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.070 align:middle line:84%
The Dead Sea Scrolls containing
copies, at least fragments,

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.880 align:middle line:84%
of each and every book
of the Hebrew scriptures,

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.350 align:middle line:84%
as well as scores and
scores of additional books--

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.550 align:middle line:84%
at least fragments of scores
and scores, perhaps even

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.080 align:middle line:84%
hundreds, of books, texts,
that were unknown to the world

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.910 align:middle line:90%
until 1947.

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.010 align:middle line:90%
Nobody even knew these existed.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.990 align:middle line:84%
For example, we
have a whole book

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.540 align:middle line:90%
of Psalms, a scroll of Psalms.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.500 align:middle line:84%
People think of the
biblical book of Psalms.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.790 align:middle line:84%
This is an entire book of Psalms
that nobody ever heard of.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.470 align:middle line:90%
They look like biblical Psalms.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:26.370 align:middle line:90%
They're in Hebrew.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:32.400 align:middle line:84%
But none of them was known until
1947, when quite by accident,

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.020 align:middle line:84%
a Bedouin shepherd lad
stumbled upon them in a cave.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.630 align:middle line:84%
My favorite saying
about all of this

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.310 align:middle line:90%
is, you couldn't make it up.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can't make that up.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.182 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: You could
not make this up.

00:03:43.182 --> 00:03:45.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
did the scrolls say?

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.840 align:middle line:84%
Did they echo the Bible, or
was the Bible the scrolls?

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Well, the scrolls
were copies of the Bible.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.800 align:middle line:84%
The Bible has a very
long chain of custody,

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.800 align:middle line:84%
as it were-- copies of
copies of copies of copies.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know exactly
how old the earliest

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.325 align:middle line:90%
copies of the Bible were.

00:04:05.325 --> 00:04:06.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we
know who wrote it?

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Well, tradition
says that the books

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.620 align:middle line:84%
of the Pentateuch, the Torah,
as we call them in Hebrew,

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.270 align:middle line:90%
were written down by Moses--

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:17.070 align:middle line:90%
Moses--

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From the word of God.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.190 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: But we
can't prove that.

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you that
the majority of scholars

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.878 align:middle line:90%
today don't buy it.

00:04:24.878 --> 00:04:25.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, they do not.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: As a scholar--
and I can talk about this.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.530 align:middle line:84%
My own colleagues do not
believe, the majority of them,

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.790 align:middle line:84%
that Moses wrote much of
anything that is in the Bible.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And many doubt that
Moses even existed,

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.830 align:middle line:84%
which gets into
another discovery

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.750 align:middle line:84%
that we definitely
want to talk about,

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.720 align:middle line:84%
because we have some
contravening evidence that

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.210 align:middle line:84%
might just indicate that
there was, in fact, a Moses.

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.618 align:middle line:84%
And we may in fact have a
text that he really wrote.

00:04:50.618 --> 00:04:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I thought Moses came
down with the Ten Commandments,

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.640 align:middle line:90%
for crying out loud.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.098 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And that's
the tradition.

00:04:55.098 --> 00:04:56.940 align:middle line:84%
But how far back can
you trace this stuff?

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Dead Sea Scrolls date
back to the first two centuries

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:06.720 align:middle line:84%
before the Common Era, the 100s
BCE, before the Common Era,

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.990 align:middle line:84%
and into the very beginning
of the Common Era.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And they all date
to this period.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.920 align:middle line:84%
By carbon-14, we are sure
they are exactly that old.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's remarkable, because
up until the discovery

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.080 align:middle line:84%
of the scrolls,
the oldest copies

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.960 align:middle line:84%
of the biblical text known
to exist in the world

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:25.900 align:middle line:90%
were medieval.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:26.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: The famed Aleppo
Codex dates to around 980

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.050 align:middle line:90%
of the Common Era.

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aleppo, Syria.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.170 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: That's as far back
as we could trace our Bibles.

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:38.040 align:middle line:84%
And now, we've got texts of
the Bible that are almost,

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.860 align:middle line:84%
word for word, identical
to bibles we read today--

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.030 align:middle line:90%
in Hebrew--

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.450 align:middle line:84%
that date back about
1,000 years older

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.040 align:middle line:90%
than the previous oldest texts.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kenny, do
the Dead Sea Scrolls

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:55.150 align:middle line:84%
discuss the birth of Jesus
before he was even born?

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Not
directly, but they do

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.480 align:middle line:84%
indicate that there
was a great expectation

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.680 align:middle line:84%
for the coming of the
Messiah, the anointed one.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.620 align:middle line:84%
They had an apocalyptic
sense that they

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.150 align:middle line:90%
were living in the end of days.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.850 align:middle line:84%
And that is brought
all the more into focus

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.970 align:middle line:84%
by the recent finds
just announced

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:21.370 align:middle line:84%
by the Israel Antiquities
Authority within the last year,

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.850 align:middle line:84%
because as I mentioned,
there's this Operation Scroll

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.040 align:middle line:84%
ongoing for the
past several years

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.370 align:middle line:84%
where they're trying to find
any additional fragments

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.723 align:middle line:84%
that the Bedouin might
have missed back in 1940.

00:06:33.723 --> 00:06:35.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
possible, right?

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.100 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And, in
fact, happened.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.900 align:middle line:84%
So the Israel
government said, look,

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.340 align:middle line:84%
we need to do this in a
scientific, systematic way.

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.100 align:middle line:84%
We're going to cove
every nook and cranny

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.730 align:middle line:84%
up and down the western shore
of the Dead Sea, every cave.

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:50.610 align:middle line:84%
There are thousands
of caves out there.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:51.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: By god.

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And they
use drone technology

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.490 align:middle line:84%
to fly overhead and
try to inspect which

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.500 align:middle line:84%
areas, which nooks,
which crannies

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.680 align:middle line:84%
might actually house
explorable caves.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:08.620 align:middle line:84%
Then they managed to attract a
group of volunteers-- hundreds

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:14.710 align:middle line:84%
of volunteers-- to actually
go in and explore a good 500

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:19.120 align:middle line:84%
caves that possibly may
hold additional fragments.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.960 align:middle line:84%
So you've got these
young Israeli volunteers,

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.670 align:middle line:84%
right before they
go into the army--

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:27.095 align:middle line:84%
this is a good way to get
them used to the rigor--

00:07:27.095 --> 00:07:27.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Combing
the countryside.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: --of the military.

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, they're
literally rappelling down

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:39.460 align:middle line:84%
the side of cliffs with
ropes, 250 feet down the side

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.740 align:middle line:84%
of a cliff-- this
is dangerous work--

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.560 align:middle line:84%
in order to get into some
of these ancient caves.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.920 align:middle line:84%
And when they enter, they're
crawling on all fours.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.600 align:middle line:90%
It's sweltering.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.250 align:middle line:84%
They have to wear
masks, of course.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:52.900 align:middle line:90%
You can barely breathe.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.860 align:middle line:84%
There's dust everywhere,
bat dung, bird dung.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.530 align:middle line:90%
This is difficult work.

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:02.750 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's not been unknown
for injuries to take place.

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:05.380 align:middle line:84%
One major Israeli
archeologist actually

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.620 align:middle line:84%
fell and died at another
archeological site

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:10.190 align:middle line:90%
a few years ago.

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:13.000 align:middle line:84%
So imagine the exploration
to get in there.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And they found, in the end,
over these past several years,

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:21.790 align:middle line:84%
a whole number of ancient coins,
as well as Roman arrowheads--

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.550 align:middle line:84%
because there was warfare
going on in those days

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:26.570 align:middle line:90%
with the legions of Rome.

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:30.550 align:middle line:84%
And most intriguingly, just
announced within the last year,

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:33.940 align:middle line:84%
a series of about 20
parchment fragments

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:37.210 align:middle line:84%
discovered in the distant
recesses of one cave

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:38.679 align:middle line:90%
in particular.

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:41.710 align:middle line:90%
It's called the Cave of Horror.

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:43.407 align:middle line:84%
As I say, you could
not make this up.

00:08:43.407 --> 00:08:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can't make this up.

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:46.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Why the
Cave of Horror?

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:50.710 align:middle line:84%
Because they also found
remnants of 40 human skeletons,

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:53.290 align:middle line:90%
as well as a basket of skulls--

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:54.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 40 skeletons?

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.800 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: 40 skeletons
and a basket of skulls.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.230 align:middle line:84%
All you need are
Nazis shooting at you,

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:02.410 align:middle line:84%
and you've got the next
Indiana Jones film, honestly.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:06.550 align:middle line:84%
It's beyond belief,
as our show declares--

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:07.480 align:middle line:90%
is "Beyond Belief."

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have a show on
Gaia called "Ascension Keepers"

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:11.050 align:middle line:90%
with William Henry.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And he talks about
the Dead Sea Scrolls

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:16.995 align:middle line:90%
from that 1947 discovery.

00:09:16.995 --> 00:09:17.795 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:17.795 --> 00:09:20.960 align:middle line:84%
- In my opinion, the accounts
of the Essenes' interactions

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.760 align:middle line:84%
with the celestials
are contained

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:27.690 align:middle line:84%
in the Dead Sea Scrolls,
the texts they left behind.

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:30.030 align:middle line:10%
These extraordinary
texts affirm there

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:33.990 align:middle line:10%
was something truly unusual
and mystically special

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.460 align:middle line:10%
about the Essenes.

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:38.070 align:middle line:84%
They are quintessentially
spiritual,

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:40.360 align:middle line:84%
oriented towards
the celestial realm

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.600 align:middle line:84%
and its otherworldly
inhabitants.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:47.820 align:middle line:84%
Their goal was an alliance
with the upper world.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:52.500 align:middle line:10%
The scrolls describe cosmic
battles, beings, portals,

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:56.160 align:middle line:10%
hidden agendas, and
new superhumans.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And cloaked behind it all is
the celestial city, the home

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:03.360 align:middle line:84%
and mother church of
their angelic teachers

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.640 align:middle line:84%
and the target of
their ascension,

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.513 align:middle line:90%
and how humans can ascend there.

00:10:08.513 --> 00:10:11.351 align:middle line:90%


00:10:11.351 --> 00:10:14.860 align:middle line:84%
The dark side won a
major victory in AD 68

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:17.110 align:middle line:84%
when the Romans
decimated the Essenes

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:19.690 align:middle line:84%
in an early example
of ethnic cleansing

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:22.060 align:middle line:90%
or spiritual genocide.

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:23.830 align:middle line:84%
With the destruction
of the Essenes

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:26.830 align:middle line:84%
and the murder of almost
a million of these souls,

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:29.560 align:middle line:84%
their ascension
teachings were lost,

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.840 align:middle line:90%
stashed in caves near Qumran.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.690 align:middle line:90%
But they were not forgotten.

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:39.220 align:middle line:84%
Mystical luminaries sought
their teachings for ages.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:43.540 align:middle line:84%
Believing in reincarnation,
it's possible the Essenes knew

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:46.240 align:middle line:84%
that their disappearance
at the hands of the Romans

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.490 align:middle line:84%
was a temporary
state of affairs.

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:51.400 align:middle line:90%
They would return.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.320 align:middle line:84%
The Essenes' cache
of scrolls, in fact,

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.710 align:middle line:84%
was rediscovered
by chance in 1947.

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:57.760 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:58.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What was that--

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.428 align:middle line:84%
the inscription was
what language, Ken?

00:11:01.428 --> 00:11:02.470 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: This is Hebrew.

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same Hebrew
that we speak today.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.970 align:middle line:84%
I lived in Israel,
studied there.

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:08.470 align:middle line:90%
I speak modern Hebrew.

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And yet the fact that I know
Hebrew-- today's Hebrew--

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:14.920 align:middle line:84%
made it possible for me to
go back, pick up the Dead Sea

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.530 align:middle line:84%
Scrolls, and read them like
you'd read a newspaper.

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:19.760 align:middle line:84%
And that really
stuck in my mind,

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.750 align:middle line:84%
and actually propelled me to
do all of my doctoral work

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:24.490 align:middle line:84%
and to become a
professor in this.

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:28.120 align:middle line:84%
But now, the video mentioned
this revolt against Rome

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.520 align:middle line:84%
that the Romans put
down ferociously

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:34.510 align:middle line:84%
in 68 of the Common
Era, at which point,

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:35.980 align:middle line:90%
the sect was wiped out.

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:38.170 align:middle line:84%
What people don't
realize is that there

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:41.890 align:middle line:84%
was a second great
revolt. That first revolt

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:45.550 align:middle line:84%
didn't end the desire of
the Israelites to be free.

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:47.140 align:middle line:90%
There were no more Essenes.

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:48.610 align:middle line:90%
The sect was wiped out.

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:53.830 align:middle line:84%
But other Israelites rose
up under a messianic leader.

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:55.300 align:middle line:90%
You talked about the Messiah.

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:58.600 align:middle line:84%
There was almost a messianic
mania in those days.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.872 align:middle line:84%
There was a messianic leader
named Simon bar Kokhba.

00:12:00.872 --> 00:12:02.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What period are
we talking about here?

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:07.960 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: We're talking about
132 to 135 of the Common Era.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.910 align:middle line:84%
That's when the
Second Great revolt--

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:10.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: AD.

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:10.910 align:middle line:90%
AD.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:14.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Yes-- called the
Bar Kokhba revolt broke out.

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:18.250 align:middle line:84%
A great rabbi named
Akiva, one of the greatest

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:21.040 align:middle line:84%
rabbis of all Jewish
history, proclaimed

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.180 align:middle line:90%
him to be the Messiah.

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:23.590 align:middle line:90%
And they believed it.

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:26.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Romans, under
the emperor Hadrian,

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:29.050 align:middle line:84%
put it down even
more ferociously

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:31.570 align:middle line:84%
than they put down
the first revolt.

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:36.220 align:middle line:84%
And the very remnants of
that revolt hid in caves--

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:39.910 align:middle line:84%
the same caves on the western
shore of the Dead Sea,

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:42.190 align:middle line:90%
including the Cave of Horror.

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's why those skeletal
remains are in there, remnants

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:50.140 align:middle line:84%
of that second horrific
revolt. But they

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:53.360 align:middle line:84%
believe that this was
the very end of days.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.560 align:middle line:84%
So when Operation Scroll
found these new fragments

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.320 align:middle line:84%
and just unveiled them
within the last year--

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's dramatic.

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:01.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Very dramatic.

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:03.700 align:middle line:90%
But what did the fragments read?

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.580 align:middle line:84%
Of all of the texts
they might have found,

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:11.140 align:middle line:84%
the fragments that were
now released read this--

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:16.870 align:middle line:84%
the mountains quake before him,
the hills melt, and the earth

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:19.300 align:middle line:90%
heaves at his presence.

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.670 align:middle line:84%
Yes, the world and
all who dwell in it.

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:25.510 align:middle line:84%
Who can stand before
his indignation?

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:28.600 align:middle line:84%
Who can endure the
fury of his wrath?

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.970 align:middle line:84%
His fury has poured
out like fire

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:33.790 align:middle line:84%
and the rocks are
thrown down by him.

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:35.210 align:middle line:90%
Imagine finding that fragment--

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:37.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they talking
about God or Jesus?

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:39.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: They're talking
about God, the god of Israel.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And they're believing-- or the
Messiah, whoever that would be.

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:46.030 align:middle line:84%
Of course, this is
after Jesus now.

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:50.860 align:middle line:84%
But in their case, Bar Kokhba
was their messianic leader.

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And they had a sense that
this was the end of days.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:56.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:57.430 align:middle line:90%
Truly remarkable.

00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:00.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, you say they are finding
more and more scrolls.

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:03.410 align:middle line:84%
First of all, Ken, why do you
believe they were put in caves

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:04.210 align:middle line:90%
and hidden?

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:06.608 align:middle line:84%
To preserve, so nobody
would destroy them?

00:14:06.608 --> 00:14:07.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: It depends, because--

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:08.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that
why they hid them?

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:10.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: --they were
put in these caves

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.788 align:middle line:84%
at different periods of
time, over centuries.

00:14:13.788 --> 00:14:14.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Different caves?

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:15.630 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yes.

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:18.730 align:middle line:84%
In the case of the
Essenes, I am convinced

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:21.640 align:middle line:84%
that this was their actual
library, that they put them

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:23.900 align:middle line:90%
in these caves for safekeeping.

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:27.610 align:middle line:84%
But in the case of these new
fragments from the Bar Kokhba

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:30.490 align:middle line:84%

later in history--

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:33.400 align:middle line:90%
a good century or more later.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And these were people
hiding from the Romans.

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And they took their
favorite passages

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:40.960 align:middle line:84%
with them, their favorite
scrolls with them,

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:43.360 align:middle line:90%
for safekeeping, of course.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly enough,
in that same cave,

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.540 align:middle line:84%
the Cave of Horror, in
the distant recesses,

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:56.260 align:middle line:84%
they found the remains of a
little girl, 6,000 years old,

00:14:56.260 --> 00:15:01.090 align:middle line:84%
that no one had discovered
before, in a flat burial

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:04.870 align:middle line:84%
place under two flat
stones, wrapped carefully

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:09.950 align:middle line:84%
in a blanket tucked under
her, with care and love.

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:10.750 align:middle line:90%
A little girl.

the significance of that was?

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:55.270 align:middle line:90%

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:00.490 align:middle line:84%
- Habakkuk is a thin book
in the Hebrew Bible, which

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:05.230 align:middle line:84%
speaks of the impending doom of
the ancient Israelite kingdom

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:09.220 align:middle line:84%
as it was about to be gobbled
up by the powerful Babylonian

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:10.510 align:middle line:90%
Empire.

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:13.600 align:middle line:84%
The prophet bemoans the
sins of the people which

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.850 align:middle line:84%
have brought about
this catastrophe,

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:18.790 align:middle line:84%
but he concludes
that whatever is

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:22.570 align:middle line:84%
to be the national fate
of Israel, the thing to do

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:25.570 align:middle line:84%
is to be faithful
on a personal level.

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:29.140 align:middle line:10%
He makes the classic statement--

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:31.000 align:middle line:10%
[SPEAKING HEBREW]

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:46.390 align:middle line:84%
The doom that the prophet
sees is imminent and involves

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:48.370 align:middle line:90%
actual historical events--

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:52.460 align:middle line:84%
the impending destruction of
the nation by a foreign power.

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:54.640 align:middle line:84%
This is where good
detective work

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.550 align:middle line:84%
is required, because
the Dead Sea Habakkuk

00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:02.620 align:middle line:84%
commentary, by contrast, is more
an apocalyptic work regarding

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:05.710 align:middle line:84%
the end of days than
a straightforward

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:08.980 align:middle line:84%
explanation of what the
biblical book is all about.

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:14.680 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the word "apocalypse,"
a term akin to eschatology,

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:17.530 align:middle line:84%
comes from a Greek
root meaning that

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:21.849 align:middle line:84%
which is revealed, and well
describes what the Dead Sea

00:17:21.849 --> 00:17:23.490 align:middle line:90%

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.000 align:middle line:90%

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:17.650 align:middle line:84%
by the Bedouin in a cave
east of the Dead Sea.

Now, this is trans-Jordan--

00:18:19.503 --> 00:18:20.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When was
that discovered?

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:25.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: It was discovered
in the late 1860s

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:28.370 align:middle line:90%
by the Bedouin wrapped in linen.

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:32.080 align:middle line:84%
This is long before the Dead
Sea Scrolls were ever found,

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:36.340 align:middle line:84%
but wrapped in the same
kind of linen cloth.

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:41.650 align:middle line:84%
And within, we have a series
of parchment fragments.

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:43.870 align:middle line:90%
There were 16 altogether.

>>NOORY: Let me hold this for

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:57.120 align:middle line:90%
This is a text in paleo-Hebrew.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.800 align:middle line:84%
This is not the

>>HANSON: The original
one, we don't know.

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:05.178 align:middle line:84%
But based on the
language itself--

00:19:05.178 --> 00:19:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Almost a
thousand years old?

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:10.620 align:middle line:84%

>>HANSON: And the Bedouin didn't
know what they had discovered.

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:20.340 align:middle line:84%
They sold it for a pittance
to a shopkeeper in Jerusalem

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:22.032 align:middle line:90%
named Moses Shapira.

00:19:22.032 --> 00:19:23.490 align:middle line:84%

00:19:25.725 --> 00:19:26.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can read that?

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:27.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yes.

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And we're looking, over
here in this column,

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:35.820 align:middle line:84%
at the most important passage
in all of the Hebrew scriptures,

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:38.680 align:middle line:84%
from the sixth chapter of
the Book of Deuteronomy.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:45.767 align:middle line:84%
It says, in Hebrew,
[SPEAKING HEBREW] here,

00:19:45.767 --> 00:19:49.900 align:middle line:84%
oh, Israel, God,
our God, God is one.

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:51.820 align:middle line:90%
That's what this text says.

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:55.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, Moses Shapira, who
bought this from the Bedouin,

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.620 align:middle line:84%
he looked at this
and he said, this

00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:01.270 align:middle line:84%
is an abbreviated version
of the Book of Deuteronomy--

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:03.580 align:middle line:90%
and a shortened version.

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And he became
convinced that this

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:09.800 align:middle line:90%
may have been Moses' own copy.

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:10.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:14.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Now, as I mentioned,
most scholars today,

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:17.302 align:middle line:84%
including my colleagues, doubt
that Moses ever wrote anything.

00:20:17.302 --> 00:20:18.760 align:middle line:84%
Most doubt that
Moses even existed.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are they doubting
all of this all of a sudden?

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:23.410 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Because when we
look at the traditional book

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:24.220 align:middle line:90%
of Deuteronomy--

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:27.140 align:middle line:84%
I have a copy of one
fragment of it here.

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:29.020 align:middle line:84%
This is only about
300 years old.

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:32.080 align:middle line:84%
This is a relatively
recent copy of Deuteronomy,

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:33.277 align:middle line:90%
just three centuries old.

00:20:33.277 --> 00:20:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Contains the first of
the Ten Commandments--

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:36.475 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Bible has
the book of Deuteronomy.

00:20:36.475 --> 00:20:36.850 align:middle line:90%
It's this, right?

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:37.480 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yes.

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.460 align:middle line:84%
This is the traditional
book of Deuteronomy.

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:42.040 align:middle line:84%
It's much longer
than the fragments

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.322 align:middle line:90%
that were shown to Shapira.

00:20:43.322 --> 00:20:44.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who was Deuteronomy?

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:48.490 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Deuteronomy is
ascribed to Moses himself.

00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:52.090 align:middle line:84%
But it has all
manner of laws in it

00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:55.000 align:middle line:84%
that discuss what you
will do, you Israelites,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.100 align:middle line:84%
when you settle in
the land of Canaan.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.380 align:middle line:84%
For example, it
has the famous law,

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:02.620 align:middle line:84%
don't muzzle an ox as
it treads out the grain.

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And wait a second, where were
the Israelites, wandering

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:07.030 align:middle line:90%
in the desert for 40 years?

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:07.990 align:middle line:90%
What ox?

00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:09.092 align:middle line:90%
What grain?

00:21:09.092 --> 00:21:11.050 align:middle line:84%
Moses couldn't have
written anything like that.

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And chapters and chapters of
laws for a settled agrarian

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:18.760 align:middle line:84%
society that made no sense for
people wandering in the desert.

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:22.030 align:middle line:84%
So my colleague friends,
my scholarly friends,

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:24.370 align:middle line:84%
say, oh, this could not
have been written by Moses.

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:26.800 align:middle line:84%
This was all just made
up centuries later

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.090 align:middle line:90%
and ascribed to Moses.

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:29.680 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what?

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:32.380 align:middle line:84%
None of those
problematical passages

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:34.690 align:middle line:90%
are in the Moses scroll.

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:38.290 align:middle line:84%
If you could
fabricate or imagine

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:42.310 align:middle line:84%
a document that the real
Moses actually wrote,

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:44.110 align:middle line:90%
this would be it.

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:48.460 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the very
divine name YHWH--

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:51.460 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people are
familiar with YHWH.

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:54.200 align:middle line:84%
It's pronounced yah-- and we
don't even say the rest of it

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.000 align:middle line:90%
in Judaism.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:55.990 align:middle line:90%
It's too holy.

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:59.140 align:middle line:84%
That name doesn't appear
in the Moses scroll.

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:02.560 align:middle line:84%
Because the idea is
that the term Elohim

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.720 align:middle line:84%
was used at that
very early date,

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:08.500 align:middle line:84%
and the YHWH not
introduced till later.

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:10.240 align:middle line:10%
Well, the story gets
more fascinating,

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:13.390 align:middle line:10%
because Shapira was
blown away by this.

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:15.620 align:middle line:10%
He showed it to some
scholarly friends.

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:16.510 align:middle line:90%
He went to Europe.

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:17.440 align:middle line:90%
He went to Leipzig.

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:18.580 align:middle line:90%
He went to Berlin.

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:22.190 align:middle line:84%
One scholar in Berlin said,
if this is not authentic,

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:23.390 align:middle line:90%
I will eat it.

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:25.270 align:middle line:90%
He was that convinced.

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Then Shapira took these
16 fragments to London,

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:33.370 align:middle line:84%
to the British Museum, where
they were put on display,

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:34.840 align:middle line:90%
amidst great fanfare--

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:38.260 align:middle line:84%
huge throngs, crowds,
the newspapers.

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:41.710 align:middle line:84%
The prime minister of Britain in
those days, William Gladstone,

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:44.620 align:middle line:90%
came and inspected them himself.

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And the museum was prepared
to offer Moses Shapira

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:54.310 align:middle line:84%
a sum of one million
pounds sterling for what

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:57.770 align:middle line:84%
would be the most important
biblical document ever

00:22:57.770 --> 00:22:58.570 align:middle line:90%
discovered.

00:22:58.570 --> 00:22:59.945 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, I'm
convinced, Ken,

00:22:59.945 --> 00:23:03.010 align:middle line:84%
that some billionaires
have documents hidden

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:04.780 align:middle line:90%
away somewhere in their house.

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:06.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Well, I
wouldn't be surprised.

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:08.080 align:middle line:90%
And it actually relates to this.

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:11.020 align:middle line:84%
Because what happened
almost immediately

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:15.310 align:middle line:84%
is that the scholarly
community started doubting it,

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:17.920 align:middle line:84%
because they hadn't yet
discovered the Dead Sea

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:19.000 align:middle line:90%
Scrolls.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.850 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when the Dead Sea
Scrolls were first discovered,

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:26.030 align:middle line:84%
the great scholar Solomon
Zeitlin said, forgery.

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:26.830 align:middle line:90%
Fraud.

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:28.210 align:middle line:90%
Dead Sea Scrolls?

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:29.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Don't exist, right?

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:31.358 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Well, these
were just forgeries

00:23:31.358 --> 00:23:32.442 align:middle line:90%
that you're showing to us.

00:23:32.442 --> 00:23:33.370 align:middle line:90%
These are not ancient.

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:36.340 align:middle line:84%
It took carbon-14 to
prove that they're,

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:38.052 align:middle line:84%
in fact, 2,000 years
old, because nothing

00:23:38.052 --> 00:23:39.010 align:middle line:90%
that old could survive.

00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:40.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the jars they
put them in were clay.

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:42.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Clay jars
that preserved them.

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:43.955 align:middle line:84%
Now, in this case,
we didn't have

00:23:43.955 --> 00:23:45.595 align:middle line:90%
carbon-14 in the 19th century.

00:23:45.595 --> 00:23:46.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, of course not.

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:49.295 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: This was 1883 already
by the time they ended up

00:23:49.295 --> 00:23:50.095 align:middle line:90%
in Britain.

00:23:50.095 --> 00:23:50.380 align:middle line:90%
And the--

00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:52.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was the material
they wrote this on, parchment?

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:55.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: This is leather,
a leathery type of material

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:56.860 align:middle line:90%
covered with--

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:57.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From an animal.

00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:00.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: --an asphalt-- yes,
with an asphalt type of resin,

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:04.330 align:middle line:84%
folded like this so that
only text touched text.

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:06.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did
they use for the ink?

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:08.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON:
Traditionally, they used

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:12.070 align:middle line:84%
gall nut, which is where
a wasp stings a tree

00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:14.020 align:middle line:84%
and it produces a
little bump in the tree,

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.660 align:middle line:84%
and that's ground up and
combined with carbon powder.

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:21.040 align:middle line:84%
That's how traditional Torahs
are inscribed even today.

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:24.070 align:middle line:84%
But we don't have the
scrolls to examine anymore.

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:25.300 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:28.330 align:middle line:84%
Because the scholars
began to denounce these.

00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:30.730 align:middle line:84%
They said, this
has to be a fake.

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:32.650 align:middle line:90%
It has to be a forgery, a fraud.

00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:34.600 align:middle line:90%
Nothing that old could survive.

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.850 align:middle line:90%
We didn't have carbon-14.

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:39.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you, of course,
think that's ridiculous, right?

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:40.510 align:middle line:90%
It did survive.

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:43.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Well, what happened
was, poor Moses Shapira was

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:44.310 align:middle line:90%
disgraced.

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:48.150 align:middle line:84%
The British Museum took
them down from display.

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:49.320 align:middle line:90%
Shapira was ruined.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:50.685 align:middle line:90%
His reputation was destroyed.

00:24:50.685 --> 00:24:51.030 align:middle line:90%
His family.

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:53.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they thought
he concocted this?

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:56.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Yes, he was accused
of forging them himself.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:59.520 align:middle line:84%
He ended up fleeing
to Holland, where

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:01.620 align:middle line:84%
he tried to find some
other scholars on his side.

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:02.580 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't.

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:05.407 align:middle line:84%
And in the end, the
poor man shot himself.

00:25:05.407 --> 00:25:06.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my god.

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.380 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: He committed suicide.

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:08.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The pressure
was that bad.

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:09.603 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: It was that bad.

00:25:09.603 --> 00:25:11.580 align:middle line:84%
His family was
ruined in bankruptcy.

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:14.760 align:middle line:84%
His shop in Jerusalem, they
had to sell everything.

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And what about these
16 parchment fragments?

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:18.930 align:middle line:90%
Well--

00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:20.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And where are they?

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:24.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: The British Museum put
them up for auction in London,

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:28.410 align:middle line:84%
and they were sold for a
sum of 10 pounds sterling.

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:29.490 align:middle line:90%
Can you imagine that?

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:30.532 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who bought them?

00:25:30.532 --> 00:25:31.800 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: A bookseller.

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:33.570 align:middle line:90%
Just a bookseller bought them.

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:35.310 align:middle line:90%
His name was Karadzic.

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And he sold them to another
gentleman, who basically

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:45.510 align:middle line:90%
wrote an article about them.

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:47.370 align:middle line:90%
Also believed they were frauds.

00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:50.460 align:middle line:90%
And subsequently, they vanished.

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:52.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like I
just said, somebody

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:53.580 align:middle line:90%
has them in their house.

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:54.265 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: They've vanished.

00:25:54.265 --> 00:25:55.098 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Taken away.

00:25:55.098 --> 00:25:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And no one has
seen a trace of them since.

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.170 align:middle line:90%
Talk about a detective story.

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:03.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, what we have
that has survived

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:07.050 align:middle line:84%
are some old photos that are
illegible, back in the 1800s.

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:09.960 align:middle line:84%
We also have detailed
transcriptions

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:14.400 align:middle line:84%
where, back then, they
came along and made

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:17.910 align:middle line:84%
a transcription, in
ink, of every letter

00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:19.170 align:middle line:90%
on all of these scrolls.

00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:21.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ken, let's take a look
at biblical scholar Michael

00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:25.530 align:middle line:84%
Heiser, whom I interviewed,
talking about similar things

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:27.360 align:middle line:90%
that you've just brought up.

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:28.200 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:31.360 align:middle line:90%
- Adam, Noah, Moses, Joshua.

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.520 align:middle line:84%
Not all of those figures
are called prophets,

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.110 align:middle line:84%
but they all have
one thing in common,

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:37.400 align:middle line:90%
and that is a divine encounter.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:38.200 align:middle line:90%
- A connection.

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.000 align:middle line:90%
- A connection.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.485 align:middle line:10%
So God comes to them in
some sort of memorable--

00:26:43.485 --> 00:26:44.860 align:middle line:10%
and I think if
God came to me, it

00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:47.860 align:middle line:10%
would be easy to remember
that day in my life.

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:50.410 align:middle line:90%
But it's a memorable event.

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:52.420 align:middle line:90%
And they get commissioned.

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:56.330 align:middle line:84%
God comes to them and says,
I've picked you for this task.

00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:57.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:57.130 --> 00:27:00.070 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they do it,
because again, they're--

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:04.688 align:middle line:84%
hey, I don't want to disobey
this encounter message.

00:27:04.688 --> 00:27:05.980 align:middle line:90%
You even get arguments, though.

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:08.950 align:middle line:84%
Moses actually argues
with God about why

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:10.030 align:middle line:90%
he shouldn't pick him.

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:11.090 align:middle line:90%
Well, I can't speak well.

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:11.890 align:middle line:90%
I can't do this.

00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:12.280 align:middle line:90%
I can't do that.

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:13.060 align:middle line:90%
- He didn't want to be picked.

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:13.540 align:middle line:90%
- He didn't-- right.

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:14.998 align:middle line:84%
He didn't want to
go back to Egypt.

00:27:14.998 --> 00:27:18.743 align:middle line:84%
But God more or less assures
him that at the end of the day,

00:27:18.743 --> 00:27:19.660 align:middle line:90%
you're going to be OK.

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:20.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be with you.

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And he gives them,
again, signs to show

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:25.630 align:middle line:90%
Pharaoh that are miraculous.

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And so Moses quits
fighting and goes back.

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.130 align:middle line:84%
But it's really about
the divine encounter.

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:31.930 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:34.960 align:middle line:84%
There are two parts of the
Bible that fascinate me, Ken--

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:38.910 align:middle line:84%
Genesis and the
Book of Revelation.

00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:40.530 align:middle line:84%
Who wrote the Book
of Revelation?

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:42.540 align:middle line:90%
Was that written by John?

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:45.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Traditionally, it was
written by the apostle John,

00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:48.450 align:middle line:84%
although I have my
own ideas about that.

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:51.960 align:middle line:84%
I think it was a John,
but personally, I

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:54.120 align:middle line:84%
think we may be
talking about a rather

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:57.127 align:middle line:90%
mysterious 13th disciple--

00:27:57.127 --> 00:27:57.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: --in the shadows, the
so-called "beloved disciple,"

00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:04.770 align:middle line:84%
who also happens to have
been an Israelite priest.

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:06.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, was the
Book of Revelation

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:09.510 align:middle line:84%
discovered in the Dead
Sea Scrolls as well?

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:13.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: No, but we do have
a very apocalyptic document

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:17.520 align:middle line:84%
referenced in our earlier
video that talks about war

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.140 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the age.

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:22.590 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
war scroll, and it

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:27.360 align:middle line:84%
describes a series of seven
end-time apocalyptic battles

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:30.210 align:middle line:84%
between the sons of
light, so-called,

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:31.420 align:middle line:90%
and the sons of darkness.

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:34.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many of those seven
battles have we had to date?

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:36.570 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Well, they
felt, back in those days,

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:38.487 align:middle line:84%
that they were going
through them at the time.

00:28:38.487 --> 00:28:41.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Every society thought
they were in the end times.

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:42.090 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yeah.

00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And so what I like to
look at are cycles--

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.970 align:middle line:90%
apocalyptic, as it were, cycles.

00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, as you
look down through history,

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:53.170 align:middle line:84%
there are apocalypses that
occur from time to time.

00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:53.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:55.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: I teach the
history of the Holocaust.

00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:57.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We may be in one now.

00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:58.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And we
may be in one now.

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:03.630 align:middle line:84%
And as we mentioned earlier,
those people in the Bar Kokhba

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:05.820 align:middle line:84%
revolt, hiding in
that Cave of Horror,

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:08.250 align:middle line:84%
felt that, certainly,
that they were in one.

00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And in the days of
Jeremiah the prophet,

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:15.700 align:middle line:84%
the Babylonians came
in and destroyed

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:18.450 align:middle line:90%
the great temple of Jerusalem--

00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:19.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's beautiful.

00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:20.533 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: --in those days.

00:29:20.533 --> 00:29:21.550 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:23.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a replica
of what it would look like.

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:24.093 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Of course.

00:29:24.093 --> 00:29:25.810 align:middle line:84%
A replica of the
temple of Jerusalem.

00:29:25.810 --> 00:29:29.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How big would that have
been, in terms of our scale?

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:32.090 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: It was at least
90 feet high, covered--

00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:32.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's huge.

00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:34.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: --covered
over in gold.

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And inside, it was
all cedar wood.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.120 align:middle line:84%
But it was completely
destroyed, burned to the ground

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:41.200 align:middle line:90%
by the Babylonians.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have a
non-biblical text,

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:46.990 align:middle line:84%
did not make it into
our Bibles, called

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:49.420 align:middle line:90%
the Book of Second Maccabees.

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:54.100 align:middle line:84%
And in that book, we're told
that the prophet Jeremiah

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:56.920 align:middle line:84%
brought the Ark
of the Covenant--

00:29:56.920 --> 00:30:00.220 align:middle line:84%
he took the Ark of the
Covenant out of that temple,

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:04.810 align:middle line:84%
along with the altar of
incense and the so-called tent.

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:07.660 align:middle line:84%
We're not told what
the tent is, but I'm

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:11.050 align:middle line:84%
convinced it was the contents
of the Holy of Holies.

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:13.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're also told in
the book of Deuteronomy

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:18.460 align:middle line:84%
that Moses commanded
that a copy of his book

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:21.940 align:middle line:84%
be placed in the
Holy of Holies next

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:24.280 align:middle line:84%
to the Ark of the
Covenant for all time.

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:26.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When did
Moses apparently live?

00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:28.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: That's
also in dispute.

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:33.010 align:middle line:84%
If he lived, most scholars
think in the 1200s.

00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:35.290 align:middle line:90%
I put him in the 1400s BC.

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:37.418 align:middle line:84%
That's another
story, because I'm

00:30:37.418 --> 00:30:38.710 align:middle line:90%
a little bit more conservative.

00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:40.810 align:middle line:84%
I actually follow the
biblical timeline on it,

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:41.840 align:middle line:90%
two centuries earlier.

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:44.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is there some
doubt now of his existence?

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:47.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: It's believed
that Moses could not

00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:50.140 align:middle line:84%
have written all of
the details in Genesis

00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:52.990 align:middle line:84%
through Deuteronomy
traditionally ascribed to him.

00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:55.120 align:middle line:84%
There was just too
much that referred

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:56.650 align:middle line:90%
to even the city of Jerusalem.

00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:58.060 align:middle line:84%
There are references
to Jerusalem

00:30:58.060 --> 00:30:59.560 align:middle line:84%
that Moses wouldn't
have written.

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:02.680 align:middle line:84%
But he would have written
this Moses scroll.

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:05.410 align:middle line:84%
None of that problematical
stuff is there.

00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And we're told, in
Second Maccabees,

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:10.510 align:middle line:84%
that Jeremiah brought
all this stuff, including

00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:13.630 align:middle line:84%
the Ark of the Covenant,
out into the desert

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:17.350 align:middle line:90%
and hid it away in a cave.

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And where was the Moses scroll
discovered in the 1860s?

00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:24.190 align:middle line:90%
By a Bedouin in a cave.

00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:25.090 align:middle line:90%
Voila.

00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:26.500 align:middle line:90%
Touché.

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:28.480 align:middle line:90%
You could not make this up.

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.642 align:middle line:90%
It's beyond belief.

00:31:29.642 --> 00:31:30.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is beyond belief.

00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:32.320 align:middle line:90%
It's truly remarkable.

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:35.440 align:middle line:90%
Who was Moses, in your opinion?

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:36.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: I love Moses.

00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:39.130 align:middle line:90%
I think that there--

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:41.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Charlton
Heston played him well.

00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:43.070 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: He played him well.

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:46.840 align:middle line:84%
But even though scholars
doubt his existence,

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:49.150 align:middle line:84%
I say that if there
were no Moses,

00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:52.990 align:middle line:84%
we would have to invent one,
because great movements,

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:56.890 align:middle line:84%
great peoples, don't come
about with no leader.

00:31:56.890 --> 00:31:58.570 align:middle line:84%
Even the United
States, of course,

00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:00.470 align:middle line:84%
had it not been for
George Washington,

00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:02.710 align:middle line:84%
there would be no
United States, for sure.

00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:04.720 align:middle line:84%
As a historian, we
wouldn't have made it.

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:07.930 align:middle line:84%
It takes strong leaders
to build a movement that

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:09.310 align:middle line:90%
turns into a people.

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:13.660 align:middle line:84%
Moses had to have been,
had to have existed.

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:16.120 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, I
think he was probably

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:19.808 align:middle line:84%
one of the greatest military
commanders of all time.

00:32:19.808 --> 00:32:21.475 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that what
he was originally?

00:32:21.475 --> 00:32:23.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: You can
look at him that way.

00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:24.850 align:middle line:90%
You certainly can.

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:28.900 align:middle line:84%
This escape out of
Egypt was remarkable.

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:31.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did he have
scribes working for him?

00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:33.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Doesn't say so.

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And some scholars have
doubted that writing even

00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:37.930 align:middle line:90%
existed in those days.

00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:41.020 align:middle line:84%
But more recently,
we now have examples

00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:43.720 align:middle line:84%
of proto-Semitic
writing on stone

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:47.830 align:middle line:84%
that have been unearthed
that do date to be that old.

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:51.970 align:middle line:84%
So I don't discount
at all the possibility

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:55.120 align:middle line:84%
that Moses not only
lived, but that he wrote,

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:57.640 align:middle line:84%
and that his writings,
according to the Bible,

00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:00.010 align:middle line:84%
were written down,
were communicated.

00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:03.640 align:middle line:84%
We're told that his
successor, Joshua, came out

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:07.570 align:middle line:84%
to the great Mount Ebal
in the land of Canaan,

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:09.850 align:middle line:84%
where the curses of
the law had been read,

00:33:09.850 --> 00:33:12.520 align:middle line:84%
and he subsequently
built an altar there,

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:16.720 align:middle line:84%
and he wrote upon them
the law of Moses--

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:18.160 align:middle line:90%
the law of Moses.

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:21.100 align:middle line:84%
I think we're, again,
looking at the Moses scroll.

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:22.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is there
so much controversy

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:24.780 align:middle line:90%
surrounding this account?

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:28.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Well, we have a
lot of minimalist scholars

00:33:28.930 --> 00:33:33.400 align:middle line:84%
who basically believe if it's in
the Bible, it must not be true.

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:34.825 align:middle line:90%
And that's very popular--

00:33:34.825 --> 00:33:35.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:36.880 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: --in the
halls of scholarship.

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:37.030 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:37.830 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are these
religious people?

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:42.220 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Many of
them, of course, are.

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:48.730 align:middle line:84%
But they tend to view biblical
texts in a very loose manner.

00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't take
them exactly word

00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:54.580 align:middle line:84%
for word, because
I think that there

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:56.710 align:middle line:84%
is an evolution in
these biblical texts.

00:33:56.710 --> 00:34:00.610 align:middle line:84%
This Moses scroll is,
I, think predating

00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:02.680 align:middle line:84%
our traditional
scroll of Deuteronomy.

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:05.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Assuming everything
you've said today is real--

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:07.910 align:middle line:90%
and I have no doubts about you--

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:10.659 align:middle line:84%
but let's assume
they are all real.

00:34:10.659 --> 00:34:14.350 align:middle line:84%
What does that tell us about
these ancient artifacts?

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:17.949 align:middle line:84%
What does that tell us
about Jesus, about God?

00:34:17.949 --> 00:34:20.030 align:middle line:90%
What does that all mean to us?

00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:23.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Well, we have
an era of discovery

00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:27.620 align:middle line:84%
going on-- and still going on--
such as we've never had before.

00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:34.270 align:middle line:84%
We have tools at our disposal
that really can help to verify

00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:39.540 align:middle line:84%
ancient accounts, to indicate
what we can rely on, what we

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:40.340 align:middle line:90%
can't.

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:43.360 align:middle line:84%
There were a whole
group of, quote,

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:46.300 align:middle line:84%
unquote, "Dead Sea Scrolls"
that were passed off

00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:49.690 align:middle line:84%
to the Museum of the Bible
just a year or so ago,

00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:52.120 align:middle line:84%
and they turned out
to be forgeries.

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:54.489 align:middle line:84%
But we have the
tools now to examine

00:34:54.489 --> 00:34:57.700 align:middle line:84%
what's real, what
isn't, and we can use

00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:59.530 align:middle line:90%
the best tools of scholarship.

00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, what we
find is that while it's

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:06.850 align:middle line:84%
fashionable to doubt
everything, hey,

00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:11.830 align:middle line:84%
we often find that the
more of these tools we use,

00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:16.000 align:middle line:84%

00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:20.470 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Absolutely.

00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And the Moses scroll,
claimed to be a forgery.

00:35:23.410 --> 00:35:26.230 align:middle line:84%
Even today, my
scholarly colleagues

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:27.730 align:middle line:90%
are calling this a forgery.

00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:29.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
authenticate it?

00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:31.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: I ask, if
this is not authentic,

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:33.725 align:middle line:84%
who on Earth would
have forged it?

00:35:33.725 --> 00:35:34.525 align:middle line:90%
The Bedouin?

00:35:34.525 --> 00:35:35.395 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And what's--

00:35:35.395 --> 00:35:37.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Did they know enough
to forge a text like this?

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:38.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --the motive?

00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:39.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: And what's the motive?

00:35:39.250 --> 00:35:42.250 align:middle line:84%
They sold it for a pittance to
Moses Shapira, the shopkeeper.

00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:45.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's claimed that Moses
Shapira would have forged this.

00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:49.100 align:middle line:84%
But wait a second, we
have another fine scholar,

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:52.803 align:middle line:84%
an American Jewish
Israeli, who has recently,

00:35:52.803 --> 00:35:54.220 align:middle line:84%
within in the last
year, published

00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:57.490 align:middle line:84%
a major scholarly work
on the Moses scroll.

00:35:57.490 --> 00:36:00.640 align:middle line:84%
He has actually
gone back to Berlin

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:04.330 align:middle line:84%
and found, in the
Berlin archives,

00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:08.570 align:middle line:84%
Moses Shapira's own papers,
where he is staring at--

00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:09.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In Berlin.

00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:10.203 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: In Berlin.

00:36:10.203 --> 00:36:13.330 align:middle line:84%
Because after he bought them
from the Bedouin, he said,

00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:14.390 align:middle line:90%
this is incredible.

00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:16.057 align:middle line:84%
I've got to show them
to other scholars.

00:36:16.057 --> 00:36:19.030 align:middle line:84%
He went to Leipzig,
Berlin, and on to London.

00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:21.760 align:middle line:84%
But while he was in
Berlin, he showed them

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:24.460 align:middle line:84%
to the scholar who said, if
this isn't real, I'll eat it.

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:25.810 align:middle line:90%
So he has his papers.

00:36:25.810 --> 00:36:27.730 align:middle line:84%
His papers were
lodged in Berlin.

00:36:27.730 --> 00:36:28.812 align:middle line:90%
And in those papers--

00:36:28.812 --> 00:36:29.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's ironic.

00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:32.410 align:middle line:84%

is straining over this text

00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:36.880 align:middle line:84%

means, deciphering the letters,

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:39.470 align:middle line:84%
and making mistakes
as he goes along.

00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:42.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, would someone who
had forged this document

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:44.410 align:middle line:84%
be trying to figure
out what they mean

00:36:44.410 --> 00:36:46.390 align:middle line:84%
and making mistakes
on a document

00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:47.750 align:middle line:90%
that he had forged himself?

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:48.550 align:middle line:90%
It's impossible.

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:49.467 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Probably not.

00:36:49.467 --> 00:36:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: If this
is not authentic,

00:36:51.310 --> 00:36:53.720 align:middle line:84%
then who on Earth
might have forged

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:54.980 align:middle line:90%
that that's the question.

00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:56.470 align:middle line:90%
And there's no answer to that.

00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:58.300 align:middle line:84%
My scholarly colleagues
have no answer.

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:00.850 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit like
those scholars who

00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:02.590 align:middle line:84%
examine the plays
of Shakespeare,

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:04.750 align:middle line:84%
and with all of
the minutia, start

00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:08.577 align:middle line:84%
counting the number of times
"to be" appears in Shakespeare,

00:37:08.577 --> 00:37:10.660 align:middle line:84%
and then try to use that
to prove that Shakespeare

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:11.980 align:middle line:90%
didn't write his own plays.

00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:15.340 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what goes on
in the halls of scholarship.

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:18.220 align:middle line:84%
I call it straining at
gnats without getting

the big picture.

00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And the big picture
is this, if it's real,

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:25.690 align:middle line:84%
it's the most astounding, most
important biblical discovery

00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:26.530 align:middle line:90%

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:37.270 align:middle line:84%
scare me, because as I say,
I can see apocalyptic cycles.

00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Imagine living during the
period of the Holocaust.

00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:42.310 align:middle line:84%
These things happen
over and over again.

00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:44.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't know when the
end of days will be,

00:37:44.350 --> 00:37:46.720 align:middle line:84%
but I can tell you that
in the Jewish world, which

00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:48.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm a part of, there is also

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:52.720 align:middle line:84%
discussion of what's called
the pangs of the Messiah,

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:55.240 align:middle line:90%
[SPEAKING HEBREW] in Hebrew.

00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:58.960 align:middle line:84%
That before the messianic
age and the world

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:02.200 align:middle line:84%
of peace will dawn,
before the Messiah comes--

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:04.540 align:middle line:84%
and of course, Jews are waiting
for the first appearance

00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:06.830 align:middle line:84%
of the Messiah,
Christians the second.

00:38:06.830 --> 00:38:10.570 align:middle line:84%
But before the end comes, there
will be a time of trouble,

00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:11.860 align:middle line:90%
of pangs--

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:14.620 align:middle line:90%
birth pangs, as it were--

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:17.470 align:middle line:90%
a time of war, famine.

00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:21.490 align:middle line:84%
Even inflation is mentioned
among the ancient rabbis.

00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:23.860 align:middle line:84%
So we look out today
at the various threats.

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:58.750 align:middle line:84%
of course, at the

We don't know
exactly where it was.

And of course, scholars dismiss
all this as mythological.

00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:07.916 align:middle line:84%

in the Middle East where,

was in Iraq, right?

possibility, absolutely,

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:15.970 align:middle line:84%
where you can look at where
the rivers came together.

00:39:15.970 --> 00:39:18.260 align:middle line:90%
And there is a theory--

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:22.240 align:middle line:84%
a good scholarly theory-- that
at the very beginning of human

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:25.870 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, there was
a belief in a single god,

00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:27.977 align:middle line:84%
which contradicts
a lot of thinking--

have been the very
first concept, which

00:39:32.477 --> 00:39:33.310 align:middle line:90%

of the Garden of Eden,
the proverbial beginning.

00:39:54.930 --> 00:40:00.780 align:middle line:10%
- There's been a fixation
amongst biblical scholars,

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:05.370 align:middle line:10%
early archaeologists, that
everything in the Middle East

00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:10.860 align:middle line:10%
began on the Euphrates and the
Tigris, down in what is today

00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:15.240 align:middle line:10%

is where the Garden of Eden

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:19.050 align:middle line:10%
was, this was where

archaeologist C. Leonard Woolley

00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:29.370 align:middle line:10%
went to southern Iraq
to hopefully find

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:32.250 align:middle line:10%
the Garden of Eden based

of Sumerian cuneiforms.

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:36.930 align:middle line:84%
However, what he
actually uncovered,

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:41.370 align:middle line:84%
instead, was the exact location
of the ancient Sumerian

00:40:41.370 --> 00:40:43.080 align:middle line:90%
city of Ur.

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:45.000 align:middle line:90%

were trying to prove the Bible.

00:40:50.610 --> 00:40:55.890 align:middle line:10%
And they were funded
by biblical societies.

00:40:55.890 --> 00:41:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- in other words,
they had to come up with

00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:02.910 align:middle line:90%
the proof.

00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And it ignored a lot of
legends and traditions

00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:12.120 align:middle line:84%

cities were elsewhere.

They took it literally.

00:42:19.927 --> 00:42:20.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:22.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And these
ancient traditions,

00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:26.440 align:middle line:84%
even oral traditions, are not
to be dismissed so lightly.

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:29.190 align:middle line:84%
It came to be all the
rage in the 19th century,

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:31.860 align:middle line:84%
with the German school
of biblical scholarship,

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:34.450 align:middle line:84%
to dismiss as much of
the Bible as possible.

00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:38.460 align:middle line:84%
But I'm in that small cadre,
admittedly, of scholars

00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:42.540 align:middle line:84%
who think that we need to
re-examine these biblical texts

00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:45.060 align:middle line:84%
and take them as
seriously as we can,

00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:47.550 align:middle line:84%
because these traditions
are well founded,

00:42:47.550 --> 00:42:49.350 align:middle line:84%
and they are very
ancient indeed.

00:42:49.350 --> 00:42:53.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will they ever find
the tomb where Jesus was laid?

00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:54.750 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: I think I know.

00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:55.875 align:middle line:90%
I think I know where it is.

00:42:55.875 --> 00:42:56.675 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:42:56.675 --> 00:42:57.780 align:middle line:90%
Where?

00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:00.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: That's one
instance where I believe

00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:02.550 align:middle line:90%
it's the traditional site.

00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:05.730 align:middle line:84%
In the Church of
the Holy Sepulcher,

00:43:05.730 --> 00:43:09.435 align:middle line:84%
you go into that church
today, and this entire--

00:43:09.435 --> 00:43:10.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's on that ground?

00:43:10.810 --> 00:43:11.610 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Exactly.

00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:14.520 align:middle line:84%
This entire area
that used to be part

00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:19.380 align:middle line:84%
of a limestone quarry for
the ancient city of Jerusalem

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:22.800 align:middle line:84%
was leveled, and a
church built there

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:26.460 align:middle line:84%
by the emperor Constantine's
mother, Helena.

00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:27.692 align:middle line:90%
And so consequently--

00:43:27.692 --> 00:43:28.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sacred ground.

00:43:28.650 --> 00:43:31.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: --the topography
has all been destroyed,

00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:35.130 align:middle line:84%
yet there is a site of
the traditional tomb

00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:38.040 align:middle line:90%
inside the church itself.

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:41.580 align:middle line:84%
You have to literally
crouch-crawl to get into it.

00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:46.180 align:middle line:84%
But that tomb itself
was recently repaired,

00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:46.980 align:middle line:90%
shall we say.

00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:51.270 align:middle line:84%
There was restoration work
done on the inner chamber.

00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:56.400 align:middle line:10%
And everything seems to match
what the record tells us

00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:00.360 align:middle line:10%
about the cave where Jesus
would actually have been laid.

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:04.050 align:middle line:10%
It was a first-century
burial area.

00:44:04.050 --> 00:44:06.990 align:middle line:84%
There are other first-century
tombs and fresh tombs

00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:08.460 align:middle line:90%
in the basement of that church.

00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:09.730 align:middle line:90%
I've been there.

00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:13.170 align:middle line:84%
So it's an archaeological
paradise to dive

00:44:13.170 --> 00:44:14.070 align:middle line:90%
into all of this.

00:44:14.070 --> 00:44:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ken, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:44:16.170 --> 00:44:17.040 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating.

00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:18.123 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: It's a pleasure.

00:44:18.123 --> 00:44:20.940 align:middle line:10%
Folks can go to my
website, drkenhanson.com.

00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:24.150 align:middle line:10%
And my new book, don't
forget, "Whose Holy Land?

00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:27.630 align:middle line:84%
Archaeology Meets Geopolitics
in Today's Middle East."

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:28.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sounds exciting.

00:44:28.830 --> 00:44:29.670 align:middle line:90%
It is amazing.

00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:33.090 align:middle line:10%
They continue to find
discoveries in caves

00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:34.560 align:middle line:10%
throughout the Middle East.

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:37.290 align:middle line:84%
I wonder what the next
discovery will show.

00:44:37.290 --> 00:44:38.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:41.060 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:46.000 align:middle line:90%
