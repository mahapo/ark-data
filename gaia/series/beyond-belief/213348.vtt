>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.980 align:middle line:10%
Debbi Dachinger with us, a
certified shamanic energy

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.030 align:middle line:10%
healer, UFO journalist,
and award-winning host

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.250 align:middle line:10%
of the incredible
podcast "Dare to Dream."

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.720 align:middle line:90%
That's fascinating, by the way.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.524 align:middle line:90%
How you been, Dab?

00:00:32.524 --> 00:00:34.191 align:middle line:84%
>>DEBBI DACHINGER:
Oh, so good, so good.

00:00:34.191 --> 00:00:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a pleasure to be
with you for this conversation.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.550 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: You look wonderful.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.972 align:middle line:90%
What a great outfit.

00:00:40.972 --> 00:00:42.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Oh,
thank you so much.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:43.810 align:middle line:90%
Anything for you, George.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:44.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very colorful.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.378 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: [CHUCKLES]

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:48.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in this genre?

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.450 align:middle line:10%
>>DACHINGER: Yeah, very
surprising my whole inception

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.150 align:middle line:10%
into this because I've always
been a very open-minded skeptic.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.520 align:middle line:90%
Very spiritual all my life--

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.300 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Yes.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.870 align:middle line:84%
But there were certain things
I was a bit of an eye roller

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.780 align:middle line:84%
about, specifically, UFOs
and things like that.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And I had enormous
turn of events

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.690 align:middle line:84%
in my life that have
led me here today.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.930 align:middle line:84%
It started many years ago with
an invitation to drink ayahuasca

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:16.950 align:middle line:90%
by a fellow podcaster.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I've never done that.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure I will.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.840 align:middle line:90%
It kind of scares me.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: I understand.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.690 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, George, because I was
scared too, and I thought,

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.040 align:middle line:84%
that's doing drugs, and
I will never do that.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.840 align:middle line:10%
And--

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.007 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I'm afraid it'll
give me heart palpitations

00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:32.120 align:middle line:10%
or something like that.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.640 align:middle line:10%
>>DACHINGER: It won't do
that because it's a plant.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.870 align:middle line:10%
It is a natural, organic
drink, so to speak.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.910 align:middle line:84%
So it is actually
a plant and a vine.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.123 align:middle line:90%
They're very specific.

00:01:42.123 --> 00:01:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's thick
too, isn't it?

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.005 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: It is.

00:01:44.005 --> 00:01:45.088 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's liquid form.

00:01:45.088 --> 00:01:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: It can be
very interesting to drink.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like syrup.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.360 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Yes.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.630 align:middle line:90%
And they're mixed together.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.740 align:middle line:90%
They're cooked a bit.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.060 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes this
psychedelic psychoactive drink.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did it do to you?

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Well,
the first time

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.680 align:middle line:84%
I had a beautiful experience,
I didn't understand

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.100 align:middle line:90%
all of what was happening.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And several months
later, I went back.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.280 align:middle line:90%
I went out of country.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And I did four nights back
to back, drinking ayahuasca.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.445 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Four nights?

00:02:12.445 --> 00:02:13.600 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Four nights.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.745 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You drinker, you.

00:02:14.745 --> 00:02:18.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: [CHUCKLES]
I dove very deep.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's the thing about me,
I can be an open-minded skeptic.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.570 align:middle line:84%
But when I feel the
energy of a yes,

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.210 align:middle line:84%
that something is right for
me, I deep dive into it.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And when I drank it, I had
many beautiful experiences.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.350 align:middle line:90%
I saw sacred geometry.

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.030 align:middle line:90%
I understood past lives.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.300 align:middle line:90%
I was being communicated with.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.740 align:middle line:84%
I had one pattern that occurred
starting with the first night.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the divine
came to me and said,

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.400 align:middle line:84%
Debbi, you're a healer, you're a
priestess, and you're a shaman.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.080 align:middle line:90%
And I began to argue.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.790 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I am not.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:56.900 align:middle line:90%
I don't even identify--

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they said you were?

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:59.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Yeah.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long does it take
for the ayahuasca to kick in?

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.600 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: About 30 minutes.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And how much do
you need to ingest?

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Everybody
is different.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.260 align:middle line:90%
You start in different ways.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.060 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not that
I'm going to try it.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: [CHUCKLES]
But just in case.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:14.573 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, no, no.

00:03:14.573 --> 00:03:16.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER:
[CHUCKLES] You know,

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.630 align:middle line:90%
you usually start with one cup.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.030 align:middle line:84%
But the shaman will
check in with you

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.570 align:middle line:84%
to understand who you
are, what size you are,

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.140 align:middle line:90%
how much you might need.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.840 align:middle line:84%
A really good shaman knows
how much to give you.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And then throughout
the experience, maybe

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.840 align:middle line:84%
a couple of hours in, you
might desire another cup.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.580 align:middle line:90%
And I certainly have done that.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.360 align:middle line:84%
Like with yahe, I ended
up having three cups.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.810 align:middle line:90%
It was just a big experience.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.648 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can you overdose on it?

00:03:42.648 --> 00:03:44.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: I don't
think you can overdose

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.110 align:middle line:90%
on something natural like that.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully,
anyone who's doing it

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.340 align:middle line:84%
has a really good
shaman with them.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.190 align:middle line:84%
So should anything
go awry, there's

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.210 align:middle line:84%
somebody there to
guide you back.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you became
a believer in ETs.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.913 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Mm-hmm.

00:03:58.913 --> 00:04:00.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What got
you to believe that?

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Yeah, because
of the ayahuasca situation

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.410 align:middle line:84%
and because of the divine
expressing these adjectives

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.090 align:middle line:84%
to me, I went home and I had
a friend who does past life

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.990 align:middle line:90%
regressions--

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: --offered
me some regression

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.820 align:middle line:84%
so I could better understand
what was happening.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.120 align:middle line:84%
I did one session and I saw
myself as a male shaman,

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.730 align:middle line:84%
and it was a very beautiful
life, very peaceful,

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.900 align:middle line:90%
very connected with everything.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.230 align:middle line:84%
We did another session, and I
saw myself as a 7 foot being.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.600 align:middle line:84%
I was a Mayan priestess and I
was the leader of my people.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And I spent the day-- it was
probably an hour under hypnosis,

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.390 align:middle line:84%
but I spent what felt like the
entire day with this amazing

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.560 align:middle line:90%
being so different than me.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And she was creating things
in a way I'd never seen.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.080 align:middle line:84%
And before I left,
George, I asked her

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.810 align:middle line:84%
how she did what she did, where
these abilities came from.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And she raised her finger
and said telepathically,

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm not from here.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm from another galaxy.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And so all of these
misgivings that I

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.520 align:middle line:84%
had and eye rolls about
extraterrestrials,

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.470 align:middle line:84%
I suddenly was like,
[GASPS] I have been one.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:14.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you accepted this?

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:15.990 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: 100%.

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.280 align:middle line:90%
It was so real.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Debbi, we have an
image of a UFO that you saw.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.960 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you tell us about it?

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And where were you
when you saw this?

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: So I've
had many experiences

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.720 align:middle line:84%
with spacecraft and,
specifically, this one

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.310 align:middle line:84%
that you're looking at,
this was in Arizona.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And on this particular night,
we were on sacred ground

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.490 align:middle line:90%
doing contact work.

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And I was taking pictures
without the flash,

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.750 align:middle line:84%
so holding the
camera very still.

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And I caught some
significant things

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.060 align:middle line:84%
later on that I
saw in the camera,

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.440 align:middle line:90%
and this was one of them.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.900 align:middle line:84%
This was very unexpected
because I was looking out,

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.960 align:middle line:90%
and it was perfectly black.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did it disappear
once it got out of your sight?

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: I would say that
every spacecraft I've seen--

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.270 align:middle line:90%
and I've seen many now--

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.858 align:middle line:90%
they are gone.

00:06:03.858 --> 00:06:05.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They blink on and off.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.233 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: That's right.

00:06:06.233 --> 00:06:07.790 align:middle line:84%
They're there to
be seen and then--

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So that didn't zoom off
over the horizon or anything?

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:13.373 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: No.

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:14.915 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Very
strange-looking object.

00:06:14.915 --> 00:06:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Mm-hmm, I've seen
a lot of strange-looking objects

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:18.880 align:middle line:90%
in my time.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.600 align:middle line:84%
This was beautiful
because I felt that when

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.850 align:middle line:84%
I started believing,
really knowing

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.850 align:middle line:84%
the truth about
extraterrestrials and UFOs,

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:28.778 align:middle line:84%
that we're not the
only kids on the block,

00:06:28.778 --> 00:06:29.820 align:middle line:90%
that there is an entire--

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:30.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We never have been.

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: And
never have been.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.270 align:middle line:90%
And that was so new for me.

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And when I accepted that,
I wholeheartedly did,

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.600 align:middle line:84%
there was no resistance,
but there was a lot

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.890 align:middle line:90%
of hunger for information.

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And I felt that all these
benevolent extraterrestrials

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:49.500 align:middle line:84%
were there to help me in very
gentle ways, such as the picture

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:53.590 align:middle line:84%
we just saw and other times that
I had experiences with them.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.350 align:middle line:84%
So I've had very
positive experiences.

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:56.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Debbi, why
does there still

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:59.790 align:middle line:84%
seem to be a resistance
to the acknowledgment

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:02.970 align:middle line:90%
that the ETs are out there?

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:06.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: I have so much
compassion for that because I

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.263 align:middle line:90%
was that person, right?

00:07:08.263 --> 00:07:09.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You were a skeptic?

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:11.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: I was
such a skeptic.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And so I have compassion
for people like that.

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:18.340 align:middle line:84%
I also feel that right now,
more than ever in our history,

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.190 align:middle line:84%
people are waking up,
people are remembering.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.860 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are
coming online and knowing

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.280 align:middle line:90%
the truth about this.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.810 align:middle line:90%
That gives me a lot of hope.

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You went to the World
Conference of Ufology in Mexico.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:30.470 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Yes.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:31.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did
you learn there?

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.320 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Wow.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was one
of the presenters,

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:35.650 align:middle line:90%
and it was phenomenal.

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:39.250 align:middle line:84%
I presented specifically on
shamanism and extraterrestrials

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.290 align:middle line:90%
and how they all intersect.

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:43.900 align:middle line:84%
I was fortunate
enough to also be

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.120 align:middle line:84%
on a panel with
some great experts

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:51.380 align:middle line:84%
that we know and participate
in UFO disclosure conversation.

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:58.090 align:middle line:84%
And I heard some people speak
who talked about experiences

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.460 align:middle line:84%
they had had being
rescued, saved,

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:04.580 align:middle line:84%
healed by extraterrestrials,
relationships they have.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:05.780 align:middle line:90%
I love this.

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:07.490 align:middle line:90%
I love this conversation.

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:08.330 align:middle line:90%
Very heartening.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When do you think we'll
make official contact with ETs?

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:12.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Yes.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:13.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Official contact.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Exactly,
open, undeniable contact

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.620 align:middle line:90%
with extraterrestrial beings.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:19.556 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Publicly.

00:08:19.556 --> 00:08:20.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Publicly.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: When will this happen?

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:26.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: The consensus
right now is a timeline sometime

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.170 align:middle line:90%
by the end of 2026.

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:28.970 align:middle line:90%
And the beginning--

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:29.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's not too far.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:31.020 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: That's very soon.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:32.450 align:middle line:90%
It's imminent upon us.

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:35.179 align:middle line:90%
And early 2027, yes.

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:36.870 align:middle line:90%
So it is exciting.

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And some of it depends
upon our timeline.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.530 align:middle line:84%
As you know, there is multiple
dimensions and timelines

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:43.400 align:middle line:90%
going on.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:47.390 align:middle line:84%
But if we, as humanity, can
start to somewhat get it

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:51.050 align:middle line:84%
together, then that will
accelerate the timeline

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:52.230 align:middle line:90%
and allow them--

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:54.620 align:middle line:84%
they've been watching
us for a very long time,

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.610 align:middle line:84%
and they know what's
happening here.

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:58.790 align:middle line:84%
They would never
intercept, right?

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:02.300 align:middle line:84%
Their protocol is to
uplift and assist humanity,

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:03.930 align:middle line:90%
and that's their mission.

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:08.510 align:middle line:84%
So until and unless it
is that, which is soon

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:12.170 align:middle line:84%
because of the waking up, the
coming back online, then we'll

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:13.390 align:middle line:90%
be ready for this.

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:15.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Debbi, you brought
some photographic evidence

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.480 align:middle line:90%
of past ET contacts.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.500 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:21.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: So we have been
visited since the beginning

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.350 align:middle line:90%
of time by extraterrestrials.

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:25.750 align:middle line:90%
It is ancient.

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:28.542 align:middle line:84%
This particular cave
painting-- and you can see

00:09:28.542 --> 00:09:29.500 align:middle line:90%
the extraterrestrials--

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:30.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who did this?

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.398 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: --clearly.

00:09:31.398 --> 00:09:36.730 align:middle line:84%
This is over 100,000 years old,
so the primitive people of that

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:40.660 align:middle line:84%
time drew this because they
were having relationship with

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.520 align:middle line:90%
the aliens at that time.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That long ago?

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:45.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Yes.

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:47.030 align:middle line:84%
There's proof
throughout history of--

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:48.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Look at the detail.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: It's
amazing, isn't it?

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.288 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's the
alien in the middle.

00:09:51.288 --> 00:09:52.450 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Mm-hmm.

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:55.060 align:middle line:84%
And if you look, you
can see several heads.

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And there's even
Egyptian pictures

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:02.150 align:middle line:84%
where they carved into
the stone spacecraft.

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:04.510 align:middle line:84%
So the Egyptians,
the ancient Egyptians

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:07.640 align:middle line:90%
were also seeing spacecraft.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:08.660 align:middle line:90%
Yes, here it is.

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:08.920 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's the
one from Abydos?

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:11.410 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Mm-hmm.

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:12.210 align:middle line:90%
And it's--

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:15.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's clearly
a helicopter, clearly.

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.380 align:middle line:90%
You see that in the upper left?

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:19.390 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Correct.

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:20.925 align:middle line:84%
And different,
almost a submarine--

00:10:20.925 --> 00:10:22.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a saucer--
there's a submarine up there.

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:23.836 align:middle line:90%
There's a saucer.

00:10:23.836 --> 00:10:25.572 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Mm-hmm.

00:10:25.572 --> 00:10:27.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It could also
look like a yacht.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.670 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH CHUCKLING]

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:31.220 align:middle line:90%
And how old is that, Abydos?

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:32.207 align:middle line:90%
It's thousands of--

00:10:32.207 --> 00:10:34.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Hundreds
of thousands of years.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.310 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, tens and hundreds
of thousands of years old.

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:40.000 align:middle line:84%
There has been proof throughout
history of all of this.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.350 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians, the Sumerians,
the Assyrians, the Babylonians,

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:48.770 align:middle line:84%
the Native Americans,
they all left behind clues

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:52.010 align:middle line:84%
that they have been contacted,
that they had relations

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:55.190 align:middle line:84%
with those from space,
from the cosmos,

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:57.463 align:middle line:84%
that these are truly our
brothers and sisters.

00:10:57.463 --> 00:10:59.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do the other
symbols represent, Debbi?

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:00.450 align:middle line:90%
Do you know?

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:01.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: No, I don't know.

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:06.860 align:middle line:84%
I really, initially, was
looking for the proof of history

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.410 align:middle line:84%
of all of these
different connections

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:12.260 align:middle line:84%
that extraterrestrials and
different species, by the way,

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:17.090 align:middle line:84%
had had with various people,
Earth people throughout history

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:18.480 align:middle line:90%
and in different countries.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And I was fascinated
by how much I found

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:22.485 align:middle line:90%
and all the different countries.

00:11:22.485 --> 00:11:23.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is fascinating.

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:26.110 align:middle line:84%
How long do you think ETs have
been visiting good old planet

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:26.910 align:middle line:90%
Earth?

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:29.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Oh, absolutely
since the beginning of time.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.510 align:middle line:90%
I think we're also a soup.

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:34.750 align:middle line:84%
We're not just a DNA
of quote unquote,

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:36.880 align:middle line:90%
"human genetic material."

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.860 align:middle line:84%
They're really our
brothers and sisters.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:39.990 align:middle line:90%
They're our family.

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:41.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Deeply our family.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:42.927 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: They are
deeply our family.

00:11:42.927 --> 00:11:44.805 align:middle line:84%
We are genetically
related with them.

00:11:44.805 --> 00:11:46.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They may
have seeded us.

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:48.595 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: They
did seed us 100%.

00:11:48.595 --> 00:11:50.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
familiar with the work

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:52.402 align:middle line:90%
of Zecharia Sitchin, the late?

00:11:52.402 --> 00:11:53.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: No, no, I'm not.

00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:54.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:57.247 align:middle line:84%
He claims that an ET
race came to this planet,

00:11:57.247 --> 00:11:58.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Mm-hmm.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --the Anunnaki.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:00.307 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: That's correct.

00:12:00.307 --> 00:12:04.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Seeded whatever was
on this life form of Earth.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.887 align:middle line:90%
And we became who they are.

00:12:05.887 --> 00:12:06.720 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Mm-hmm.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they needed
us to be workers--

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:09.600 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Yes.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --to mine
for gold, which

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:15.810 align:middle line:84%
they sprinkled as gold
dust in their atmosphere

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:17.240 align:middle line:90%
to preserve their atmosphere.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.300 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Mm-hmm

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:20.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's an amazing story.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: That's
450,000 years ago.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:26.360 align:middle line:84%
The Anunnaki were having the
catastrophe on their planet

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:29.490 align:middle line:84%
and they noticed that
Earth was habitable.

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:30.600 align:middle line:90%
It had mining.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And specifically in Africa,
there was gold to be found.

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:35.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it had the
beings, whatever we might have

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:37.080 align:middle line:90%
been before we are who we are.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Yeah, we
were 12 strand DNA beings.

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And because they needed
labor to do the mining,

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:46.770 align:middle line:84%
they made some adjustments to
our DNA down to a two strand.

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:50.330 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we are
a planet of choice,

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.520 align:middle line:90%
of will, our own will.

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And so it actually was
them interfering and not

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:58.640 align:middle line:84%
a correct thing to do,
but it also created us

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.660 align:middle line:90%
into being Homo sapiens.

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And then there were other
races that came and helped us.

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why they
helped us, George, is we

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.910 align:middle line:90%
started to not live as long.

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:10.560 align:middle line:90%
Longevity was an issue.

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:14.450 align:middle line:84%
Women were dying in childbirth
after this alteration

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:15.750 align:middle line:90%
of the DNA.

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, we were starting
to have physical problems.

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And so the benevolent races
who knew this and were helping

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:29.490 align:middle line:84%
to assist us, they came
and, that was specifically

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:34.050 align:middle line:84%
donated genetic material
from the felines,

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:38.250 align:middle line:84%
from the reptilians, from
the avian, the bird people,

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:41.635 align:middle line:84%
and the high level dimensional
light beings of Lyra.

00:13:41.635 --> 00:13:42.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:44.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Yeah,
thankfully, to them.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:46.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Governments
lately claim

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.990 align:middle line:84%
to be doing as much as
they can to disclose.

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:51.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure they are.

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:51.570 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Mm.

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:53.945 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But what are your
thoughts on all these hearings

00:13:53.945 --> 00:13:54.850 align:middle line:90%
and things like that?

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Yeah, I
follow all of that,

00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:58.930 align:middle line:84%
and it's very interesting
what's happening.

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And my feeling is that
the whistleblowers are

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:04.350 align:middle line:84%
going to get louder and
louder, and they're not

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:07.510 align:middle line:84%
going to kowtow now to what
the government's been doing.

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:09.427 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They feel secure
doing what they do.

00:14:09.427 --> 00:14:10.510 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: That's right.

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:12.810 align:middle line:84%
I think they realize they
have a lot of support

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:16.380 align:middle line:84%
from the public more and
more, and we want so much

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:17.680 align:middle line:90%
to hear the truth.

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.440 align:middle line:84%
So whistleblowers are
becoming more brave.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:23.180 align:middle line:84%
I was recently speaking
with Nick Pope and--

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:23.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good guy.

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:26.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Phenomenal,
phenomenal man,

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:27.670 align:middle line:90%
very articulate man.

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:30.570 align:middle line:84%
And he definitely predicts
that the whistleblowers

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:33.280 align:middle line:84%
are going to come forth
even more than before.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:36.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's almost as if
the floodgates have opened up.

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:39.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: We are
remembering, right?

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:42.700 align:middle line:84%
We are coming back online and
the extraterrestrials are aware.

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:47.130 align:middle line:84%
And this is why they say it is
imminent the timeline for us

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:50.040 align:middle line:84%
to have this open,
undeniable contact.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You mentioned shamans.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.715 align:middle line:84%
What exactly is a shaman,
and where do they come from?

00:14:55.715 --> 00:14:57.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: I
love that question

00:14:57.090 --> 00:14:59.700 align:middle line:84%
so much because it's
really misunderstood,

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:03.440 align:middle line:84%
and especially today in the
world of ayahuasca and people

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:06.320 align:middle line:84%
sitting with people who
claim to be shamans.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:09.930 align:middle line:84%
You know, a shaman is not
an easy thing to come by.

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:11.800 align:middle line:90%
It's a very difficult path.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:17.300 align:middle line:84%
The inception of shamanism
is 2.5 million years ago

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:18.880 align:middle line:90%
in the Paleolithic time.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a long time ago.

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:22.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Yeah,
and they were women.

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:25.310 align:middle line:84%
The women were the first
shamans, the first medicine

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:27.140 align:middle line:90%
people, the first oracles.

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.870 align:middle line:84%
They mended bones,
they fixed herbs,

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:32.450 align:middle line:84%
and they transcended
this reality

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:35.390 align:middle line:84%
to go into another
reality to heal people.

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:37.710 align:middle line:90%
And they were brilliant.

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:41.310 align:middle line:84%
And then years later, men
wanted to learn the same.

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And so they taught themselves
how to go into trance.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:47.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's why today,
especially in Siberia, you

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:51.610 align:middle line:84%
will see that shamans are
often dressed like women.

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:54.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were they tuned
into extraterrestrials?

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:56.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: 100%,
always have been

00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:57.910 align:middle line:90%
since the beginning of time.

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:01.770 align:middle line:84%
You know, the Hopis talk about
their Pleiadian relations

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:05.010 align:middle line:90%
and the Zuni elders talk about--

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:06.780 align:middle line:84%
with their
grandparents, how they

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:09.800 align:middle line:84%
were connected to those
from space and the cosmos.

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.640 align:middle line:84%
I think what's really
little understood

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:14.520 align:middle line:84%
about shamanism is one
doesn't wake up and say,

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:16.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be a shaman.

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:21.690 align:middle line:84%
A shaman is chosen, chosen by
community, chosen by spirit

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:23.650 align:middle line:90%
and by the ancestors.

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:25.420 align:middle line:90%
And it's a tough road.

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:26.380 align:middle line:90%
They have to endure.

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:27.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is.

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:30.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Some kind of
transitional experience,

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:35.320 align:middle line:84%
namely a mental crisis or
a near-death experience.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.440 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
struck by lightning.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And some of them go
into a psychic trance,

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:44.400 align:middle line:84%
and they are met face to face
with a fierce animal that

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.090 align:middle line:90%
eats and dismembers them.

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:46.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ew.

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:48.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: And
then that animal

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:51.060 align:middle line:84%
will blow them back
into being with gifts

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:54.603 align:middle line:84%
and becomes their tutor
and their protector.

00:16:54.603 --> 00:16:55.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's interesting.

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:59.920 align:middle line:84%
Now what about the contact with
ETs by using ayahuasca and plant

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:00.720 align:middle line:90%
medicine?

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.180 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Well, I know--

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:03.740 align:middle line:84%
it hasn't happened
to me, but I do

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:06.680 align:middle line:84%
know that for many people
who drink ayahuasca,

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:10.520 align:middle line:84%
they absolutely get visited
by extraterrestrials.

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:13.579 align:middle line:84%
And they're often visited
by the mantis people

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:15.230 align:middle line:84%
if they need some
kind of healing,

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:17.630 align:middle line:84%
and the mantis will
come and facilitate

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:19.890 align:middle line:84%
some kind of physical
healing for them.

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:20.849 align:middle line:90%
I've seen it.

00:17:20.849 --> 00:17:24.329 align:middle line:84%
I've seen it happen,
and it's miraculous.

00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:28.850 align:middle line:84%
As far as shaman connection
with extraterrestrials,

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:31.970 align:middle line:90%
it's really about--

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:34.960 align:middle line:84%
this conversation wouldn't
happen with a shaman

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.980 align:middle line:84%
because this is part of
their everyday world.

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:41.050 align:middle line:84%
They're connected with the
sacred mountains and the rivers

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:45.760 align:middle line:84%
and the skies, Pachamama, Gaia,
the Earth, and also the cosmos,

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:48.320 align:middle line:84%
and all our star
brothers and sisters.

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.020 align:middle line:84%
So this is ongoing
relations with them.

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:55.122 align:middle line:84%
They live in this world and
also the non-ordinary realms.

00:17:55.122 --> 00:17:56.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they have,
like, an herbalist

00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:58.900 align:middle line:90%
making this plant medicine?

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:00.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: What's
really interesting,

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:06.290 align:middle line:84%
George, is that ayahuasca was
discovered by the shamans.

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And imagine going
through the Amazon

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:12.020 align:middle line:84%
where there's tens of
thousands of plants.

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:16.120 align:middle line:84%
How would you pick out
this vine and that plant

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:17.647 align:middle line:90%
and know to mix them together--

00:18:17.647 --> 00:18:18.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And know that it works.

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:19.855 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Exactly.

00:18:19.855 --> 00:18:20.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Trial and error?

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:24.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: No, because the
Achuar people of the Amazonian

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:27.640 align:middle line:84%
region have said it was
the extraterrestrials who

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:28.750 align:middle line:90%
guided them.

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:31.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, just to be fair,
there are other sectors

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:36.070 align:middle line:84%
of shamans around the world who
say that the plants told them.

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:39.010 align:middle line:84%
But both make so much
sense because shamans

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:42.500 align:middle line:84%
are connected to everything, in
conversation with everything.

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you interviewed
a shaman, Oscar Miro-Quesada--

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.000 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Yes.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: About plant medicine
and the shamans' role

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.100 align:middle line:90%
in journey.

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:54.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Does doing that
always necessitate ingesting

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:55.010 align:middle line:90%
something?

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And I can use the words
ayahuasca and yahe and San

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:02.300 align:middle line:84%
Pedro, you know, huachuma, and
there's so much more out there,

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:03.100 align:middle line:90%
peyote.

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:06.460 align:middle line:84%
Does it always include
something like that?

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:10.660 align:middle line:84%
Or can it be done just by
virtue of some of the rituals

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:11.800 align:middle line:90%
that you do?

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.258 align:middle line:10%
>>OSCAR MIRO-QUESADA:
I see, that's

00:19:13.258 --> 00:19:16.690 align:middle line:10%
what you were referring
to by ingesting.

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:17.800 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.200 align:middle line:10%
Our plant sacraments
are an integral part

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.300 align:middle line:10%
of the shamanic phenomenon
around the world.

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:27.610 align:middle line:84%
Yet, many cultures do not
use any plant sacraments

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:32.160 align:middle line:84%
or any type of catalysts
to expand consciousness.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:36.620 align:middle line:84%
On the contrary, just through
ascetic practices and drumming

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:40.160 align:middle line:84%
and shamanic journeys and
fastings and pilgrimages

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:46.310 align:middle line:84%
to sacred sites and isolated
periods of dreaming,

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:51.170 align:middle line:84%
of inner work, you can attain
the same type of contact,

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:54.200 align:middle line:84%
not only with
alternative realities,

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.810 align:middle line:84%
but with the denizens,
with the inhabitants,

00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:58.940 align:middle line:84%
with the spirit
helpers and animal

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:03.950 align:middle line:84%
allies that are part of these
worlds, these inner worlds,

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:06.900 align:middle line:84%
the imaginal, the
archetypal worlds.

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:10.940 align:middle line:84%
In my actual situation,
I was initiated

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:14.720 align:middle line:84%
into the camasca
curandero tradition that

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:19.190 align:middle line:84%
involves the ingestion of San
Pedro cactus or trichocereus

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:20.300 align:middle line:90%
pachanoi.

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And I see all plant sacraments
such as that, ayahuasca, peyote,

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:30.470 align:middle line:84%
psilocybin, any
entheogen that is now

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:33.110 align:middle line:84%
popular and even
clinically being approved

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:39.770 align:middle line:84%
to treat a whole variety of
psychopathological issues

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:45.020 align:middle line:84%
to be keys to a door,
not the door itself.

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And that when you
use them, they must

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:51.200 align:middle line:84%
be used with reverence
and in a manner that

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.950 align:middle line:84%
has a foundation
that is traditional,

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:58.430 align:middle line:84%
that has been sanctioned
since ancestral

00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:03.440 align:middle line:84%
times by a tribal nation or
representatives of an indigenous

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:06.980 align:middle line:84%
people that understand
that these are not

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:10.370 align:middle line:84%
things to play with, that
are not recreational.

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:15.500 align:middle line:84%
They truly are sacraments,
that they are spiritual food,

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:18.350 align:middle line:90%
as they say, food for the gods.

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:23.240 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, it does not require
ingesting any type of plant

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:26.640 align:middle line:84%
to enter into a shamanic
state of consciousness.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:30.810 align:middle line:84%
We are born in a shamanic
state of consciousness.

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:33.530 align:middle line:84%
If we just think of what
it's like to be floating

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:36.500 align:middle line:84%
in the amniotic universe
in our mother's womb,

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:40.250 align:middle line:84%
what more expanded
state of consciousness,

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:43.700 align:middle line:90%
shamanically speaking, is that?

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:51.480 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, we have come in
as amplified shamanic adepts.

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:54.995 align:middle line:84%
We just forget it over time
because of social conditioning.

00:21:54.995 --> 00:21:56.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He makes a lot
of sense, doesn't he?

00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:59.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: He is the most
amazing being, he truly is.

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:03.650 align:middle line:84%
He's doing such great work,
Don Oscar, on this planet.

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And exactly what he
said, it's really

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:09.960 align:middle line:84%
meant to be treated with
reverence and it's so important.

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:12.060 align:middle line:84%
All the wisdom's
inside of us are ready.

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:13.730 align:middle line:90%
It's just been forgotten.

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:15.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you a shaman?

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:17.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: I call myself
a shamanic practitioner.

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:20.690 align:middle line:84%
Shamans never call
themselves shaman.

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:21.500 align:middle line:90%
And I--

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why not.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:26.840 align:middle line:10%
>>DACHINGER: It's not humble
and it's part of the lineage

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:30.030 align:middle line:10%
that they don't do that ever.

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And so, yes, I call myself
a shamanic practitioner

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:36.620 align:middle line:84%
or an energy healer,
any of those things.

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And I, although, well
certified and working

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.690 align:middle line:84%
with groups and people,
I'm still on the path.

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:45.540 align:middle line:84%
I'll be working
with Don Oscar soon.

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:48.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm working right now
with Puma Fredy Quispe.

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:50.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm very passionate
about this work.

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:51.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You are.

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:51.910 align:middle line:90%
It seems like you are.

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:53.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: I love it, yes.

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:55.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about the
Inca prophecy, Debbi?

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.500 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:59.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: There is a prophecy
that comes down from high

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:03.160 align:middle line:84%
on the Andes, and it is
called the Pachacuti.

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pachakuti.

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:05.440 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Pachacuti.

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And pacha, of course, you've
heard the word Pachamama,

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:11.890 align:middle line:84%
like Earth, but pacha
also means time,

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:14.840 align:middle line:84%
and cuti means
setting things right.

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:19.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's taking a very chaotic
experience and making it right.

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.070 align:middle line:90%
And it happens every 500 years.

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:25.990 align:middle line:84%
We are definitely in a Pachacuti
right now where a lot of people

00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:28.030 align:middle line:84%
are experiencing
chaos and having

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:29.900 align:middle line:90%
very particular experiences.

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:30.700 align:middle line:90%
But it's like--

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's everywhere.

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: It needs
to go a little crazy

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:35.120 align:middle line:90%
until it's set right.

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And the Pachacuti is
calling all of us.

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:41.810 align:middle line:84%
It's calling every single
being to harmony, to peace,

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:44.510 align:middle line:84%
to treating others with
kindness and reverence,

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:49.970 align:middle line:84%
to treating the Earth, the good
Earth who houses us and feeds us

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:51.090 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:53.757 align:middle line:84%
The four legged, the two legged,
the many legged, the no legged,

00:23:53.757 --> 00:23:55.590 align:middle line:84%
the fin, the furred,
the winged ones.

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:58.700 align:middle line:84%
She is our home, and
to start recognizing

00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:02.760 align:middle line:84%
who she is, the sky, that
there is peace with everything,

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:05.960 align:middle line:84%
the cosmos, the earth,
the mountains, the rivers

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.080 align:middle line:90%
and each other.

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.470 align:middle line:90%
It is the time for Pachacuti.

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:11.690 align:middle line:84%
So like a snow
globe, if you will,

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:14.120 align:middle line:84%
that gets shaken upside
down, that's a bit where

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:18.300 align:middle line:84%
we are so that for the Pachacuti
we can right ourselves.

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:20.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why don't the
ETs step in and help

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:23.348 align:middle line:90%
us a little more directly?

00:24:23.348 --> 00:24:25.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Oh, it's
such a good question.

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:26.850 align:middle line:90%
And you know, they never will.

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:28.050 align:middle line:90%
They just never will.

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:30.500 align:middle line:84%
I think the only thing
they've ever done

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:33.360 align:middle line:84%
is to stop something
nuclear happening.

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure many of your
listeners and viewers

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:37.850 align:middle line:84%
have heard about
that, where there's

00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:40.490 align:middle line:84%
been incidents
where somebody was

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:43.160 align:middle line:84%
close to pressing the
button on a nuclear warhead

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:46.460 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden,
spacecraft appeared above

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:49.245 align:middle line:84%
and the nuclear
warhead got dismantled.

00:24:49.245 --> 00:24:50.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:52.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Yeah, because
the repercussion goes way out.

00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:53.820 align:middle line:90%
It's way beyond Earth.

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:55.830 align:middle line:90%
It goes way out into the cosmos.

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:58.640 align:middle line:84%
But outside of that,
I mean, they're

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.620 align:middle line:84%
really allowing us
to find our way.

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:02.070 align:middle line:90%
Again, we have our own will.

00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:03.540 align:middle line:90%
We have our own choice.

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:06.620 align:middle line:84%
But they will be stepping
in, but more to invite us

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:08.580 align:middle line:90%
into the galactic community.

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have a
video of you, Debbi,

00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:15.110 align:middle line:84%
sharing an experience as
a shamanic practitioner

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:16.350 align:middle line:90%
at a ceremony.

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:18.320 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: OK, beautiful.

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:19.970 align:middle line:90%
--and our foreheads connect.

00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And into is streaming
energy, feeling

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:27.600 align:middle line:84%
all of the shamanic
lineage coming through me,

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.780 align:middle line:84%
heavenly blessings
for you and your path,

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:32.660 align:middle line:84%
that you make all right
choices, total mountain top

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:35.780 align:middle line:90%
where help will come.

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And now I pull
forward your crown

00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:43.920 align:middle line:84%
and I blow the Starkeeper Rites
into the crown of your head.

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:45.111 align:middle line:90%
[BLOWS]

00:25:45.111 --> 00:25:49.238 align:middle line:90%


00:25:49.238 --> 00:25:50.170 align:middle line:90%
[WHISTLES]

00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:54.090 align:middle line:84%
And I ring with my
fingers, not to alarm you,

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:58.700 align:middle line:84%
but for you to surrender
to this experience.

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And while you remain here
in the Starkeepers Rites,

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:04.760 align:middle line:84%
allowing this energy
to go through you,

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:10.160 align:middle line:84%
I ask you to allow a great deal
of love to emit from your heart.

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:13.340 align:middle line:84%
Just let the light pour
out gold and white light,

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:19.580 align:middle line:84%
filling your body of
love and calm and peace.

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And then take that love
light energy and allow it

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:25.660 align:middle line:90%
to fill up this room.

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:28.250 align:middle line:90%


00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:29.390 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And then take that
energy and fill up

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:38.565 align:middle line:84%
all of Mexico City and Mexico
with your love, with your light.

00:26:38.565 --> 00:26:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And take that
light and spread it

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:44.710 align:middle line:84%
all over the entire
world, deep into Mother

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:49.870 align:middle line:84%
Earth, pachuamama, madre
tierra, deep up into the skies.

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And send love right now,
awareness, consciousness,

00:26:56.820 --> 00:27:01.230 align:middle line:84%
and gratitude for the
beautiful cosmic brothers

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:05.260 align:middle line:84%
and sisters, star
brothers and beings who

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:08.550 align:middle line:90%
know of us and of this moment.

00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And allow this world
to settle back inside

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:14.130 align:middle line:84%
of you, knowing that
you're initiated

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:16.410 align:middle line:84%
and you can choose
the moment you

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:20.700 align:middle line:84%
open your eyes to live from
a future self version of you,

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:24.090 align:middle line:84%
a future healed version
of you, a knowing,

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:27.222 align:middle line:90%
kinder version of you.

00:27:27.222 --> 00:27:29.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you look like
you're having fun there.

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:30.847 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Oh,
it's so beautiful

00:27:30.847 --> 00:27:34.080 align:middle line:84%
to be able to do this for
people and help people

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:37.540 align:middle line:84%
to uplevel, awaken, connect
with their real selves.

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:41.950 align:middle line:84%
That's called the Mosoq Carpay,
the Rites of the Time to Come.

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, this is part
of the Munay-Ki, Rites,

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:48.390 align:middle line:90%
which are really rites of love.

00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:49.930 align:middle line:90%
And there's several of them.

00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:52.140 align:middle line:84%
This particular
one allows people

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:57.450 align:middle line:84%
to move into their future
self, their evolved self,

00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:00.250 align:middle line:84%
so that they can start
to operate from that.

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's very powerful to
watch people come out of this

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:04.850 align:middle line:90%
and be so different.

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:07.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does that energize
you when you do that?

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:10.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Yeah, it
fills me with a lot of joy

00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:13.240 align:middle line:84%
to be able to facilitate
all of these rights

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:14.900 align:middle line:90%
and all of these processes.

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:16.768 align:middle line:90%
It feels very familiar to me.

00:28:16.768 --> 00:28:19.435 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you do that without
the plant medicine involvement?

00:28:19.435 --> 00:28:21.227 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Oh, yes,
that was definitely--

00:28:21.227 --> 00:28:23.553 align:middle line:84%
what we just saw was
not with plant medicine.

00:28:23.553 --> 00:28:24.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was you?

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:25.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Oh, absolutely.

00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:31.900 align:middle line:10%
And I wouldn't do shamanic
practice during a ceremony,

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:32.710 align:middle line:10%
ever.

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:33.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I--

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why not?

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:35.282 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: I would
distinguish them

00:28:35.282 --> 00:28:37.910 align:middle line:84%
because everybody is on
their own healing journey.

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:40.060 align:middle line:90%
They have their own experience.

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:43.450 align:middle line:84%
And everybody-- it's amazing
when you sit in an integration

00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:47.200 align:middle line:84%
circle after drinking
ayahuasca, and you sit there

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:49.270 align:middle line:84%
with, let's say,
20 other people.

00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And you go around,
and everybody gets

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:53.240 align:middle line:84%
to share a little bit
about their experience.

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.550 align:middle line:90%
And it's phenomenal.

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:58.840 align:middle line:84%
You cannot imagine you all drank
the same thing and everybody had

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.430 align:middle line:84%
such a significantly
different experience.

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:03.650 align:middle line:84%
But that experience
was for them.

00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:05.270 align:middle line:90%
My experience was for me.

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:06.967 align:middle line:90%
I got what I needed.

00:29:06.967 --> 00:29:08.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they all
tuned in to each other

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.300 align:middle line:90%
when they're on ayahuasca?

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:12.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: I do feel
like there's a synergy that

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.030 align:middle line:90%
goes on, without a doubt.

00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:14.830 align:middle line:90%
There is--

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:15.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Telepathic?

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:18.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Well, I think
the group comes together

00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:19.720 align:middle line:90%
for great reason.

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And we're all, even though we're
on our individual journeys,

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:25.220 align:middle line:84%
we're holding space
for one another.

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:28.120 align:middle line:84%
We're inviting in
something greater than us.

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:30.710 align:middle line:90%
It's a fascinating experience.

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:33.350 align:middle line:84%
It makes you feel very close
with people in the room.

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:35.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got an image
of Edgar Cayce's quote.

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:36.460 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Mm-hmm

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:39.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Edgar Casey, of
course, was the sleeping

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.990 align:middle line:90%
American prophet.

00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:43.790 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at this quote
and you tell us what it is.

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:44.870 align:middle line:90%
Read it to us, Debbi.

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:48.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Yes, Edgar Cayce
said, "the people of the Earth

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:50.510 align:middle line:84%
shall meet the people
of the universe.

00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:54.580 align:middle line:84%
As we approach the Golden age,
the veils shall be removed

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:58.390 align:middle line:84%
and the people of the Earth
shall become aware of the people

00:29:58.390 --> 00:29:59.660 align:middle line:90%
of the universe."

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:00.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hear, hear, right?

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:03.380 align:middle line:10%
>>DACHINGER: Edgar
Cayce died in 1945,

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:06.610 align:middle line:10%
so this prediction, if
you will, the clairvoyant

00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:09.700 align:middle line:10%
said this, at least, 80
years before you and I are

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:11.350 align:middle line:10%
sitting here today.

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:15.580 align:middle line:84%
He predicted that we would
have open, undeniable contact

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:17.150 align:middle line:90%
with extraterrestrials.

00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:19.220 align:middle line:90%
He knew that this was upon us.

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:20.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did he know.

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:22.227 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Well,
he was a clairvoyant.

00:30:22.227 --> 00:30:24.622 align:middle line:84%
He was phenomenal, what he
could access, the information.

00:30:24.622 --> 00:30:26.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he did
it in a trance state.

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:28.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: And
he-- yes, exactly.

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:30.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Based on
your experiences,

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:32.080 align:middle line:90%
where do we go from here?

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:33.045 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:30:33.045 --> 00:30:34.180 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Hmm.

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:36.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are
several things that

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.410 align:middle line:84%
would be great if
people would be aware

00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:42.610 align:middle line:84%
of because all transformation
that will align us

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:46.600 align:middle line:84%
with the timeline so that we
can meet our benevolent star

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:50.300 align:middle line:84%
brothers and sisters, we
can have open contact.

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:52.630 align:middle line:90%
It really is incumbent on us.

00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:54.770 align:middle line:90%
And it's not a powerless thing.

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:56.930 align:middle line:84%
We're actually
greatly empowered.

00:30:56.930 --> 00:30:59.770 align:middle line:84%
One of the things we
can do is live in ayni.

00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:01.390 align:middle line:90%
Ayni is a catchall word.

00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And specifically, it means
to be in right relationship

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:08.300 align:middle line:84%
or for you today,
for me tomorrow.

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:11.290 align:middle line:84%
So when we live in ayni,
in right relationship

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:13.510 align:middle line:84%
with all things
and all situations,

00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:16.420 align:middle line:84%
all people, then
we create Munay.

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And more than saving,
this planet needs loving.

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:23.500 align:middle line:84%
More than saving, our
people need loving.

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:26.210 align:middle line:90%
So love-- great equalizer.

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:29.380 align:middle line:84%
Or one can ask in
any situation that

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:33.680 align:middle line:84%
may feel a little difficult,
what would love do here?

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:35.120 align:middle line:90%
Make that choice.

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:37.810 align:middle line:84%
People can also align
with shamanic practices,

00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:39.050 align:middle line:90%
work with somebody.

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:42.070 align:middle line:84%
I do group experiences,
private experiences,

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:43.970 align:middle line:90%
and they are life changing.

00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And they're-- I used to work
with this beautiful shaman

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:50.230 align:middle line:90%
in my town, this Peruvian woman.

00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And she would always say to me,
Debbi, these seem so simple,

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:56.750 align:middle line:90%
but the result is so profound.

00:31:56.750 --> 00:32:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And I found that over the course
of working with her for seven

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:04.370 align:middle line:84%
months, my life was changing
drastically, perfectly.

00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And so people can
start to get involved

00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:08.900 align:middle line:90%
with situations like that.

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:11.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How can people become
more shamanic in their approach

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:13.820 align:middle line:90%
to life?

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:15.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: To
understand, we are

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:20.070 align:middle line:84%
part of the interconnectedness
of all of life.

00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:23.430 align:middle line:84%
That includes our star
brothers and sisters.

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:26.440 align:middle line:84%
So when they finally
come to see us,

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:29.818 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be those who
look the most like us first,

00:32:29.818 --> 00:32:31.610 align:middle line:84%
and we have the most
genetic material with.

00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:33.652 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, we believe
they have come to see us.

00:32:33.652 --> 00:32:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Right, in
an open, undeniable way.

00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:38.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You mean, publicly?

00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:40.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Yes, publicly.

00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:43.900 align:middle line:84%
It will probably be the
Pleiadians first and then maybe

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:45.820 align:middle line:90%
the hybrids, like the Yahyel.

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And after that,
possibly the Sassani.

00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:53.200 align:middle line:84%
And so to understand these
are our brothers and sisters

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:56.050 align:middle line:84%
and family, I think
also to prepare

00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:58.150 align:middle line:84%
to understand that a
transformation needs

00:32:58.150 --> 00:32:59.060 align:middle line:90%
to take place.

00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Part of the Pachacuti is
moving from the masculine

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:03.190 align:middle line:90%
to the feminine.

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:06.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think everyone can
agree the divine feminine is

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:07.720 align:middle line:90%
on the rise.

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:10.460 align:middle line:84%
The divine feminine
is needed right now.

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And so when that balance starts
to occur and we go from our head

00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:17.680 align:middle line:84%
to our heart, often the
longest walk for most people,

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:20.170 align:middle line:84%
this is where the healing
is going to take place,

00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:21.440 align:middle line:90%
is from the heart.

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:25.030 align:middle line:84%
This is also where
extraterrestrials look for.

00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:28.250 align:middle line:84%
People can use this in
contact work, come from love,

00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:30.530 align:middle line:84%
come from heart,
and they'll probably

00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:34.070 align:middle line:84%
see that the contact
even increases.

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:37.202 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
connect with them--

00:33:37.202 --> 00:33:38.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: You know--

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:39.743 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --without
the plant medicine?

00:33:39.743 --> 00:33:42.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Oh,
yeah, absolutely.

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:44.880 align:middle line:90%
So for me, two different ways.

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:48.000 align:middle line:84%
The first way, I'm very
fortunate in the work

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.590 align:middle line:90%
I do as a podcaster.

00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:53.405 align:middle line:84%
I get to interview people who
channel extraterrestrials.

00:33:53.405 --> 00:33:55.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how
often do you podcast?

00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:57.922 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: I podcast
once and twice a week.

00:33:57.922 --> 00:33:59.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: OK, that's
pretty intense.

00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:01.255 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: I've been
doing it for 17 years.

00:34:01.255 --> 00:34:02.172 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:34:02.172 --> 00:34:03.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: It is my great joy.

00:34:03.610 --> 00:34:05.280 align:middle line:90%
It is a master class.

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And I've got a very curious
mind, so it really works for me.

00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:12.719 align:middle line:84%
And when I interview
these people who channel

00:34:12.719 --> 00:34:16.469 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials, George,
I have found over the years,

00:34:16.469 --> 00:34:19.739 align:middle line:84%
because many of them come
back to the show a lot,

00:34:19.739 --> 00:34:21.989 align:middle line:84%
I've developed a
relationship, certainly

00:34:21.989 --> 00:34:23.370 align:middle line:90%
with the people who are there.

00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:23.969 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course, yeah.

00:34:23.969 --> 00:34:26.261 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: But then with
the extraterrestrial beings,

00:34:26.261 --> 00:34:30.780 align:middle line:84%
I have profound friendships and
great love for these beings who

00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:33.750 align:middle line:84%
come through and I feel
like have ushered me

00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:37.400 align:middle line:84%
into this experience
and conversation.

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:40.780 align:middle line:84%
And more recently,
I've had dreams

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:44.350 align:middle line:84%
where I've been visited
by extraterrestrials.

00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:45.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do they want?

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:48.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: You know,
they have really been there

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:50.739 align:middle line:90%
to heal me and love me.

00:34:50.739 --> 00:34:54.190 align:middle line:84%
I had one dream
where I was sitting

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:57.290 align:middle line:84%
and I was surrounded
by these light beings.

00:34:57.290 --> 00:35:03.580 align:middle line:84%
They felt a bit hooded and they
were incredibly benevolent,

00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:06.040 align:middle line:90%
incredibly aware of me.

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of those
dreams, like a flying dream

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:11.870 align:middle line:90%
that I woke up from.

00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I want to
have that again and again,

00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:16.460 align:middle line:90%
that deep connection.

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:19.510 align:middle line:84%
They may have been my star
family or one of the many

00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:20.710 align:middle line:90%
that I have.

00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:24.080 align:middle line:84%
But I've had several of them
where I've been visited.

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.925 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Flying dreams
are fun, aren't they?

00:35:25.925 --> 00:35:28.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Oh, I had them so
much as a kid, and I loved them.

00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:30.730 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you an
interesting story.

00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:34.390 align:middle line:84%
This beautiful
woman from Amsterdam

00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:37.450 align:middle line:90%
who channels one of the Yayhel.

00:35:37.450 --> 00:35:39.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
are the Yahyels?

00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:39.640 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Yes.

00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:40.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are they?

00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:43.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Yahyels
are hybrid beings.

00:35:43.450 --> 00:35:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And they are part
human and part--

00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:47.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: From a
dimension or planet?

00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:49.017 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Where
are the Yahyels from?

00:35:49.017 --> 00:35:50.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm not really sure
what their planet is.

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:51.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Physical though?

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:52.300 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Yes.

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:52.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:54.165 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER:
Definitely physical.

00:35:54.165 --> 00:35:55.610 align:middle line:90%
Very beautiful creatures.

00:35:55.610 --> 00:35:58.493 align:middle line:84%
Very, very beautiful
men and women.

00:35:58.493 --> 00:35:59.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They look like you.

00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:00.650 align:middle line:90%
They look like us.

00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:01.130 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Thank you.

00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:01.790 align:middle line:90%
They do.

00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:03.290 align:middle line:84%
They have a lot of
features like us.

00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:05.200 align:middle line:84%
Maybe their eyes
are a little bigger

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:07.550 align:middle line:84%
and their nose are
just a little tinier,

00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:09.777 align:middle line:84%
but they're a very
attractive race.

00:36:09.777 --> 00:36:11.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Definitely
don't look like me then.

00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:12.410 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Yeah.

00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:15.110 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] And they're
so phenomenal, George.

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:18.560 align:middle line:84%
I was in conversation
with this being

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:20.630 align:middle line:90%
and asking all these questions.

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And probably much like you when
you're talking to somebody,

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:27.080 align:middle line:84%
I had this feeling,
like, this wonderment.

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And I asked this being,
are your people aware

00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:34.390 align:middle line:84%
that you are having a
conversation with me?

00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:36.433 align:middle line:84%
Do you go back and
report and tell them--

00:36:36.433 --> 00:36:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it
sanctioned or what?

00:36:37.850 --> 00:36:38.650 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Right.

00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:40.160 align:middle line:90%
Or do you report to somebody?

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.560 align:middle line:90%
I was really curious.

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And the woman who was channeling
looked over her shoulder

00:36:45.310 --> 00:36:47.890 align:middle line:84%
while she was channeling
and came back to me

00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:51.040 align:middle line:84%
and said, oh, yes,
they're aware of you.

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:54.310 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there's
an entire stadium--

00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:57.670 align:middle line:84%
in Earth terms, you might
call that a football stadium--

00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:59.090 align:middle line:90%
of the Yahyels.

00:36:59.090 --> 00:37:02.050 align:middle line:84%
They're engaged in
this conversation

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:06.230 align:middle line:84%
and cheering right now,
sending their hellos.

00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:12.878 align:middle line:84%
It was so emotional for me to
even think that they knew of me.

00:37:12.878 --> 00:37:14.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're on your side--

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:15.545 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: And
what I was doing

00:37:15.545 --> 00:37:18.260 align:middle line:84%
and that they were
promoting this benevolence.

00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And another time when I was in
a conversation with Daryl Anka,

00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:24.705 align:middle line:84%
I was asking him
something similar.

00:37:24.705 --> 00:37:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And as you know,
Daryl doesn't channel

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:29.020 align:middle line:90%
while he's being interviewed.

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And Daryl has been on my
show many, many times.

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:32.240 align:middle line:90%
And Daryl--

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:34.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Related to the
singer Paul Anka, by the way.

00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Yes, he is.

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:36.707 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're cousins.

00:37:36.707 --> 00:37:38.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Isn't that amazing?

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:38.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:39.980 align:middle line:90%
We've got a tape of Daryl--

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:40.780 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: OK.

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:42.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --talking about
how he channels Bashar.

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:44.000 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Beautiful.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.100 align:middle line:84%
When last I got
together with you,

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:48.770 align:middle line:84%
we had this conversation
about when will

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:52.020 align:middle line:90%
first undeniable contact occur?

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:54.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's been four or
five months since I

00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:55.530 align:middle line:90%
spoke to you about that.

00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And I know a lot is changing
rapidly in the Earth.

00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:01.320 align:middle line:90%
What is the latest on that?

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:04.880 align:middle line:84%
What are-- are there new
predictions or senses

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:06.510 align:middle line:90%
about when that will happen?

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:08.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DARYL ANKA: No,
there's still the idea

00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:12.920 align:middle line:84%
that the general window of
contact is sometime between now

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:21.350 align:middle line:84%
and maybe 2033 or 2040, although
relatively recently, Bashar did

00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:24.860 align:middle line:84%
say that there
may be an over 90%

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:28.760 align:middle line:84%
probability of some
kind of major UFO event

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:33.110 align:middle line:84%
at the end of 2026 or
the beginning of '27 that

00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:37.760 align:middle line:84%
would be strong enough to start
changing our understanding

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:39.450 align:middle line:90%
that they exist.

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:42.320 align:middle line:84%
So he's not really
forthcoming yet

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:46.040 align:middle line:84%
about why that happens, how
it happens, where it happens,

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:49.320 align:middle line:84%
exactly what it is
that's going to happen.

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:51.710 align:middle line:84%
But he's basically
saying something about

00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:55.280 align:middle line:84%
that event will allow us
to know we're not alone.

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:57.650 align:middle line:84%
This is the beginning
of a new cycle

00:38:57.650 --> 00:39:03.020 align:middle line:84%
that he's now going to focus
on the idea of preparing us

00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:05.810 align:middle line:84%
for contact in a
variety of new ways

00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:08.450 align:middle line:84%
that he is called the
interstellar alliance

00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:10.680 align:middle line:90%
social experiment.

00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:15.290 align:middle line:84%
This is the year of contact
or it is the countdown

00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:17.520 align:middle line:90%
to contact year one.

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:20.270 align:middle line:84%
So there's going to
be a series of things

00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:23.060 align:middle line:84%
he's going to start delivering
to people that are very

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:26.510 align:middle line:84%
different than what he's done
before that actually, I believe,

00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:31.190 align:middle line:84%
if I understand his concept,
will call upon us to start

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:34.970 align:middle line:84%
taking certain actions,
physical actions in our lives

00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:38.930 align:middle line:84%
that would allow us to be
more vibrationally aligned

00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:42.080 align:middle line:84%
with becoming a member of
the interstellar alliance

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:43.440 align:middle line:90%
that he belongs to.

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:46.890 align:middle line:84%
So he has said this is
going to be very different.

00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:49.070 align:middle line:84%
He has said, not
everyone necessarily

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:52.280 align:middle line:84%
needs to do it if they don't
want to because, I guess,

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:55.580 align:middle line:84%
the suggestions
he's going to make

00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:57.680 align:middle line:84%
might be challenging
for some people

00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:04.640 align:middle line:84%
because they might not, let's
say, be typical in our society.

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:07.790 align:middle line:84%
He's not talking about breaking
any laws or anything like that,

00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:10.040 align:middle line:84%
but he's talking
about taking actions

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:12.860 align:middle line:84%
that may allow people
to really start

00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:16.760 align:middle line:84%
acting a little differently
and being engaged with society

00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:18.920 align:middle line:90%
in a very different way.

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:20.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's an
interesting guy, isn't he?

00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:22.190 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: I love him, yeah.

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:23.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
of what he just said?

00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:25.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: I think
it is so exciting.

00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:27.710 align:middle line:90%
I think it is phenomenal.

00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that Daryl said--

00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:33.900 align:middle line:84%
not this actually
conversation, but one prior--

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:39.530 align:middle line:84%
he was expressing that what he
does with me and you and what

00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:42.740 align:middle line:84%
these other people who channel,
especially extraterrestrials,

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:46.050 align:middle line:84%
do, this is considered
first wave contact.

00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:48.350 align:middle line:84%
So through people like you,
through people like me,

00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:50.930 align:middle line:84%
through our platforms,
we are getting--

00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:52.790 align:middle line:84%
we are allowing the
extraterrestrials

00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:55.800 align:middle line:84%
to have a voice out there
to start to be known.

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.630 align:middle line:90%
And so that is the first step.

00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:59.600 align:middle line:84%
Of course, then Daryl
and other people

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:02.450 align:middle line:84%
who do this amazing
channeling in front of groups,

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:03.990 align:middle line:90%
that's another venue.

00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And then, yes, what
he said, this incident

00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:11.430 align:middle line:84%
coming up 2026, 2027, I
want to be alive for this.

00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:15.210 align:middle line:84%
I want to be around for
open, undeniable contact.

00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:17.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready to connect with them.

00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:19.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm ready to be
ushered in and stop

00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:21.830 align:middle line:84%
being the new kids
on the block and have

00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:24.650 align:middle line:84%
all that advanced
information and exchange

00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:28.255 align:middle line:84%
relationship and wisdom and
technology for the good.

00:41:28.255 --> 00:41:29.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sounds like.

00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:31.762 align:middle line:90%
Darryl does it "my way," right?

00:41:31.762 --> 00:41:32.720 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: [CHUCKLES]

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:34.678 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's what his
cousin wrote that song

00:41:34.678 --> 00:41:35.990 align:middle line:90%
for Frank Sinatra, right?

00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:36.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Yes.

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:43.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has science looked at a
connection between ETs, humans?

00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:46.665 align:middle line:84%
And is there a strange DNA
pattern or anything like that?

00:41:46.665 --> 00:41:47.540 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: Perfect.

00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:50.940 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we covered some of
that with the Anunnaki.

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And then going further,
yes, Francis Crick,

00:41:54.950 --> 00:42:00.410 align:middle line:84%
who discovered DNA and also
won a Nobel Prize for his work,

00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:05.240 align:middle line:84%
was looking at DNA and said,
because of Earth's evolution,

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:09.460 align:middle line:84%
it's impossible for this DNA
to be strictly from humanity--

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:10.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From-- earthbound.

00:42:10.610 --> 00:42:11.735 align:middle line:90%
>>DACHINGER: That is right.

00:42:11.735 --> 00:42:16.220 align:middle line:84%
That it was clearly showed
complex interference

00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:20.970 align:middle line:84%
from other cosmos
and cosmos relations.

00:42:20.970 --> 00:42:26.690 align:middle line:84%
And also, they've often called
this a grand experiment here

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:30.780 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, what has created
Homo sapiens, originally

00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:33.120 align:middle line:84%
the Anunnaki, and then
the other benevolent

00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:37.450 align:middle line:84%
races that came in to donate
their genetic material to us.

00:42:37.450 --> 00:42:39.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You think ETs
will listen to this show,

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:41.280 align:middle line:84%
will watch this
program when it's

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:45.070 align:middle line:84%
beamed out into the
atmosphere and go right on,

00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:46.620 align:middle line:90%
Debbi, right on?

00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:48.820 align:middle line:10%
>>DACHINGER: From your
mouth to God's ears,

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:52.500 align:middle line:10%
I would love nothing more
than that, if they knew,

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:54.870 align:middle line:10%
if they blessed us
for doing this work,

00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:57.360 align:middle line:10%
if they thanked all
those watching us,

00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:02.370 align:middle line:10%
and if they really created the
best possible experience when

00:43:02.370 --> 00:43:05.700 align:middle line:10%
they do connect with
us openly, undeniably

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:09.330 align:middle line:10%
so that we can encourage
more and more benevolent

00:43:09.330 --> 00:43:11.730 align:middle line:10%
connection with
extraterrestrials.

00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:14.080 align:middle line:90%
I, for one, am ready for it.

00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:15.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's
your next project?

00:43:15.730 --> 00:43:17.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Mm,
the next project,

00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:19.810 align:middle line:84%
well, I'm speaking
in Glastonbury.

00:43:19.810 --> 00:43:22.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm speaking on a
spiritual cruise.

00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:25.650 align:middle line:84%
I am offering these
shamanic group experiences

00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:27.720 align:middle line:90%
all around the world on Zoom.

00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And I'm continuing my studies
as well as my podcast.

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:34.000 align:middle line:90%
Happiest places I can be.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
get a hold of you, Debbi?

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.210 align:middle line:10%
>>DACHINGER: My website is
great, debbidachinger.com.

00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:42.670 align:middle line:10%
And you can find me on all
social media, same platforms.

00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:43.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great.

00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:44.970 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for being

00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:46.845 align:middle line:84%
>>DACHINGER: Thank you
so much for having me.

00:43:46.845 --> 00:43:48.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isn't it
amazing to have someone

00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:51.270 align:middle line:84%
with shamanic influence
that Debbi has,

00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:53.650 align:middle line:84%
being able to do
things for humanity?

00:43:53.650 --> 00:43:57.330 align:middle line:84%
We need, like, a million of
them, like you running around.

00:43:57.330 --> 00:43:58.940 align:middle line:90%
What a planet we would have.

00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:00.990 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
