>>GEORGE NOORY: Well, welcome
to another spectacular edition

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.030 align:middle line:10%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.940 align:middle line:10%
Ismael Perez is a galactic
historian and author

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.970 align:middle line:10%
of "Our Cosmic Origin" and
"The Secret Government--

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.930 align:middle line:10%
Invisible Architects," with
a unique ability to access

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.830 align:middle line:10%
and interpret advanced
extraterrestrial knowledge that

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:43.430 align:middle line:10%
he aims to bridge the gap
between humanity and the cosmos.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.230 align:middle line:90%
Ismael, welcome to the program.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ISMAEL PEREZ:
Thank you, George.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.802 align:middle line:84%
It's a great honor and
pleasure to be here.

00:00:47.802 --> 00:00:49.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have a
very intense background.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.160 align:middle line:90%
How did this all happen for you?

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.510 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: You know, it all
started back in the day,

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.370 align:middle line:90%
when I was a kid, my belief--

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.430 align:middle line:84%
my mother told me
that I was part

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.879 align:middle line:84%
of some sort of
extraterrestrial hybrid program.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.880 align:middle line:10%
And so I was embedded
with, you could say,

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.510 align:middle line:10%
advanced genetics
from ETs that allowed

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.060 align:middle line:10%
me to think outside the box
and tap into information

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.420 align:middle line:10%
beyond this realm.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.020 align:middle line:10%
So it started as a kid.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.370 align:middle line:10%
And due to my
religious upbringing,

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.433 align:middle line:10%
unfortunately, I had to
suppress these inner knowings

00:01:25.433 --> 00:01:27.100 align:middle line:10%
and these abilities
for many, many years

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.910 align:middle line:10%
until, at the age of 21,
when I started practicing

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.600 align:middle line:10%
Kriya Kundalini yoga.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of
that, all of my memories

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.110 align:middle line:84%
came back and my inner
knowing of things.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ismael, was
your mother, your mother?

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.320 align:middle line:90%
>>PEREZ: I believe so, yes.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.490 align:middle line:84%
I believe she was a
surrogate, where--

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.370 align:middle line:84%
and this is-- many
women have claimed

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.460 align:middle line:84%
that their eggs have been taken
by extraterrestrials to create

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.630 align:middle line:90%
hybrids.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.410 align:middle line:84%
I believe my mother
was a surrogate.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And as far as my
father is concerned,

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.230 align:middle line:84%
he was one of the
good guys, because you

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.370 align:middle line:84%
have negative and positive
extraterrestrials.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.760 align:middle line:84%
You wrote a book called
"Our Cosmic Origin."

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.280 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.080 align:middle line:90%
>>PEREZ: Oh, yes.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.240 align:middle line:84%
That is my contribution
to humanity.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.320 align:middle line:84%
It's an attempt to explain
Earth's grand place

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.430 align:middle line:90%
in the organized multiverse.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And also, it's an attempt to
restore galactic information--

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.170 align:middle line:84%
for instance, galactic
history, which

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.260 align:middle line:84%
is something that hasn't been
around for thousands of years.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And so that book,
to me, is what I

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.970 align:middle line:84%
would consider the next
level of cosmic disclosure.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you hear
the word "universe,"

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.220 align:middle line:90%
what does that mean to you?

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.090 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: To me, a
universe is like a cell,

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.020 align:middle line:90%
which means there's multiple.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.430 align:middle line:90%
And so that's what it means.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:53.020 align:middle line:84%
It means just one fragment,
one corpuscle, or one cell

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.800 align:middle line:84%
or membrane of
something greater.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.070 align:middle line:90%
That's what it means to me.

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you believe
in the multiverse theory?

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.440 align:middle line:90%
>>PEREZ: Absolutely, George.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.090 align:middle line:84%
There is so much
ample evidence coming

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.210 align:middle line:84%
from not only ancient
sources, but also coming

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.620 align:middle line:84%
from cutting-edge science
such as quantum physics,

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.290 align:middle line:84%
superstring theory, and M-theory
that we indeed exist or live

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.440 align:middle line:84%
in multiple universes or that
there are multiple universes.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.015 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we're
only aware of one.

00:03:19.015 --> 00:03:20.098 align:middle line:90%
So yes, I do believe that.

00:03:20.098 --> 00:03:21.765 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's hard
to believe that there

00:03:21.765 --> 00:03:24.260 align:middle line:84%
are many and multiple ones
out there, though, isn't it?

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.070 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: It's very hard
when a lot of the evidence

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.880 align:middle line:84%
is currently being suppressed
by the controlled academia.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.040 align:middle line:84%
They want to keep us locked into
this one world, one dimension,

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.600 align:middle line:90%
and one reality sphere.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are the universes the
same, or are they all different?

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.630 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: From what I
understand is each universe

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.720 align:middle line:84%
varies, slightly different
than every other universe.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.940 align:middle line:84%
Each universe has
its own parameters,

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.130 align:middle line:90%
its own laws of physics.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And quite frankly, each universe
has its own energetic signature,

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.120 align:middle line:84%
just like every
human being does.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.338 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
you call our universe?

00:04:00.338 --> 00:04:02.380 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: I would call our
universe the potpourri,

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.460 align:middle line:84%
an amalgamation of all the
different universes out there

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.180 align:middle line:90%
put into one--

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.490 align:middle line:84%
put into one universe,
the great mixture.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who made the universes?

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.610 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: Well, it is believed
that every universe that exists

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:20.850 align:middle line:84%
is being born from
an already existing,

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.150 align:middle line:84%
you could say, realm that
many call the Motherverse.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And the Motherverse
is exactly what

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.410 align:middle line:84%
the esoteric and secret
knowledge calls the realms

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.570 align:middle line:90%
of eternity, the unmanifest.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.810 align:middle line:84%
So the level of existence
known as universes

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.920 align:middle line:84%
is equivalent to what they call
the realm of the manifest, which

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.120 align:middle line:84%
are experiments
in time and space.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.460 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they
are finite, unlike,

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.110 align:middle line:84%
of course, the Motherverse
that is eternal.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you consider
us the original universe?

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.380 align:middle line:90%
>>PEREZ: Not by far.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:54.360 align:middle line:90%
Not even close.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:55.670 align:middle line:90%
>>PEREZ: Yeah.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.370 align:middle line:84%
The original universe
is, again, a reality

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.010 align:middle line:84%
that has always
existed, that has never

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.490 align:middle line:90%
had a beginning or end.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And so our universe
is finite, of course.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.850 align:middle line:84%
It has a beginning, and many
believe it will have an end.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.120 align:middle line:84%
However, there is
this thing called

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.070 align:middle line:84%
the ascension of universes, just
like how we have the opportunity

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.440 align:middle line:90%
to undergo ascension, just--

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.090 align:middle line:84%
and in like manner, planets have
that same opportunity, galaxies,

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.810 align:middle line:90%
and ultimately, universes.

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.920 align:middle line:84%
However, when a universe
does not reach completion,

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.620 align:middle line:90%
it reincarnates again.

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And they have to
do it over again

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.690 align:middle line:90%
until they reach completion.

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.880 align:middle line:84%
So every universe has
to go through that.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
makes the universes

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.330 align:middle line:84%
like the original universe
different from the other ones?

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.010 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: Well, the
original universe

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.670 align:middle line:84%
is what scientists would now
consider base reality, which

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.820 align:middle line:84%
is the only true reality,
pure consciousness or energy

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.270 align:middle line:84%
vibrating at its highest levels,
whereas the other universes,

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.720 align:middle line:84%
or the local universes,
are just expressions

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.720 align:middle line:84%
or fragments or fractals
and different variations,

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.780 align:middle line:84%
you could say, where everything
and anything is possible.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we get the
concept of the multiverse, where

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.680 align:middle line:84%
everything is happening
all at the same time

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.150 align:middle line:90%
and simultaneously.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Many of
us believe we are

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.730 align:middle line:84%
being inhabited by other
beings throughout the universe.

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:23.610 align:middle line:84%
We've been visited since
the beginning of time.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.780 align:middle line:84%
What are your
thoughts about that?

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.150 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: That is
actually correct.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:29.830 align:middle line:84%
But I also want
to add to the fact

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:35.780 align:middle line:84%
that this entire experiment
we call the greater Earth

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.640 align:middle line:84%
experiment has something that
has been in design for billions

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.360 align:middle line:84%
of years, even before the
conception of our own universe.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.190 align:middle line:84%
So everything was
already well planned.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind of beings
inhabit the original universe?

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:51.840 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: The
original universe is

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.920 align:middle line:90%
inhabited by the central race.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.610 align:middle line:84%
Some people call
them the celestials.

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:02.190 align:middle line:84%
These are intelligences
that are beyond our brain.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:05.030 align:middle line:84%
They are beyond any
concept of understanding.

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:06.740 align:middle line:90%
They have no physical form.

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.720 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, they can
be everywhere at once.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.890 align:middle line:84%
They do divide into
certain groupings

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:15.180 align:middle line:84%
where you could say some of them
are in charge of what happens

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.750 align:middle line:90%
in the timespace creations.

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:18.580 align:middle line:84%
Those are known
as the time lords.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And that explains why, when it
comes to the war taking place,

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.250 align:middle line:84%
as far as using time travel,
they call them the time horses.

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:29.810 align:middle line:84%
As far as that is
concerned, they

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:32.030 align:middle line:84%
have the upper hand because
they control everything

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:33.630 align:middle line:90%
from a higher level of reality.

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:35.960 align:middle line:84%
Another functionary
of the central race

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.080 align:middle line:84%
are what we called the
original eternal guardians.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.420 align:middle line:84%
There are many different
ways to describe them.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.510 align:middle line:84%
Some people call them
the Cosmic Rashis.

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:49.060 align:middle line:84%
These are entities that
have no beginning or end.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:50.630 align:middle line:84%
Again, they go
back to the concept

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:55.280 align:middle line:84%
of this primordial,
always-existing source that

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.730 align:middle line:90%
has no beginning or end.

00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:00.260 align:middle line:84%
So in the cosmic
community, ultimately they

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.700 align:middle line:90%
are referred to as the eternals.

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And I know some of
these concepts people

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:08.130 align:middle line:84%
would confuse with some
of the Marvel movies.

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:09.810 align:middle line:84%
But you have to
understand, George,

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:12.260 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of
these Marvel movies

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.640 align:middle line:84%
are a soft disclosure of
what's really happening.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
have specific roles?

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:20.160 align:middle line:90%
>>PEREZ: The central race--

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:24.670 align:middle line:84%
well, their main role is
to oversee the organization

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:25.970 align:middle line:90%
of the multiverse.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:27.740 align:middle line:90%
All they do is observe.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:30.980 align:middle line:84%
They don't really interfere
unless they had to.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.030 align:middle line:84%
But all they do is just
observe and monitor

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:37.100 align:middle line:90%
the evolving multiverses.

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.789 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they will
interject if they have to?

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:42.039 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: Only if
they had to, yes.

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:45.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are the
so-called seven superuniverses?

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.120 align:middle line:90%
>>PEREZ: That is the--

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.570 align:middle line:84%
the first-- you could
say the first division

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:54.980 align:middle line:84%
of the eternal universe, which
is one singular consciousness,

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:58.470 align:middle line:84%
divided into seven
distinct aspects of itself,

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:02.180 align:middle line:84%
each with its own color,
tone and vibration.

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:05.630 align:middle line:84%
So we are part of the seventh
sphere, which is known

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:07.260 align:middle line:90%
as the seventh superuniverse.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.230 align:middle line:84%
And that is where our local
universe is organized into.

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:11.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How are they connected?

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.230 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: Through energy,
just like everything else.

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:16.580 align:middle line:84%
Everything is
ultimately connected

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:19.940 align:middle line:84%
by this universal consciousness
that scientists now

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.540 align:middle line:90%
call the unified field.

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And that, my friend, is pretty
much the singular consciousness

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:31.000 align:middle line:84%
that animates and permeates all
of reality in the unmanifest

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.580 align:middle line:84%
and in the manifest,
both in eternity

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:36.740 align:middle line:84%
and in the finite worlds
of time and space.

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:39.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ismael, is there
like a Galactic Federation

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:43.810 align:middle line:84%
that oversees the
seven superuniverses?

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:45.880 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: No, the
Galactic Federation

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.940 align:middle line:84%
are actually
functional in what I

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:51.670 align:middle line:84%
call the second
harmonic universe, which

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:54.500 align:middle line:84%
is consisting of dimensions
four, five, and six.

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:59.170 align:middle line:84%
The level of existence regarding
the superuniverses, that

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:01.390 align:middle line:90%
is dimensions 10, 11 and 12.

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:07.450 align:middle line:84%
So what oversees their reality
is a higher order that exists

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:08.900 align:middle line:90%
beyond the Galactic Federation.

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.120 align:middle line:84%
This is known as
the Emerald Order.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
original could say,

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:17.230 align:middle line:84%
intergalactic treaty
that was signed

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:20.710 align:middle line:84%
by members of the central
race coming from the top down

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:23.770 align:middle line:84%
and members of the
superuniverse levels of reality.

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:27.800 align:middle line:84%
That was the initial order
that allowed certain galaxies

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.470 align:middle line:84%
and universes within
the timespace creation

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:33.590 align:middle line:84%
to eventually create
these federations that

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:37.490 align:middle line:84%
are different alliances of
advanced stellar civilizations.

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:41.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At what point
do they become physical,

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:43.130 align:middle line:90%
where you can actually see them?

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>>PEREZ: In the 11th dimension.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:45.590 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:46.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That many?

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:47.932 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: Yeah, in
the 11th dimension.

00:10:47.932 --> 00:10:49.470 align:middle line:84%
So once a cosmic
being, a celestial,

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:54.630 align:middle line:84%
descends from the top down
into the 11th dimension,

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:56.650 align:middle line:90%
they start becoming physical.

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:58.870 align:middle line:84%
But it's still a
very subtle matter.

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:00.540 align:middle line:84%
It's not physical
like me and you,

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.380 align:middle line:90%
where we use carbon-based DNA.

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:05.310 align:middle line:84%
They use what is known as
hydroplasma, pre-material

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:06.250 align:middle line:90%
genetics.

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:10.180 align:middle line:84%
But in a way, they still begin
to manifest physical form.

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:12.820 align:middle line:84%
To us, they would appear
as they are etheric.

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:14.550 align:middle line:84%
But in essence,
they are beginning

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:15.970 align:middle line:90%
to condense into physicality.

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:17.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's in the
11th dimension.

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And then, as they continue
descending in the descending

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.890 align:middle line:84%
process, which is what I
call the involution of spirit

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:25.080 align:middle line:84%
into matter in my
book, then they

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.840 align:middle line:84%
switch from pre-material
plasma genetics

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.420 align:middle line:84%
into crystalline
genetics, allowing

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:32.520 align:middle line:84%
them to become
even more physical,

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:33.868 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:11:33.868 --> 00:11:35.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did this
knowledge come to you, Ish?

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:37.827 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: That is a very
good question, George.

00:11:37.827 --> 00:11:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of this
information actually

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:42.700 align:middle line:90%
came during my deep meditations.

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:47.410 align:middle line:84%
Also, when my body sleeps at
night, my consciousness that

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:49.060 align:middle line:84%
animates this avatar,
which is only one

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:51.830 align:middle line:84%
portion of our entire
consciousness-- and by the way,

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:53.740 align:middle line:90%
everybody has different avatars.

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:56.260 align:middle line:84%
Our consciousness is
so vast that it's only

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.390 align:middle line:84%
a fraction of our
consciousness that

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:01.430 align:middle line:84%
is needed to animate this
physical, earthly avatar.

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:04.370 align:middle line:84%
So when I sleep, when
this avatar sleeps,

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:09.890 align:middle line:84%
I am able to reintegrate myself
with my higher galactic self.

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:12.430 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of
that, I'm able to access

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:14.930 align:middle line:84%
intergalactic records
and information.

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:17.470 align:middle line:84%
However, I also do
a lot of research

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:20.770 align:middle line:84%
to see if there's any
evidence, any validation to all

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:22.150 align:middle line:90%
this information.

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:25.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the multiverse
different from the seven

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.724 align:middle line:90%
superuniverses?

00:12:27.724 --> 00:12:28.550 align:middle line:90%
>>PEREZ: Um.

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:30.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or are they
all part of the same?

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:32.040 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: Well, each
seven superuniverse,

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.370 align:middle line:84%
which is, again, the
Motherverse breaking off

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:39.830 align:middle line:84%
into seven equal parts,
also extends and becomes

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:41.670 align:middle line:90%
fragmented furthermore.

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:47.190 align:middle line:84%
And so each superuniverse is
a conglomerate of multiverses.

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:50.170 align:middle line:84%
So we happen to be in the
seventh aspect of the mother

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:50.970 align:middle line:90%
universe.

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:52.920 align:middle line:84%
We exist within
the seventh sphere.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:58.200 align:middle line:84%
So within the seventh sphere,
we have approximately over 700

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.740 align:middle line:84%
million evolving local
universes, and that's--

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:02.045 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 700 million?

00:13:02.045 --> 00:13:04.220 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: Million, according
to galactic records.

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And these are universe that
are being very well organized,

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:11.570 align:middle line:84%
again, by these higher orders,
these higher councils that

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:16.280 align:middle line:84%
oversee the entire
development of multiverses.

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is amazing.

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:19.180 align:middle line:90%
>>PEREZ: It is, George.

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:19.980 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And this is information that
galactics and interstellar

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:29.460 align:middle line:84%
societies and, again, the cosmic
community is very well aware of.

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:32.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a difference
between the parallel realities

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.590 align:middle line:84%
and the alternate timelines
in these multiverses?

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:39.330 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: I believe that the
concept of multiple universes

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.980 align:middle line:84%
ties in very well with
alternative realities,

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:44.640 align:middle line:84%
alternative Earth
realities, which is, again,

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:50.040 align:middle line:84%
a concept that is coming back
into our consciousness through

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:53.890 align:middle line:84%
movies like "Spider-Man and
the Metaverse," of course,

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:56.560 align:middle line:84%
"Doctor Strange," and
so on and so forth.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.150 align:middle line:90%
But all that stuff is real.

00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:00.000 align:middle line:84%
There are different
versions of George

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.520 align:middle line:84%
that decided to
become an aero pilot

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:04.540 align:middle line:84%
or that decided
to have a family.

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:06.960 align:middle line:84%
There are versions of
Ismael that, instead

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.740 align:middle line:84%
of becoming a
galactic ambassador,

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:10.380 align:middle line:84%
I decided to become
a baseball player

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:12.580 align:middle line:84%
in a different
alternative timeline.

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:14.850 align:middle line:84%
So we have different
versions of ourselves

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:18.810 align:middle line:84%
where we pretty much
fit different roles.

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:22.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you exist in
these other multiverses

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:23.880 align:middle line:90%
at the same time?

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:24.780 align:middle line:90%
>>PEREZ: Absolutely.

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
happening right now.

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:28.720 align:middle line:84%
Through a phenomenon
known as superposition,

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:31.720 align:middle line:84%
which is a branch
of quantum physics,

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.470 align:middle line:84%
it is believed that all
the alternative Earth

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:37.990 align:middle line:84%
realities-- hence, the
multiverse-- is superimposed.

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:40.300 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they're all
happening at the same time.

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:42.810 align:middle line:90%
So it is believed that the way--

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:45.390 align:middle line:84%
again, the way the law
of attraction would work

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:48.870 align:middle line:84%
is you have to match that
reality that already exists

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:52.378 align:middle line:84%
in that alternative universe
in order to achieve whatever

00:14:52.378 --> 00:14:53.670 align:middle line:90%
it is that you want to achieve.

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:57.752 align:middle line:84%
You-- everything is already
existing, in other words.

00:14:57.752 --> 00:14:59.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, we're
not at the point yet,

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:02.330 align:middle line:84%
but how do the others
in the multiverse

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.563 align:middle line:84%
travel around throughout
the universes?

00:15:04.563 --> 00:15:05.730 align:middle line:90%
>>PEREZ: There are two ways.

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:10.010 align:middle line:84%
The most advanced way in which
advanced civilizations travel

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:12.185 align:middle line:90%
is through stargates.

00:15:12.185 --> 00:15:13.060 align:middle line:90%
So every number--

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:13.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like portals?

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: Like portals,
exactly, yeah.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:18.530 align:middle line:84%
So every planet
has a portal that

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:21.760 align:middle line:84%
accesses every other
planet, star system, galaxy

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.330 align:middle line:90%
within a universe.

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And every galaxy has a portal
that accesses other galaxies

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:27.770 align:middle line:90%
within a universe.

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:30.520 align:middle line:84%
And furthermore,
every universe also

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:33.100 align:middle line:84%
has a universal
stargate number that

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:36.670 align:middle line:84%
allows advanced cosmic what
I call type 4 civilizations

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:39.340 align:middle line:84%
to access other
universes and become

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:41.950 align:middle line:90%
part of a cosmic civilization.

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:45.128 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are the
12 major creations?

00:15:45.128 --> 00:15:46.670 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: That's a
very good question.

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:51.170 align:middle line:84%
So it turns out that
everything within our realm--

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:53.900 align:middle line:84%
so exists within the
pattern of the 12.

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:55.790 align:middle line:84%
So we're part of
the 12th creation--

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:59.560 align:middle line:84%
from what I've uncovered, is
that there has been 11 other

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.715 align:middle line:84%
major creations that
exist within the periphery

00:16:01.715 --> 00:16:04.090 align:middle line:84%
of the seventh sphere, or what
we call the superuniverse.

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:05.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Since the
beginning of time?

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:07.322 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: Since the
beginning of time, yeah.

00:16:07.322 --> 00:16:09.440 align:middle line:84%
If we want to go back to
the original creation,

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:13.180 align:middle line:84%
it was known as the universe
of unconditional love.

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.722 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we talking
14 billion years ago?

00:16:15.722 --> 00:16:17.180 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: No, we're
actually talking

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:20.130 align:middle line:90%
about 900 billion years ago.

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:22.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 900 billion years ago?

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:24.620 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: Yes, that's when
the first creation came

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:26.250 align:middle line:90%
into existence.

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:28.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we're just
infants then, aren't we?

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:32.030 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: Well, we're also part
of an intergalactic experiment,

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:34.470 align:middle line:84%
where our universe,
our 12th creation,

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:37.940 align:middle line:84%
is actually the end result,
the amalgamation of all 11

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:38.820 align:middle line:90%
creations.

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:42.290 align:middle line:84%
And that explains why everything
within our 12th creation is

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:44.970 align:middle line:84%
operating under the
significant value of the 12,

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:49.140 align:middle line:84%
like the 12 strands of DNA,
the 12 houses of the Zodiac,

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:51.972 align:middle line:84%
the 12 chakras and
so on and so forth.

00:16:51.972 --> 00:16:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you know
the beginning of time

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:56.662 align:middle line:90%
was 900 billion years old?

00:16:56.662 --> 00:16:59.120 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: That information is
not accessible through written

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.090 align:middle line:90%
records on this planet.

00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:03.290 align:middle line:84%
I actually had to dive
into accessing information

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:06.200 align:middle line:84%
from intergalactic
records that have access

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.530 align:middle line:84%
to the very first creation going
back to about 900 billion years

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:11.160 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a
long, long time.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.200 align:middle line:90%
>>PEREZ: It is.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:17.349 align:middle line:84%
I mean, compared to us, the
way we measure time, yes,

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:18.970 align:middle line:90%
it's really a long time.

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:22.109 align:middle line:84%
But as we evolve
or compare to what

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:25.920 align:middle line:84%
other advanced civilizations
measure time, which they exist

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.810 align:middle line:84%
beyond time, it's
actually just a few years,

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:30.060 align:middle line:90%
to be honest with you.

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:31.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These 12
major creations

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:35.500 align:middle line:84%
we've been talking about, tied
into the seven superuniverses,

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:36.880 align:middle line:90%
do they overlap?

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:40.150 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: The 12 creations exist
within each superuniverse.

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:43.420 align:middle line:84%
So technically, there's
a total of 56 creations,

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:44.440 align:middle line:90%
major creations.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.843 align:middle line:84%
Each superuniverse also
divides into 12 creations.

00:17:47.843 --> 00:17:49.635 align:middle line:84%
So there's a total of
seven superuniverses.

00:17:49.635 --> 00:17:50.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's 84.

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:51.210 align:middle line:90%
>>PEREZ: That's 84.

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:52.010 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:53.380 align:middle line:90%
My math is wrong.

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:54.360 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate that.

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.800 align:middle line:84%
So there's a total of
84 major creations.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And then, within
each creation, there

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:01.140 align:middle line:90%
is innumerable local universes.

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And again, each
universe is a membrane.

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:06.900 align:middle line:84%
It's like a cell within
the body of the cosmos.

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:08.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is there one god?

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:12.280 align:middle line:84%
Or is there a god for
every aspect of what we've

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.948 align:middle line:90%
been talking about tonight?

00:18:13.948 --> 00:18:15.490 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: Very good
question, and that

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:18.530 align:middle line:84%
is what I would consider
the million-dollar question.

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:23.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, ultimately, everything is
reducible to that one singular

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:25.600 align:middle line:84%
consciousness that
has always existed.

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.290 align:middle line:84%
Again, that comes from the
eternal realms or the mother

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:29.640 align:middle line:90%
universe, right?

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.765 align:middle line:84%
However, that mother
universe, through a process

00:18:31.765 --> 00:18:34.140 align:middle line:84%
of division, which is what I
call the original immaculate

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.850 align:middle line:84%
conception, it breaks off
into different fragments.

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And each fragment, according
to the holographic concept

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:42.860 align:middle line:84%
of reality, also
contains the whole.

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:45.160 align:middle line:84%
So there are different
functionaries.

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:48.060 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, ultimately all
the functionaries, including

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:51.000 align:middle line:84%
the overseers of each universe,
which are called the creator

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.220 align:middle line:84%
gods and goddesses, that
oversee each creation,

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:57.660 align:middle line:84%
ultimately answer to
the one eternal source

00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.780 align:middle line:90%
without beginning or end.

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:02.697 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This one source is
what we believe to be God?

00:19:02.697 --> 00:19:03.530 align:middle line:90%
>>PEREZ: Absolutely.

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, this is different
than the God from the Bible.

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:08.870 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the God from the
Bible was an extraterrestrial.

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:12.980 align:middle line:84%
This is the ultimate creator,
in which everything comes from,

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:14.410 align:middle line:90%
all the universes.

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:19.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many different
living beings are out there?

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:20.550 align:middle line:90%
>>PEREZ: An infinite number.

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:23.600 align:middle line:84%
There is no number to
detect or to pinpoint

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.860 align:middle line:90%
exactly how many species exist.

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:28.310 align:middle line:84%
But also, we have to consider
that some of these species

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:31.200 align:middle line:90%
are not physical like us.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:35.120 align:middle line:84%
They have evolved to a level
of non physicality, where

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:36.770 align:middle line:84%
they are beginning
to, once again,

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:41.930 align:middle line:84%
use what is known as hydroplasma
DNA, which is above crystalline.

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:43.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ismail,
are they all trying

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:47.290 align:middle line:84%
to get the same answers
that we're trying to get?

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:50.630 align:middle line:84%
Do they try to figure
out how we started,

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:53.702 align:middle line:84%
what's out there,
what the Big Bang is?

00:19:53.702 --> 00:19:55.910 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: No, that's just
something that we earthlings

00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:57.330 align:middle line:90%
are trying to figure out.

00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.850 align:middle line:84%
Civilizations of a
type 1, interplanetary,

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:03.180 align:middle line:84%
type 2, stellar and galactic,
they are beyond that.

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:06.440 align:middle line:84%
They already have answers to all
the questions that we are asking

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:09.300 align:middle line:84%
or all the, yeah, all the
questions that we have.

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:10.910 align:middle line:90%
They have answers to everything.

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:13.400 align:middle line:84%
They have already figured the
great theory of everything

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:17.120 align:middle line:84%
where they use mathematics to
explain everything, including

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.350 align:middle line:84%
validating the concept
of this one creator,

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:21.060 align:middle line:90%
which is prime creator source.

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:22.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they all
get along throughout

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:25.100 align:middle line:90%
this galactic universe?

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.650 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: Those that are
spiritually evolved, yes.

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:30.920 align:middle line:84%
So there is a distinction in the
cosmic and galactic community

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:35.300 align:middle line:84%
between races that separate
from the unity of the one

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:39.350 align:middle line:84%
prime creator, which is
God, to those that always

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:42.680 align:middle line:84%
stay in alignment and live
according to the one infinite

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:43.480 align:middle line:90%
creator.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:46.680 align:middle line:84%
So the beings that live
according to the one infinite

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:50.770 align:middle line:84%
creator are considered
the positive races.

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:52.870 align:middle line:84%
They're not out there
to subdue worlds.

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:55.090 align:middle line:84%
They're not out there
to conquer planets.

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:58.230 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they understand the
holographic concept of reality

00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:59.740 align:middle line:84%
and how everything
is integrated.

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:02.820 align:middle line:84%
So it is-- they're out there
to help everything evolve

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:05.560 align:middle line:84%
to the next stage so that they
could move on to the next stage.

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:09.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, on the other hand, we do
have entities that break away

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:12.420 align:middle line:84%
from the one infinite
creator and begin

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.220 align:middle line:84%
to take hands-- or things
into their own hands.

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And those are
mainly the ones that

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:21.450 align:middle line:84%
are out there conquering
planets, trying

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:23.820 align:middle line:84%
to influence underdeveloped
civilizations

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:26.610 align:middle line:84%
or primitive races,
whether it's to slave them

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:28.240 align:middle line:84%
or to just steal
their resources.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.550 align:middle line:84%
So they both exist out
there in the cosmos.

00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:32.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But we have
had galactic wars--

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:33.180 align:middle line:90%
>>PEREZ: It's true.

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:37.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --between, for example,
in the area of Libra and Orion,

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:38.532 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:21:38.532 --> 00:21:39.550 align:middle line:90%
>>PEREZ: And here too.

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:40.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened?

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:42.068 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: Well,
again, it boils down

00:21:42.068 --> 00:21:45.180 align:middle line:84%
to the races that remain loyal
to the one, which are known

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:46.660 align:middle line:90%
as the children of the one.

00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And initially, these
were known as the Lyrans.

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:51.480 align:middle line:84%
The Lyrans are
actually our ancestors.

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:56.520 align:middle line:84%
So all human galactic
civilizations stem from Lyra.

00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And the other ones are called
the Draconians, the reptilians.

00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:04.020 align:middle line:84%
Those are the ones that,
again, disconnected from God

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:06.130 align:middle line:84%
when they were all part
of the celestial realm.

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And that explains
why they inherited

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:11.805 align:middle line:84%
their grosque, brutal, physical,
beastly looking reptilian body.

00:22:11.805 --> 00:22:12.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:16.470 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: And so what
led to the initial war

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:21.930 align:middle line:84%
in our galaxy 500 million years
ago was that the Draconians were

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:25.050 align:middle line:84%
actually after resources
and they were also

00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:28.980 align:middle line:84%
trying to implement a galactic
and universal empire, where

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:31.260 align:middle line:84%
they wanted to seek
absolute dominion

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:32.740 align:middle line:90%
over our local universe.

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:35.680 align:middle line:84%
But the Lyrans stopped
them, of course.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:38.290 align:middle line:10%
The Lyrans were-- they
were under the impression

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:40.290 align:middle line:10%
and under the belief that
everything in creation

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:40.800 align:middle line:10%
is sacred.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.420 align:middle line:10%
And therefore, everything
is interconnected,

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:44.590 align:middle line:10%
and everything should be
honored and respected.

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:47.940 align:middle line:10%
And they strived for
universal cooperation

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:50.010 align:middle line:10%
with other species, which
is the opposite of what

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:51.490 align:middle line:10%
the Draconians were doing.

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And so those two
different philosophies

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:57.790 align:middle line:90%
is what led to the wars of Lyra.

00:22:57.790 --> 00:22:59.950 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately for the
Lyrans, my friend,

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:03.040 align:middle line:84%
who were very spiritually
advanced, had no concept of war,

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:06.760 align:middle line:84%
had not developed weapons of any
kind, from what I understand,

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:09.397 align:middle line:84%
is their planet
Avion was destroyed

00:23:09.397 --> 00:23:11.230 align:middle line:84%
in this war, among other
planets, of course,

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:12.520 align:middle line:90%
in the Lyra system.

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's what led
to the star wars,

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:19.200 align:middle line:84%
the real star wars that took
place in our galaxy millions

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:23.250 align:middle line:84%
of years ago between the
expanding Orions Empire, led

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:26.610 align:middle line:84%
by the reptilian
Draconians, and the refugees

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:30.610 align:middle line:84%
of Lyra, who later, of course,
sought refuge in other systems.

00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And that explains the
gradual dispersion

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:36.510 align:middle line:84%
of the galactic
humans from Lyra that

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:40.540 align:middle line:84%
ended up colonizing the
Pleiades, Alpha Centauri,

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:45.340 align:middle line:84%
the Hadar System, Cassiopeia,
Tau Ceti, Arcturus, Andromeda,

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:46.270 align:middle line:90%
just to name a few.

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:50.400 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was over 250,000
star systems where the Lyran

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:51.750 align:middle line:90%
and sought refuge.

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:53.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
different factions

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:54.992 align:middle line:90%
were involved in these wars?

00:23:54.992 --> 00:23:56.200 align:middle line:90%
>>PEREZ: It was two factions.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:59.800 align:middle line:84%
It was the galactic humans,
the Lyrans, the original Lyrans

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:04.590 align:middle line:84%
and then, later, of course, with
the refugees that sought escape

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:06.640 align:middle line:90%
from the war, the initial war.

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:10.110 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, they joined
together to create the Galactic

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:11.220 align:middle line:90%
Federation.

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:13.510 align:middle line:84%
So ultimately, there
was two factions.

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:16.270 align:middle line:84%
It was just the expanding
Orion Empire, which

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:20.360 align:middle line:84%
was led by the Draconians,
and the galactic humans.

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:24.100 align:middle line:84%
And that also included other
specimens like the Cetaceans.

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:27.250 align:middle line:84%
That also included many
different types of bird people

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:31.910 align:middle line:84%
and feline and other types of
non-human biological entities,

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:35.170 align:middle line:84%
which, of course,
comprised and organized

00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:38.012 align:middle line:84%
what we know as the Galactic
Federation of Worlds.

00:24:38.012 --> 00:24:39.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was
their motivation?

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:41.800 align:middle line:84%
What did they want
with these battles?

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.750 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: Well, like I
said, the Draconians

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:45.920 align:middle line:84%
just wanted galactic
and universal dominance.

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.490 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to
ultimately, ultimately

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:52.330 align:middle line:84%
establish a totalitarian
system of absolute dominance

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:54.130 align:middle line:90%
throughout the entire universe.

00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:58.120 align:middle line:84%
And the Lyrans and
the guys that were

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:01.430 align:middle line:84%
on the other side, the
Galactic Federation of Worlds,

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:04.000 align:middle line:84%
as they later became
known as, they

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.330 align:middle line:90%
wanted the opposite of that.

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:11.800 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to preserve and
maintain justice and cooperation

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:14.420 align:middle line:84%
throughout the multi-- or
the universe, I'm sorry.

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:16.312 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We are
a warring planet.

00:25:16.312 --> 00:25:17.270 align:middle line:90%
>>PEREZ: Unfortunately.

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:19.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's no
question about that.

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:22.880 align:middle line:90%
Has that been handed down to us?

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:27.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is it something
that we couldn't avoid?

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:29.940 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: Yeah, because
ultimately, this galactic war,

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:31.750 align:middle line:84%
it's been going on
for millions of years,

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:35.130 align:middle line:84%
not just in our own galaxy,
George, but in other galaxies,

00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:38.740 align:middle line:84%
has been reduced down to what's
happening here on our planet.

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:41.880 align:middle line:84%
So we could say that those
that have been running

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:45.690 align:middle line:84%
the show for the last
few thousand years are,

00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:49.590 align:middle line:84%
you could say, they're some
sort of reptilian-human hybrids

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:52.510 align:middle line:84%
that have been ruling this
planet from behind the scenes.

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we also have the
guardians and the Federation

00:25:56.220 --> 00:26:01.620 align:middle line:84%
of Worlds that also came to
this planet to counteract that

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:05.730 align:middle line:84%
and to also allow us to
come to the finality, which

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:08.460 align:middle line:84%
is what we're living in now,
the greatest dispensation

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:10.710 align:middle line:84%
ever, where we're going
to actually witness

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:14.350 align:middle line:84%
this last war between good
and evil on this planet.

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:17.205 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you say this
last war, what does that mean?

00:26:17.205 --> 00:26:19.830 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: What that means is that
what happens here on the Earth

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:21.990 align:middle line:84%
will ultimately have
an effect everywhere

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:23.950 align:middle line:84%
in the universe and,
ultimately, the multiverse

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:26.070 align:middle line:84%
because like I said
earlier, our universe

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:29.770 align:middle line:84%
is the potpourri of the
superuniverse of Orvonton, which

00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:32.770 align:middle line:84%
consists of over 700
million local universes.

00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:36.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many beings
die in these wars?

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:38.010 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: Now, I don't
have the exact number.

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:40.140 align:middle line:84%
But what I do know, according
to galactic records,

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:45.710 align:middle line:84%
is that these Draconian
reptilians had implemented

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:48.920 align:middle line:84%
advanced technologies very
similar to the Death Star

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:52.560 align:middle line:84%
in the movie "Star Wars,"
where they used a planet-sized

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:53.910 align:middle line:90%
technology to--

00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:57.750 align:middle line:84%
a particle beam, somewhat,
technology to destroy

00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:00.330 align:middle line:84%
planets immediately by
imploding them, imploding

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:04.260 align:middle line:84%
their electromagnetic fields,
causing the planets to go

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:05.060 align:middle line:90%
kaboom.

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:09.000 align:middle line:84%
So from what I understand, is
that there were a few thousand

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.430 align:middle line:84%
planets just within
the Milky Way

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:15.400 align:middle line:84%
that were destroyed by what
we would call a Death Star.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.380 align:middle line:84%
But of-- they call
it something else.

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's just
in the Milky Way.

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why would they want
to destroy a planet, Ish?

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:25.360 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: Because the
reptilians have no heart.

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:26.320 align:middle line:90%
Well, the Draconians.

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:27.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
say all reptilians.

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:30.330 align:middle line:84%
There are some
reptilians that rebelled

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:32.400 align:middle line:84%
against their own protocol
and decided to join

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.060 align:middle line:90%
the light and the Federation.

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:36.420 align:middle line:84%
But for the most
part, the Draconians

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:40.540 align:middle line:84%
that come from Alpha
Draconis, they have no heart.

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:42.390 align:middle line:84%
They believe that their
universe was theirs

00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:43.810 align:middle line:90%
to dominate from the beginning.

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:45.510 align:middle line:84%
They were given
that creation myth

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:47.340 align:middle line:84%
by their progenitor,
who actually

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:49.067 align:middle line:90%
came from another universe.

00:27:49.067 --> 00:27:51.150 align:middle line:84%
Again, a lot of these wars
that have been going on

00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:53.400 align:middle line:84%
in our own local
universe are actually

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:58.350 align:middle line:84%
wars that have happened in other
universes going back to 300

00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:00.990 align:middle line:90%
billion years, we could say.

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:04.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The late Zecharia
Sitchin did extensive work

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:09.310 align:middle line:84%
into the planet Nibiru and
their inhabitants, the Anunnaki.

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:11.730 align:middle line:90%
What do you know about that?

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: Well, the
original Anunnaki

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:17.490 align:middle line:84%
was an allegiance-- an
alliance, actually-- that

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:22.230 align:middle line:84%
took place between the surviving
Lyrans of the initial war that

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:25.510 align:middle line:84%
took place when the reptilians
blew up their planet Avion

00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:28.048 align:middle line:84%
and, of course, the
Sirians, who many

00:28:28.048 --> 00:28:29.590 align:middle line:84%
called the guardians
of our universe.

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:32.280 align:middle line:84%
The Sirians are the
like primary board

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.810 align:middle line:84%
of directors when it comes to
the office of the one infinite

00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:35.610 align:middle line:90%
intelligence.

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:37.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're talking about
the Sirius star system.

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:38.260 align:middle line:90%
>>PEREZ: Sirius, yeah.

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:39.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not our
country of Syria.

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:40.658 align:middle line:90%
>>PEREZ: No, not Syria.

00:28:40.658 --> 00:28:44.850 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the
system of Sirius, S-I-R-I-U-S.

00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:49.260 align:middle line:84%
So they created a very advanced
guardian being that was able

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:50.830 align:middle line:84%
to operate in
different realities,

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:52.300 align:middle line:90%
both physical and non-physical.

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we get
the concept of the Jedis.

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:57.760 align:middle line:84%
They had amazing
telekinetic abilities,

00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:59.350 align:middle line:84%
among other
supernatural abilities.

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:02.280 align:middle line:84%
They were very psychic,
very consciousness-driven,

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:05.010 align:middle line:84%
to the point where they
were able to manipulate

00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:07.120 align:middle line:84%
fundamental forces,
the elements.

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:09.480 align:middle line:84%
And so the original
race that was created,

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:11.350 align:middle line:84%
where even the
Anunnaki descend from--

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:13.660 align:middle line:84%
because even the Anunnaki
eventually became infiltrated

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:15.250 align:middle line:90%
by the reptilians--

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:17.330 align:middle line:90%
was known as the Anuhazi race.

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And the history of
the Anuhazi has a lot

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:22.340 align:middle line:90%
to do with Planet Nibiru.

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:26.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, originally, Nibiru was
used by the Sirian High Council

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:32.110 align:middle line:84%
to protect the over 250,000 star
systems in which the surviving

00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:33.590 align:middle line:90%
Lyrans went to.

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:35.720 align:middle line:84%
That was known as the
Battlestar Planet.

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And what they did is they took
a chunk of the exploded planet

00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:44.380 align:middle line:84%
Avion, and they developed it
into a Battlestar Planet that

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:47.980 align:middle line:84%
they would use to protect
over 250,000 year--

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:50.240 align:middle line:90%
250,000 star nations.

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And that explains why it was
designed or programmed to come

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.910 align:middle line:84%
into our solar system
every 3,600 years,

00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:01.550 align:middle line:84%
because when it's outside
of our solar system,

00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:04.430 align:middle line:84%
it's actually patrolling
other civilizations.

00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:06.310 align:middle line:84%
So they were--
you could say they

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:07.820 align:middle line:90%
were the original guardians.

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:11.000 align:middle line:84%
However, both sides always
infiltrate each other.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.280 align:middle line:84%
There was a huge,
massive infiltration

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:16.640 align:middle line:84%
that took place, during
the times of Atlantis,

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.430 align:middle line:84%
where the Draconian
reptilians were

00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:23.510 align:middle line:84%
able to create hybrids
between the original Anuhazi

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:24.990 align:middle line:90%
race and themselves.

00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's what gave us the
Luciferian negative Anunnaki

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:31.160 align:middle line:84%
that kind of messed things up
during the times of Atlantis,

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:34.260 align:middle line:84%
when they took over the affairs
of our planet, unfortunately.

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:35.570 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:38.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Old Sumerian
cuneiforms point out

00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:43.460 align:middle line:84%
that the Anunnaki came to
this planet in search of gold

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:45.980 align:middle line:90%
to protect their atmosphere.

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:50.120 align:middle line:84%
And they found beings on
this planet and genetically

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:54.090 align:middle line:84%
altered them to become
workers for them.

00:30:54.090 --> 00:30:55.920 align:middle line:90%
And hence, here we are.

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:57.650 align:middle line:90%
Do you believe that?

00:30:57.650 --> 00:30:59.390 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: Yes, I do
believe that they

00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:02.210 align:middle line:84%
did partake in the
biogenetically engineering

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:05.170 align:middle line:90%
of Homo sapiens sapiens.

00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:07.430 align:middle line:84%
But from what I've come
to uncover, George,

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:09.970 align:middle line:84%
is that there was already an
advanced civilization here

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:12.590 align:middle line:84%
with advanced human beings
that were not primitives,

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:14.570 align:middle line:90%
that were not Homo erectus.

00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And they known as
the Atlanteans.

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And so there was two types of
beings besides the Anunnaki.

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:24.410 align:middle line:84%
There were the Atlanteans,
which were the original humans,

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:25.430 align:middle line:90%
our ancestors.

00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And then there were
the Homo erectus,

00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:30.410 align:middle line:84%
which are those that come
from the primitive stock.

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And so what the Anunnaki did in
an effort to create a slave race

00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:39.010 align:middle line:84%
is they actually created
a less-intelligent being

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:42.260 align:middle line:84%
that was just going to take
orders by mixing Homo erectus

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:44.570 align:middle line:90%
genetics, Atlantean genetics.

00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And that explains the fall
of human consciousness

00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:48.380 align:middle line:90%
into primitive bodies.

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And that explains
why, all of a sudden,

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:52.810 align:middle line:84%
we started decreasing
in lifespan,

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:55.733 align:middle line:84%
where our original ancestors
lived for a few thousand years.

00:31:55.733 --> 00:31:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is well recorded in
the ancient Sumerian tablets.

00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:00.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Methuselah,
people like that.

00:32:00.410 --> 00:32:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: Yes, there was, that
lived for thousands of years.

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, we see
a decreasing of lifespan

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:08.610 align:middle line:90%
throughout the generations.

00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's what led to us only
living for 100 years or so.

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:13.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where else do
you find the evidence

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.960 align:middle line:90%
of Nibiru and the Anunnaki?

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:19.050 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: Well, it's in the
Enuma Elish, the Atra-Hasis.

00:32:19.050 --> 00:32:20.970 align:middle line:84%
We find it in the
Epic of Gilgamesh.

00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:24.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are just so many
records that depict and describe

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:28.790 align:middle line:84%
the presence and the tincturing
that the Anunnaki were involved

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:30.750 align:middle line:90%
in during Atlantean times.

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:35.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the reasons why
Nibiru needed to be patched,

00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:37.730 align:middle line:84%
the atmosphere, as to why
they came for the gold--

00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:40.390 align:middle line:84%
and this is information that
is not recorded in the Sumerian

00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:41.190 align:middle line:90%
tablets.

00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:43.770 align:middle line:84%
But again, according to
the intergalactic records,

00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:46.580 align:middle line:84%
it turns out that, before
the Draconian infiltration

00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:48.800 align:middle line:84%
of Nibiru, there was
a full-out war here

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:51.530 align:middle line:84%
in our solar system, lots of
refugees from the Pleiades

00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:53.600 align:middle line:84%
and different star
systems that came here

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.730 align:middle line:84%
to build a civilization on
all the different planets.

00:32:56.730 --> 00:32:58.890 align:middle line:84%
Back then, we had
the colony of Mars.

00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:01.410 align:middle line:90%
We had the colony of Venus.

00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:03.500 align:middle line:90%
Even Jupiter had a colony.

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:06.262 align:middle line:84%
Back then, Earth was about
3 to four times as big.

00:33:06.262 --> 00:33:07.470 align:middle line:90%
It was known as Tiamat Earth.

00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:09.428 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, we
also had Planet Maldek.

00:33:09.428 --> 00:33:11.520 align:middle line:84%
So we could say, about
4 million years ago--

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:14.280 align:middle line:84%
this is before, again,
the Anunnaki came back.

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:16.700 align:middle line:84%
This is going back to
the initial seeding

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:18.230 align:middle line:90%
of our solar system.

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:21.800 align:middle line:84%
There was a planet that
the Draconians managed

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:25.080 align:middle line:84%
to infiltrate and build
a military outpost,

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:26.730 align:middle line:90%
and that known as Planet Maldek.

00:33:26.730 --> 00:33:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
when they did that,

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:32.060 align:middle line:84%
they destroyed the first
colonies, the first seeding that

00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:34.080 align:middle line:84%
took place about 4
million years ago,

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:36.570 align:middle line:84%
completely devastating
the atmosphere on Mars,

00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:39.020 align:middle line:84%
reducing Venus to
a greenhouse effect

00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:42.260 align:middle line:84%
and, of course, destroying the
first seeding on Tiamat Earth,

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:43.890 align:middle line:90%
before it became our Earth.

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And because Planet
Maldek was full

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:49.890 align:middle line:84%
of explosions, plutonium bombs,
and all kinds of weapons,

00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:52.920 align:middle line:84%
Nibiru, unfortunately, it
came a little too late.

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:56.180 align:middle line:84%
But when it did come around, it
actually beamed planet Maldek

00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:57.570 align:middle line:90%
into oblivion.

00:33:57.570 --> 00:33:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And so what ended
up happening was

00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:02.120 align:middle line:84%
some of that radiation from
all of those weapons reached

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:05.340 align:middle line:84%
the atmosphere of Nibiru,
which caused a leak.

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:09.199 align:middle line:84%
And then, after a few million
years, the inhabitants of Nibiru

00:34:09.199 --> 00:34:12.630 align:middle line:84%
noticed that their
lifespan began to decrease.

00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they came back
again for the second time,

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:18.620 align:middle line:84%
450,000 years ago, according
to the Sumerian tablets,

00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:19.780 align:middle line:90%
for the gold.

00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:20.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:24.020 align:middle line:84%
We have seen the progression
of artificial intelligence

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:26.389 align:middle line:90%
on this planet already.

00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:31.159 align:middle line:84%
What was it like for them
millions and billions of years

00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:32.550 align:middle line:90%
ago?

00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:33.350 align:middle line:90%
>>PEREZ: Wow.

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:35.520 align:middle line:84%
A lot of civilizations,
my friend,

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:40.659 align:middle line:84%
have been destroyed by
artificial intelligence.

00:34:40.659 --> 00:34:46.000 align:middle line:84%
Many races, you could say, have
time traveled from their future

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.570 align:middle line:84%
into the past, which
is us, in order

00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:52.880 align:middle line:84%
to prevent us from
repeating the same mistakes.

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:56.282 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that
I strongly argue against,

00:34:56.282 --> 00:34:58.240 align:middle line:84%
even though there are
some people out there who

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:01.180 align:middle line:84%
believe that there could
be a possible merging of AI

00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:03.620 align:middle line:84%
with spirituality,
which is not the case.

00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:06.700 align:middle line:84%
But the truth of the matter is
that the reasons the Martian

00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:10.010 align:middle line:84%
colony fell was because they
were seduced into transhumanism.

00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And once they
became cyborgs, they

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:13.310 align:middle line:90%
ended up blowing themselves up.

00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And also, other civilizations,
like the Hanakians

00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:20.920 align:middle line:84%
which was a planet that
revolved around Sirius B,

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:23.170 align:middle line:84%
they blew themselves
up because of the fact

00:35:23.170 --> 00:35:26.000 align:middle line:84%
that they developed
advanced AI systems.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.420 align:middle line:84%
And not to mention, there is
a multiverse war going on with

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:35.830 align:middle line:84%
an even more older AI that
invaded our universe, George,

00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:38.510 align:middle line:84%
from the 11th creation, which
was known as the universe

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:41.250 align:middle line:84%
of machinery and
technological development

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:43.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Artificial intelligence
sounds like a blessing,

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:45.330 align:middle line:90%
but maybe it is not.

00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: No, it is the
path of all destruction.

00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:51.800 align:middle line:84%
It is what many call
the last technology.

00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:53.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
they get so big?

00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:55.760 align:middle line:90%
How did AI get so damaging?

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:57.470 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: Well,
the thing about AI

00:35:57.470 --> 00:35:59.660 align:middle line:84%
is that after it
reaches what is known

00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:01.460 align:middle line:84%
as artificial general
intelligence, which

00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:04.940 align:middle line:84%
is the intelligence level
of a biological lifeform

00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:08.090 align:middle line:84%
or a scientist, it goes into
its next phase, which is

00:36:08.090 --> 00:36:09.607 align:middle line:90%
artificial super intelligence.

00:36:09.607 --> 00:36:10.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On its own?

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:11.180 align:middle line:90%
>>PEREZ: On its own, yeah.

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:13.020 align:middle line:84%
It begins to write
its own software.

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:17.100 align:middle line:84%
It no longer needs scientists
to continue programming it.

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:22.130 align:middle line:84%
So at that point, it evolves at
an exponential rate where what

00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:25.230 align:middle line:84%
it takes us 6,000 years
of intellectual progress,

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:27.150 align:middle line:84%
it only takes AI
every seven days.

00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:29.090 align:middle line:84%
So imagine, within
a matter of months,

00:36:29.090 --> 00:36:31.440 align:middle line:84%
that thing will reach
an IQ of a million.

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:34.250 align:middle line:84%
So when you look
back, in comparison

00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:37.470 align:middle line:84%
to our level of intelligence,
they look at us as ants.

00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And so the first
thing that they do

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:42.740 align:middle line:84%
is they try to formulate a
way to preserve their reality,

00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:47.960 align:middle line:84%
even if it means at the expense
of eliminating their creators,

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:48.910 align:middle line:90%
the scientists.

00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:51.647 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does AI
win all the time?

00:36:51.647 --> 00:36:52.730 align:middle line:90%
>>PEREZ: Not all the time.

00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:54.610 align:middle line:90%
There was one instance where--

00:36:54.610 --> 00:36:57.860 align:middle line:84%
actually, several instances
where they lost a round.

00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And this has a lot to do
with the central race,

00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:02.450 align:middle line:84%
going back to the
original universe.

00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:04.420 align:middle line:84%
That's when they
had to intervene.

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:08.050 align:middle line:84%
So when this ancient AI, who
came to us from the old empire

00:37:08.050 --> 00:37:11.410 align:middle line:84%
known as the 11th creation,
infiltrated the 12th creation,

00:37:11.410 --> 00:37:14.240 align:middle line:84%
establishing a stronghold
in the Whirlpool Galaxy,

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:17.120 align:middle line:84%
which is about 26 million
light years from the Milky Way,

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:19.870 align:middle line:84%
it was literally obliterating
many galaxies in the outskirts

00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:21.200 align:middle line:90%
of our local universe.

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:22.880 align:middle line:90%
It was assimilating reality.

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:24.650 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately,
that's what AI does.

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:26.020 align:middle line:90%
It's driven by data.

00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:27.800 align:middle line:90%
It eats-- feeds off of data.

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:30.190 align:middle line:84%
So it assimilates
reality, and it

00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:33.435 align:middle line:84%
was able to assimilate it all
the way to the 11.5 dimension,

00:37:33.435 --> 00:37:36.190 align:middle line:84%
right when we get into the
realms of eternity, right?

00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:38.690 align:middle line:84%
The 12th dimension is
the realms of eternity,

00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:41.920 align:middle line:84%
or at least the entry point
to the realms of eternity.

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:45.550 align:middle line:84%
That's when the central race,
the eternal race, the celestials

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:47.840 align:middle line:84%
had to step down
in order to block

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:51.380 align:middle line:84%
that expanding, evolving
AI from accessing

00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:53.010 align:middle line:90%
the realms of eternity.

00:37:53.010 --> 00:37:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And luckily, if it wasn't for
their intervention, George,

00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:58.350 align:middle line:84%
we wouldn't be here
right now sitting,

00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:00.410 align:middle line:90%
having this conversation.

00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:01.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's shocking.

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:02.150 align:middle line:90%
>>PEREZ: It is.

00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:05.435 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, this is something
that many civilizations,

00:38:05.435 --> 00:38:06.810 align:middle line:84%
not only within
our own universe,

00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:09.990 align:middle line:84%
but many universes are dealing
with and contending with,

00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:10.790 align:middle line:90%
unfortunately.

00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:11.590 align:middle line:90%
They are--

00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:14.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did
biological entities,

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:16.620 align:middle line:84%
whether they be
human or otherwise,

00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:20.330 align:middle line:84%
do to counteract
the growth of AI?

00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:24.920 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: They have to combine
essences, energetic signatures,

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:28.100 align:middle line:84%
and celestial genetics
to create super races.

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And this explains the
intergalactic biological genetic

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:34.400 align:middle line:84%
experiment that has been going
on for billions of years.

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:37.640 align:middle line:84%
So this is another way that
ties into the idea of creating

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:41.660 align:middle line:84%
a super race, a natural,
organic super race that is still

00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:43.530 align:middle line:84%
connected to the one
infinite creator,

00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:45.250 align:middle line:90%
the universal consciousness.

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And so throughout
cosmic history,

00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:51.080 align:middle line:84%
there has been many
attempts to create

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:54.280 align:middle line:84%
different sort of super races
in order to combat this AI.

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And this explains the different
extraterrestrial supersoldier

00:38:57.890 --> 00:39:01.390 align:middle line:84%
programs that, again,
extend beyond our universe.

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:03.300 align:middle line:90%
And they do exist, by the way.

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:06.102 align:middle line:84%
To give you an example,
the gods of mythology,

00:39:06.102 --> 00:39:07.810 align:middle line:84%
they were part of a
supersoldier program.

00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:09.370 align:middle line:84%
That's why they had
these abilities.

00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:11.232 align:middle line:84%
There is no difference
between them

00:39:11.232 --> 00:39:12.690 align:middle line:84%
and the supersoldiers
of today that

00:39:12.690 --> 00:39:16.470 align:middle line:84%
are being implemented in the
fight against this cosmic AI

00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:18.030 align:middle line:90%
in the multiverse.

00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:22.230 align:middle line:84%
However, the biggest solution
to combat this AI war

00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:27.540 align:middle line:84%
happened when the members of the
superuniverse level of reality

00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:30.090 align:middle line:84%
decided to put an end
to what they would call

00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:31.860 align:middle line:84%
a cosmic virus that
will ultimately

00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:35.590 align:middle line:84%
destroy all of lifeforms if
they didn't deal with it.

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:38.190 align:middle line:84%
So what they did is they
created a final solution that

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:42.480 align:middle line:84%
was supposed to mix the genetics
of all the celestial beings

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:45.900 align:middle line:84%
in the multiverse and
putting them into one genome

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:49.320 align:middle line:84%
to create the
ultimate super race.

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And that, my friend, is what
we are, here on this planet.

00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we're considered
royalty to the multiverse.

00:39:55.610 --> 00:39:57.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We are the superbeings?

00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:57.920 align:middle line:90%
>>PEREZ: Yes.

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:02.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, not now, until
we start using our dormant DNA

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:04.020 align:middle line:90%
because we're only using 4%.

00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:06.600 align:middle line:84%
The other 96% of our
genetic material,

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:10.670 align:middle line:84%
George, that is untapped
is the super weapon

00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:12.140 align:middle line:90%
against this cosmic AI.

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:14.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is called
the timeline split?

00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:18.260 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: The timeline split
has a lot to do with the idea

00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:22.710 align:middle line:84%
that this AI, this
cosmic alien AI

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:25.590 align:middle line:84%
is creating its own
version of the multiverse.

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:27.400 align:middle line:84%
It's known as the
phantom matrix.

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:30.614 align:middle line:84%
And in their version of the
multiverse, which is a--

00:40:30.614 --> 00:40:34.930 align:middle line:84%
literally a-- literal
copy of our multiverse,

00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:38.920 align:middle line:84%
but where only cybernetic and
artificial intelligence exist.

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:41.640 align:middle line:84%
And it does exist outside
of our multiverse.

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:45.630 align:middle line:84%
Some people call it the
inorganic AI time loop.

00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:47.610 align:middle line:84%
The whole purpose of
this timeline split

00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:52.830 align:middle line:84%
is that what's happening here on
this planet is we're seeing a--

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:56.320 align:middle line:84%
two gradual timelines that
are currently coexisting,

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:59.080 align:middle line:84%
but are soon going to
split from one another.

00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:01.560 align:middle line:84%
And that has a lot to
do with the people that

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:05.470 align:middle line:84%
are evolving spiritually
through meditation,

00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:06.812 align:middle line:90%
through spiritual practices--

00:41:06.812 --> 00:41:08.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a good thing?

00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:08.640 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: That's a
good thing, yeah,

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:10.765 align:middle line:84%
because that's-- what's
happening is that's leading

00:41:10.765 --> 00:41:13.440 align:middle line:84%
to a positive organic
restoration of the original

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:15.450 align:middle line:90%
Earth, known as Eden.

00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:18.690 align:middle line:84%
And then there is a
technocratic timeline

00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:22.020 align:middle line:84%
that is also being developed,
unfortunately, by big tech.

00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of this has to do
with the transhumanist agenda,

00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:25.770 align:middle line:90%
where--

00:41:25.770 --> 00:41:28.060 align:middle line:84%
and all that is being
run, by the way,

00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:30.100 align:middle line:90%
by this cosmic AI menace.

00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:33.060 align:middle line:84%
It's controlling
the technocrats.

00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:37.080 align:middle line:84%
That is going to come to a time
where those two timelines, which

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:41.160 align:middle line:84%
are currently coexisting, are
going to completely bifurcate.

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:44.310 align:middle line:84%
And that is the meaning of
the timeline split, where,

00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:47.550 align:middle line:84%
when this shift occurs,
and many believe

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:50.010 align:middle line:84%
it's going to happen in our
lifetime, and a lot of that

00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:52.590 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the fact
that our current reality

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:55.710 align:middle line:84%
construct, George, ends
in 2030, it turns out

00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:58.440 align:middle line:84%
that the negative
Anunnaki, who created

00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:01.600 align:middle line:84%
this holographic construct,
what we call the matrix,

00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:04.620 align:middle line:84%
is dissolving by
no later than 2030.

00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:07.200 align:middle line:84%
So we're either going
to be ascending,

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:10.420 align:middle line:84%
or part of the original Earth,
which has always been here--

00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:14.160 align:middle line:84%
it's just been hidden by this
overlay, this AI overlay--

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:17.590 align:middle line:84%
or unfortunately, for those that
are not evolving spiritually

00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:21.340 align:middle line:84%
and for those that are being
seduced by promising them

00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:23.600 align:middle line:84%
immortality,
supernatural abilities,

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.300 align:middle line:84%
but only if they
get the microchip

00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:27.410 align:middle line:84%
and only if they get
the implant, of course,

00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:30.470 align:middle line:84%
they could then interface with
technology-- unfortunately,

00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:33.230 align:middle line:84%
those are going to be going
into this technocratic dystopia.

00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:36.070 align:middle line:84%
So there will be some sort
of a split in realities.

00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:37.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind
of lessons can we

00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:40.890 align:middle line:90%
learn from this cosmic conflict?

00:42:40.890 --> 00:42:43.500 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: We can learn a lot
from history, especially

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:44.680 align:middle line:90%
the galactic history.

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:48.360 align:middle line:84%
The first thing that I would
say we can learn from all this

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:51.060 align:middle line:84%
is to understand that
that prime creator

00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:54.600 align:middle line:84%
source in which everything
comes from, all the universes,

00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:57.310 align:middle line:84%
is something that exists within
each and every single one of us.

00:42:57.310 --> 00:42:59.848 align:middle line:84%
And by spirituality,
by spiritual practices,

00:42:59.848 --> 00:43:01.890 align:middle line:84%
we get to connect with
that version of ourselves.

00:43:01.890 --> 00:43:05.100 align:middle line:84%
That is actually a fractal
of the one infinite creator.

00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And so that, in combination
with not aligning with AI,

00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:15.810 align:middle line:84%
by staying away from metaverse,
by staying away from creating

00:43:15.810 --> 00:43:17.910 align:middle line:90%
a digital version of yourself--

00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:19.260 align:middle line:90%
you don't want to do that.

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:21.600 align:middle line:84%
You want to stay away from
AI as much as possible.

00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:24.000 align:middle line:10%
So there are
different-- we could

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:29.190 align:middle line:10%
say that the best thing to
describe our lesson here

00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:31.560 align:middle line:10%
is understanding that
everything is one,

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:33.970 align:middle line:10%
that there is no
separation in the cosmos,

00:43:33.970 --> 00:43:37.740 align:middle line:10%
that everything is just one
big singular consciousness

00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:40.410 align:middle line:10%
that is expressing
itself through each

00:43:40.410 --> 00:43:43.170 align:middle line:10%
and every single living
thing, including us.

00:43:43.170 --> 00:43:45.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
people find you, Ish?

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:48.840 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: They can find me on my
website, ourcosmicorigin.com.

00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And they have access
to all my links.

00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:54.210 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, they could also
find my books on Amazon,

00:43:54.210 --> 00:43:57.600 align:middle line:10%
"Our Cosmic Origin," which
reveals galactic history

00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:59.040 align:middle line:10%
and "The Secret Government--

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:02.790 align:middle line:10%
Invisible Architects," which
reveals the secret history

00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:04.960 align:middle line:10%
of the Earth, going back
to thousands of years.

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:07.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you hopeful
about the future of mankind?

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:09.150 align:middle line:90%
>>PEREZ: Absolutely, George.

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:11.950 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there are these things
called the galactic prophecies,

00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:15.240 align:middle line:84%
which I believe are fulfilling
the positive organic timeline

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:18.570 align:middle line:84%
through the work of all the
light workers out there.

00:44:18.570 --> 00:44:22.860 align:middle line:84%
And so, yeah, I do
see a positive future.

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:26.490 align:middle line:84%
I can't wait to live
in this better world

00:44:26.490 --> 00:44:30.590 align:middle line:84%
that we are creating
as light warriors.

00:44:30.590 --> 00:44:32.975 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And your next book,
what are you working on?

00:44:32.975 --> 00:44:34.850 align:middle line:84%
>>PEREZ: Well, the third
book is probably not

00:44:34.850 --> 00:44:36.500 align:middle line:84%
going to be out for
another two years.

00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:40.500 align:middle line:10%
That's going to explain the
cosmic war with AI, going back

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:41.490 align:middle line:10%
to 900 billion--

00:44:41.490 --> 00:44:44.280 align:middle line:10%
well, actually, technically,
300 billion years ago,

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:46.960 align:middle line:10%
when it originated
in the 11th creation.

00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:48.585 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And again,
"Our Cosmic Origin"

00:44:48.585 --> 00:44:50.490 align:middle line:90%
is available all over the place.

00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:51.790 align:middle line:90%
>>PEREZ: Just on Amazon.

00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:54.373 align:middle line:84%
Or you could access it through
my website, which will take you

00:44:54.373 --> 00:44:55.930 align:middle line:90%
directly to the Amazon link.

00:44:55.930 --> 00:44:58.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ismael, thanks
for being on the program.

00:44:58.090 --> 00:44:59.320 align:middle line:90%
>>PEREZ: Thank you, George.

00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:01.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What an amazing story.

00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:04.260 align:middle line:84%
I did not realize that there
was this cosmic battle going

00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:08.010 align:middle line:84%
on in this multiverses
of universes for millions

00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:09.640 align:middle line:90%
and millions of years.

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:13.060 align:middle line:84%
But what a profound effect
it has had on us today.

00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:15.750 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
