00:00:03.423 --> 00:00:19.919 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:21.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.240 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and we've got
an old friend back with us--

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.280 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Bruce Goldberg,
noted author.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.100 align:middle line:90%
21 books.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.910 align:middle line:90%
He's a past life regressionist.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.350 align:middle line:90%
He's a hypnotherapist.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And his latest book is
called "Exploring the Fifth

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.620 align:middle line:90%
Dimension."

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.310 align:middle line:84%
Bruce, welcome back
to the program.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUCE GOLDBERG:
Thank you, George.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.030 align:middle line:84%
It's always a pleasure
to reincarnate.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I always get great
reception from our viewers

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.830 align:middle line:90%
when you're on the show.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:44.690 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.190 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, I have a lot
of contact with your viewers,

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.320 align:middle line:84%
because many of them
become patients of mine.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.470 align:middle line:10%
It's a very sophisticated
audience, they're well read,

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.790 align:middle line:10%
and they appreciate my energy
and my overall spirituality.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.076 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And enthusiasm.

00:00:58.076 --> 00:00:58.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: It helps.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.324 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, tell me, what
is a past life regressionist?

00:01:01.324 --> 00:01:02.576 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:01:02.576 --> 00:01:04.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well,
what I do is actually

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.300 align:middle line:90%
more of an energy approach.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.589 align:middle line:84%
I like to call this spiritually
thinking outside the box.

00:01:09.589 --> 00:01:10.630 align:middle line:90%
Let me share what I mean.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:11.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.278 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Going back, I
take people into past lives

00:01:13.278 --> 00:01:14.760 align:middle line:84%
and progress them
into the future,

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.590 align:middle line:84%
but that's not the
real basis of my work.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.300 align:middle line:84%
My work is based
upon something I

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.910 align:middle line:84%
developed many years ago
called the superconscious mind

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.150 align:middle line:84%
tap, which is a way of
introducing a patient's

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.400 align:middle line:84%
subconscious mind,
or their soul, which

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.280 align:middle line:84%
is equivalent to-- it's really
electromagnetic radiation, just

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.800 align:middle line:84%
like this TV signal
or a computer signal.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And then you have a
higher self, which is

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.940 align:middle line:90%
called the superconscious mind.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And if you introduce
the subconscious

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.370 align:middle line:84%
to the superconscious,
you can raise, literally,

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.175 align:middle line:84%
the baseline, or what we
call the frequency vibration

00:01:44.175 --> 00:01:47.370 align:middle line:84%
or rate of their soul's energy,
and they can overcome issues.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.120 align:middle line:84%
But you see, the whole
point of this field

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.000 align:middle line:90%
is thinking outside the box.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.930 align:middle line:84%
You can't do it with
conventional mentality.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.370 align:middle line:90%
So here's an example.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.780 align:middle line:84%
Here's what I call a thinking
outside the box riddle.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.590 align:middle line:84%
What occurs once in a
minute, twice in a moment,

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.177 align:middle line:90%
but never in 1,000 years?

00:02:03.177 --> 00:02:04.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is this a riddle?

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.930 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: It's a riddle.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:05.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I have no idea.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.139 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: The answer
is the letter M.

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:09.479 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The letter M?

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.949 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Once
in a minute, two

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.600 align:middle line:84%
M's in moment, but
no M in 1,000 years.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So do we get a
prize for this or what?

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So next
time I'm on the air,

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.280 align:middle line:84%
I'll wear a green suit
with question marks,

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.560 align:middle line:90%
and you call me the Riddler.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.000 align:middle line:84%
The point of all
this is that you

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.330 align:middle line:84%
wanted to think outside the
box if you want to accomplish

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.070 align:middle line:90%
things on a permanent level.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.550 align:middle line:84%
As a healer and therapist,
I'm trying to eliminate

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.670 align:middle line:90%
causes of issues, you see?

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And energy is the
cause of everything.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.370 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, instead
of treating people

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.890 align:middle line:84%
symptomatically, like allopathic
or modern medicine does,

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.410 align:middle line:90%
I treat the cause of things.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's why people are
able to attain goals and not

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.157 align:middle line:84%
have to have those
issues reincarnate again.

00:02:46.157 --> 00:02:48.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind of
issues are we talking about?

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Oh, I deal with
depression, anxiety, addiction,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.790 align:middle line:84%
drug addiction, people
who want to increase

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.080 align:middle line:90%
their own abundance of life.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.980 align:middle line:90%
I call this karmic capitalism.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, are these
issues because of past lives?

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, yeah,
they're carryovers.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.260 align:middle line:84%
Most issues people have are
carryovers from past lives.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.110 align:middle line:84%
This is the point
of the karmic cycle.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.840 align:middle line:84%
If you didn't learn
something in a past life

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.020 align:middle line:84%
or let somebody victimize
you or dominate you,

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.180 align:middle line:84%
or you failed, or
you procrastinated

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.670 align:middle line:84%
and something negative
happened to you or your family,

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.670 align:middle line:84%
that's going to carry
over in your current life.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.860 align:middle line:84%
So most people's problems are
really past life in origin.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take on it.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.746 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Remember my famous
case, the search for Grace,

00:03:26.746 --> 00:03:30.150 align:middle line:84%
about a woman who is obsessively
attracted to a married man?

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.327 align:middle line:90%
She was a single woman.

00:03:31.327 --> 00:03:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And he tried to murder her
on three different occasions.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.280 align:middle line:84%
When I did the
regressions on her,

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.590 align:middle line:84%
he murdered her in
20 of 46 past lives.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:39.540 align:middle line:90%
So she didn't get it.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The same soul guy?

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: The same soul, but
eventually, she-- of course,

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.880 align:middle line:84%
we were able to work with her,
not just through regressions

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.310 align:middle line:84%
but by using the
superconscious mind tap.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.020 align:middle line:84%
She was able to overcome
her obsession with him.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And 24 years later-- she
would call me every year

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.230 align:middle line:84%
to tell me how she
was doing, and she's

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.690 align:middle line:84%
fine and broke up
with the gentleman

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:58.950 align:middle line:90%
and now went on with her life.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.790 align:middle line:84%
But that's pretty
heavy carry over.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.060 align:middle line:84%
So that's a lot of people
who, for example, if they

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.520 align:middle line:84%
starve to death
in the past life,

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.490 align:middle line:84%
they can come back and overeat
in this life to compensate.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:09.990 align:middle line:90%
Relationship issues.

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.750 align:middle line:84%
I deal with everything
from abundance,

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.510 align:middle line:90%
I told you, earning more income.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:15.480 align:middle line:90%
Relationships.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.329 align:middle line:84%
Meeting a soul mate
is another thing.

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.700 align:middle line:84%
Overcoming anything
that in their life,

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.020 align:middle line:84%
right now, is a negative
factor or an inhibition.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.760 align:middle line:84%
Because I believe
in what I called not

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.630 align:middle line:84%
just karmic capitalism, but I
believe in psychic empowerment,

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.060 align:middle line:84%
using your subconscious
higher self-connection,

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.770 align:middle line:84%
the psychic part, to
take charge of your life.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.350 align:middle line:90%
And that's the empowerment part.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
deal with a past life,

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.712 align:middle line:84%
how does it fix that problem,
that issue, that phobia,

00:04:42.712 --> 00:04:43.920 align:middle line:90%
whatever you want to call it?

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:44.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well,
the past life itself

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.806 align:middle line:90%
doesn't do anything, really.

00:04:45.806 --> 00:04:48.150 align:middle line:84%
What does something is
raising the soul's energy.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.520 align:middle line:84%
So the past life regression
is like watching the History

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.320 align:middle line:90%
Channel.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.880 align:middle line:84%
But what really does the
solution to the problem

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.830 align:middle line:84%
is connecting with
the higher self.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.150 align:middle line:90%
Think of it this way.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.025 align:middle line:84%
If it's a chilly morning
and you go outside

00:04:59.025 --> 00:05:00.450 align:middle line:84%
and you're going
to get the paper

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:01.530 align:middle line:84%
or something and
your body's going

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:02.760 align:middle line:84%
to be chilled
because you open up

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.150 align:middle line:84%
a door from your
nice, warm house.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.650 align:middle line:84%
Chances are you don't
have your socks on.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.316 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: But when you go back
into the house, the nice heated

00:05:07.316 --> 00:05:09.400 align:middle line:84%
house that you're in
warms up your body.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.200 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.935 align:middle line:84%
So introducing
your subconscious,

00:05:11.935 --> 00:05:13.560 align:middle line:84%
which is always
compromised, because it

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.060 align:middle line:84%
has karmic carryovers,
unless it's learned,

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.270 align:middle line:84%
to the perfect part
of your soul's energy

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.940 align:middle line:84%
that we call the higher
self or the superconscious,

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.750 align:middle line:84%
which can never be contaminated,
raises the quality of your soul

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:25.654 align:middle line:90%
to a higher level.

00:05:25.654 --> 00:05:26.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And what do you do?

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Do you put them in some
different state of mind?

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:29.960 align:middle line:90%
How do you do this?

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, I
use self-hypnosis.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.830 align:middle line:84%
See, all hypnosis
is self-hypnosis.

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:35.830 align:middle line:90%
So think of it this way.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.330 align:middle line:84%
When you're driving
in a car and not

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.834 align:middle line:84%
realizing all the exits you
pass by on the freeway, if I was

00:05:39.834 --> 00:05:41.750 align:middle line:84%
sitting next to you with
electroencephalograph

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.130 align:middle line:84%
and hooked you up,
electrodes to your skull,

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.320 align:middle line:84%
you would be in alpha,
or the hypnotic level,

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.400 align:middle line:84%
for about 25% to
30% of the time.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.040 align:middle line:90%
While you're driving?

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.920 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: While
you're driving.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:51.330 align:middle line:90%
Your eyes are open.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.690 align:middle line:90%
You're fine.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:52.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
happened to me, too.

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.390 align:middle line:84%
I've gotten from
point A to point B,

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.100 align:middle line:84%
and I couldn't remember
how I did that.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.433 align:middle line:84%
It was something like you've
been abducted by something.

00:05:58.433 --> 00:06:00.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: We call
that auto-hypnosis.

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:02.820 align:middle line:84%
So then you can think
of watching a TV movie

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.200 align:middle line:84%
or reading a book
or on the computer.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.280 align:middle line:84%
Any time your mind is focused
concentration, you're relaxed,

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.730 align:middle line:84%
and time goes by quickly, we
call that time distortion.

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.130 align:middle line:84%
That's a definition
of a daydream,

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:15.840 align:middle line:84%
which is really
hypnosis, because it's

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:16.800 align:middle line:90%
an alpha brainwave.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.480 align:middle line:90%
All hypnosis is is alpha.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.690 align:middle line:84%
Meditation, yoga, biofeedback,
they're all the same.

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.100 align:middle line:90%
They're all alpha brainwaves.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you also take
people into the future.

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.930 align:middle line:84%
You've done that
with me in terms

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.520 align:middle line:90%
of who I am in the future.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm a talk show host.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.320 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Dexter Monterrey.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dexter Monterrey.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:33.143 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: The man.

00:06:33.143 --> 00:06:36.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How far into the
future do you take people?

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.820 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: I've taken people
as far as the 51st century.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.910 align:middle line:84%
When I did my work with time
travelers from our future,

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:44.960 align:middle line:84%
I have worked with the
discovery of time travel, which

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.190 align:middle line:84%
was about the 31st
century, going

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.220 align:middle line:84%
all the way into the
51st century, 2000 years

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.650 align:middle line:84%
hence from that time,
3,000 years from us today.

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:56.504 align:middle line:84%
So I've taken people as far
forward as the 51st century.

00:06:56.504 --> 00:06:58.920 align:middle line:84%
The good news about that is
that we're going to be around.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was going
to ask you that.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:00.950 align:middle line:90%
So we will be.

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:03.840 align:middle line:84%
If you were to try to look
at a number of people--

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.940 align:middle line:84%
let's say something
happened in the future

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:09.390 align:middle line:84%
where the planet's obliterated,
civilization is gone,

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:11.970 align:middle line:84%
and you looked at five
people for the future.

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:15.510 align:middle line:84%
Would you see five things
that would convince

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:16.727 align:middle line:90%
you there is no future?

00:07:16.727 --> 00:07:18.310 align:middle line:84%
Something that
happened to the planet?

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:18.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: No, actually,
what would happen

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.210 align:middle line:84%
is-- we'll discuss this
with the new you technique.

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:23.807 align:middle line:84%
You can go into the future, and
there are parallel universes.

00:07:23.807 --> 00:07:25.890 align:middle line:84%
So even if we destroy the
planet-- which we're not

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:29.670 align:middle line:84%
going to do on this frequency,
because this is my ideal one.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.100 align:middle line:84%
I've already done switching
parallel universes myself,

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.290 align:middle line:84%
so I can speak from the
perspective of a person who

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:35.640 align:middle line:90%
knows what they're doing.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.880 align:middle line:84%
But there's always other
universes where the Earth would

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.150 align:middle line:84%
not be contaminated or
destroyed or civilization

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:43.540 align:middle line:90%
will continue on.

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:46.170 align:middle line:90%
It's just a matter of time.

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:48.660 align:middle line:84%
In parallel universes,
the American Revolution

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:50.119 align:middle line:90%
was lost by America.

00:07:50.119 --> 00:07:52.410 align:middle line:84%
There are parallel universes
where everything happened,

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:54.510 align:middle line:90%
with every possibility.

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And this is based
on quantum physics,

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:58.060 align:middle line:84%
by the way, or
quantum mechanics.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:01.170 align:middle line:84%
We have mathematical models
to demonstrate the proof

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:03.530 align:middle line:84%
for the existence of
parallel universes.

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:05.640 align:middle line:84%
So that really isn't
even an argument today.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bruce, let's give
our "Beyond Belief" viewers

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:14.600 align:middle line:84%
an opportunity to look at what
a future life progression is.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.950 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: What do you do?

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:18.080 align:middle line:10%
>>TREENA STANLEY:
I'm a tree cutter.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.050 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: And this
scene that you're

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:23.780 align:middle line:10%
describing about your relieving
of your bodily functions,

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.900 align:middle line:10%
is this unusual in
some way for you?

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:27.275 align:middle line:10%
>>STANLEY: Yeah,
I'm standing up.

00:08:27.275 --> 00:08:28.858 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And you
find that unusual?

00:08:28.858 --> 00:08:29.680 align:middle line:90%
>>STANLEY: Mm-hmm.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.763 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: OK, very good.

00:08:30.763 --> 00:08:34.082 align:middle line:10%
How do you like, enjoy,
being a tree cutter?

00:08:34.082 --> 00:08:35.429 align:middle line:10%
>>STANLEY: It's hard work.

00:08:35.429 --> 00:08:37.720 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: How old would
you say you are at this time?

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:38.820 align:middle line:10%
>>STANLEY: 23.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:39.299 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: All right.

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:40.423 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm sorry, Dr. Goldberg.

00:08:40.423 --> 00:08:42.890 align:middle line:10%
I know this can't be fake,
because what young woman would

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:46.562 align:middle line:10%
come on television and say
she's peeing on a tree?

00:08:46.562 --> 00:08:48.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, I'll tell
you, if this was unusual,

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:50.776 align:middle line:90%
it would be a real pisser.

00:08:50.776 --> 00:08:52.280 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is in
the future, again.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.130 align:middle line:90%
We're talking about future.

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:54.210 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: This is the future.

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:56.660 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to the most significant
development or experience

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.871 align:middle line:84%
of yours that would occupy
your life as much now,

00:08:59.871 --> 00:09:01.995 align:middle line:84%
in your professional life
or in your personal life.

00:09:01.995 --> 00:09:02.870 align:middle line:90%
On the count of five.

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:04.520 align:middle line:90%
One, moving forward.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.210 align:middle line:90%
Two, farther forward.

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:08.070 align:middle line:90%
Three, halfway there.

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:09.830 align:middle line:90%
Four, almost there.

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:10.630 align:middle line:90%
Number five.

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:12.084 align:middle line:84%
Now, all right,
what has happened

00:09:12.084 --> 00:09:13.250 align:middle line:90%
since I last spoke with you?

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:16.094 align:middle line:90%


00:09:16.094 --> 00:09:17.990 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:19.412 align:middle line:90%
>>STANLEY: I don't know.

00:09:19.412 --> 00:09:21.344 align:middle line:90%
It's gotten sad again.

00:09:21.344 --> 00:09:22.760 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Is
that something that

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:26.060 align:middle line:84%
has occurred that has made you
feel uncomfortable about this?

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:27.741 align:middle line:84%
>>STANLEY: I feel
like someone's hurt.

00:09:27.741 --> 00:09:29.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Someone
physically hurt,

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.390 align:middle line:90%
like one of your colleagues?

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:32.230 align:middle line:90%
>>STANLEY: Yes.

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:34.000 align:middle line:84%
Someone I'm related
to or something.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:34.800 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: OK.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:35.883 align:middle line:90%
How do you deal with that?

00:09:35.883 --> 00:09:38.602 align:middle line:90%


00:09:38.602 --> 00:09:40.264 align:middle line:90%
>>STANLEY: I just hide.

00:09:40.264 --> 00:09:42.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Are you not very
communicative person normally

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:43.360 align:middle line:90%
about feelings?

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.401 align:middle line:90%
Hard to express feelings?

00:09:44.401 --> 00:09:45.430 align:middle line:90%
>>STANLEY: Yes.

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:46.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Are you hurt yourself?

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:47.650 align:middle line:90%
>>STANLEY: No.

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:49.290 align:middle line:90%
It's someone that's close to me.

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:50.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: But you're
emotionally hurt by them

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:51.600 align:middle line:90%
and afraid to show that?

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.600 align:middle line:90%
Is that what's going on?

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.680 align:middle line:90%
>>STANLEY: Mm-hm.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.597 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who was
that dark-haired guy?

00:09:56.597 --> 00:09:58.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Now, the
interesting thing

00:09:58.180 --> 00:09:59.638 align:middle line:84%
about this future
life progression,

00:09:59.638 --> 00:10:01.880 align:middle line:84%
this is about 100
years in the future.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.940 align:middle line:84%
This is a woman who,
in her current life,

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.110 align:middle line:90%
she's very sociable.

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:10.150 align:middle line:84%
She's your typical housewife,
mother, very gregarious.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:11.890 align:middle line:90%
In the future, she's a male.

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:12.927 align:middle line:90%
Changing of sexes.

00:10:12.927 --> 00:10:14.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Does that happen a lot?

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.301 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Yes, it does.

00:10:15.301 --> 00:10:18.070 align:middle line:84%
Actually, about 25% of the time,
you're going to change sexes.

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:20.710 align:middle line:84%
And she's very kind of
a strong silent type,

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:25.540 align:middle line:84%
very insecure, or very
non-communicative, very shy.

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And she was able
to experience that.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, what was interesting on
this particular same patient

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:33.310 align:middle line:84%
or same woman, she
had a fear of spiders.

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:34.994 align:middle line:84%
And what we did
during that show was--

00:10:34.994 --> 00:10:36.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who doesn't, right?

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.899 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, she had a
very severe fear, arachnophobia.

00:10:39.899 --> 00:10:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And what they did was I worked
with her before the show

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:43.310 align:middle line:90%
to prepare for this.

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And I gave her a superconscious
mind tap is what we did.

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And then they brought
out a tarantula in a box,

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:49.630 align:middle line:90%
in a glass cave.

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:51.088 align:middle line:84%
And they showed it
to her while she

00:10:51.088 --> 00:10:53.214 align:middle line:84%
was in the audience
after the thing.

00:10:53.214 --> 00:10:54.130 align:middle line:90%
They said, are you OK?

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:57.009 align:middle line:84%
And she says, I'm not
jumping over the banister.

00:10:57.009 --> 00:10:59.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She normally
probably would have, right?

00:10:59.050 --> 00:10:59.850 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Yes.

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:01.780 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
I don't like to try

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:03.439 align:middle line:90%
to cure people on the air.

00:11:03.439 --> 00:11:04.480 align:middle line:90%
I really don't cure them.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.470 align:middle line:90%
They cure themselves.

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:08.230 align:middle line:84%
But the point was is that it
was a very interesting case

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:09.220 align:middle line:90%
of time travel.

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.130 align:middle line:84%
Changing of sexes, which she
didn't think would happen.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.530 align:middle line:84%
Number two is that also
changing the personality

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:18.310 align:middle line:84%
from a gregarious person to
a very strong, silent, more

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:21.617 align:middle line:84%
shy male in the future,
100 years hence.

00:11:21.617 --> 00:11:23.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Since you've
been doing this,

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.750 align:middle line:84%
what has been one of the
most remarkable cases you've

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:29.279 align:middle line:84%
come across, in either past
life or future life regression?

00:11:29.279 --> 00:11:31.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, let me deal
with the past life first.

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:34.720 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, my most famous
case is the search for Grace,

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.990 align:middle line:84%
about the woman
who was obsessively

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:38.920 align:middle line:84%
attracted to the man
who tried to murder her.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.740 align:middle line:84%
I had another case that's
also of great interest.

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.690 align:middle line:84%
This is a case of
hysterical blindness.

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:45.490 align:middle line:84%
A woman came to me,
a young, attractive--

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:46.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hysterical blindness?

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:48.094 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: This is a
woman who couldn't see,

00:11:48.094 --> 00:11:49.660 align:middle line:90%
but her optic nerve was fine.

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:50.810 align:middle line:90%
This is what happened.

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:52.690 align:middle line:90%
She was with her boyfriend.

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:54.877 align:middle line:84%
One morning, he was
shaving in the bathroom,

00:11:54.877 --> 00:11:56.460 align:middle line:84%
and she came in there
to talk to him--

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:57.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is a real story?

00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:59.078 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: It's a
real story, real case.

00:11:59.078 --> 00:12:02.180 align:middle line:84%
And he was taking some pills
that weren't prescribed.

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:02.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To him?

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:03.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Yes.

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:04.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:06.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And she said, oh
my god, what are you doing?

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.525 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you
shouldn't have seen me.

00:12:08.525 --> 00:12:10.150 align:middle line:84%
In other words, he
hid the fact that he

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:12.640 align:middle line:84%
was taking this opioids,
whatever sort of illegal drugs.

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:13.315 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whatever he was taking.

00:12:13.315 --> 00:12:15.190 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So she
freaked out, stepped back,

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:17.920 align:middle line:84%
didn't hit herself or anything,
and said, oh my god, I

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.150 align:middle line:90%
can't see.

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:21.250 align:middle line:90%
She was blind for two weeks.

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:22.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Literally blind?

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, and they took
her to the ophthalmologist.

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:25.676 align:middle line:84%
He said, look, your
optic nerve is fine.

00:12:25.676 --> 00:12:26.900 align:middle line:90%
You should be able to see.

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:28.900 align:middle line:84%
So this is called
hysterical blindness.

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:30.410 align:middle line:84%
It's called a
conversion disorder,

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:32.290 align:middle line:84%
which means that
she's psychologically

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:33.820 align:middle line:90%
preventing herself from seeing.

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:36.850 align:middle line:84%
So I did a regression with
her, past life regression.

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:39.520 align:middle line:84%
In the 1880s in London,
in the London slums.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.130 align:middle line:84%
She's a little girl, about
five or six years old.

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:43.860 align:middle line:84%
She walks into her
father's bedroom

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:45.610 align:middle line:84%
because she wants to
get something to eat,

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:48.070 align:middle line:84%
and she wants him to
prepare a meal for her.

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:50.230 align:middle line:84%
He was wrapping
his arm with rubber

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:52.510 align:middle line:84%
and shooting morphine
into his arm.

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:54.040 align:middle line:90%
He was a morphine addicted.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.907 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you
shouldn't have seen me.

00:12:55.907 --> 00:12:56.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same thing.

00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:58.989 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And then he beat
the living tar out of her

00:12:58.989 --> 00:12:59.860 align:middle line:90%
for witnessing that.

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's what she
learned karmically.

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:02.920 align:middle line:90%
I shouldn't have seen that.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:04.232 align:middle line:90%
I should be punished.

00:13:04.232 --> 00:13:06.690 align:middle line:84%
When we did the regression and
then the superconscious mind

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:10.480 align:middle line:84%
tap following that, her sight
returned in about 20 minutes.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:13.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Now,
future life, here's

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.700 align:middle line:84%
one of my favorite
future life cases.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.310 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I'm known
for is discovering the concept

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:20.980 align:middle line:84%
of time travelers from our
future, people from our future

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:22.485 align:middle line:84%
that will come back in
our time and interact.

00:13:22.485 --> 00:13:22.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That come back here.

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:24.720 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So I work
with this gentleman,

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.660 align:middle line:84%
and he goes into a future
life in the 33rd century.

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:31.270 align:middle line:90%
His name is Kamar.

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:32.860 align:middle line:84%
It's the only time
I've ever worked--

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:35.180 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with
about 17,000 patients.

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:38.210 align:middle line:84%
His future life is going
to be as a chrononaut,

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:41.390 align:middle line:84%
or as a future
life time traveler.

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:44.830 align:middle line:84%
He goes back into the
Atlantic, the ancient times

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:47.170 align:middle line:90%
of Mu or Lemuria.

00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:51.010 align:middle line:90%
It's 101,637 BC.

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
they're sent back there

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:56.230 align:middle line:84%
is because there was something
called the Electric Wars, where

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:57.970 align:middle line:84%
ETs were running
around doing things,

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:00.610 align:middle line:84%
causing a break in the
space-time continuum.

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Electrical shocks and pulses
were all over the place,

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.200 align:middle line:84%
and the Earth was
very much in danger.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.310 align:middle line:84%
And they negotiated
a peace treaty,

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:10.940 align:middle line:84%
and he was part of the time
traveler team to do that.

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:14.650 align:middle line:84%
So that's the only time a future
life of one of my patients

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:17.260 align:middle line:90%
was an actual time traveler.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And I found that to be a
very significant future life

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:20.950 align:middle line:90%
progression.

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:24.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you find you
stumble across people

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:28.960 align:middle line:84%
who have had out-of-body
experiences, OBE,

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:32.862 align:middle line:84%
or near-death experiences, and
is there some similarity there?

00:14:32.862 --> 00:14:34.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, a
near-death experience

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:36.850 align:middle line:84%
is an actual type of
out-of-body experience.

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:37.780 align:middle line:90%
There are three types.

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:38.980 align:middle line:84%
The near-death
experience is the one

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:40.390 align:middle line:90%
that gets most of the press.

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:41.980 align:middle line:84%
But you don't want to have
one, because that means

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:43.480 align:middle line:84%
you're clinically dead
for three or four minutes,

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.500 align:middle line:90%
and you may not come back.

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like
Dannion Brinkley has.

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:45.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Right.

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:46.750 align:middle line:90%
Well, many times.

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:48.310 align:middle line:90%
My old buddy, Dannion.

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:50.410 align:middle line:90%
The good old boy, my old friend.

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:52.480 align:middle line:84%
Then, there's the regular
out-of-body experience

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.980 align:middle line:90%
that you had when you were 11.

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:56.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bouncing
up at the ceiling,

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.500 align:middle line:90%
looking down at my little body.

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And I've been out
of the body over 3,000 times.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.559 align:middle line:84%
So folks out there,
it's not dangerous, OK?

00:15:01.559 --> 00:15:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And then there is what I call
the technique I developed

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:07.480 align:middle line:84%
years ago called the COBE,
a conscious out-of-body

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.060 align:middle line:84%
experience, where I'm training
the patient to connect

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:11.170 align:middle line:90%
with your higher self.

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:13.750 align:middle line:84%
So at the moment of their
eventual physical death,

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:15.250 align:middle line:90%
they won't have to reincarnate.

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:16.850 align:middle line:90%
It's an ascension technique.

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:19.060 align:middle line:84%
So that's the third kind
of out-of-body experience.

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's been reported, by
the way, in ancient cultures.

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:22.060 align:middle line:90%
The Greeks.

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:24.390 align:middle line:84%
The mystery schools of
Egypt and Greece and Rome

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:27.317 align:middle line:84%
were doing technique similar to
that, so I've westernized them.

00:15:27.317 --> 00:15:29.650 align:middle line:84%
So those are the three kinds
of out-of-body experiences.

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:30.887 align:middle line:90%
It's perfectly normal.

00:15:30.887 --> 00:15:32.470 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when you
go to sleep at night

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:35.640 align:middle line:84%
and you enter the dream or REM
cycle, which is also an alpha

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:38.050 align:middle line:84%
brainwave, you are
actually out of the body

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:39.910 align:middle line:90%
into the fifth dimension.

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:41.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jason Quitt,
do you know Jason?

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:42.430 align:middle line:90%
He's a researcher.

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:43.513 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: I know of him.

00:15:43.513 --> 00:15:47.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's been on Gaia a
lot talking about astral travel.

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:51.770 align:middle line:84%
>> In terms of your journeys,
what types of other dimensions

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:53.560 align:middle line:90%
have you seen off-world?

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:56.860 align:middle line:84%
Is it, like how you say,
in terms of other planets

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:59.080 align:middle line:84%
or other parts of
the universe, you

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.240 align:middle line:84%
would say this is
multidimensional travel.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:04.450 align:middle line:84%
But do you believe that you have
actually been to other planets?

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:06.520 align:middle line:84%
>>JASON QUITT: I have
been to other planets,

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:10.600 align:middle line:84%
other dimensions, other
timelines, and parallel Earths.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.810 align:middle line:84%
Those are all part of
my experience range.

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:18.340 align:middle line:84%
And I would say it started to
happen to me quite drastically

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:21.280 align:middle line:90%
when I was in my early 20s.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And what would happen was I
would be sleeping at night,

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:27.100 align:middle line:84%
and I would actually be
forcefully pulled out

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:28.340 align:middle line:90%
of my body.

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:33.167 align:middle line:84%
So just imagine you're laying
in bed having a normal dream.

00:16:33.167 --> 00:16:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And then, suddenly,
you feel something

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:37.720 align:middle line:84%
reach inside your body and
yank you out of that dream.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And now, you're floating
above yourself in your bed.

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:46.120 align:middle line:84%
So those original
experiences I never

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.820 align:middle line:84%
asked for, I never prayed,
I never meditated for.

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:50.590 align:middle line:90%
They just started happening.

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:52.870 align:middle line:84%
And so once I got
yanked out of my body--

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:58.780 align:middle line:84%
and this being, it looked like a
humanoid, but it was invisible.

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:00.460 align:middle line:84%
You know that effect
from Predator,

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:02.980 align:middle line:84%
where it's like you can
make out their form,

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:04.040 align:middle line:90%
but you can't see them?

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:05.710 align:middle line:90%
They almost look invisible.

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:08.050 align:middle line:84%
That's what these
beings looked like.

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And they would just rip me out
of my body, quite violently,

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:14.859 align:middle line:84%
and then I'd be shot
up into outer space.

00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:18.069 align:middle line:84%
So I'd experience kind of like
that Google Earth effect, where

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:20.829 align:middle line:84%
you go right out
into outer space,

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:22.810 align:middle line:90%
and I can view the planets.

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And then, suddenly,
they would direct me

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:28.089 align:middle line:84%
to another point on the
planet, and they'd shoot me

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:29.410 align:middle line:90%
right back to that point.

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And they would drop me off
in this new environment.

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just kind of standing
in this new environment,

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:40.510 align:middle line:84%
and I realize it's not
a place I recognize.

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:43.210 align:middle line:84%
So that's where I
realized that, OK, this

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:47.380 align:middle line:84%
is not only astral travel, but
this is astral time travel.

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:50.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm being placed in a
different timeline of Earth.

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:52.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think of that, Bruce?

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:55.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, first, I'm
very impressed with this.

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:57.230 align:middle line:84%
He's representing a
lot of classic aspects.

00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:59.410 align:middle line:84%
First of all, a lot of
your listeners or viewers

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:01.660 align:middle line:84%
out there, when
you have a feeling

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:04.262 align:middle line:84%
of a vibration around
your head and body,

00:18:04.262 --> 00:18:06.470 align:middle line:84%
this is the beginning phase
of going out of the body.

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:07.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like
a tingling effect.

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:08.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Tingling
effect, true.

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:10.480 align:middle line:84%
It goes, usually, from the
head and works the way down.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:11.660 align:middle line:90%
Here's an example of dreams.

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:13.270 align:middle line:84%
Remember I told you dreams
are out-of-body experiences?

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:13.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:16.428 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Let me give you a
dream example that you've had

00:18:16.428 --> 00:18:19.060 align:middle line:84%
and everybody out there
in TV land has had.

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:20.075 align:middle line:90%
Dreams of flying.

00:18:20.075 --> 00:18:21.450 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's had
dreams of flying.

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:22.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, everybody's
had that, sure.

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:24.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Now, there's
a second dream, too.

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:24.930 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about
that in a moment.

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:26.440 align:middle line:84%
Dreams of flying
is when your soul

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.530 align:middle line:84%
leaves the body
from the Earth plane

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:29.977 align:middle line:84%
and goes up into
the astral plane.

00:18:29.977 --> 00:18:32.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your dream state,
or is it really happening?

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:33.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: No, it's
really happening.

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:35.020 align:middle line:84%
When you're dreaming, your
soul is out of the body.

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:37.561 align:middle line:84%
Now, you say, what about being
possessed or a psychic attack?

00:18:37.561 --> 00:18:39.040 align:middle line:84%
No, you leave a
clone of yourself,

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:41.260 align:middle line:84%
like an alias on the computer,
so your body is always

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:42.169 align:middle line:90%
protected.

00:18:42.169 --> 00:18:43.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's another
dream that people have

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:46.624 align:middle line:84%
when they feel like they're
falling into an abyss.

00:18:46.624 --> 00:18:48.790 align:middle line:84%
They never splat, but they
feel like they're falling

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:50.149 align:middle line:90%
into a deep crevice or--

00:18:50.149 --> 00:18:51.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you think
if you hit, you die.

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:52.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Right,
but you don't.

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:53.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've
always thought that.

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:55.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And you
could hear a pin drop.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.590 align:middle line:84%
You hear like this maybe
like a whooshing sound

00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:00.340 align:middle line:84%
or like the roar of
the sea kind of thing,

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:02.560 align:middle line:84%
which is characteristic
of the astral plane,

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:03.610 align:middle line:90%
but you don't splat.

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:07.180 align:middle line:84%
That's when your soul is
returning from the astral plane

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:08.770 align:middle line:90%
to the Earth plane.

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:11.015 align:middle line:84%
So those are remnants,
conscious remnants,

00:19:11.015 --> 00:19:12.140 align:middle line:90%
of out-of-body experiences.

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:13.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And sometimes that's
a jarring effect, Bruce.

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:13.900 align:middle line:90%
You can feel that.

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:14.890 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Yes.

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:15.350 align:middle line:90%
Think of it this way.

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:17.530 align:middle line:84%
When you wake up in the
morning, did you ever notice,

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:19.613 align:middle line:84%
for a few seconds, you
don't know what time it is.

00:19:19.613 --> 00:19:21.550 align:middle line:90%
Is it 7:00 AM or 7:00 PM?

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:22.430 align:middle line:90%
What planet am I on?

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:23.230 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:23.905 align:middle line:90%
You get disoriented--

00:19:23.905 --> 00:19:24.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where am I?

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:25.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: --just
for a few seconds.

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why is
because your astral body

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:30.310 align:middle line:84%
has slammed back into
the physical body,

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:32.590 align:middle line:84%
and it's very disruptive,
just for a second or two.

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:34.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the slamming
effect wakes you up, by the way.

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:36.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well,
that's true, yes.

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:37.764 align:middle line:84%
Whether you have an
alarm clock or not,

00:19:37.764 --> 00:19:39.269 align:middle line:90%
it's your automatic alarm clock.

00:19:39.269 --> 00:19:41.560 align:middle line:84%
But remember, there are
different dimensions out there.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.684 align:middle line:84%
In my books, I talk about
the different dimensions.

00:19:43.684 --> 00:19:45.970 align:middle line:84%
For example, suppose you're
flying around-- remember,

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:48.095 align:middle line:84%
when you're out of the body
in the fifth dimension,

00:19:48.095 --> 00:19:50.499 align:middle line:84%
there are no physical laws,
so you can fly, teleport.

00:19:50.499 --> 00:19:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And let's say you're
floating around,

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.200 align:middle line:90%
and you look down on the road--

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:58.540 align:middle line:84%
there are highways-- and you
see a iridescent blue road.

00:19:58.540 --> 00:19:59.710 align:middle line:90%
Where are you?

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:00.790 align:middle line:90%
It's the mental plane.

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:02.712 align:middle line:84%
It's characteristic
of the mental plane.

00:20:02.712 --> 00:20:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And every dimension
has different sounds,

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:06.687 align:middle line:84%
like the Earth plane,
the sound of thunder

00:20:06.687 --> 00:20:08.020 align:middle line:90%
is the sound of the Earth plane.

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:09.610 align:middle line:84%
So you never want to
go out of the body

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:11.410 align:middle line:84%
when it's a thunderstorm,
because you're going

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:12.670 align:middle line:90%
to be like swimming upstream.

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:13.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:15.398 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: The sound
of the astral plane

00:20:15.398 --> 00:20:18.670 align:middle line:84%
is the roar of the sea, like
a sea shell to your ear.

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:20.200 align:middle line:84%
The next plane is
the causal plane,

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.362 align:middle line:84%
which is with the
Akashic records are kept.

00:20:22.362 --> 00:20:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And that sounds like
a tinkling of bells,

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:26.080 align:middle line:84%
like you're in a
new-age bookstore.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.940 align:middle line:84%
The mental plane
that I described

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:31.400 align:middle line:84%
with the blue highways and
these abstract design buildings

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.550 align:middle line:84%
and these angelic
figures that are around,

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:36.310 align:middle line:84%
that's where that Jesuses
and Buddhas and Mohammad,

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:38.500 align:middle line:84%
all these spiritual
leaders would hang out.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
the etheric plane,

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:42.850 align:middle line:84%
which is the sound
of buzzing of bees.

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:45.740 align:middle line:84%
And that etheric plane
is relevant in my work,

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:49.210 align:middle line:84%
because what is existing there
are what we call etheric plane

00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:52.060 align:middle line:84%
surgeons that can
heal the etheric body

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:53.740 align:middle line:84%
and transfer that
to the physical body

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:56.436 align:middle line:90%
and actually do healing.

00:20:56.436 --> 00:20:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And then beyond that
is the soul plane,

00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:00.101 align:middle line:84%
where you choose your
next, where you reincarnate

00:21:00.101 --> 00:21:01.090 align:middle line:90%
or you ascend from.

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's the single
note of a flute.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And so each dimension
has sounds that

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:08.500 align:middle line:84%
are characterized
and certain physical

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:11.440 align:middle line:84%
we call identifying
characteristics that tell

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.060 align:middle line:90%
you which dimension you're on.

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:14.740 align:middle line:90%
It is important to know that.

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:16.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The late
Robert Monroe was

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:19.890 align:middle line:84%
an expert in out-of-body
travel and experiences.

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:22.300 align:middle line:84%
He was able to do
this, Bruce, at will.

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:24.610 align:middle line:90%
Not a lot of people are.

00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:26.140 align:middle line:90%
Do you train people to do that?

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:26.973 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Oh, yes.

00:21:26.973 --> 00:21:29.400 align:middle line:84%
I work with literally thousands
of people to train them.

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And I have CD programs to
actually train them to go out

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.560 align:middle line:84%
of the body, to do the
conscious dying techniques,

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:36.580 align:middle line:90%
if they want that .

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:39.100 align:middle line:84%
To visit the fifth dimension,
where they can actually

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:41.020 align:middle line:84%
meet time travelers,
their higher self,

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:44.530 align:middle line:84%
departed loved ones, to go back
into past and future lives,

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:46.840 align:middle line:84%
to do the healing techniques,
the superconscious mind

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.600 align:middle line:84%
taps, to experience
parallel universes.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.760 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I am a great
believer in that,

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:53.200 align:middle line:90%
and I always train people.

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:56.350 align:middle line:84%
I want to make myself obsolete
as quickly as possible

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:57.400 align:middle line:90%
with my patients.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.900 align:middle line:84%
Because see, here's
the thing that I

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:00.490 align:middle line:90%
have to clarify right now.

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:02.110 align:middle line:84%
I do a lot of therapy
with patients.

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:04.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm responsible for
1% of the therapy.

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.720 align:middle line:84%
The patient themselves, with
their higher self connection,

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.440 align:middle line:90%
does 99%.

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:10.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That much?

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:12.538 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: That's why I
call it psychic empowerment.

00:22:12.538 --> 00:22:15.010 align:middle line:84%
The last thing I want are
people to be dependent on me.

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:15.810 align:middle line:90%
I don't want that.

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:17.827 align:middle line:84%
I want them to be able
to go on with their lives

00:22:17.827 --> 00:22:20.410 align:middle line:84%
and do their own thing and not
have to come running back to me

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:22.030 align:middle line:90%
every time they have a problem.

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:25.330 align:middle line:84%
So accessing the higher
self is a God-given gift.

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:27.670 align:middle line:84%
That's why we have
a higher self, see?

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And everybody's
higher self is unique,

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:30.891 align:middle line:84%
just like everybody's
soul is unique.

00:22:30.891 --> 00:22:31.960 align:middle line:90%
It's like a fingerprint.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.351 align:middle line:84%
So basically,
anyone can do this.

00:22:34.351 --> 00:22:36.100 align:middle line:84%
Everybody goes through
hypnosis every day.

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.200 align:middle line:84%
We spend about seven
hours a day in hypnosis.

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.707 align:middle line:84%
Four hours during
the waking day.

00:22:39.707 --> 00:22:42.040 align:middle line:84%
The little daydreams that I
talked about-- driving a car

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.854 align:middle line:84%
and watching TV or
reading or whatever.

00:22:43.854 --> 00:22:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And then, when you
go to sleep at night,

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:48.310 align:middle line:84%
you're in the REM cycle,
which is three hours a night,

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:50.440 align:middle line:84%
broken up into four
or five sleep cycles.

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:52.840 align:middle line:84%
So you're spending a third
of your life, actually,

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.920 align:middle line:90%
in a hypnotic level every day.

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:57.070 align:middle line:84%
So why not use that
therapeutically?

00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:59.140 align:middle line:84%
The reason why we have
this natural level

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:01.030 align:middle line:90%
is simply to distress ourselves.

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:02.489 align:middle line:84%
If we didn't have
natural hypnosis,

00:23:02.489 --> 00:23:04.946 align:middle line:84%
the average person would die
of a heart attack or a stroke.

00:23:04.946 --> 00:23:05.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You think so?

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:06.220 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Yeah.

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:07.615 align:middle line:84%
The world is a lot
more stressful--

00:23:07.615 --> 00:23:07.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Too stressful.

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.524 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: --than
you see it right now

00:23:09.524 --> 00:23:12.550 align:middle line:84%
because we have this natural
protective mechanism known

00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:15.910 align:middle line:84%
as the alpha brainwave, or
what I call natural hypnosis.

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:17.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You mentioned
the Akashic records.

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:19.032 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:23:19.032 --> 00:23:21.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Akashic records is
a fifth-dimensional computer

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:23.114 align:middle line:84%
chip, is the way I
like to describe it,

00:23:23.114 --> 00:23:25.240 align:middle line:90%
stored on the causal plane.

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.910 align:middle line:84%
But you can access it from any
dimension, including this one.

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:29.980 align:middle line:90%
And what it is is a record.

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:32.710 align:middle line:84%
Think like a hospital record,
a medical record of you.

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:36.730 align:middle line:84%
It's a record of all your
past, present, future,

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:38.361 align:middle line:90%
and parallel lives.

00:23:38.361 --> 00:23:39.610 align:middle line:90%
Now, let me define some terms.

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:40.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who records
these records?

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:41.620 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, the universe.

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:43.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's done
automatically?

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:43.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: It's
called Akashic--

00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:46.207 align:middle line:84%
they call it the Akashic
light, the astral light.

00:23:46.207 --> 00:23:47.040 align:middle line:90%
They call that, too.

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.130 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds
of terms we use.

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:50.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this the good book
that we used to hear about?

00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:52.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Yes, this is
the ultimate good book,

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:52.720 align:middle line:90%
the ultimate.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:53.680 align:middle line:90%
So let me give you some terms.

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.221 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you go back
into a past life,

00:23:55.221 --> 00:23:56.860 align:middle line:84%
it's called a past
life regression.

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:58.830 align:middle line:84%
If you go into a future
life, I call that--

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:00.550 align:middle line:84%
the field I
developed years ago--

00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:02.890 align:middle line:84%
that's called a future
life progression.

00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:08.260 align:middle line:84%
If you explore a parallel life,
that's called a paragression.

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:10.690 align:middle line:84%
And if you go out of the body
into the fifth dimension,

00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:11.530 align:middle line:90%
you become--

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:15.332 align:middle line:84%
listen to this-- an
ultraterrestrial.

00:24:15.332 --> 00:24:16.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: An ultraterrestrial.

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:19.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have you
do a little past life

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:20.920 align:middle line:90%
regression with me.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:22.141 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: OK.

00:24:22.141 --> 00:24:23.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do what you do.

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:23.940 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: OK.

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:24.940 align:middle line:90%
Just close your eyes.

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:27.360 align:middle line:84%
Just sit back, and
just focus on my voice.

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:30.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to count
backwards from 10 to 1.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And what I want you to do
is I want you to access

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.570 align:middle line:90%
into your own Akashic records.

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to perceive a
past life that will give you

00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:40.180 align:middle line:84%
an insight as to
your karmic purpose

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:42.250 align:middle line:90%
in your current life as George.

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:44.770 align:middle line:90%
10, nine, relaxing.

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:46.930 align:middle line:84%
Letting each and every
muscle in your body

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:48.400 align:middle line:90%
get so completely relaxed.

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:51.460 align:middle line:90%
Eight, seven, six.

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:53.500 align:middle line:90%
Accessing the higher self.

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:54.430 align:middle line:90%
Five.

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:56.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, perceive yourself
opening up a door

00:24:56.650 --> 00:24:59.560 align:middle line:84%
and moving into the
environment of a past life,

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.960 align:middle line:84%
surrounded by white
light, always protective.

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.160 align:middle line:90%
Four, number three.

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:04.960 align:middle line:90%
You are there.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.910 align:middle line:90%
Number two, number one.

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:09.880 align:middle line:84%
You can answer questions
and still remain in trance.

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:13.750 align:middle line:84%
So let's see the first thought
that comes into your mind.

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:16.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's way, way back.

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:17.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: OK.

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:22.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, I am
looking at the construction

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:23.367 align:middle line:90%
of the pyramids.

00:25:23.367 --> 00:25:25.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And what is your
position there in reference

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:26.480 align:middle line:90%
to that?

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:27.396 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't know.

00:25:27.396 --> 00:25:30.087 align:middle line:84%
I'm just like on the
outside looking in.

00:25:30.087 --> 00:25:31.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And how
do you feel as you

00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:35.370 align:middle line:84%
perceive the construction
of the pyramids?

00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:38.572 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I feel like I'm
in charge of something.

00:25:38.572 --> 00:25:40.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Would you say
that you're male or female?

00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:41.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Male.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:45.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Would you have an
idea about how old you are?

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.644 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 28 to 45.

00:25:47.644 --> 00:25:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And
could you perceive

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:54.110 align:middle line:84%
the actual mechanisms of how the
pyramid is being constructed?

00:25:54.110 --> 00:26:00.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are craft,
like spaceships, by them.

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:03.792 align:middle line:84%
And I can see the blocks
being raised into place.

00:26:03.792 --> 00:26:05.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So the
spaceships themselves,

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.910 align:middle line:84%
they are the ones
raising the blocks?

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:08.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:10.084 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So
would you say this

00:26:10.084 --> 00:26:13.800 align:middle line:90%
is an anti-gravity approach?

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.420 align:middle line:84%
In other words, are using
physical ones like ropes?

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:21.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm hearing some
kind of strange sound

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:25.250 align:middle line:84%
that they seem to be
bursting at these blocks.

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:27.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: But your positioned
as a director or somebody

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:29.850 align:middle line:90%
in charge, like a supervisor?

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:31.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I must be.

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:37.046 align:middle line:84%
There are many workers
watching this, as I am.

00:26:37.046 --> 00:26:38.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And would
you have an idea,

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:40.470 align:middle line:84%
by the way you keep
time, approximately

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:42.950 align:middle line:90%
what year this is?

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:44.734 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's just
way, way back.

00:26:44.734 --> 00:26:45.650 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Very good.

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:46.430 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:46.660 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:47.610 align:middle line:90%
Sleep now and rest now.

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:48.410 align:middle line:90%
Just relax.

00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:50.286 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to count
forwards from one to five.

00:26:50.286 --> 00:26:51.743 align:middle line:84%
And when I reach
the count of five,

00:26:51.743 --> 00:26:54.350 align:middle line:84%
you're going to return back to
the current awareness of George

00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:57.200 align:middle line:84%
Noory, with complete memories
of everything you've experienced

00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:01.100 align:middle line:84%
and your ability to go back
in time to re-explore this

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:04.970 align:middle line:84%
or other past lives and to
focus in on getting access

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:07.460 align:middle line:84%
to your own Akashic records
for your own karmic purpose.

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:09.890 align:middle line:84%
Number one, coming
back to the present.

00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:11.720 align:middle line:90%
Number two, feeling lighter.

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.520 align:middle line:90%
Three, halfway there.

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.620 align:middle line:90%
Number four, almost there.

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:18.980 align:middle line:84%
Number five, awaken wide
awake and refreshed.

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:21.640 align:middle line:90%


00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I have recollection
of what I just said.

00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:25.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And you'll
be able to do it again.

00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:27.006 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you what's
significant about this.

00:27:27.006 --> 00:27:29.830 align:middle line:84%
In my books, my Egypt
book specifically, I

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:32.260 align:middle line:84%
talk about the way
the pyramid of Giza

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:33.974 align:middle line:90%
and the Giza Plateau in Cairo--

00:27:33.974 --> 00:27:35.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's where I was.

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:36.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: The way
they were constructed,

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:40.150 align:middle line:84%
they had these what they call
anti-gravity flying crafts.

00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:42.340 align:middle line:84%
These were these
pyramidal-shaped crafts

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:45.580 align:middle line:84%
that would use anti-gravity
to lift these tons of rocks

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:49.209 align:middle line:84%
and put them into the
intimate, specific requirement.

00:27:49.209 --> 00:27:50.500 align:middle line:90%
You know, the pyramid of Giza--

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:51.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that's
what I was seeing.

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:52.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: --these
rocks are like a quarter

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.200 align:middle line:90%
of an inch accurate.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.160 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's amazing.

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And tons.

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:57.190 align:middle line:90%
These were huge.

00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:59.200 align:middle line:84%
But I also heard
sounds that they

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.435 align:middle line:90%
were emitting at these blocks.

00:28:01.435 --> 00:28:02.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Think
of it this way.

00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:04.950 align:middle line:84%
When you have these
anti-gravity flying crafts,

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:07.810 align:middle line:84%
is what I call them, and
these were based upon--

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:09.620 align:middle line:84%
actually, the time
traveler technology

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:11.680 align:middle line:84%
is part of this, actually,
is how they worked.

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:14.620 align:middle line:84%
But they do emit a sound,
just like a whooshing effect

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:17.200 align:middle line:84%
or some sort of sound
in actually doing that,

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:20.080 align:middle line:84%
because they're using
energy to lift the rocks.

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:23.230 align:middle line:84%
So you were a supervisor, like
a supervisor at a construction

00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:25.750 align:middle line:90%
site is basically what you were.

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:27.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were with
me on "Beyond Belief"

00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:30.910 align:middle line:84%
some time ago what we
talked about time travel.

00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:33.332 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Sure.

00:28:33.332 --> 00:28:35.790 align:middle line:84%
>> But you said you can also
take people into their future.

00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:37.350 align:middle line:84%
You can take Michelle
into her future?

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:38.640 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: Michelle
can go into the future,

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:41.190 align:middle line:10%
and she can actually access
people from our future.

00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:42.960 align:middle line:10%
We call these time travelers.

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:44.575 align:middle line:10%
>> That'll be
interesting to see.

00:28:44.575 --> 00:28:46.408 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: Michelle,
I want you to focus in

00:28:46.408 --> 00:28:48.480 align:middle line:10%
on communicating,
establishing and recreating

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.190 align:middle line:10%
the communication with
the time traveler,

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:51.450 align:middle line:10%
like you had discussed before.

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:54.000 align:middle line:10%
Can you focus in
the time traveler?

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.180 align:middle line:10%
Can you focus in on
what century he is from?

00:28:57.180 --> 00:29:02.960 align:middle line:90%


00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:03.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: 30.

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:09.020 align:middle line:90%


00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:09.820 align:middle line:90%
35.

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:13.114 align:middle line:90%


00:29:13.114 --> 00:29:15.129 align:middle line:10%
I can't get the second number.

00:29:15.129 --> 00:29:17.170 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: So it looks
like it's a 36th century?

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:17.970 align:middle line:10%
>>MICHELLE: Yes.

00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:20.010 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: OK, very good.

00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:22.100 align:middle line:10%
Have you had much contact
with him over the years?

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:22.900 align:middle line:10%
>>MICHELLE: Yes.

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:24.608 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: And how
do you meet with him?

00:29:24.608 --> 00:29:25.770 align:middle line:10%
>>MICHELLE: In my dreams.

00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:26.686 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: All right.

00:29:26.686 --> 00:29:29.280 align:middle line:10%
And has he given you any
information about yourself

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:32.460 align:middle line:10%
or about the plan itself
that you can share

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:35.172 align:middle line:10%
from this man from the future?

00:29:35.172 --> 00:29:36.630 align:middle line:10%
>>MICHELLE: The
consciousness level

00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:41.130 align:middle line:10%
of the people of Mother
Earth is raising.

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:45.070 align:middle line:90%


00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:48.205 align:middle line:10%
There are some people
who will fight it,

00:29:48.205 --> 00:29:54.444 align:middle line:10%
but they're meant to be
there to create a balance.

00:29:54.444 --> 00:29:56.370 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: Now,
she's describing

00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:59.230 align:middle line:10%
this 36th-century time
traveler who's helping her

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:00.360 align:middle line:10%
in her own spiritual path.

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:01.735 align:middle line:10%
Which is what they
do, and I talk

00:30:01.735 --> 00:30:04.980 align:middle line:10%
about this in my "Time
Travelers From Our Future" book.

00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:06.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing work.

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:07.758 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Now,
what's interesting

00:30:07.758 --> 00:30:09.870 align:middle line:84%
about this
progression experience

00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:12.540 align:middle line:84%
is that this is a woman who
was contacted in her dreams.

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:15.090 align:middle line:84%
That's how time travelers
communicate with us.

00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:16.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a
research going on that

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:19.440 align:middle line:84%
shows that 80% of
scientific discoveries

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:22.590 align:middle line:84%
and artistic creations like
portraits and sculptures

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:24.630 align:middle line:84%
are done by artists
or scientists

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:26.460 align:middle line:90%
in their dream levels.

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:29.100 align:middle line:84%
So time travelers connect
with us in our dreams.

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:30.450 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is the 36th century.

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:32.670 align:middle line:84%
Time travelers then
come back in time

00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:35.970 align:middle line:84%
by using teleportation
to come back in time.

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:38.730 align:middle line:84%
In her future life, which I did
right after that experience was

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:42.510 align:middle line:84%
done, she's a 36th-century
spiritual psychologist

00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:44.730 align:middle line:84%
working with people
who are traveling,

00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:47.770 align:middle line:84%
like astronauts, to different
planets and helping them out.

00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:51.090 align:middle line:84%
So this is the 36th century,
a very important century.

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's also an
important century for you,

00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:56.860 align:middle line:84%
because your future life as
Xeor that we talked about

00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:58.710 align:middle line:90%
is in the 36th century.

00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:01.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you look
at the time travelers,

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:03.750 align:middle line:84%
have you ever
interviewed somebody

00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:08.760 align:middle line:84%
who has come back, where they're
a time traveler right now

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:09.734 align:middle line:90%
from the future?

00:31:09.734 --> 00:31:12.150 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, I've had one
of my patients, I told you,

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:16.350 align:middle line:84%
had a future life as a time
traveler in their future life.

00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:18.510 align:middle line:84%
I can't work with a time
traveler in my office

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:20.880 align:middle line:84%
today, because if a time
traveler came back--

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.310 align:middle line:84%
and they hang around
usually the fifth dimension.

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:25.710 align:middle line:84%
If they come back to the
Earth plane, the Men in Black,

00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:27.870 align:middle line:84%
and there are Men in
Black, they will kill them.

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:28.770 align:middle line:84%
Just like you won't
see an ET going--

00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:31.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They come back from
the future to get these people?

00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:33.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, no, there are
Men in Black in this century,

00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:35.610 align:middle line:84%
and there are Men in Black
in the future, and they know.

00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:36.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do they know?

00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:37.680 align:middle line:84%
How do they know
that they're back?

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:38.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well,
this is the thing.

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:40.560 align:middle line:84%
Their advanced technology, they
can tell when a Man in Black

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:41.400 align:middle line:90%
is here.

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:42.930 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of like
a coding system.

00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:45.300 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like you
put a chip in someone.

00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:47.560 align:middle line:84%
You know, like I have
a chip in my dog.

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:48.485 align:middle line:90%
Her name is Karma.

00:31:48.485 --> 00:31:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And if I ever lose her,
somebody could get the chip

00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:52.690 align:middle line:84%
and find out it's my dog
and get her back to me.

00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:53.410 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, that's
never happened.

00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:54.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't
like chips, though.

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:54.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: OK.

00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:56.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't, either, but
they can trace them.

00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:57.811 align:middle line:90%
They don't need chips for that.

00:31:57.811 --> 00:31:58.800 align:middle line:90%
They can trace them.

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:01.834 align:middle line:84%
They know when the time
traveler is on the Earth plane.

00:32:01.834 --> 00:32:03.500 align:middle line:84%
The reason why they
can hang around here

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:06.230 align:middle line:84%
is they can hang around
in the fifth dimension

00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:08.130 align:middle line:84%
where the Men in Black
can't touch them.

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:10.620 align:middle line:10%
So that's why they don't
like to materialize here

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:12.180 align:middle line:10%
unless they are safe.

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:14.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, in ancient times,
it was easier to do that.

00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:17.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do they kill
them, or why do they want to?

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:20.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Because
governments are very paranoid.

00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:23.202 align:middle line:84%
They don't like people knowing
about extraterrestrials.

00:32:23.202 --> 00:32:24.660 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we have
extraterrestrials

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:26.295 align:middle line:90%
go on TV every week?

00:32:26.295 --> 00:32:27.670 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we have
them at the UN?

00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:28.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, we should.

00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:29.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: We should, but if
they were there, believe me--

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:31.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We should have them on
my Coast to Coast radio show.

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:33.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: They would,
but they would be taken out

00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:34.440 align:middle line:90%
in the New York minute.

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:37.870 align:middle line:84%
And being from New York, I
can say that with expertise.

00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:38.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:40.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Because the
governments don't like it.

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:42.050 align:middle line:84%
The government,
American government--

00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:43.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm a patriotic
American, but one thing

00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:45.540 align:middle line:84%
I know about this
government, they will never

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:47.207 align:middle line:90%
admit to the presence of ETs.

00:32:47.207 --> 00:32:48.290 align:middle line:90%
Now, other governments do.

00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:48.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I agree with that.

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:50.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: South
America, Chile, Argentina,

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:51.390 align:middle line:90%
they admit to it, right?

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:52.680 align:middle line:90%
You see stories about them.

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:54.040 align:middle line:90%
Mexico does, too.

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:55.240 align:middle line:90%
But we don't.

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.030 align:middle line:90%
The deep state or the--

00:32:57.030 --> 00:32:59.614 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Even though things leak
out, we still don't admit it.

00:32:59.614 --> 00:33:01.613 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: You know what
I think the reason is?

00:33:01.613 --> 00:33:02.830 align:middle line:90%
I have a different reason.

00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:03.630 align:middle line:90%
You say paranoia.

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:05.040 align:middle line:84%
OK, governments are
always paranoid.

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:06.660 align:middle line:84%
I think the reason
is they don't want

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:09.390 align:middle line:84%
you to know that the
technology that we have today

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:11.880 align:middle line:84%
doesn't come from your
tax dollars or research.

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:14.380 align:middle line:84%
It comes from extraterrestrials
and time travelers.

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:16.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Interesting
take on that, Bruce.

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:18.300 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: I'm serious.

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you have
looked at time traveling,

00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:25.080 align:middle line:84%
there was a case once of a
time traveler who apparently

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:28.440 align:middle line:90%
stumbled back into--

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:33.390 align:middle line:84%
he came from the past, but he
jumped ahead into our future,

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:34.756 align:middle line:90%
and he got hit by a cab.

00:33:34.756 --> 00:33:35.880 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember that story?

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:36.280 align:middle line:90%
Did you ever hear?

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:38.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: You're talking about
the classic case of the man

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:40.120 align:middle line:90%
from 1880s in Kansas.

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:41.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:43.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: He has
dinner at a restaurant.

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:45.245 align:middle line:84%
He goes out for
his constitutional.

00:33:45.245 --> 00:33:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And then, next
thing, he winds up

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:49.860 align:middle line:84%
in New York City in
the 1950s, and he's

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:51.194 align:middle line:90%
dressed in an 1880s get-up.

00:33:51.194 --> 00:33:52.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:53.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: A cab hits
him and kills him.

00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:54.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Kills him.

00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:56.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Now, he teleported
from the past to the future.

00:33:56.850 --> 00:33:58.416 align:middle line:84%
The teleportation
didn't kill him.

00:33:58.416 --> 00:33:59.790 align:middle line:84%
The New York City
cab driver did.

00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:00.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The cab
driver killed him.

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:01.620 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And when
they investigated

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:03.870 align:middle line:84%
the guy, they find that he
was wearing his dreadlocks,

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:08.190 align:middle line:84%
you know, these long sideburns,
and the clothes was all 1880s.

00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:09.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No
identification, right?

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:10.648 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Oh, no, no.

00:34:10.648 --> 00:34:13.230 align:middle line:84%
They found a piece of
paper in his jacket,

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:15.929 align:middle line:84%
and it showed the receipt
of a livery stable

00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:17.769 align:middle line:90%
that he took his horse to.

00:34:17.769 --> 00:34:20.310 align:middle line:84%
They showed the receipt from
the restaurant he had dinner in,

00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:21.690 align:middle line:90%
and they gave him his ID.

00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And when they checked out
his ID from the 1880s,

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:27.900 align:middle line:84%
they found that the man did
exist, but he disappeared.

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:28.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my gosh.

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:31.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And they never
knew what happened to him.

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:32.670 align:middle line:84%
He just disappeared
into the vortex

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:34.199 align:middle line:90%
of the space-time continuum.

00:34:34.199 --> 00:34:36.540 align:middle line:84%
So that was a
documented case of a man

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:39.049 align:middle line:84%
who teleported
from 1880 to 1950.

00:34:39.049 --> 00:34:41.175 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did he stumble
into a portal or something?

00:34:41.175 --> 00:34:43.674 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: He went into a tear
in the fabric of space-time.

00:34:43.674 --> 00:34:45.179 align:middle line:90%
Let me show you how that works.

00:34:45.179 --> 00:34:46.820 align:middle line:84%
One of the ways
time travel is going

00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:49.110 align:middle line:84%
to be discovered,
in the 31st century,

00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:51.810 align:middle line:84%
a man named Taatos,
T double A T-O-S,

00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:54.400 align:middle line:84%
will be the first man
to discover time travel.

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And he creates a device
called the wormhole linear

00:34:57.990 --> 00:35:00.300 align:middle line:90%
accelerator, the WLA.

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And what that does is
it enlarges wormholes

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:06.534 align:middle line:84%
to classic size and allows
a man and a crew in a ship--

00:35:06.534 --> 00:35:07.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To just
go right through.

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:09.325 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: --to
go back in time.

00:35:09.325 --> 00:35:11.010 align:middle line:84%
The problem is when
you do that, you

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:13.060 align:middle line:84%
create a tear in the
fabric of space-time.

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:15.720 align:middle line:84%
So for 300 years,
until the 35th century,

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:18.360 align:middle line:84%
that's how time
travel is manifested.

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:21.420 align:middle line:84%
And there have been thousands
of time travelers coming back.

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:24.300 align:middle line:84%
So what this man did in
Kansas, he accidentally

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:26.320 align:middle line:84%
walked into one of those
tears in the fabric.

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.510 align:middle line:90%
You can't see that.

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:30.090 align:middle line:84%
He walked into a tear in
the fabric of space-time

00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:31.195 align:middle line:90%
and then was teleported.

00:35:31.195 --> 00:35:32.070 align:middle line:90%
There are many cases.

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:34.770 align:middle line:84%
The classic case that I describe
in my books about this guy

00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:37.740 align:middle line:84%
named Gil Perez
from Manila in 1593

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:41.370 align:middle line:84%
that teleported from Manila
to Mexico City wearing

00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:43.567 align:middle line:84%
a Spanish uniform
and a Spanish gun.

00:35:43.567 --> 00:35:44.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Incredible.

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:45.050 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Which was different.

00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:47.056 align:middle line:84%
Mexico had their own
uniforms and guns.

00:35:47.056 --> 00:35:48.180 align:middle line:90%
And they said, who are you?

00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:49.763 align:middle line:84%
He appears in the
middle of the plaza.

00:35:49.763 --> 00:35:52.360 align:middle line:10%
He says, my name is Gil
Perez, and the governor,

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:53.160 align:middle line:10%
he was killed.

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:54.090 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
what's going on.

00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:56.006 align:middle line:84%
I was one of the guards,
and I couldn't do it.

00:35:56.006 --> 00:35:58.920 align:middle line:84%
They interrogated him,
and they had an exorcism,

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.540 align:middle line:84%
so the Catholic
church got involved.

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:02.310 align:middle line:84%
They found that they said,
we're going to put you in jail.

00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:03.150 align:middle line:90%
You're crazy.

00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:05.483 align:middle line:84%
Two months later, the ship
comes from Manila-- remember,

00:36:05.483 --> 00:36:06.750 align:middle line:90%
Spain owned Manila--

00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:08.072 align:middle line:90%
to Mexico City.

00:36:08.072 --> 00:36:09.780 align:middle line:84%
And the crew goes out
there and they say,

00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:12.510 align:middle line:84%
we got this guy who
thinks he's crazy.

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:13.569 align:middle line:90%
Thinks he's from Manila.

00:36:13.569 --> 00:36:14.610 align:middle line:90%
He says, let me see them.

00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:16.230 align:middle line:90%
He says, yeah that's Gil Perez.

00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:17.700 align:middle line:90%
He's one of the guards.

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And the governor, Don
Gomez Dasmarinas ,

00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:23.680 align:middle line:84%
was actually murdered that day
he said he was, October 25,

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:24.790 align:middle line:90%
1593.

00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:27.170 align:middle line:84%
So this is a documented
case of teleportation.

00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:29.700 align:middle line:84%
Not only documented by the
police and the historians,

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:31.260 align:middle line:90%
but by the Catholic church.

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:32.530 align:middle line:90%
It's one of the classic cases.

00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:35.106 align:middle line:84%
But he went into a tear in
the fabric of space-time.

00:36:35.106 --> 00:36:37.230 align:middle line:84%
Didn't know what he was
doing, just walked into it.

00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:38.205 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just walked through.

00:36:38.205 --> 00:36:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: All of
a sudden, whoosh.

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And there were many
cases of teleportation.

00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:42.095 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I was
going to say, there are,

00:36:42.095 --> 00:36:46.350 align:middle line:84%
at any given time, every year,
100,000-plus cases of people

00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:48.420 align:middle line:90%
disappearing on this planet.

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:49.860 align:middle line:90%
I mean disappearing.

00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:51.430 align:middle line:90%
Bodies aren't found.

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:53.670 align:middle line:90%
You don't know where they are.

00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:55.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: England
and Argentina

00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:57.970 align:middle line:84%
are two places where there's
most of the teleportation

00:36:57.970 --> 00:36:58.770 align:middle line:90%
cases.

00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:02.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, most of the teleportation
cases, people will disappear,

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:03.004 align:middle line:90%
but they will reappear.

00:37:03.004 --> 00:37:05.170 align:middle line:84%
There are very few cases
where they don't come back.

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:06.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
have a recollection

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:07.080 align:middle line:90%
of what happened to them?

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:09.496 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, sometimes
they do, sometimes they don't.

00:37:09.496 --> 00:37:12.550 align:middle line:84%
There are classic cases
where they will say,

00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:14.250 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what's going on.

00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:16.990 align:middle line:84%
But they know who they are,
but they can't recall details

00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:17.790 align:middle line:90%
of where--

00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:18.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where they went.

00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:19.400 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: --where they went.

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:21.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how
much time they lost.

00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:25.170 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: What I've done in my
"Exploring the Fifth Dimension"

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:27.930 align:middle line:10%
book is I give a little
paragraph describing

00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:30.990 align:middle line:10%
the exact feeling that people
have when they teleport.

00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:33.900 align:middle line:84%
It's very technical, and it's
been reported by not just one

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:35.430 align:middle line:90%
person, by many people.

00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And I've done my
own teleportation.

00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:37.730 align:middle line:90%
Here's an example.

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:39.660 align:middle line:84%
I'll show you how I
practice what I preach.

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:41.300 align:middle line:84%
Back when I used to
live in Baltimore,

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:42.425 align:middle line:90%
it was the end of the year.

00:37:42.425 --> 00:37:44.340 align:middle line:90%
It was the end of December.

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:45.660 align:middle line:90%
And it was a cold winter's day.

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:47.802 align:middle line:84%
Baltimore is, you know,
it's not California.

00:37:47.802 --> 00:37:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And I just said,
you know, I really

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:51.120 align:middle line:84%
wish I was in
Montego Bay, Jamaica.

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:52.620 align:middle line:90%
It was my best vacation.

00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I
decide to use my techniques.

00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And I had my three
dogs at the time,

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:57.690 align:middle line:84%
and they would
just looking at me

00:37:57.690 --> 00:37:59.220 align:middle line:84%
like I'm dressed
in my bathing suit.

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:03.520 align:middle line:84%
I got my little Zories,
my little radio, my towel.

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And next thing I know, I'm
in Montego Bay, Jamaica.

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:08.490 align:middle line:90%
I spent the afternoon--

00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:09.815 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you there
physically or mentally?

00:38:09.815 --> 00:38:10.773 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Physically.

00:38:10.773 --> 00:38:11.580 align:middle line:90%
Now, I come back.

00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:13.210 align:middle line:84%
You say, well, that
was a dream, right?

00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:14.010 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:16.050 align:middle line:84%
Number one, my
bathing suit is wet.

00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:18.240 align:middle line:90%
I got sand in my sneakers.

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:20.220 align:middle line:90%
And I have a suntan.

00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:23.220 align:middle line:84%
Trust me, you don't get a suntan
in Baltimore on December 28th.

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:24.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:24.897 align:middle line:90%
Or in a dream.

00:38:24.897 --> 00:38:26.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well,
I've done everything

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:27.521 align:middle line:90%
you can do with hypnosis.

00:38:27.521 --> 00:38:29.230 align:middle line:84%
You can't give a
suggestion for a suntan.

00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:30.029 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:38:30.029 --> 00:38:31.886 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So that
was a teleportation.

00:38:31.886 --> 00:38:34.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, these people
who are disappearing off

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:36.490 align:middle line:90%
the planet--

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:37.890 align:middle line:84%
and many of them
don't come back.

00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:38.690 align:middle line:90%
Many of them.

00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:40.310 align:middle line:90%
They're just gone.

00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:42.170 align:middle line:84%
What's happening
to them right now?

00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:42.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: I think
it's an abduction.

00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:43.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where are they?

00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: I think
those are UFO abductions.

00:38:44.570 --> 00:38:45.903 align:middle line:90%
I think those are ET abductions.

00:38:45.903 --> 00:38:48.337 align:middle line:84%
Because in teleportation--
I've teleported myself.

00:38:48.337 --> 00:38:49.670 align:middle line:90%
I've trained people to teleport.

00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:50.586 align:middle line:90%
They always come back.

00:38:50.586 --> 00:38:52.920 align:middle line:84%
Nobody gets lost in the
space-time continuum.

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.420 align:middle line:84%
So when somebody
doesn't come back--

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:56.211 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not like
that "Twilight Zone"

00:38:56.211 --> 00:38:57.395 align:middle line:90%
episode, Little Girl Lost.

00:38:57.395 --> 00:38:57.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Yes, I remember.

00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:58.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Daddy, where are you?

00:38:58.930 --> 00:38:59.415 align:middle line:90%
Daddy?

00:38:59.415 --> 00:38:59.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: The fifth
dimension, right?

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:00.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She's in
this other dimension.

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:00.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: They
reach the arm in there

00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:01.340 align:middle line:90%
and they try and get her.

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:02.673 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To try to pull her out.

00:39:02.673 --> 00:39:05.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And she has
her dog in there, too.

00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:08.150 align:middle line:84%
Let's not forget, there
is approximately 8 million

00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:12.140 align:middle line:84%
Americans that have been
abducted over the years by ETs.

00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:13.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Never to
come back, right?

00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:14.710 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Right.

00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:15.714 align:middle line:90%
That's the problem.

00:39:15.714 --> 00:39:17.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, some of them
have come back.

00:39:17.130 --> 00:39:18.838 align:middle line:84%
But there have been
people who have lost.

00:39:18.838 --> 00:39:22.059 align:middle line:84%
So I think that because we know
about all the UFO abductions,

00:39:22.059 --> 00:39:23.850 align:middle line:84%
I think that those
would be UFO abductions.

00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:25.940 align:middle line:84%
But let me tell you
something about abductions.

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:28.775 align:middle line:84%
The month of the year that have
the most abductions reported

00:39:28.775 --> 00:39:30.260 align:middle line:90%
is July.

00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:33.320 align:middle line:84%
The day of the month is the
24th, and the day of the week

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:34.440 align:middle line:90%
is a Wednesday.

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:36.740 align:middle line:84%
So if there's ever a
Wednesday in July 24th, folks,

00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:39.680 align:middle line:84%
don't leave your home, because
you're likely to be abducted.

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:40.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Stay home.

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:41.570 align:middle line:90%
It's safer.

00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:43.310 align:middle line:90%
Parallel universes.

00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:44.672 align:middle line:90%
What exactly are they?

00:39:44.672 --> 00:39:46.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well,
we have universes

00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:48.800 align:middle line:84%
that are identical to the
one that we have right now.

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:51.440 align:middle line:84%
The difference is the
events are different.

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:54.600 align:middle line:84%
Like, for example, one of my
patients is a young teenager.

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:56.000 align:middle line:90%
Call her Tanya.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.812 align:middle line:90%
She's doing a research project.

00:39:57.812 --> 00:39:59.020 align:middle line:90%
You know, homework in school.

00:39:59.020 --> 00:39:59.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nice name, by the way.

00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:01.408 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And they're
studying the year

00:40:01.408 --> 00:40:04.077 align:middle line:84%
1968, a very volatile
year, politically, music.

00:40:04.077 --> 00:40:04.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, it was.

00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:05.840 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:06.798 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Everything.

00:40:06.798 --> 00:40:07.880 align:middle line:90%
OK, it was a great year.

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:09.610 align:middle line:84%
So she is doing
a research on it.

00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:13.739 align:middle line:84%
She figures, you know-- and
she got one of my CD programs

00:40:13.739 --> 00:40:16.280 align:middle line:84%
called the Custom Design Your
Own Destiny, which takes people

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:17.820 align:middle line:90%
into parallel universes, right?

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:18.620 align:middle line:90%
So she plays it.

00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:20.703 align:middle line:84%
She figures, I don't want
to do a lot of research.

00:40:20.703 --> 00:40:23.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to go there by
using Dr. Goldberg's tapes.

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:28.310 align:middle line:84%
So she winds up doing the tape,
and she winds up it's 1968.

00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And you know who's
elected president?

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:31.490 align:middle line:90%
Robert F. Kennedy.

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:33.740 align:middle line:84%
Not only was he
not assassinated.

00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:36.620 align:middle line:84%
He was elected president
in this parallel universe.

00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:37.530 align:middle line:90%
There was no Nixon.

00:40:37.530 --> 00:40:38.840 align:middle line:90%
There was no Watergate.

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:42.870 align:middle line:84%
The Soviet Union collapsed
in 1981 rather than '89.

00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And all these things
were different.

00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:45.870 align:middle line:90%
Now, she knew something's weird.

00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:48.650 align:middle line:84%
So now she comes back
from the experience,

00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:51.230 align:middle line:84%
and she goes down from her
bedroom to the kitchen.

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:53.420 align:middle line:84%
She wants to get something
to eat before dinner,

00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:54.474 align:middle line:90%
and the mother is there.

00:40:54.474 --> 00:40:56.390 align:middle line:84%
And she looks at her
mother and she's talking.

00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:58.520 align:middle line:84%
She goes, you know,
something's weird about this.

00:40:58.520 --> 00:40:59.400 align:middle line:90%
This is my mother.

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:00.700 align:middle line:90%
She looks like my mother, but--

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:02.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's not my mother.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.291 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: --this is not cool.

00:41:03.291 --> 00:41:05.002 align:middle line:84%
She was still in that
parallel universe.

00:41:05.002 --> 00:41:07.460 align:middle line:84%
So then she figures, I'm going
to go upstairs again and use

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:08.510 align:middle line:90%
the tapes again.

00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And then she goes back to the
current parallel universe,

00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:11.990 align:middle line:90%
the current universe.

00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:16.110 align:middle line:84%
So there's an example of a woman
who switched tracks, literally.

00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:17.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So there
are similarities

00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:21.059 align:middle line:84%
in these other universes,
but it's not quite the same?

00:41:21.059 --> 00:41:22.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, the
events are different.

00:41:22.850 --> 00:41:25.190 align:middle line:90%
Now, the environment's the same.

00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:29.420 align:middle line:84%
For example, back in 1994, when
I was working on my TV movie

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:32.090 align:middle line:84%
project, "The Search
for Grace," that movie

00:41:32.090 --> 00:41:34.250 align:middle line:84%
was not going to be
aired that year at all.

00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:36.950 align:middle line:84%
So I did a parallel
universe switch myself,

00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:40.340 align:middle line:84%
and I went into the universe
that not only did the movie

00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:43.310 align:middle line:84%
air, but I was to meet you and
all these other things going

00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:45.620 align:middle line:84%
on that happened over
the next 24 years.

00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:48.830 align:middle line:84%
So I'm an example of
switching parallel universes.

00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:49.966 align:middle line:90%
Perfectly safe.

00:41:49.966 --> 00:41:51.590 align:middle line:84%
And I do that with
patients who tell me

00:41:51.590 --> 00:41:53.930 align:middle line:84%
that they have a life where
their life is terrible.

00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:57.410 align:middle line:84%
They may have a criminal record
or incurable disease or history

00:41:57.410 --> 00:41:58.800 align:middle line:90%
that they can't change.

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:00.590 align:middle line:84%
So they figure their
life is like toast.

00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:01.190 align:middle line:90%
They don't want to do.

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:02.480 align:middle line:90%
They're suicidal sometimes.

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:04.700 align:middle line:84%
I say, look, don't
think of suicide.

00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:08.120 align:middle line:84%
How about switching
into a parallel universe

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:09.680 align:middle line:90%
where things are different?

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:10.910 align:middle line:90%
And they do.

00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And I have examples of that
that I've reported with you

00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:15.530 align:middle line:90%
on the radio many times.

00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:18.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Scientists have talked
about three different types

00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:19.550 align:middle line:90%
of parallel universes.

00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:21.730 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:42:21.730 --> 00:42:23.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Meet Max Tegmark.

00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:25.740 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to
parallel universes,

00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:29.044 align:middle line:84%
you could say Max
is pretty hardcore.

00:42:29.044 --> 00:42:30.960 align:middle line:10%
>>MAX TEGMARK: To me,
these parallel universes

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:35.970 align:middle line:10%
aren't just some cutesy
idea it's fun to chat about

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:37.440 align:middle line:10%
to provoke my colleagues.

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:40.380 align:middle line:84%
I really believe that
this is how reality works.

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:44.220 align:middle line:90%


00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:48.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Max and his fellow scientific
believers argue there are,

00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:52.247 align:middle line:84%
effectively, three different
types of parallel universe.

00:42:52.247 --> 00:42:57.390 align:middle line:90%


00:42:57.390 --> 00:43:00.900 align:middle line:84%
Some exist far beyond
the furthest edge

00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:02.400 align:middle line:90%
of our visible universe.

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:05.190 align:middle line:90%


00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:11.570 align:middle line:84%
Others hang out in a mysterious
landscape full of dark energy

00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:12.600 align:middle line:90%
called the multiverse.

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:20.270 align:middle line:90%


00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And others are right
here, in the same space

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:27.508 align:middle line:84%
we're all living, but we
can't see them, obviously.

00:43:27.508 --> 00:43:30.440 align:middle line:90%


00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:34.010 align:middle line:84%
It's thought we can't travel to
any of these other universes.

00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:36.500 align:middle line:90%


00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:37.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But we can, can't we?

00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:38.750 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Yes, we can.

00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:42.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, the technical aspect, they
call this the brane theory,

00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:45.650 align:middle line:90%
B-R-A-N-E, like membrane.

00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:47.800 align:middle line:84%
The closest sister
universe, by the way,

00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:52.030 align:middle line:84%
is less than a millimeter away,
which is like 1/27 of an inch.

00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:53.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's how
parallel they are.

00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:55.760 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: This is
reported in the August 2000

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:58.930 align:middle line:84%
issue of "Scientific American,"
a very technical magazine.

00:43:58.930 --> 00:44:00.490 align:middle line:90%
And they give you the research.

00:44:00.490 --> 00:44:03.100 align:middle line:84%
Their story for that
month, the topic story

00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:04.420 align:middle line:90%
was parallel universes.

00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:05.540 align:middle line:84%
But let me show you
what goes on here.

00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:08.123 align:middle line:84%
Parallel universes came out of
Einstein's theory of relativity

00:44:08.123 --> 00:44:09.130 align:middle line:90%
in 1905.

00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:10.870 align:middle line:90%
That was the special theory.

00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:13.300 align:middle line:10%
It also comes out of the
work of Hugh Everett, III

00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:16.150 align:middle line:10%
in Princeton University
in 1957, what he called

00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:17.740 align:middle line:10%
the many-worlds phenomena.

00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:20.350 align:middle line:10%
It's been challenged for
the last 60-some-odd years.

00:44:20.350 --> 00:44:21.940 align:middle line:10%
Nobody has ever disavowed it.

00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:23.740 align:middle line:90%
The mathematical models work.

00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:26.880 align:middle line:84%
If the math works in
science, it's real.

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:30.340 align:middle line:84%
So the point is is that they say
that there's an infinite number

00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:31.510 align:middle line:90%
of parallel universes.

00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:34.510 align:middle line:84%
Every time you have a thought,
you create a parallel universe

00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:35.750 align:middle line:90%
where something happens.

00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:39.520 align:middle line:84%
The question is what is the
logic or the possibility

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:41.590 align:middle line:90%
of that becoming relevant?

00:44:41.590 --> 00:44:44.800 align:middle line:84%
In my work, I'm focusing with
using hypnosis to lay out

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:46.660 align:middle line:90%
the five major groupings.

00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:49.450 align:middle line:84%
Each grouping has an
infinite number of subsets.

00:44:49.450 --> 00:44:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And letting them choose which
grouping they want to go to.

00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
I did, and that's

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:55.484 align:middle line:84%
what I do when I work
with my patients,

00:44:55.484 --> 00:44:58.840 align:middle line:84%
with Tanya, the one who
did the 1968 research.

00:44:58.840 --> 00:44:59.870 align:middle line:90%
Anyone can do it.

00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:02.110 align:middle line:90%
It's very simple, very safe.

00:45:02.110 --> 00:45:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And the question is, is
that it is scientifically

00:45:05.170 --> 00:45:06.512 align:middle line:90%
and realistically possible.

00:45:06.512 --> 00:45:08.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many parallel
universes are there?

00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:09.700 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Infinite number.

00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:10.501 align:middle line:90%
There's no limits.

00:45:10.501 --> 00:45:11.300 align:middle line:90%
Zero.

00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:12.130 align:middle line:90%
Just whatever.

00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:13.630 align:middle line:90%
Just infinity.

00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:14.560 align:middle line:90%
It's like pi.

00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:16.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: More than the three
that some scientists think?

00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:17.760 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Yeah, well, they're
talking about different groups.

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:18.980 align:middle line:84%
He's talking about
something different.

00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:19.710 align:middle line:84%
They're talking
about like if you

00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:20.920 align:middle line:84%
go to the far edge
of the universe,

00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:22.720 align:middle line:84%
there's another Earth
just like this one.

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:24.470 align:middle line:84%
But that's really not
a parallel universe,

00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:26.050 align:middle line:84%
because it's on
the same dimension.

00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:29.520 align:middle line:84%
So I have a different aspect to
it, where there are different--

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:31.280 align:middle line:84%
the brane theory is
much more relevant.

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:32.770 align:middle line:90%
I like that much better.

00:45:32.770 --> 00:45:36.190 align:middle line:84%
These branes, in other words, if
a brane was to connect with us,

00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:39.190 align:middle line:84%
we'd have like the
black hole or we'd

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:41.200 align:middle line:84%
have the equivalent of
the Big Bang Theory.

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the theories
as to how the Big Bang

00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:46.690 align:middle line:84%
Theory happened, the branes
connected and collided.

00:45:46.690 --> 00:45:48.970 align:middle line:84%
So the branes, the
B-R-A-N-E branes,

00:45:48.970 --> 00:45:50.620 align:middle line:90%
represent parallel universes.

00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:52.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are
there similarities

00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:54.260 align:middle line:90%
in these parallel universes?

00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:55.060 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there's--

00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:56.225 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, we
have physical laws.

00:45:56.225 --> 00:45:56.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --a you, there's a me.

00:45:56.890 --> 00:45:58.330 align:middle line:90%
We may have a role reversal.

00:45:58.330 --> 00:45:59.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: If we're dealing
with the Earth plane,

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:00.730 align:middle line:84%
we're not talking about
the fifth dimension

00:46:00.730 --> 00:46:02.260 align:middle line:90%
or the astral plane yet.

00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:04.400 align:middle line:84%
On the Earth plane,
we have physical laws.

00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:06.280 align:middle line:84%
So the physical laws,
we just can't get up

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:08.520 align:middle line:84%
there and teleport
and just dematerialize

00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:10.180 align:middle line:84%
right now, unless
you walk into a tear

00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:11.750 align:middle line:90%
in the fabric of space-time.

00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:14.470 align:middle line:84%
So these parallel universes
have to be organized and have

00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:17.770 align:middle line:90%
to follow the laws of physics.

00:46:17.770 --> 00:46:20.890 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they are
similar in their environment

00:46:20.890 --> 00:46:24.400 align:middle line:84%
but different in the
options, your potential.

00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:26.200 align:middle line:84%
You could have
been a construction

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:28.400 align:middle line:90%
worker in a parallel universe.

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:30.280 align:middle line:84%
Or you could have
been a surgeon.

00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:32.044 align:middle line:84%
You can have
different occupations,

00:46:32.044 --> 00:46:33.460 align:middle line:84%
but you're going
to look the same.

00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:35.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you die
in those universes?

00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:35.770 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Oh, yeah.

00:46:35.770 --> 00:46:36.190 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:36.630 align:middle line:90%
Sure you do.

00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:37.713 align:middle line:90%
At different ages, though.

00:46:37.713 --> 00:46:42.220 align:middle line:84%
You may live to be 90 in
one and 45 in another.

00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:46.210 align:middle line:84%
So the universe has different
events and different options

00:46:46.210 --> 00:46:48.012 align:middle line:90%
to you.

00:46:48.012 --> 00:46:49.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Everything
you've studied,

00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:51.310 align:middle line:84%
Bruce, everything
you've studied,

00:46:51.310 --> 00:46:53.062 align:middle line:84%
what has fascinated
you the most?

00:46:53.062 --> 00:46:54.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well,
what's fascinated

00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:56.740 align:middle line:84%
me is the point of
empowerment, is that we

00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:58.020 align:middle line:90%
are in charge of our destiny.

00:46:58.020 --> 00:47:00.940 align:middle line:84%
You see, I use the term when
I use-- like one of my books

00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:02.770 align:middle line:84%
is called "Custom Design
Your Own Destiny."

00:47:02.770 --> 00:47:05.200 align:middle line:84%
It's not called custom
design your own fate,

00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:06.910 align:middle line:84%
because fate is
predestination, which

00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:08.170 align:middle line:90%
I have real problems with.

00:47:08.170 --> 00:47:10.840 align:middle line:84%
To me, I like the concept
that everybody out

00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:14.440 align:middle line:84%
there has maximum potential if
they access their higher self.

00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:16.130 align:middle line:84%
You can take charge
of your life.

00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:17.800 align:middle line:84%
You can be
psychically empowered.

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:21.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't really care what the
other aspects of your life are.

00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:25.140 align:middle line:10%
Relationships, jobs, whatever it
is, you can take charge of it.

00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:27.070 align:middle line:84%
You can always get
off your keister

00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:30.670 align:middle line:84%
and do something as long as you
connect with your higher self.

00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And remember, the one
point of this is critical.

00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:35.560 align:middle line:84%
If you want to grow
spiritually, there's

00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:37.160 align:middle line:90%
one thing you have to do.

00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:38.260 align:middle line:90%
Get rid of fear.

00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:41.170 align:middle line:84%
Fear is the only thing that
keeps us in the karmic cycle.

00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:42.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Constantly do.

00:47:42.250 --> 00:47:43.280 align:middle line:90%
It keeps us down.

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:44.821 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And what
does society do?

00:47:44.821 --> 00:47:47.080 align:middle line:84%
Society generates
fear, doesn't it?

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:48.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It wants
you to be afraid.

00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:50.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Because it
wants you to be codependent.

00:47:50.290 --> 00:47:51.090 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:55.030 align:middle line:10%
My point is empowerment is
the opposite of codependency.

00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:58.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever regressed
somebody and heard things

00:47:58.180 --> 00:48:00.670 align:middle line:90%
that you wish you didn't hear?

00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:04.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, I've regressed
relationships, like a couple,

00:48:04.450 --> 00:48:07.120 align:middle line:84%
and I regressed
them individually.

00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And I say, look,
this is something

00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:11.080 align:middle line:84%
I would rather you not
share with your spouse,

00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:13.640 align:middle line:84%
because it's not going to
help your relationship.

00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:16.600 align:middle line:84%
In other words, some
spouse in a past life

00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:18.771 align:middle line:84%
killed, murdered, or
abandoned their spouse now.

00:48:18.771 --> 00:48:21.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't think you'd
want to know that, right.

00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:22.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So I say,
look, it's confidential.

00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:24.220 align:middle line:84%
When I see them, it's
always confidential.

00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:25.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
share it, but I said,

00:48:25.570 --> 00:48:27.339 align:middle line:84%
this is not something
you want to share,

00:48:27.339 --> 00:48:29.380 align:middle line:84%
because it's not going to
help your relationship.

00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:33.130 align:middle line:84%
Which is why I don't like to do
a lot of past life regressions.

00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:34.890 align:middle line:84%
I'd much rather do the
superconscious mind

00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:37.920 align:middle line:84%
tap, because going
back in time is never

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:39.210 align:middle line:90%
going to help you grow.

00:48:39.210 --> 00:48:41.760 align:middle line:84%
What's going to help you grow
is accessing your higher self

00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:43.420 align:middle line:90%
and looking towards the future.

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:44.640 align:middle line:90%
The past is history.

00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:47.099 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever done a
couple of people at one time?

00:48:47.099 --> 00:48:49.765 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: I've done workshops,
of course, where I've regressed

00:48:49.765 --> 00:48:51.360 align:middle line:90%
hundreds of people at one time.

00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And then what it's
interesting is that they

00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:56.050 align:middle line:90%
tell me certain stories that--

00:48:56.050 --> 00:48:56.850 align:middle line:90%
here's an example.

00:48:56.850 --> 00:48:58.590 align:middle line:84%
We call this Whatley's
law of evidence.

00:48:58.590 --> 00:49:00.810 align:middle line:84%
How do I know my work with the
time travelers in the future

00:49:00.810 --> 00:49:01.690 align:middle line:90%
was relevant?

00:49:01.690 --> 00:49:03.930 align:middle line:84%
How do I know it isn't
just confabulations, just

00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:05.232 align:middle line:90%
people making it up?

00:49:05.232 --> 00:49:07.190 align:middle line:84%
Whatley's law of evidence,
in science, is this.

00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:08.820 align:middle line:84%
It's like
circumstantial evidence.

00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:11.190 align:middle line:84%
If people from all
over the world that

00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:15.060 align:middle line:84%
have no communication with each
other tell you the same thing,

00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:16.084 align:middle line:90%
it must be true.

00:49:16.084 --> 00:49:17.250 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I'm getting.

00:49:17.250 --> 00:49:21.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting corroboration from
people, in group workshops,

00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:22.680 align:middle line:84%
as well as mostly
individually is

00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:25.140 align:middle line:84%
much better from a
scientific point of view.

00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:27.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, when you
regressed me a few minutes ago,

00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:31.140 align:middle line:84%
how do I know it wasn't
part of my vivid imagination

00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:33.420 align:middle line:84%
that was coming up through
that in that kind of state

00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:34.380 align:middle line:84%
I was in, as opposed to
what really happened?

00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:35.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, think
of the logic behind it.

00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:37.350 align:middle line:84%
Most people, they went
back to ancient Egypt,

00:49:37.350 --> 00:49:39.599 align:middle line:84%
and they're watching the
construction of the pyramids,

00:49:39.599 --> 00:49:41.370 align:middle line:84%
they wouldn't see
crafts doing it.

00:49:41.370 --> 00:49:43.400 align:middle line:84%
They would go with a more
conventional approach.

00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:45.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I basically
backed up what you've seen.

00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:46.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well,
right, but my point

00:49:46.830 --> 00:49:48.930 align:middle line:84%
is you don't know about my
work in the detail that I do.

00:49:48.930 --> 00:49:50.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, I don't know that.

00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:51.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: You don't know
about anti-gravity flying

00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:53.480 align:middle line:84%
crafts or the things
like that and why

00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:54.870 align:middle line:90%
I documented that in my books.

00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:56.940 align:middle line:84%
But my point is that
you're coming up

00:49:56.940 --> 00:50:01.870 align:middle line:84%
with things that are not logical
or statistically significant.

00:50:01.870 --> 00:50:04.570 align:middle line:84%
The average person going back
in ancient Egypt, you can say,

00:50:04.570 --> 00:50:06.990 align:middle line:84%
well, they would be
by the pyramids, fine,

00:50:06.990 --> 00:50:09.180 align:middle line:84%
but they wouldn't have
crafts doing this.

00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:12.510 align:middle line:84%
They would have pulleys and more
conventional ways in which we

00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:15.420 align:middle line:84%
think the pyramids were
constructed, by the more

00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:16.620 align:middle line:90%
conventional approach.

00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:19.260 align:middle line:84%
So you're doing something that
not only is not conventional,

00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:21.210 align:middle line:84%
but it marries into
my research, which

00:50:21.210 --> 00:50:24.307 align:middle line:84%
makes it very credible
from my point of view.

00:50:24.307 --> 00:50:25.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know,
what I'd like to do

00:50:25.890 --> 00:50:28.570 align:middle line:84%
is have you take
me into the future.

00:50:28.570 --> 00:50:29.370 align:middle line:90%
Can you do that?

00:50:29.370 --> 00:50:29.640 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Sure.

00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Just close your eyes, and
just take a nice deep breath

00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:32.760 align:middle line:90%
and relax.

00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:35.075 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to count
forwards from 1 to 10.

00:50:35.075 --> 00:50:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And when I reach
the count of 10,

00:50:36.450 --> 00:50:39.780 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be now focusing
in on a future life that

00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:42.810 align:middle line:84%
will help you to learn about
your own karmic purpose.

00:50:42.810 --> 00:50:45.030 align:middle line:90%
One, moving forward in time.

00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:50.090 align:middle line:84%
Two, three, four, number
five, halfway there.

00:50:50.090 --> 00:50:52.030 align:middle line:90%
Always safe and protected.

00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:54.790 align:middle line:90%
Number six, number seven.

00:50:54.790 --> 00:50:57.570 align:middle line:84%
Opening up a door with a
bright white light above it,

00:50:57.570 --> 00:51:00.140 align:middle line:84%
giving you all the information
from this future life.

00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:02.200 align:middle line:90%
Number eight, number nine.

00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:03.400 align:middle line:90%
You are there.

00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:05.720 align:middle line:90%
Number 10.

00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:09.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, tell me the first thought
that comes into your mind.

00:51:09.850 --> 00:51:16.019 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I actually see
crumbling cities, Bruce.

00:51:16.019 --> 00:51:17.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: By the
way you keep time,

00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:19.920 align:middle line:90%
what year would you say this is?

00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:24.730 align:middle line:90%


00:51:24.730 --> 00:51:27.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 2200, 2300.

00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:29.304 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:51:29.304 --> 00:51:30.470 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: OK, that's fine.

00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And would you say
yourself, would you

00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:34.090 align:middle line:90%
say you're a male or a female?

00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:36.680 align:middle line:90%
How would you describe yourself?

00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:37.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I can't tell.

00:51:37.950 --> 00:51:38.750 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: OK.

00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:40.700 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything
about you personally

00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:43.080 align:middle line:84%
that your relationship
to this society?

00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:45.650 align:middle line:84%
In other words, your
occupation, your family life?

00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:49.660 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything about
you that you can identify?

00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:53.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm in a uniform,
and I'm wearing a hat.

00:51:53.360 --> 00:52:00.040 align:middle line:84%
It's not quite a police officer,
but it's somebody in authority,

00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:03.760 align:middle line:84%
trying to direct people
who seem to be panicking.

00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:06.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So you're trying to
help this cataclysm or whatever

00:52:06.830 --> 00:52:07.630 align:middle line:90%
is going on?

00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:08.860 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:10.700 align:middle line:84%
How do you describe--
what is your name?

00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:11.908 align:middle line:90%
How do you describe yourself?

00:52:11.908 --> 00:52:14.160 align:middle line:90%
What do people call you?

00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:16.562 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have a
name tag on my shirt.

00:52:16.562 --> 00:52:18.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: See if
you can read it.

00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:20.960 align:middle line:90%


00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:22.601 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Abrams
is the last name.

00:52:22.601 --> 00:52:24.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Now,
what is the cause--

00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:25.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I have no idea why.

00:52:25.070 --> 00:52:27.361 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: This cataclysm
or this crumbling of cities,

00:52:27.361 --> 00:52:29.683 align:middle line:84%
do you have any idea of
what caused this problem?

00:52:29.683 --> 00:52:33.070 align:middle line:90%


00:52:33.070 --> 00:52:35.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Some kind of weapon.

00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:38.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Is it just
one city that's involved?

00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:41.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm only in one
city, so I don't know.

00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:44.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And what are
your orders now at this time?

00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:46.515 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Keep the peace.

00:52:46.515 --> 00:52:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And so what
are the people doing,

00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:52.050 align:middle line:84%
or how are you dealing
with the correction of this

00:52:52.050 --> 00:52:54.020 align:middle line:90%
or the population in the city?

00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:57.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're all over the
streets screaming, yelling.

00:52:57.120 --> 00:53:00.340 align:middle line:90%


00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:03.840 align:middle line:90%
The cars look like--

00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:06.870 align:middle line:90%
very futuristic.

00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:09.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: The weapon
that caused this, now,

00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:11.976 align:middle line:84%
could you describe the weapon
that caused this catastrophe?

00:53:11.976 --> 00:53:15.720 align:middle line:90%


00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:20.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're beams
that are coming from space.

00:53:20.190 --> 00:53:23.040 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Is there a
ship involved at all?

00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:24.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All I can
see is the beams

00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:26.937 align:middle line:90%
coming through the clouds.

00:53:26.937 --> 00:53:28.020 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: OK, very good.

00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:28.990 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:53:28.990 --> 00:53:33.280 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to focus in
on this name tag Abrams.

00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:35.250 align:middle line:84%
So let's assume
that's your last name.

00:53:35.250 --> 00:53:37.920 align:middle line:84%
I want you to focus in on
this and this environment.

00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:40.140 align:middle line:84%
You'll be able to
go back to this

00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:43.320 align:middle line:84%
or go forward to this in
the future to explore this

00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:46.440 align:middle line:84%
and to connect with
this and to always

00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:49.120 align:middle line:84%
be able to learn from this
from your own perspective

00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:51.149 align:middle line:84%
and your own karmic
purpose and growth.

00:53:51.149 --> 00:53:53.190 align:middle line:84%
So, I'm going to count
forwards from one to five.

00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:54.810 align:middle line:84%
When I reach the
count of five, you'll

00:53:54.810 --> 00:53:57.210 align:middle line:84%
return all thoughts to the
current as George Noory,

00:53:57.210 --> 00:53:59.610 align:middle line:84%
having complete
knowledge and awareness.

00:53:59.610 --> 00:54:02.340 align:middle line:84%
Number one, moving
back to Earth here.

00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:03.980 align:middle line:90%
Two, back to the present.

00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:05.430 align:middle line:90%
Three, halfway there.

00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:07.320 align:middle line:90%
Four, almost there.

00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:12.630 align:middle line:84%
Number five, awaken,
wide awake and refreshed.

00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Whatever I
saw was frightening.

00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:18.140 align:middle line:84%
Something had
happened to a city.

00:54:18.140 --> 00:54:21.590 align:middle line:84%
I assume I was in
the United States.

00:54:21.590 --> 00:54:23.150 align:middle line:90%
Was that truly the future?

00:54:23.150 --> 00:54:24.980 align:middle line:90%
Was I in a parallel universe?

00:54:24.980 --> 00:54:26.060 align:middle line:90%
Where was I?

00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:29.090 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: That was one future,
not necessarily the future

00:54:29.090 --> 00:54:30.560 align:middle line:10%
that we're on even right now.

00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:33.390 align:middle line:10%
For example, I've done
thousands of progressions,

00:54:33.390 --> 00:54:37.430 align:middle line:10%
and when I go into the
23rd or 22nd, 23rd century,

00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:40.091 align:middle line:10%
none of my patients ever report
these kinds of catastrophes.

00:54:40.091 --> 00:54:41.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, that doesn't mean
that there couldn't

00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:44.540 align:middle line:84%
have been some
anomaly that happened,

00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:49.610 align:middle line:84%
but this wouldn't be a worldwide
cataclysm or some ET domination

00:54:49.610 --> 00:54:50.870 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:52.650 align:middle line:84%
There are times when
they can test weapons

00:54:52.650 --> 00:54:53.910 align:middle line:90%
and there can be problems.

00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:56.690 align:middle line:84%
But what I get in the
future, as my work goes on,

00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:58.550 align:middle line:84%
is beyond this
century now, we're

00:54:58.550 --> 00:55:00.750 align:middle line:84%
going to have the usual
issues of terrorism

00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:04.090 align:middle line:84%
and maniacs and people doing
stupid things, as they do.

00:55:04.090 --> 00:55:06.320 align:middle line:84%
But into the 22nd
century and beyond, it's

00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:08.070 align:middle line:90%
a much more positive future.

00:55:08.070 --> 00:55:12.710 align:middle line:84%
But even considering
this, this is a option.

00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:14.510 align:middle line:90%
This is one parallel universe.

00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:16.940 align:middle line:84%
And I suspect that
what you were viewing

00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:20.000 align:middle line:84%
was a parallel universe,
because my patients

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.610 align:middle line:84%
from this current universe
don't get that from the universe

00:55:22.610 --> 00:55:23.840 align:middle line:90%
that we're on now.

00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:25.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Parallel universe
and a parallel life,

00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:26.990 align:middle line:90%
are two different things?

00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:27.290 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Yes.

00:55:27.290 --> 00:55:28.610 align:middle line:90%
Here's a parallel life.

00:55:28.610 --> 00:55:30.650 align:middle line:84%
The soul that you have
right now can occupy

00:55:30.650 --> 00:55:32.854 align:middle line:90%
more than one body at one time.

00:55:32.854 --> 00:55:34.520 align:middle line:84%
So years ago, I worked
with a gentleman,

00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:36.500 align:middle line:84%
he was a salesman
from Baltimore.

00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And he used to go to Cleveland,
Ohio, on his sales routines,

00:55:39.690 --> 00:55:41.370 align:middle line:90%
but he never went north of that.

00:55:41.370 --> 00:55:43.100 align:middle line:84%
So when I did a
experience, he wanted

00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:44.630 align:middle line:84%
to go into a past
life regression.

00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:46.320 align:middle line:84%
I assumed that was
what I was doing.

00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:55.580 align:middle line:84%
He winds up he's in Cincinnati,
Ohio, and he's a woman.

00:55:55.580 --> 00:55:57.530 align:middle line:90%
And he says, what's going on?

00:55:57.530 --> 00:56:00.020 align:middle line:90%
Current, same frame.

00:56:00.020 --> 00:56:02.960 align:middle line:84%
So I said, look, you've got
the woman's name and number.

00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:04.730 align:middle line:90%
Look her up.

00:56:04.730 --> 00:56:08.720 align:middle line:84%
So when he next went to Ohio for
his next trip, he looks her up.

00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:10.520 align:middle line:90%
He talks her into meeting.

00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:11.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For real?

00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:13.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: He met
her for coffee.

00:56:13.070 --> 00:56:15.697 align:middle line:84%
And he said it was the weirdest
experience in his life.

00:56:15.697 --> 00:56:17.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was looking at himself?

00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:19.571 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Because they both
had the exact same personality.

00:56:19.571 --> 00:56:22.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a different sex,
a different genetic code.

00:56:22.070 --> 00:56:23.910 align:middle line:90%
That's called a parallel self.

00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:26.270 align:middle line:84%
A parallel life is
when like Tanya,

00:56:26.270 --> 00:56:27.770 align:middle line:84%
when she went into
the parallel life

00:56:27.770 --> 00:56:31.430 align:middle line:84%
to perceive the 1968 routine,
or you in experiencing

00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:34.100 align:middle line:84%
this future in the
22nd or 23rd century

00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:36.350 align:middle line:84%
when you saw the
catastrophe, or me

00:56:36.350 --> 00:56:38.990 align:middle line:84%
going into this parallel
universe where my movie airs

00:56:38.990 --> 00:56:40.880 align:middle line:84%
where it didn't in
the universe I left.

00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:44.134 align:middle line:84%
That's a parallel life
rather than a parallel self.

00:56:44.134 --> 00:56:45.050 align:middle line:90%
That's the difference.

00:56:45.050 --> 00:56:47.258 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People who want to
get a hold of you, Bruce,

00:56:47.258 --> 00:56:48.470 align:middle line:90%
how do they find you?

00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: They can contact
me at my website, www.dr--

00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:54.530 align:middle line:90%
for doctor-- brucegoldberg.com.

00:56:54.530 --> 00:56:58.910 align:middle line:84%
They can call me at my
1-800-KARMA4U which is

00:56:58.910 --> 00:57:02.200 align:middle line:90%
1-800-527-6248 number.

00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:04.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Write
down those numbers.

00:57:04.970 --> 00:57:07.160 align:middle line:84%
In our parting ways
here, what advice

00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:12.100 align:middle line:84%
would you give people
who really have problems

00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:14.500 align:middle line:84%
in this life that
could be affected

00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:15.792 align:middle line:90%
because of past or future ones?

00:57:15.792 --> 00:57:17.958 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, obviously,
connect to higher self.

00:57:17.958 --> 00:57:20.200 align:middle line:84%
If they want to work with
me, most of my sessions

00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:22.540 align:middle line:84%

They don't have to come
to Los Angeles to meet me.

But I would suspect they
lose the negativity,

00:57:28.450 --> 00:57:30.070 align:middle line:90%
connect with the higher self.

00:57:30.070 --> 00:57:32.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm like what I call
a realistic idealist.

00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:35.230 align:middle line:84%
I have idealistic tendencies,
but I'm a realist.

00:57:35.230 --> 00:57:37.300 align:middle line:10%
But I always connect
with my higher self,

00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:40.190 align:middle line:10%
and I always keep a
positive attitude.

00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:41.920 align:middle line:84%
I believe in
innocent until proven

00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:43.780 align:middle line:84%
guilty, not the
other way around.

>>NOORY: Looking back in the
past how the pyramids might

00:57:49.990 --> 00:57:53.500 align:middle line:10%
have been constructed with
crafts moving these huge blocks

00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:55.150 align:middle line:10%
was pretty fascinating.

00:57:55.150 --> 00:57:59.440 align:middle line:84%
Looking into the future, seeing
the devastation of a city,

00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:00.910 align:middle line:90%
was not.

00:58:00.910 --> 00:58:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And I hope I'm
wrong on that one.

00:58:03.010 --> 00:58:05.350 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
us on "Beyond Belief."
