little kid, I just knew things.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.309 align:middle line:90%
I traveled in other worlds.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:17.407 align:middle line:90%
I would talk to spirits.

>>GEORGE NOORY: What is a spell?

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: A spell is I'm going
to take this and shift this.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.180 align:middle line:90%
I want a love spell.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.470 align:middle line:90%
I want a money spell.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:25.595 align:middle line:90%
I want a health spell.

00:00:25.595 --> 00:00:27.470 align:middle line:84%
You have to believe,
you have to take action,

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.045 align:middle line:84%
and then that spirit
is the battery power

00:00:30.045 --> 00:00:30.920 align:middle line:90%
that makes it happen.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And you're building
it, building it,

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.340 align:middle line:84%
and you send it up
to the universe.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.465 align:middle line:90%

[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:37.964 --> 00:00:40.530 align:middle line:90%


00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, welcome to this
edition of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.980 align:middle line:10%
We've got a great guest for you.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.130 align:middle line:10%
Patti Negri is an American
psychic, a medium,

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.670 align:middle line:10%
a television personality,
and a very published author.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And what we're going to talk
about on "Beyond Belief" today

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.690 align:middle line:90%
will blow your mind.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.200 align:middle line:90%
Patti, welcome to the program.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: Thank you
so much, George.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.412 align:middle line:90%
I am thrilled to be here.

00:00:58.412 --> 00:01:00.673 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in being a psychic?

00:01:00.673 --> 00:01:01.840 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen for you?

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: I think I was
just born this way.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.590 align:middle line:84%
When I was a little
kid, I just knew things.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.290 align:middle line:10%
I traveled in other worlds.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.940 align:middle line:10%
I would talk to spirits.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.847 align:middle line:84%
And it was never
taught out of me.

00:01:13.847 --> 00:01:15.930 align:middle line:84%
My mom was just like, yeah,
grandma did that, too.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.430 align:middle line:84%
So it was never,
like, weird or evil.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's genetic, huh?

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: It's genetic.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.880 align:middle line:90%
It's genetic.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.080 align:middle line:84%
I think it's kind of
genetic on both sides.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.140 align:middle line:84%
So that psychic part
was just a knowing.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.630 align:middle line:10%
The medium part was I was
talking to dead people

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.010 align:middle line:10%
since that same age.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.010 align:middle line:10%
And even the witchey part
was I would find myself

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.850 align:middle line:10%
in the backyard, knowing if
I put the mint from my mom's

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.700 align:middle line:10%
garden in her purse,
she'd have more money.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.700 align:middle line:90%
It's just kind of this--

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it worked, huh?

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: It worked.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mint, huh?

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Mint.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't have to
have any on you, do you?

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Sure I do.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.960 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'll get that later.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.650 align:middle line:84%
What did your friends
say about this?

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: Well, I was actually
really shy when I was a kid,

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.310 align:middle line:84%
which people who
know me as an adult--

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.643 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You had friends, right?

00:01:51.643 --> 00:01:53.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: I did have friends.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.220 align:middle line:84%
I think-- well, my first
friend-- my first seance,

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.420 align:middle line:90%
I was seven or eight.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And I was always kind of
obsessed with the dead,

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.700 align:middle line:84%
but not in a scary
or morbid way.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.840 align:middle line:90%
Just I talked to them.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.410 align:middle line:84%
So my first-- my best friend
from birth was Sherry Jones.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.900 align:middle line:84%
So we went in the hallway,
and we closed all the doors.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.250 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know dead people.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.570 align:middle line:84%
So I called in Marilyn Monroe
and John Kennedy, anybody--

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.432 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really--

00:02:16.432 --> 00:02:18.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: That a little
seven- or eight-year-old

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.440 align:middle line:90%
knows in the late '60s.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you connected?

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Oh my god.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.887 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't know that
I connected with them.

00:02:22.887 --> 00:02:25.080 align:middle line:84%
But my windowless,
lightless hall

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.030 align:middle line:90%
filled with orbs and shadows.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.620 align:middle line:84%
They were flying
through this room.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.940 align:middle line:84%
So Sherry and I jumped up, ran
out of the house screaming.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.100 align:middle line:84%
But I was jumping up and
down going, oh my gosh.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.320 align:middle line:10%
It's real, and
it's controllable.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.217 align:middle line:84%
It was my first time actually
really lifting the veil.

00:02:40.217 --> 00:02:41.550 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't so good at shutting it.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:42.510 align:middle line:90%
I ran out the door.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.350 align:middle line:90%
But yeah.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
techniques do you use

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.590 align:middle line:90%
to connect with the other side?

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: I use--

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.040 align:middle line:90%
I think it's a big combination.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.970 align:middle line:84%
Because I've always
been doing it--

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:51.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or does it just happen?

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:52.822 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: It just happens.

00:02:52.822 --> 00:02:55.425 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have a complete
on/off switch,

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:56.800 align:middle line:84%
because the more
you get into it,

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be
at the grocery store

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.990 align:middle line:84%
like, your dead mother
wants to talk to you.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.730 align:middle line:90%
I have an on and off switch.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And when you kind
of create that,

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.940 align:middle line:90%
it makes both sides stronger.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.130 align:middle line:84%
I can go through the day
being regular and then,

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.690 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's talk to spirits.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.130 align:middle line:90%
Let's look into the future.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.020 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk to
elementals and things.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.450 align:middle line:84%
I think because I did it
before I learned about it,

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.110 align:middle line:84%
I don't go, oh, that's
clairaudience, clairsentience,

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.970 align:middle line:90%
clairvoyance, claircognizance.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.070 align:middle line:84%
It just kind of
mushes in together.

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.540 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, here
are the spirits.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.810 align:middle line:90%
We talk to them.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But when
you connect, Patti,

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.770 align:middle line:84%
how do you know
you've connected?

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.810 align:middle line:10%
>>NEGRI: It is kind
of otherworldly.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:32.610 align:middle line:90%
Again, once--

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:33.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You just know?

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.733 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: You just know, because
there's somebody there talking

00:03:35.733 --> 00:03:37.470 align:middle line:84%
to you or because
you just start seeing

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.040 align:middle line:84%
a story, seeing a future,
seeing, smelling, tasting.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.450 align:middle line:84%
All the senses squish in because
I don't separate them so much.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.410 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if I'm
OK, your Uncle Fred

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.850 align:middle line:90%
wants to talk to you.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sitting--

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to use
my left brain to go,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.010 align:middle line:84%
am I seeing him on my
outside of my head?

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.990 align:middle line:84%
Or am I seeing on my
inside of my head?

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.000 align:middle line:84%
I try not to delineate,
because I really

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.210 align:middle line:84%
try to shut down that left
logical brain and just allow.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had heard that
when you open up this portal

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.390 align:middle line:84%
to let these entities
through, anything

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.038 align:middle line:90%
can come through, good or bad.

00:04:12.038 --> 00:04:13.080 align:middle line:90%
Has that happened to you?

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.372 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: It has happened to me.

00:04:14.372 --> 00:04:18.300 align:middle line:84%
But I learned really early
on that we can control that.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:22.170 align:middle line:84%
I firmly believe that this
is our realm of existence,

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.350 align:middle line:84%
that the other side, whatever
it is-- good, bad, elemental,

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.990 align:middle line:90%
spirits, beings of all sorts--

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.167 align:middle line:90%
that this is our realm.

00:04:29.167 --> 00:04:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And because I've
always believed that,

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.440 align:middle line:90%
it's pretty much been true.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.060 align:middle line:84%
But I do think you have
to say who you allow in.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.290 align:middle line:90%
It's not that crazy.

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.085 align:middle line:84%
It's like you
don't let any-- you

00:04:39.085 --> 00:04:40.710 align:middle line:84%
don't open the front
door of your house

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.930 align:middle line:84%
and let anybody in, the
serial killer next door.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:43.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You better not.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY AND NEGRI:
You better not.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.548 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: So the same thing
with working with spirit--

00:04:46.548 --> 00:04:48.060 align:middle line:84%
if you, OK, I want
to lift the veil,

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.220 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk to spirits,
my guide, the ghost,

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.290 align:middle line:90%
whatever, be specific.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.220 align:middle line:84%
OK, only good or light beings,
only relatives, only ancestors,

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.450 align:middle line:84%
only people for my own
good, good and light beings.

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:59.250 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.590 align:middle line:90%
That's what you get.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.960 align:middle line:90%
It's not that complicated.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.460 align:middle line:84%
Whether you're
working a divination,

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.162 align:middle line:84%
whether you're working with
dowsing rods or pendulums

00:05:08.162 --> 00:05:09.870 align:middle line:84%
or even a Ouija board,
because I know you

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:10.912 align:middle line:90%
don't like Ouija boards--

00:05:10.912 --> 00:05:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't
like Ouija boards.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: But see, I've safely
used them since I was a kid

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.430 align:middle line:90%
because I've--

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe
you've been lucky.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: I've been lucky.

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, when I've allowed--

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.920 align:middle line:84%
like if I'm doing
something where OK, we do

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.600 align:middle line:84%
want to channel
the darker spirits

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.830 align:middle line:84%
there, that is when you
can get into some trouble.

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.020 align:middle line:90%
But I'm allowing it.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.790 align:middle line:84%
But at least I'm
well-trained enough.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:30.960 align:middle line:90%
I know how to shut it down.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:31.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm not taking anything home.

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the scariest
moment that you've ever

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.187 align:middle line:90%
had that something happened?

00:05:35.187 --> 00:05:37.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: I think the scariest
moment I ever had was

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.350 align:middle line:84%
when a cameraman burst into
flames during a seance.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A cameraman
burst into flames?

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:45.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Yeah.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened?

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Well, it was a house.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.190 align:middle line:84%
It was an old house right in
my neighborhood, actually,

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.180 align:middle line:90%
the Hollywood Hills.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.125 align:middle line:84%
It was built by Charlie
Chaplin and for his girlfriend

00:05:54.125 --> 00:05:55.610 align:middle line:90%
then, Mary Astor.

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.970 align:middle line:84%
After they lived there, then
the Rolling Stones manager

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:58.770 align:middle line:90%
bought it.

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.370 align:middle line:84%
So the Rolling Stones lived
there, Mamas and Papas.

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And Marilyn Manson moved
in and lived there.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:04.940 align:middle line:84%
He was my neighbor
for seven years.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.150 align:middle line:90%
And he recorded.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.840 align:middle line:84%
So the house itself looks
like a haunted house,

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.220 align:middle line:90%
feels like a haunted house.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.650 align:middle line:84%
It looks like it was built
by a mason or something.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.200 align:middle line:84%
Oh, there's 12 of
those, sacred geometry.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.580 align:middle line:84%
It attracts creative,
chaotic, somewhat dark people.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.070 align:middle line:84%
So they were doing a
documentary about the house.

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And we were doing a seance there
as part of the documentary.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.730 align:middle line:84%
My one thing is, though,
you have to be respectful.

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:30.545 align:middle line:84%
That's when you get
into trouble because--

00:06:30.545 --> 00:06:31.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To the other side.

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:35.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: To the other side, to
the other side because nobody

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.420 align:middle line:90%
wants to be disrespected.

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:37.400 align:middle line:90%
Neither do spirits.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.110 align:middle line:90%
And this one kid--

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:40.950 align:middle line:90%
maybe because he was on TV.

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:41.750 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.580 align:middle line:84%
But he started
being a smart aleck.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.590 align:middle line:84%
So we would be getting
some good information.

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:46.670 align:middle line:90%
And he'd say something.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And I felt the spirits
getting agitated.

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.383 align:middle line:84%
So first, really cool things
happened, like something

00:06:52.383 --> 00:06:53.300 align:middle line:90%
and he said something.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.160 align:middle line:90%
And the French doors flew open.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.823 align:middle line:90%
And everybody's going, ah.

00:06:56.823 --> 00:06:57.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like, slammed open.

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:59.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Like, slammed open.

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:00.770 align:middle line:90%
And then that happened again.

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:02.570 align:middle line:90%
And then the energy's building.

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:03.620 align:middle line:90%
Energy's building.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.043 align:middle line:84%
And then they said something
else really stupid.

00:07:06.043 --> 00:07:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And then the
speakers on the floor

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.120 align:middle line:90%
came on, this white noise.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.030 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's ah.

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:12.440 align:middle line:90%
Again, we look later.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.730 align:middle line:90%
They weren't even plugged in.

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:14.690 align:middle line:90%
But it's building.

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:15.560 align:middle line:90%
It's building.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.580 align:middle line:90%
We're using the Ouija.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.680 align:middle line:84%
We got something about
the dirt basement,

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.185 align:middle line:84%
something that had horrible
happened in the early 1930s.

00:07:21.185 --> 00:07:21.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, boy.

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:22.833 align:middle line:90%
Somebody buried down there?

00:07:22.833 --> 00:07:23.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: I don't know.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:28.440 align:middle line:84%
But there was some trafficking
weird stuff in some bad times

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.240 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And he again said
something stupid.

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And not him, but my cameraman
facing him literally

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:39.440 align:middle line:84%
burst into flames
like a V up his back.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.670 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's screaming.

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And I all of a
sudden pull medium,

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.050 align:middle line:84%
which Patti becomes
medic, which I am.

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:46.580 align:middle line:90%
It's like, drop and roll.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm calling in my guardians
and shut this down.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.140 align:middle line:90%
Shut this down.

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And I don't care what we're
filming, no one bursts

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:56.420 align:middle line:90%
into flames on my watch.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:59.550 align:middle line:84%
But the cameraman, he
was a total skeptic.

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:00.590 align:middle line:90%
He was like, oh my gosh.

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:02.570 align:middle line:84%
He was not in front of
a fireplace or anything.

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:03.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He wasn't a
skeptic after that.

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:04.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: He wasn't a skeptic.

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:05.930 align:middle line:90%
He goes, no, I'm fine.

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:07.280 align:middle line:90%
His shirt burnt off him.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.740 align:middle line:84%
It poofed off him like
it was a synthetic.

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:10.842 align:middle line:90%
But it was a cotton.

00:08:10.842 --> 00:08:12.050 align:middle line:90%
It should not have went poof.

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And for me, the coolest
thing is that the cameraman

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:19.220 align:middle line:84%
who caught on fire, he showed
me his back afterwards.

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:23.405 align:middle line:84%
And it looked like he had went
and got a tattoo of a dragon.

00:08:23.405 --> 00:08:24.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:25.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: Open
mouth, short teeth--

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Etched right on him--

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:28.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: The winged-- into
the shape of a serpent.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:29.900 align:middle line:90%
And that is the exact--

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:30.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's freaky--

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:31.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Energy.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.710 align:middle line:84%
That is the exact
energy I called in

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:35.240 align:middle line:90%
to shut down the seance.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:38.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had a chance to
interview psychic Marla Frees

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:42.650 align:middle line:84%
about her abilities to want that
connection with the other side.

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:47.100 align:middle line:84%
What do people
generally look for when

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.230 align:middle line:90%
they think they're psychic?

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:50.230 align:middle line:90%
What do they want?

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:52.022 align:middle line:84%
What are they trying
to do with their life?

00:08:52.022 --> 00:08:54.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MARLA FREES: Well,
I think that all of us

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:58.650 align:middle line:84%
need connection, need
connection to a source.

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:00.180 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very
important, even

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.040 align:middle line:90%
for the science-based people.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.850 align:middle line:84%
Science-based people who want to
ignore the idea of God or they

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:07.560 align:middle line:84%
think they're
beyond that, they're

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.120 align:middle line:90%
getting downloads all the time.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.380 align:middle line:90%
They're getting information.

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:13.345 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes, ego makes them
think that it's theirs, right?

00:09:13.345 --> 00:09:14.145 align:middle line:90%
It's just them.

00:09:14.145 --> 00:09:17.910 align:middle line:84%
It's their intelligence
that makes them so smart.

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:21.760 align:middle line:84%
So the dynamic of being
connected, we all need that.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And the psychic
connection that we

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:30.250 align:middle line:84%
make to another
consciousness, my goodness,

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:33.700 align:middle line:84%
it makes us feel as
though we're not alone,

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.560 align:middle line:84%
as though we're part
of a system, part

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.860 align:middle line:84%
of a universal consciousness,
part of a larger consciousness

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:39.910 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:43.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you find that some
people have misperceptions

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:44.950 align:middle line:90%
about the psychic people?

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:46.300 align:middle line:90%
>>FREES: Oh, yeah.

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:48.070 align:middle line:90%
It's really kind of sad.

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:50.200 align:middle line:84%
I did, too-- made
fun of them, thought

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.420 align:middle line:84%
the people talking to the
dead were crazy, all of it.

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:55.990 align:middle line:84%
I had lots of judgment about
it, until it happened to me.

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:59.350 align:middle line:84%
I think the dynamic
is how we reframe it,

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:03.490 align:middle line:84%
because people keep thinking
that it's not biblical

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:05.682 align:middle line:90%
or it's not Christian or it's--

00:10:05.682 --> 00:10:07.390 align:middle line:84%
and oh my goodness,
the Bible is filled--

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:08.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or it's demonic.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:09.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MARLA FREES: Yes.

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Some people think that.

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:12.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MARLA FREES: Well, of
course, because anything

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:15.670 align:middle line:84%
that threatens someone else's
reality is challenging to them.

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:17.180 align:middle line:90%
They like to make it wrong.

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.240 align:middle line:84%
But the Bible's
filled with prophecy,

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.180 align:middle line:90%
vision, a precognition.

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:23.680 align:middle line:90%
It's all about that.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:28.170 align:middle line:84%
So psychic functioning is
actually science-based.

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:29.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Patti, do
you agree with Marla?

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: Yes, I
completely agree.

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:36.130 align:middle line:84%
My grandfather was a very
academic atheist leader,

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:39.370 align:middle line:84%
hung out with Isaac Asimov
and Carl Sagan and all

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:40.170 align:middle line:90%
these people.

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:43.290 align:middle line:84%
He thought anything to do
with spirituality or religion

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:44.560 align:middle line:90%
was a weakness.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.410 align:middle line:84%
But I-- and he wrote
about religion.

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But now, Carl
was a believer, though.

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:49.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Yeah.

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:50.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sagan was.

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:52.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: But they had all
these very academic things.

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:54.300 align:middle line:90%
But I read his work now.

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, oh, grandpa,
we don't believe so different.

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:58.570 align:middle line:90%
You just use different words.

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:00.990 align:middle line:84%
If you take it down to
energy, the true line

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:03.870 align:middle line:84%
between, whether you're
using very scientific words

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:07.570 align:middle line:84%
or Judeo-Christian words
or pagan or New Age words,

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:09.510 align:middle line:90%
the truth there is the same.

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:12.190 align:middle line:84%
You just-- who cares
what the names are?

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:14.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
magic mean to you?

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:17.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: Magick with
a K means to me--

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:20.640 align:middle line:84%
again, you're not pulling
a rabbit out of a hat.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:21.910 align:middle line:90%
You're causing a real shift.

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:22.890 align:middle line:90%
It's not illusion.

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:24.540 align:middle line:90%
It's a change and shift.

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:28.290 align:middle line:84%
So magick isn't a spell
working or isn't a shift

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:29.550 align:middle line:90%
of whatever you're doing.

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:31.583 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it
something occultist?

00:11:31.583 --> 00:11:33.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: It's
certainly occultist.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:33.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.220 align:middle line:90%
But it could be--

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:36.570 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't have to be.

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:38.760 align:middle line:84%
To me, magick could
also be somebody

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.920 align:middle line:84%
goes to their evangelical church
and they have a faith healing

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:42.720 align:middle line:90%
and it's there.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.750 align:middle line:90%
That's magick.

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:44.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:47.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, Jason Louv had a chance
to be on "Beyond Belief" with me

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:52.010 align:middle line:84%
and talked about his
definition of what is magic.

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:54.500 align:middle line:90%
To you, what is magic?

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.000 align:middle line:84%
>>JASON LOUV: There's a couple
ways to answer that question.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.810 align:middle line:84%
I think that as
Crowley defined it,

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:03.200 align:middle line:84%
any willed intentional
act is a magical act.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.170 align:middle line:10%
So it's any time a human
being puts their will out

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:07.130 align:middle line:10%
into the world.

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:09.350 align:middle line:10%
I like to say that
spiders weave webs.

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:10.850 align:middle line:10%
Snails build shells.

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:15.200 align:middle line:84%
Human beings create
meaning and exteriorize

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.050 align:middle line:84%
story and meaning into the world
in an attempt to control it.

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:20.270 align:middle line:90%
All of that is magic.

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:23.030 align:middle line:84%
But more specifically, there
is a specific thing called

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:26.690 align:middle line:84%
the Western magical
tradition, which involves,

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:32.030 align:middle line:84%
I would say, a graded
practice of ritual.

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And what magical ritual really
is is not the Hollywood version

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:37.387 align:middle line:90%
of some type of--

00:12:37.387 --> 00:12:39.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Conjuring up stuff
and things like that--

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:41.012 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: Christopher
Lee, all of that.

00:12:41.012 --> 00:12:44.390 align:middle line:84%
What magic really is is
creating a temporary space

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:47.810 align:middle line:84%
through ritual to shift your
consciousness into somewhere

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:51.320 align:middle line:84%
else, to intentionally-- so
for instance, when I came here,

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.600 align:middle line:90%
we're on a set.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:56.300 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, we're doing a
magical ritual where we're here

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.800 align:middle line:84%
and our consciousness is
engaged in creating this show.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:12:59.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: And it won't
be out on the street.

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:02.600 align:middle line:90%
It won't be at the airport.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.225 align:middle line:84%
You're completely
different because you

00:13:04.225 --> 00:13:05.480 align:middle line:90%
have a different surrounding.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.060 align:middle line:84%
So with magic, you
create a ritual space

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:11.600 align:middle line:84%
specifically to do
something like talk

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:15.465 align:middle line:84%
to a god, which represents
an aspect of the universe

00:13:15.465 --> 00:13:17.090 align:middle line:84%
that you would like
to know more about,

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:23.930 align:middle line:84%
or to exteriorize
and define your will

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:27.750 align:middle line:84%
in a specific way of what you
want to happen in your life.

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:30.183 align:middle line:84%
And there are many, many
different types of it.

00:13:30.183 --> 00:13:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
different kinds of it

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:33.510 align:middle line:84%
in different cultures
throughout the world.

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:35.330 align:middle line:84%
So I also use magic
as a catch-all phrase

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.730 align:middle line:84%
for any of these
techniques for altering

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:41.420 align:middle line:84%
consciousness-- shamanism,
tantra, esoteric Buddhism,

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:42.770 align:middle line:90%
all of these things.

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:46.190 align:middle line:84%
I use the word "magic"
to denote all of them.

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:47.930 align:middle line:90%
But that's really what it is.

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:50.270 align:middle line:84%
So you can think of
it as meditation.

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:52.160 align:middle line:84%
If someone is meditating,
they're internal.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.560 align:middle line:84%
They're sitting on a
mat and going within,

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:58.670 align:middle line:84%
where a magical ritual
is exteriorizing outside

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:03.560 align:middle line:84%
of yourself, using symbols
and tools to represent

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:06.410 align:middle line:84%
one's own consciousness
outside of yourself

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:08.090 align:middle line:84%
and then to change
it and manipulate it,

00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:10.110 align:middle line:84%
almost like a building
a sand mandala

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:12.050 align:middle line:90%
as the Tibetans would do.

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:15.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of people
confuse magic with illusion,

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:16.880 align:middle line:84%
as you pointed out
earlier, don't they?

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:17.810 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:20.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: Well, most people
aren't thinking about it.

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.260 align:middle line:90%
They hear the word "magic."

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And if they're not in the
spiritual world or occultist

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:27.620 align:middle line:84%
world, they think card
tricks or disappearing,

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:29.130 align:middle line:90%
cutting the girl in half--

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:29.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which are great tricks.

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Which are great tricks.

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:31.820 align:middle line:90%
And they are tricks.

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And I like actually the
trend in magic, because I

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:35.330 align:middle line:90%
love that kind of magic.

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:38.520 align:middle line:84%
I've been hanging out at the
Magic Castle for decades.

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:42.590 align:middle line:84%
But they're more and more
using the word "illusionist"

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:44.300 align:middle line:90%
than "magic."

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:47.570 align:middle line:84%
I like that, that they
themselves are differentiating

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:49.550 align:middle line:90%
it more than we even are.

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:52.392 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why the K at
the end of your magick?

00:14:52.392 --> 00:14:53.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: I forget who it was.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.480 align:middle line:84%
But it was in the early
Wicca ceremonial magic.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And they put the K
on to differentiate.

00:14:58.860 --> 00:14:59.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:00.350 align:middle line:90%
And it does.

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:00.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: And it does.

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you look
at it, you go, this

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:07.175 align:middle line:84%
looks a little kind of evil
compared to regular magic.

00:15:07.175 --> 00:15:08.300 align:middle line:90%
But it's really not, is it?

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:09.803 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: It's not evil at all.

00:15:09.803 --> 00:15:11.720 align:middle line:84%
It could be anything you
want, but it's shift.

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.250 align:middle line:90%
It's change.

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:14.630 align:middle line:84%
Just what he said
it beautifully.

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:16.400 align:middle line:84%
It's that you are
creating something.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.192 align:middle line:84%
You are creating this
world, whether you're

00:15:18.192 --> 00:15:20.000 align:middle line:84%
doing ritual or spell
work, whatever it is.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you
say you're a magician?

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: I would
say I'm a magician.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.890 align:middle line:84%
I don't use that
term a lot, but yeah.

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:26.130 align:middle line:90%
I could say I'm a shaman.

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:26.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm a magician.

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:28.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you a sorcerer?

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:29.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: I'm a sorcerer.

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:29.630 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:30.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You do
all those things?

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: I do.

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:32.805 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
your favorites?

00:15:32.805 --> 00:15:35.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: Well, I'm about
empowering people or letting

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.570 align:middle line:90%
people see their power.

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:38.930 align:middle line:84%
So if we're doing a ritual
or we're doing a spell,

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:40.850 align:middle line:84%
I want people to
be able to really--

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:43.130 align:middle line:84%
you don't always
want to go by fate.

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:44.780 align:middle line:90%
Fate takes the easy--

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:46.640 align:middle line:90%
destiny takes the easy path.

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.110 align:middle line:84%
If you want to
shift it, you want

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:50.110 align:middle line:84%
to make that magic
happen and see

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:51.860 align:middle line:84%
that you really are
in charge of your life

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:53.390 align:middle line:84%
so much more than
you think you are.

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:56.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is magic a
little bit about fate?

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:57.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Well, it is.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.370 align:middle line:90%
You do have to--

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:01.430 align:middle line:84%
again, that's why I
think to do magic,

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:04.370 align:middle line:84%
to do this kind-- to do
spell work and magic,

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:07.190 align:middle line:84%
you really have to have a
sense of right and wrong

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:10.850 align:middle line:84%
or integrity or moral
code, not morality like who

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:12.230 align:middle line:90%
does what, but that moral code.

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:13.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Karma?

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:13.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Karma.

00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:15.470 align:middle line:84%
Karma's a good-- it's
an Eastern philosophy

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:17.510 align:middle line:90%
because you are causing shift.

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:18.440 align:middle line:90%
So you have to look.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:21.870 align:middle line:84%
There is cause and effect,
action and reaction.

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:23.790 align:middle line:90%
So my idea is to do magic--

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:24.590 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:26.472 align:middle line:84%
Say the water runs
down the hill.

00:16:26.472 --> 00:16:27.680 align:middle line:90%
The water runs down the hill.

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.450 align:middle line:84%
But you have a
house on the hill.

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And you want some
of that water, too.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:32.460 align:middle line:90%
But it's over there.

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:34.370 align:middle line:84%
The water runs down the
hill to the village,

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:36.320 align:middle line:90%
and the village loves the water.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:40.310 align:middle line:84%
To do a magic working,
you would build a dam

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:41.390 align:middle line:90%
and take that water.

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:42.920 align:middle line:90%
And now, you've got the water.

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:45.440 align:middle line:84%
To me, unethical
magic, bad magic--

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:48.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't use black or white--
is if you take all the water.

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:50.570 align:middle line:84%
Then those villagers
don't have any water.

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:51.200 align:middle line:84%
They're going to die or
they're going to get mad.

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.941 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then you
sell it back to them.

00:16:52.941 --> 00:16:54.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: You sell
them-- there's commerce.

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:55.560 align:middle line:90%
No, but they get mad.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:56.710 align:middle line:90%
Or they come and kill you.

00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:58.950 align:middle line:84%
Ethical magic would be
you take what you need.

00:16:58.950 --> 00:16:59.910 align:middle line:90%
That's a spell working.

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:01.000 align:middle line:90%
That's causing the shift.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.290 align:middle line:84%
I need water over here,
but they get water, too.

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:06.569 align:middle line:84%
And again, if you could
create that in your magic

00:17:06.569 --> 00:17:11.170 align:middle line:84%
where you're not messing up
other people, then create it.

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:13.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So generally,
magic is something good.

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:15.599 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: In my working,
it is something good,

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:17.730 align:middle line:84%
because if I do
something bad, then

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:19.175 align:middle line:90%
I have to live in that world.

00:17:19.175 --> 00:17:20.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How
important, Patti, is

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:24.270 align:middle line:84%
energy tied into this, because
I've seen a lot of people

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:25.980 align:middle line:90%
with negative energy.

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:28.349 align:middle line:84%
And things just don't
go well for them at all.

00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:29.910 align:middle line:90%
It compiles.

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:31.440 align:middle line:90%
More things pile on.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:34.420 align:middle line:84%
The more negative they are,
the worse things get for them.

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:35.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Yep.

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:38.160 align:middle line:84%
Energy is everything,
everything.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:38.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I agree.

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.043 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: We're all energy.

00:17:40.043 --> 00:17:40.920 align:middle line:90%
We're not solid.

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:43.080 align:middle line:84%
Seventh-grade science--
this isn't solid.

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:44.740 align:middle line:90%
We are moving energy.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:46.440 align:middle line:90%
So that's the shift.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.960 align:middle line:84%
And if things start
going awry, they're

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.420 align:middle line:84%
going to-- you get in
the spin and going awry.

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:52.657 align:middle line:90%
But you can shift that.

00:17:52.657 --> 00:17:54.240 align:middle line:84%
People don't know
they can shift that.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.530 align:middle line:90%
And they get so used to it.

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:57.630 align:middle line:90%
They fall into, my life sucks.

00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:58.770 align:middle line:90%
And they keep going on.

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:00.540 align:middle line:84%
But that's where
magic would come in

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:02.340 align:middle line:90%
or faith or belief system.

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:05.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm a big believer
in that mind, body,

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:08.623 align:middle line:84%
spirit that 200,000 books are
written about, because you do.

00:18:08.623 --> 00:18:11.040 align:middle line:84%
You have to believe it, or
you'll never surpass your mind.

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.540 align:middle line:90%
You have to take action.

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:14.250 align:middle line:84%
Sitting on the couch
won't get you there.

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:17.620 align:middle line:84%
And the spirit, that's
the energy behind it.

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:19.800 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's faith-- going
to church or temple--

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.140 align:middle line:84%
or you're doing a spell
working or a ritual

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:25.080 align:middle line:84%
or you're doing a vision
board or affirmations,

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.880 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is, you
have to believe,

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.320 align:middle line:84%
you have to take
action, and then

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:32.045 align:middle line:84%
that spirit is the battery
power that makes it happen.

00:18:32.045 --> 00:18:34.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had a guy I
worked with in St. Louis who

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:38.850 align:middle line:84%
every day, he would come in with
a black cloud over his head.

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:41.065 align:middle line:84%
He would start
his day by saying,

00:18:41.065 --> 00:18:42.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to have
a good day today.

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:43.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Yeah.

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:45.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
that do to you when you

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.548 align:middle line:90%
program yourself to think that?

00:18:47.548 --> 00:18:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: That makes you
have a bad day every day.

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:50.400 align:middle line:90%
He's doing it.

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:53.340 align:middle line:84%
He is-- even getting
into science and sciences

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.377 align:middle line:84%
of language, you
are confirming that.

00:18:55.377 --> 00:18:56.460 align:middle line:90%
And you are creating that.

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:58.325 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do you change that?

00:18:58.325 --> 00:19:00.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: Again, that's why
I like magic and ritual,

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:01.740 align:middle line:90%
because a nice big--

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:06.002 align:middle line:84%
again, a big shift is
when you can consciously

00:19:06.002 --> 00:19:08.460 align:middle line:84%
change it, because you have to
change your thought pattern.

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:10.230 align:middle line:84%
You have to take
action to do it.

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:13.380 align:middle line:84%
So again, all of a sudden, if
you're working a moon cycle

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:15.300 align:middle line:84%
on it or you're doing
a big candle working

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:16.920 align:middle line:84%
or you've got your
herbs and your oils

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.620 align:middle line:84%
and you're dancing under the
full moon, all of a sudden,

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:22.890 align:middle line:84%
you're taking a tangible
action to add to the thought

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:26.370 align:middle line:84%
process, to add to the spirit
or magic or whoever, whatever

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:29.040 align:middle line:84%
you're calling in, which you
could just take down to energy.

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:29.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it fun?

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:30.763 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: It's fun.

00:19:30.763 --> 00:19:31.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You enjoy doing it.

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:33.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: I love
doing it because--

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:34.172 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You seem upbeat.

00:19:34.172 --> 00:19:36.240 align:middle line:90%
You seem like a nice person.

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.198 align:middle line:84%
The times I've talked to
you, you've been nice.

00:19:38.198 --> 00:19:38.998 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Yeah.

00:19:38.998 --> 00:19:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't see
anything evil about you.

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:41.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Yeah.

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:42.990 align:middle line:90%
I love people.

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:44.130 align:middle line:90%
I love life.

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:46.680 align:middle line:90%
And I honestly have been able--

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:49.680 align:middle line:84%
and I like to create the
life I want and I love.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.390 align:middle line:90%
And I'm a total manifester.

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And I've been able to create the
life I want and love completely

00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:56.670 align:middle line:90%
doing positive magic.

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:58.500 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
do negative magic.

00:19:58.500 --> 00:19:59.300 align:middle line:90%
I've beat on--

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:00.842 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I like
that, positive magic.

00:20:00.842 --> 00:20:01.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Positive magic.

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:03.690 align:middle line:84%
To prove my health
thing, I decided

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:06.060 align:middle line:84%
I would do the world's
hardest obstacle course.

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:07.800 align:middle line:90%
I'd get that TV show, "Wipeout."

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:08.670 align:middle line:90%
I live in Hollywood.

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:10.320 align:middle line:90%
So I'm not that athletic.

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:13.320 align:middle line:84%
So I beat literally
70,000, 80,000 people

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.540 align:middle line:84%
to do the world's
hardest obstacle course.

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm like,
well, I can't cook.

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:18.210 align:middle line:90%
Get on "MasterChef."

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:20.543 align:middle line:84%
I beat another 100,000 people
to cook for Gordon Ramsay.

00:20:20.543 --> 00:20:21.343 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:20:21.343 --> 00:20:23.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: Now, I didn't do that
by when you're at the audition

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:26.580 align:middle line:84%
with 100,000 people, going, oh,
I hope they break their foot.

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:27.940 align:middle line:10%
Oh, I hope there's--

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:28.740 align:middle line:10%
I was like--

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:29.670 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You didn't wish
evil things on them.

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:31.900 align:middle line:10%
>>NEGRI: No, I wished
them good luck.

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:33.120 align:middle line:90%
I hope you do great.

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.980 align:middle line:90%
Oh my gosh, you look fabulous.

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:36.930 align:middle line:84%
The more you're
putting that out there,

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:38.680 align:middle line:84%
that's what you're
getting, because you're

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:39.540 align:middle line:90%
creating that world.

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:42.210 align:middle line:84%
If people can get that,
oh, no, hold on to mine,

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:44.640 align:middle line:90%
that's not serving them.

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:45.900 align:middle line:90%
This is serving them.

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:47.342 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that
creating a spell?

00:20:47.342 --> 00:20:48.300 align:middle line:90%
Is that the same thing?

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:49.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: That could
be creating a spell.

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:50.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:51.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is a spell?

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:54.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: A spell is I'm going
to take this and shift this.

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:55.260 align:middle line:90%
It's not working.

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:56.580 align:middle line:90%
I want a love spell.

00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:57.870 align:middle line:90%
I want a money spell.

00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:58.950 align:middle line:90%
I want a health spell.

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:01.250 align:middle line:90%
I want to get a new home spell.

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:02.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they affirmations?

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.057 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: They can
be affirmations.

00:21:04.057 --> 00:21:06.690 align:middle line:84%
Affirmations, though, are
just a thought process.

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:08.850 align:middle line:84%
A spell working--
again, number one,

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:11.400 align:middle line:84%
it incorporates that
psychological mind, body,

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.310 align:middle line:84%
spirit thing because it
also comes in three forms.

00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:16.860 align:middle line:84%
In a spell working, first,
you have to do the creation.

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's like,
OK, what do I want?

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:20.962 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I want love.

00:21:20.962 --> 00:21:22.920 align:middle line:84%
So oh, I should have some
fire in that passion.

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:24.337 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
do a candle spell.

00:21:24.337 --> 00:21:25.950 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I should do it on a Friday.

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:27.040 align:middle line:90%
That's the day of Venus.

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:27.840 align:middle line:90%
That's love.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.610 align:middle line:84%
Oh, maybe I should
do it on a new moon.

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:32.430 align:middle line:84%
That's the creation,
which is mind.

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And then the body,
that's the working.

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:36.120 align:middle line:90%
I am carving that candle.

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:39.570 align:middle line:84%
I am putting that dragon's
blood in the mortar and pestle.

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:40.880 align:middle line:90%
And then there's the spirit--

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Eyes of newt
and stuff like that.

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:43.505 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Eye of newt.

00:21:43.505 --> 00:21:44.430 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I use it often.

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:46.980 align:middle line:84%
And then the spirit part,
that's the dispatch.

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:51.600 align:middle line:84%
Any spell working, you also have
the sending out to the heavens.

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.850 align:middle line:84%
That's the dancing around
or the drumming around

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:56.340 align:middle line:84%
or the just sending
it out to the heavens,

00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:58.830 align:middle line:84%
universe, God, gods,
whatever you believe in.

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:00.160 align:middle line:90%
So it fits into that.

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:03.450 align:middle line:84%
So the spell has the
tangible working to it

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:05.880 align:middle line:84%
versus just an affirmation
or just a prayer.

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:07.920 align:middle line:84%
Prayer has the hope
and the thought.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:11.160 align:middle line:84%
You have the spirit of the god
and you have the brainpower.

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.860 align:middle line:84%
But you don't have that
action in the middle so much.

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:17.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do you
need things in a spell?

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:21.180 align:middle line:84%
Hair, clothes-- why
do you need objects?

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:22.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: Well, you
don't need anything.

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:25.470 align:middle line:84%
I believe actually that we
have everything we need.

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:27.870 align:middle line:84%
But if you have an
automatic dishwasher,

00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:30.090 align:middle line:84%
use it if you just served
dinner for 20 people,

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:31.950 align:middle line:90%
because things have attributes.

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:33.810 align:middle line:90%
Again, fire is passion.

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:35.370 align:middle line:90%
Fire is moving and passion.

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:36.660 align:middle line:90%
Earth is grounding.

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:38.910 align:middle line:90%
So you need some rocks in it.

00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:41.400 align:middle line:84%
Something air element, you're
going to burn some incense

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.170 align:middle line:90%
to take it off into the air.

00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:45.210 align:middle line:84%
I work very
elementally in my work.

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:46.950 align:middle line:90%
So you don't need things.

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:48.480 align:middle line:90%
But things, hair--

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.580 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't work with
anybody else's hair

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:52.928 align:middle line:84%
because, again, I don't do
spell working on other people

00:22:52.928 --> 00:22:54.220 align:middle line:90%
unless I have their permission.

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:55.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But some people do.

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:56.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Some people do.

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:59.190 align:middle line:84%
But if I can control someone
else without their permission,

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:01.210 align:middle line:84%
again, I believe that,
therefore, someone

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:02.010 align:middle line:90%
can control me.

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:03.635 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want
someone to control me.

00:23:03.635 --> 00:23:06.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I talked with the
Salem witch, Leanne Marrama.

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And she was telling about
spells and things you

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:12.310 align:middle line:90%
put in there to create them.

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:14.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LEANNE MARRAMA: Each spell
requires different ingredients.

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:17.720 align:middle line:84%
If I was going to make a
love spell or a love mixture,

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:20.540 align:middle line:84%
I would add things that
made me feel loved--

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:23.967 align:middle line:84%
roses, hibiscus, beautiful
flowers with fragrant scents--

00:23:23.967 --> 00:23:24.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Lavenders--

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:27.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MARRAMA: Lavender to
relax you, beautiful things.

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:29.030 align:middle line:90%
And I'd put it in there.

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:29.870 align:middle line:90%
And I would--

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:30.763 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Boil it up--

00:23:30.763 --> 00:23:31.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MARRAMA: Cook it up.

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:37.132 align:middle line:84%
You can add-- you can burn it
and let it rise to the heavens.

00:23:37.132 --> 00:23:38.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's pretty
pointed, isn't it?

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.007 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Yes, and it's true.

00:23:40.007 --> 00:23:42.300 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what I would
put in a love spell, too.

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:43.100 align:middle line:90%
We do.

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:44.990 align:middle line:90%
We picture roses.

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:50.150 align:middle line:84%
Have them take a rose petal
bath, red passion, pink love,

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:52.310 align:middle line:84%
all those things
because, again, we need

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:53.720 align:middle line:90%
the psychological part of it.

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:57.110 align:middle line:84%
We need the real attribute that
those things have within them.

00:23:57.110 --> 00:24:00.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is putting
on a spell easy?

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:01.550 align:middle line:90%
Can anybody do it?

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:05.540 align:middle line:84%
Or do I have to go to a psychic
or a witch to get it done?

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:07.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: No, I believe
anybody can do it.

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:11.550 align:middle line:84%
I think, again, so long as you
have a good sense of integrity,

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:13.963 align:middle line:84%
so long as you're not doing
anything on anybody else

00:24:13.963 --> 00:24:16.130 align:middle line:84%
without their permission,
I think anybody can do it.

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:17.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That would
be a curse, right?

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:18.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: That would-- well, no.

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:19.800 align:middle line:90%
Even if you want to--

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.280 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:23.450 align:middle line:84%
In my belief system,
a good love spell

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:25.160 align:middle line:90%
is bring me the love of my life.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Make them funny,
tall, this, and that.

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:27.620 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:28.070 align:middle line:90%
I can do that.

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:29.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's got power.

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:29.735 align:middle line:90%
It's positive.

00:24:29.735 --> 00:24:30.535 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Yes.

00:24:30.535 --> 00:24:34.510 align:middle line:84%
But if you go bring me Bob
Jones, as good as that--

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:35.510 align:middle line:90%
I know he's my soulmate.

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:36.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's wrong with that?

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:38.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: Because I don't
have Bob Jones's permission.

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:40.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm controlling Bob Jones.

00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:42.360 align:middle line:84%
I can make Bob Jones
fall in love with you.

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.160 align:middle line:90%
And if it's not--

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:44.743 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you
don't have permission

00:24:44.743 --> 00:24:46.650 align:middle line:84%
on the first person,
either, when you say,

00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:48.470 align:middle line:90%
bring me my love of my life.

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:50.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: No, because
then the universe--

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:53.610 align:middle line:84%
God, gods, whatever-- brings
you the love of your life.

00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:55.520 align:middle line:84%
But if you're
asking for Bob Jones

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:57.238 align:middle line:84%
and if it's not supposed
to be Bob Jones,

00:24:57.238 --> 00:24:59.030 align:middle line:84%
I can make Bob Jones
fall in love with you.

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:01.030 align:middle line:84%
And it'd be the worst
relationship you ever had.

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:03.043 align:middle line:84%
It'd be like that
stalker who's obsessed.

00:25:03.043 --> 00:25:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And you'd be going,
get rid of it.

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:06.682 align:middle line:84%
Get rid of it, because
we're controlling Bob Jones

00:25:06.682 --> 00:25:07.640 align:middle line:90%
without his permission.

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't want Bob
Jones to fall in love with me.

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:10.558 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: No, I don't, either.

00:25:10.558 --> 00:25:11.750 align:middle line:90%
I hear he's terrible.

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And then if you get
Bob Jones's permission,

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:16.137 align:middle line:84%
then you probably don't
need the love spell, anyway.

00:25:16.137 --> 00:25:17.303 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's interesting.

00:25:17.303 --> 00:25:18.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: So to me, that's--

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:19.940 align:middle line:84%
so people think,
well, it doesn't

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:22.790 align:middle line:84%
sound bad, oh, because I know
Bob Jones is my soulmate.

00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:23.810 align:middle line:90%
He just doesn't know it.

00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:26.240 align:middle line:84%
Or I know that we
just had a fight.

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.190 align:middle line:90%
No, I won't.

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:30.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I used to interview
a witch, Patti, on "Coast

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:31.940 align:middle line:90%
to Coast," on the radio show.

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:33.860 align:middle line:90%
She's since long passed.

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:36.050 align:middle line:90%
Evelyn Paglini was her name.

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And she talked about candles
used for different rituals

00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:40.910 align:middle line:90%
and spells.

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:44.630 align:middle line:84%
Different colors would
depict certain things.

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:45.777 align:middle line:90%
Is that the case?

00:25:45.777 --> 00:25:46.610 align:middle line:90%
You agree with that?

00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:47.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Yes, I do.

00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:49.220 align:middle line:90%
And there are standard colors.

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:51.230 align:middle line:84%
Like I said before,
red is passion.

00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:53.510 align:middle line:84%
Pink is love, green
or good for money--

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:55.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: White or
blue or whatever--

00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:56.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: White, blue--
white works for everything.

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:58.160 align:middle line:84%
Black pulls--
black's not negative.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:25:59.150 align:middle line:90%
It pulls out.

00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:01.130 align:middle line:84%
But I'm also of
the belief system

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:04.130 align:middle line:84%
that if over whatever
the book says

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:09.110 align:middle line:84%
or what standard or yes, red
does create passion, if to you,

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:11.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, chartreuse
means passion,

00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:14.210 align:middle line:84%
I would say you should
use chartreuse then

00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:18.050 align:middle line:84%
because I think, again, to
be in this belief system,

00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:21.332 align:middle line:84%
your truth is more important
than this is official.

00:26:21.332 --> 00:26:23.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
written a book on just spells?

00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:25.623 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: I've never written
a book on just spells.

00:26:25.623 --> 00:26:26.990 align:middle line:90%
My book does have spells in it.

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:29.810 align:middle line:84%
Mine's kind of like an
overall philosophy of this.

00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:31.100 align:middle line:90%
But I go into everything.

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:32.330 align:middle line:90%
I have love magic.

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:34.580 align:middle line:84%
I have weight loss
and health magic.

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:36.770 align:middle line:90%
I have how to talk to the dead.

00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:39.080 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's just kind
of like this overview.

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you
want a better job,

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:42.713 align:middle line:90%
can you cast a spell for that?

00:26:42.713 --> 00:26:43.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Of course, you can.

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:45.205 align:middle line:90%
And they're very successful.

00:26:45.205 --> 00:26:46.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it
better for someone

00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:48.887 align:middle line:84%
to go to you or for them
to do it themselves?

00:26:48.887 --> 00:26:51.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: If they're willing to
do it themselves, that's great.

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:53.210 align:middle line:84%
Again, what I'm going
to bring into it

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:55.272 align:middle line:84%
is expertise, both
in what to use--

00:26:55.272 --> 00:26:56.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And a track record--

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:59.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: And a track record and
their belief system, probably,

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:02.120 align:middle line:84%
because the biggest
problem with people--

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:05.400 align:middle line:84%
not that they can't do it, but
that they don't believe they

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:06.200 align:middle line:90%
can do it.

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:08.510 align:middle line:84%
Again, intent is
number-one ingredient

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:10.290 align:middle line:90%
in any spell working, intent.

00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:12.448 align:middle line:84%
And if they think, oh,
she's going to do it better,

00:27:12.448 --> 00:27:13.490 align:middle line:90%
they're going to believe.

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:15.198 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it's
going to work better.

00:27:15.198 --> 00:27:17.130 align:middle line:84%
But I still don't
go do for them.

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:17.930 align:middle line:90%
I do it with them.

00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:20.030 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you are going
to participate with me,

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:23.030 align:middle line:84%
even if we're on the telephone,
even if we're on a Zoom call,

00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:25.340 align:middle line:84%
because even though
I have the expertise

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:28.490 align:middle line:84%
and I have that direct
path up to the heavens

00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:33.230 align:middle line:84%
and I know what to do and I know
how to move and direct energy,

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:34.970 align:middle line:90%
you are the one who wants this.

00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:37.670 align:middle line:84%
You have that passion
and desire behind it

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:38.915 align:middle line:90%
more than I ever will.

00:27:38.915 --> 00:27:40.040 align:middle line:90%
So the two of us together--

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:41.810 align:middle line:90%
1 plus 1 equals 6.

00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:45.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are spells done
for people who cannot reach

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:46.310 align:middle line:90%
their goals?

00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:47.670 align:middle line:90%
Here's an example.

00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:51.180 align:middle line:90%
Let's say I want a nice car.

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:54.480 align:middle line:84%
Get a good job, make enough
money, and go get it.

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.833 align:middle line:84%
What do you need a
spell for for that?

00:27:56.833 --> 00:27:58.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: Yeah, you
don't actually.

00:27:58.250 --> 00:27:59.930 align:middle line:84%
That's a really
great answer to it.

00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:02.662 align:middle line:84%
But as a rule, you
look at people--

00:28:02.662 --> 00:28:04.620 align:middle line:84%
because I usually do a
session with them first.

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:06.628 align:middle line:84%
It's like they don't
get a really good job.

00:28:06.628 --> 00:28:08.420 align:middle line:84%
Either they're not
going to go look for it,

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:10.220 align:middle line:84%
or they don't believe
they're worthy of it.

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:11.637 align:middle line:84%
Or when they were
seven years old,

00:28:11.637 --> 00:28:13.095 align:middle line:84%
their dad told them
they were going

00:28:13.095 --> 00:28:14.360 align:middle line:90%
to never amount to anything.

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:17.180 align:middle line:84%
Or when they were four years
old, their dad or their mom

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:18.470 align:middle line:90%
said, it's really hard.

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:19.580 align:middle line:90%
Oh, those rich people.

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:21.320 align:middle line:90%
They get thought patterns to it.

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:23.430 align:middle line:84%
So part of it is very
much psychological.

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:25.760 align:middle line:84%
We have to break
those belief systems,

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:27.740 align:middle line:90%
these limiting belief systems.

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:30.470 align:middle line:84%
Like I said in the beginning,
we give our power away.

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:32.210 align:middle line:90%
I don't deserve that Cadillac.

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:33.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you do.

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:35.300 align:middle line:84%
So let's shift
your belief system.

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:38.190 align:middle line:84%
Let's add some magic to
it and make it happen.

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:40.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can spells be
applied to everything?

00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:41.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Spells can be--

00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:43.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or are
there limitations?

00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:44.385 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: I think
you have to stay

00:28:44.385 --> 00:28:46.340 align:middle line:90%
within the laws of physics.

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:48.080 align:middle line:84%
If somebody said, make
me a foot taller--

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:49.372 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or the laws of magic--

00:28:49.372 --> 00:28:51.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: The laws of magic.

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:53.120 align:middle line:84%
I want to fly
without an airplane.

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:55.845 align:middle line:84%
I don't think-- maybe
someday, that will be doable,

00:28:55.845 --> 00:28:58.220 align:middle line:84%
when they figure out all those
other things in our brain.

00:28:58.220 --> 00:28:59.930 align:middle line:90%
Right now, we can't do that.

00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:02.300 align:middle line:84%
But pretty much, I do believe
that so long as you're not

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:04.758 align:middle line:84%
hurting somebody else, you're
not affecting somebody else's

00:29:04.758 --> 00:29:07.310 align:middle line:90%
life, spells really work.

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:10.730 align:middle line:84%
And you could do what you
want to do and step into it.

00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:12.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you chant
during your spells?

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:14.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: I do a lot with sound.

00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:14.450 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:14.970 align:middle line:90%
I do a lot with sound.

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:16.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Give me an
example of a chant.

00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:17.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: OK.

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:17.840 align:middle line:90%
Excuse my voice.

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:18.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a singer.

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:20.570 align:middle line:84%
Here's one that will
call in spirits.

00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:22.505 align:middle line:84%
If you really want
to lift and do the--

00:29:22.505 --> 00:29:25.133 align:middle line:90%
[CHANTING VOWEL SOUNDS]

00:29:25.133 --> 00:29:29.630 align:middle line:90%


00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:31.130 align:middle line:90%
Vowels talk to spirit.

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:32.370 align:middle line:90%
Vowels open up.

00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:33.170 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:35.810 align:middle line:84%
Every sacred word
is a vowel-- "amen,"

00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:38.990 align:middle line:90%
"om," Native American "hey".

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:40.160 align:middle line:90%
Eastern "ya."

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:42.050 align:middle line:84%
It opens up this
crown of illumination.

00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:45.590 align:middle line:84%
So this [CHANTING VOWEL SOUNDS],,
it's working in to open up.

00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:50.420 align:middle line:84%
But say if I'm doing a money
spell or something, money here,

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:52.190 align:middle line:90%
money now, money, it is mine.

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:54.650 align:middle line:84%
Money here, money now,
money, it is mine.

00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And you're building
it, building it.

00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:58.010 align:middle line:84%
And you send it up
to the universe.

00:29:58.010 --> 00:29:59.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're scaring me.

00:29:59.250 --> 00:29:59.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Sorry.

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:00.340 align:middle line:90%
I do scare people.

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:02.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're scaring me.

00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:04.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: But it's not
scary in a bad way.

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:07.320 align:middle line:84%
It's this grasp,
hold on, believe--

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:08.120 align:middle line:90%
magic, energy.

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:10.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you know
the witch Fiona Horne?

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:12.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: I've not met
her, but I respect her.

00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:13.190 align:middle line:90%
She's great.

00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:14.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good person.

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:15.990 align:middle line:84%
But I had a chance
to interview her

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:19.970 align:middle line:84%
on "Beyond Belief"
about gratitude spells.

00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:23.540 align:middle line:84%
When you cast a spell, you're
trying to accomplish something.

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:24.890 align:middle line:90%
Can you give us an example?

00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:27.470 align:middle line:84%
>>FIONA HORNE: Well, I can give
you a really recent example

00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:29.060 align:middle line:84%
when I was just on
tour in Australia

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:31.490 align:middle line:84%
doing a spoken word event
for my "Art of Witch" book.

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:36.780 align:middle line:84%
And I did an interactive magical
experience with the audience.

00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:39.290 align:middle line:90%
So there were over 200 people.

00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And it was in the Blue
Mountains just west of Sydney,

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:44.150 align:middle line:90%
a very magical place.

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:46.280 align:middle line:90%
And we all did a spell together.

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:49.277 align:middle line:84%
So I invited everyone
to think of something

00:30:49.277 --> 00:30:50.360 align:middle line:90%
that they're grateful for.

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And it was like a
ritual of gratitude,

00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:54.140 align:middle line:90%
but you could call it a spell.

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:56.750 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of
bridging both worlds.

00:30:56.750 --> 00:31:00.170 align:middle line:84%
So I invited everyone to
stand up, first and foremost.

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:00.980 align:middle line:90%
Take a deep breath.

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:01.780 align:middle line:90%
Clear the slate.

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:03.770 align:middle line:84%
So interlace their
10 fingers-- a little

00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:05.240 align:middle line:90%
bit of witchey yoga here.

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:07.057 align:middle line:84%
Wipe the slate
clean on the inhale,

00:31:07.057 --> 00:31:09.140 align:middle line:84%
opening themselves up to
the concept that anything

00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:10.010 align:middle line:90%
is possible.

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:10.890 align:middle line:90%
Flip their hands.

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:11.690 align:middle line:90%
Exhale.

00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:13.297 align:middle line:90%
Anchor into the present moment.

00:31:13.297 --> 00:31:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And anchor into the intention
for the spell, which

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:17.987 align:middle line:84%
is to create more reasons
to be grateful in our lives.

00:31:17.987 --> 00:31:20.570 align:middle line:84%
And then I invited everyone to
think of something that they're

00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:23.750 align:middle line:84%
grateful for, to name
it, to give it a name,

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:25.892 align:middle line:84%
and to then place it in
the palm of their hand.

00:31:25.892 --> 00:31:27.350 align:middle line:84%
So we've got 200
people doing this.

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And everyone's holding
their hands up.

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:30.800 align:middle line:84%
And the reason to be
grateful and the name

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:32.480 align:middle line:90%
is in the palm of their hands.

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And then I invited everyone
to throw their reason

00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:38.090 align:middle line:84%
to be grateful into the
center of the space.

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:40.280 align:middle line:84%
We were all together
in this sacred space

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:41.270 align:middle line:90%
that was determined.

00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And they-- and to name it, to
say the name, to call it out.

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:47.870 align:middle line:84%
So this large explosion
of sound happened

00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:51.410 align:middle line:84%
as everyone called out the name
of what they were grateful for.

00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:53.703 align:middle line:84%
And then we allowed
those reasons

00:31:53.703 --> 00:31:55.370 align:middle line:84%
to be grateful to
circulate in the room.

00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And I was guiding
them with my voice.

00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And I sang a goddess
chant to energize

00:32:00.290 --> 00:32:03.920 align:middle line:84%
the reasons to be grateful
and to have them magnetize

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.650 align:middle line:84%
and become something that
could attract more reasons

00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:08.540 align:middle line:84%
to be grateful into
the lives of everyone.

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:11.450 align:middle line:84%
So I sang this goddess
chant, which goes--

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:12.530 align:middle line:90%
I'll sing it for you.

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:19.364 align:middle line:84%
(SINGING) "Isis, Astarte, Diana,
Hecate, Demeter, Kali, Anana."

00:32:19.364 --> 00:32:21.685 align:middle line:84%
(SPEAKING) And I sang that
over and over and over.

00:32:21.685 --> 00:32:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And you could feel the
energy building in the room.

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:25.190 align:middle line:90%
And everyone's arms are up.

00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:27.440 align:middle line:90%
And energy's building.

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:28.820 align:middle line:90%
And then I said the incantation.

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:29.987 align:middle line:90%
"By one, this spell is done.

00:32:29.987 --> 00:32:31.190 align:middle line:90%
By two, it shall come true.

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:32.840 align:middle line:90%
By three, so must it be.

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:34.160 align:middle line:90%
By four, for the good of all.

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:36.080 align:middle line:90%
By five, our dreams come alive."

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:38.000 align:middle line:90%
And it was like this--

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.530 align:middle line:84%
everyone sort of just went ah
and felt this shift of energy

00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:42.330 align:middle line:90%
in the room.

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:43.550 align:middle line:90%
And that was the spell cast.

00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:47.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is the result. The
amount of emails and messages

00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:49.530 align:middle line:84%
I got on Facebook
from people saying,

00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:51.730 align:middle line:84%
oh my god, my life was
transformed in that moment.

00:32:51.730 --> 00:32:54.147 align:middle line:84%
The next day, this happened,
this happened, this happened.

00:32:54.147 --> 00:32:56.100 align:middle line:90%
Or my reason to be--

00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:58.910 align:middle line:84%
to feel joyful in
life came true.

00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:00.240 align:middle line:90%
And I was transformed.

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:03.000 align:middle line:84%
And this is weeks later,
I'm getting this feedback

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.030 align:middle line:90%
from people.

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:06.930 align:middle line:84%
So I would consider that most
recently a dramatic spell.

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:10.737 align:middle line:84%
And it shows that you don't need
a lot of fancy tools and props.

00:33:10.737 --> 00:33:12.570 align:middle line:84%
When we think of spells,
we think, oh, we've

00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:14.653 align:middle line:84%
got to have all these
candles, all these crystals,

00:33:14.653 --> 00:33:17.610 align:middle line:84%
this exotic herb from the
far-flung corner of the Earth.

00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:19.560 align:middle line:90%
And it's not necessary.

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:22.770 align:middle line:84%
A spell or ritual that creates
profound transformation

00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:25.920 align:middle line:84%
and positive
transformation in life

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:29.040 align:middle line:84%
can happen just with your
desire, your willingness

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:34.080 align:middle line:84%
to believe anything is possible,
breath, movement, sound,

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:36.397 align:middle line:90%
and intention.

00:33:36.397 --> 00:33:38.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So she echoes many of
the things you've already said.

00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:39.813 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Completely.

00:33:39.813 --> 00:33:42.150 align:middle line:84%
Every word she said,
I agree with 100%.

00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's my favorite chart,
the "Isis, Astarte, Diana,

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:45.880 align:middle line:90%
Hecate."

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:46.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:47.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, she's great.

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
potions and spells?

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:51.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Potions and spells--

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:53.080 align:middle line:84%
well, potions are a
mix of things you put.

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:53.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.140 align:middle line:90%
Here's a love potion for you.

00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:59.020 align:middle line:84%
I work-- I personally do work
with a lot of essential oils

00:33:59.020 --> 00:33:59.820 align:middle line:90%
and things.

00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:02.160 align:middle line:84%
So you're putting the different
attributes-- lavender in this--

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't
necessarily drink it.

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:04.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: You don't drink it.

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:05.490 align:middle line:90%
I rarely drink it.

00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:07.497 align:middle line:84%
No, I don't actually,
because really, you

00:34:07.497 --> 00:34:09.330 align:middle line:84%
have to keep me out of
the kitchen, anything

00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:10.920 align:middle line:90%
that's ingestible.

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:12.040 align:middle line:90%
But you might smell it.

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:13.290 align:middle line:90%
You might put the oils on you.

00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:14.320 align:middle line:90%
You might work with them.

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:14.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You mix it.

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:15.659 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: You might put
drops in your bath.

00:34:15.659 --> 00:34:16.459 align:middle line:90%
You mix it.

00:34:16.459 --> 00:34:19.710 align:middle line:84%
But again, it's intent, like
she said, and the creation.

00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:21.960 align:middle line:84%
Spell working is,
again, when you

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:26.590 align:middle line:84%
are I am shifting the natural
trajectory of what life is.

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:28.560 align:middle line:84%
I am bringing in this
or bringing in that.

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:31.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm shifting the natural
pattern of things.

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:35.179 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Potions are
done for specific things?

00:34:35.179 --> 00:34:36.179 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Potions can be.

00:34:36.179 --> 00:34:37.620 align:middle line:84%
Or it could be a
general enhancer.

00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:41.880 align:middle line:84%
I make a lot of enhancers to
multiply, multiply whatever it

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:43.980 align:middle line:90%
is you're feeling or to relax.

00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:46.560 align:middle line:84%
Just like people
into aromatherapy,

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:48.870 align:middle line:84%
they're a kind of
a form of potion.

00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:52.469 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, sniff this to
relax and tea tree oil to that

00:34:52.469 --> 00:34:54.150 align:middle line:90%
and lavender to that.

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:58.290 align:middle line:84%
But potions itself are done
ritualistically or spell

00:34:58.290 --> 00:34:59.220 align:middle line:90%
working-wise.

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:01.770 align:middle line:84%
So they've got I'm doing
them under a moon cycle

00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:03.330 align:middle line:84%
or I'm doing into
a sacred space.

00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And I'm putting my intent
into them, as well as

00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:06.420 align:middle line:90%
all the ingredients.

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:09.133 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you differ,
Patti, from a witch?

00:35:09.133 --> 00:35:10.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: I am a witch.

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:10.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, you're
a witch, too.

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:11.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: I'm a witch.

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:12.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So you're a psychic.

00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:13.690 align:middle line:90%
You do it all.

00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:14.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Yeah, I am a witch.

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:15.530 align:middle line:90%
I claim a witch.

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:16.593 align:middle line:90%
I'm a good witch.

00:35:16.593 --> 00:35:17.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I was going to say.

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:18.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: And I use
the term "good."

00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:20.130 align:middle line:90%
I don't like white or black.

00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:22.710 align:middle line:84%
But I'm a big fan of
Glinda in "Wizard of Oz."

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:24.940 align:middle line:84%
I actually have that
great big pink dress.

00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:25.740 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:26.010 align:middle line:90%
So I'm a good witch.

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:27.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or "Bewitched"?

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:27.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Or "Bewitched."

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:28.050 align:middle line:90%
I love--

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:29.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you
wiggle your nose?

00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:30.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: I've been
working on that one.

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:30.900 align:middle line:90%
But I haven't got it down yet.

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:31.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Twinkle twinkle.

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:32.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Yeah.

00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:34.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the difference,
though, between a good witch

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:34.970 align:middle line:90%
and a bad witch?

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:36.540 align:middle line:90%
What does a bad witch do?

00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:41.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: Well, I think a bad
witch is someone-- again,

00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:43.590 align:middle line:90%
I don't talk dark and light.

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:47.130 align:middle line:84%
A bad which is somebody who
doesn't know the consequence,

00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:49.510 align:middle line:84%
who doesn't look at the
cause and effect, action

00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:50.310 align:middle line:90%
and reaction.

00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:52.620 align:middle line:84%
A bad witch is the one
who takes all the water

00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:53.617 align:middle line:90%
from the villagers.

00:35:53.617 --> 00:35:54.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And doesn't care.

00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: And doesn't care and
then will face the consequence.

00:35:56.730 --> 00:35:59.400 align:middle line:84%
Either they'll come up and
beat up them and kill them.

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:02.040 align:middle line:84%
Or they'll all die or
doesn't care at all.

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:03.420 align:middle line:90%
To me, that's the difference.

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:06.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you had a
preference, of course,

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:08.580 align:middle line:84%
you would take the
good over the bad.

00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:10.020 align:middle line:90%
How many people do that?

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: I think
most people do that.

00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:14.220 align:middle line:90%
I think most people are good.

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:15.810 align:middle line:90%
I am the ultimate optimist.

00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:19.050 align:middle line:90%
But people want to be good.

00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:20.070 align:middle line:90%
People want to be happy.

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:21.180 align:middle line:10%
People want to be safe.

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:23.130 align:middle line:84%
People want to be--
people don't want to--

00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:25.050 align:middle line:84%
even when they are,
oh, I hate that person

00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:26.730 align:middle line:84%
or I curse that
person, it's usually

00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:28.590 align:middle line:84%
just out of their
own insecurities

00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:29.670 align:middle line:90%
or out of whatever.

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:33.150 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a smaller minority
of people who are really evil.

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:34.035 align:middle line:90%
Yes, they do exist.

00:36:34.035 --> 00:36:35.160 align:middle line:90%
Yes, of course, they exist.

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:35.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:37.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: We see it all the time.

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:39.840 align:middle line:84%
But I think most people who
go into the magical arts,

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:42.790 align:middle line:84%
the occult arts, witchcraft,
most of them, again,

00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:45.430 align:middle line:90%
are usually gifted of some sort.

00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:47.430 align:middle line:84%
They do know there's more
out there because they

00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:49.620 align:middle line:84%
see it or they feel
it or they sense it.

00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And most of them do
want to do good with it,

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:54.450 align:middle line:84%
whether for
themselves just for I

00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:57.810 align:middle line:84%
want a good life myself
or on a big global scale.

00:36:57.810 --> 00:36:59.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has been
the most satisfying aspect

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:01.540 align:middle line:90%
of all of this for you?

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:04.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: I think when I see
people turn on that little

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:05.940 align:middle line:90%
light bulb of--

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:09.690 align:middle line:84%
again, not because a spell
worked or a ritual worked but,

00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:11.520 align:middle line:84%
again, seeing
that, oh, wow, they

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:14.280 align:middle line:84%
have more control
over their lives,

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:17.230 align:middle line:84%
over their path, over
what they're doing.

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:18.630 align:middle line:90%
They have sails on their boat.

00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:middle line:84%
They're just not the
wind takes them this way

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.170 align:middle line:84%
and the wind takes
them that way.

00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:23.220 align:middle line:90%
Hey, put up your sail.

00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:24.150 align:middle line:90%
You have a rudder.

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:26.340 align:middle line:84%
You can drive it--
maybe not 100%.

00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:27.630 align:middle line:90%
The storm will come.

00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:30.240 align:middle line:84%
But you really
can create and get

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:33.030 align:middle line:84%
to where you want to go, even
when the little storms come.

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:35.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When people come to
you for help and assistance,

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:39.600 align:middle line:84%
generally, what is some of
the most widespread things

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:41.730 align:middle line:90%
they want done?

00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:44.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: Well, love is always
first-- wanting to belong,

00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:46.740 align:middle line:90%
love.

00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do they need a
psychic which for love stuff?

00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:52.890 align:middle line:84%
Why can't they go out
and find it themselves?

00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:55.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Well, they can.

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:57.030 align:middle line:90%
But so many people don't.

00:37:57.030 --> 00:38:00.120 align:middle line:84%
Or again, they've got
into such a bad headspace

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:02.088 align:middle line:90%
about it or a belief system.

00:38:02.088 --> 00:38:03.630 align:middle line:84%
I can't-- how many
people come to me.

00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:07.110 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, there are no
straight men in this city.

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:09.210 align:middle line:84%
They're all married
or they're all gay.

00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:10.710 align:middle line:90%
It's like, really?

00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:13.930 align:middle line:84%
You are just chanting
that on a regular basis?

00:38:13.930 --> 00:38:15.300 align:middle line:90%
Hey, what if that's not true?

00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:17.160 align:middle line:84%
Let's create that
that's not true.

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:18.420 align:middle line:90%
Let's open your eyes.

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:21.063 align:middle line:84%
And then they're walking around
through life with blinders on.

00:38:21.063 --> 00:38:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to
miss that person, anyway.

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:25.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long does
it take for a spell

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:28.410 align:middle line:84%
that you may do on
someone to take effect?

00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:30.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: It can be
immediate like that.

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:33.180 align:middle line:84%
If they have the faith
in that, it is crazy

00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:34.890 align:middle line:90%
how fast it can take effect.

00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:36.390 align:middle line:84%
But they have a
lot to do with it.

00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:39.830 align:middle line:84%
Again, not always-- it's like,
I want a kabillion dollars.

00:38:39.830 --> 00:38:42.780 align:middle line:84%
They may not get that the next
day unless they win a lottery.

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:45.030 align:middle line:84%
But all of a sudden, their
trajectory, their chain,

00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:47.460 align:middle line:84%
their thought patterns about
what money and abundance

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:48.720 align:middle line:90%
and money is changes.

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:50.920 align:middle line:90%
And everything shifts.

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:51.720 align:middle line:90%
But it's funny.

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:55.140 align:middle line:84%
With love and money, if they're
willing to be open to it,

00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:56.970 align:middle line:90%
it could go fast.

00:38:56.970 --> 00:38:59.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was an old
"Twilight Zone" episode

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:02.910 align:middle line:84%
about a gentleman who
wanted everything.

00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And he found a genie and
was allowed three wishes.

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:09.900 align:middle line:84%
But the genie told
him one thing.

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:15.030 align:middle line:84%
He said, each wish comes
with a consequence.

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:17.340 align:middle line:90%
And he went, eh.

00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:18.330 align:middle line:90%
I want what I want.

00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:22.620 align:middle line:84%
So he would say things like,
I want omnipotent power

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:24.520 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:26.560 align:middle line:84%
And the genie would
grant him that.

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:28.600 align:middle line:90%
He turned him into Hitler.

00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:29.980 align:middle line:90%
That was the consequence.

00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And they showed the
debacle with Hitler.

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:36.520 align:middle line:84%
Or he'd want money,
and then he'd

00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:38.720 align:middle line:90%
have all the money in the world.

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:40.270 align:middle line:90%
But he'd have no arms and legs.

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:42.490 align:middle line:90%
He'd be in a bed.

00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:44.062 align:middle line:90%
So everything had a consequence.

00:39:44.062 --> 00:39:45.520 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe
that's what life is?

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:46.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: Yes, I will believe.

00:39:46.810 --> 00:39:50.350 align:middle line:10%
Again, versus consequence,
it is consequence.

00:39:50.350 --> 00:39:53.672 align:middle line:10%
But it is that action and
reaction, cause and effect.

00:39:53.672 --> 00:39:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And that goes right back
to science, as well as

00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:56.740 align:middle line:90%
spirituality.

00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:58.720 align:middle line:84%
What you do is going to
shift something else.

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:01.940 align:middle line:84%
You slide the kid over on the
bed, the other kid falls off.

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:03.530 align:middle line:90%
That's what happens.

00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:05.597 align:middle line:84%
So again, you work
it so that it's

00:40:05.597 --> 00:40:07.180 align:middle line:84%
a positive thing or
it's something you

00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:09.130 align:middle line:90%
can afford that coin to pay.

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:11.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Put a spell on us
that we want 10 million people

00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:12.610 align:middle line:90%
to watch this show.

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:13.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NEGRI: OK.

00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:15.662 align:middle line:84%
We want 10 million people
to watch this show.

00:40:15.662 --> 00:40:17.120 align:middle line:10%
So we're going to
do it right here.

00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:18.290 align:middle line:10%
So picture it in your head.

00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:19.790 align:middle line:10%
Believe it.

00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:21.463 align:middle line:10%
Take a deep breath
in and then just

00:40:21.463 --> 00:40:22.630 align:middle line:10%
breathe it out to the world.

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:23.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Super.

00:40:23.470 --> 00:40:25.330 align:middle line:84%
Patti, thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:26.823 align:middle line:84%
>>NEGRI: Thank you
so much, George.

00:40:26.823 --> 00:40:28.240 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's
fascinating that you

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:32.110 align:middle line:10%
can use spells and potions
and practical ideas

00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:34.700 align:middle line:10%
to get what you want in life.

00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:36.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to give it a try.

00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:38.692 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:40:38.692 --> 00:40:42.210 align:middle line:90%
