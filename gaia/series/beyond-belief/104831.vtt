>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And I
think many people today don't

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:08.600 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.420 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.080 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.570 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.055 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.780 align:middle line:10%
You will see two
incredible programs

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.439 align:middle line:10%
over the next several weeks.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.180 align:middle line:84%
These shows will simply
boggle your mind.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.800 align:middle line:84%
Boggle your mind, I say,
because Eldon Taylor is with us.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.750 align:middle line:10%
He's a bestselling author.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.060 align:middle line:10%
But he deals with
the human mind.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.820 align:middle line:10%
His latest work is called
"Mind Programming," which

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.730 align:middle line:10%
is an incredible book, Eldon.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:50.890 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ELDON TAYLOR:
Thank you very much.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.950 align:middle line:84%
It's my pleasure to
join you, George.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know when I
was looking at all your work

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.700 align:middle line:84%
over the years, I kept saying
to myself, this is scary stuff.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.070 align:middle line:90%
This isn't just pure science.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.320 align:middle line:90%
This isn't just manipulation.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.270 align:middle line:90%
This is control.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.325 align:middle line:84%
How did you get interested
in mind programming?

00:01:14.325 --> 00:01:18.730 align:middle line:10%
>>TAYLOR: That's a long story,
but it begins in years past

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.950 align:middle line:10%
when I was practicing
criminalistics.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.810 align:middle line:10%
I found myself dealing with
lie detection scenarios,

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.960 align:middle line:10%
as I was a lie detection
examiner for years.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And I heard that LA
Police Department

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.000 align:middle line:84%
had utilized a technology,
a subliminal technology,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.440 align:middle line:84%
to dehydrate the
cadets in the academy.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
they did so is they

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.210 align:middle line:84%
were preparing for the
Los Angeles Olympics.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they had a
terrorist abduction scenario

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.290 align:middle line:84%
that played out, like
there are so many hours

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.730 align:middle line:84%
spent on the phone
in negotiation.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.120 align:middle line:84%
They would play
this white sound,

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.680 align:middle line:84%
the sound of an air conditioner
or a heater in the background.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.040 align:middle line:84%
It would have hidden messages,
and those hidden messages

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.210 align:middle line:84%
were designed to affect the
nervous system, dehydrate.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.370 align:middle line:84%
They would suggest
to the abductors

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.960 align:middle line:84%
that they were in an area
that was contaminated,

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.890 align:middle line:84%
and if they were
to see symptoms of,

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.370 align:middle line:90%
they'd describe the symptoms.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.570 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the idea was that
by pumping this information in,

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.850 align:middle line:84%
they would begin to
manifest the symptoms.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.490 align:middle line:84%
When I heard about this, I
was really amazed at the idea

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.740 align:middle line:84%
that you can hide a
message that would affect

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.694 align:middle line:90%
the human body in that way.

00:02:40.694 --> 00:02:42.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, the long and
the short of it

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.130 align:middle line:84%
is I've never been able
to, despite attempts,

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.750 align:middle line:84%
either confirm or get
that story denied.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.190 align:middle line:84%
But it changed the direction
of my career at that point.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.260 align:middle line:84%
Because I thought,
OK, now wait a minute.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.000 align:middle line:84%
If that can happen, I
can solve a major problem

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.180 align:middle line:90%
in lie detection.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.170 align:middle line:84%
20% percent, approximately,
of those people

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.080 align:middle line:84%
that come in for a lie detection
test, they're inconclusive.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.372 align:middle line:90%
You have an honest person, but--

00:03:09.372 --> 00:03:10.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's
nervous or something.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.230 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Yes, so much
situational stress with them

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.560 align:middle line:84%
that you can't say they
practiced deception,

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.520 align:middle line:90%
and you can't say they haven't.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When I was a
kid, I'd go to the doctor,

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.210 align:middle line:84%
and they'd give me a
little blood pressure test.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.390 align:middle line:84%
All the time, I would be off
the charts-- off the charts.

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And for a while, they
thought, oh, my God, what's

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:31.670 align:middle line:90%
wrong with this kid?

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:32.567 align:middle line:90%
Is he sick?

00:03:32.567 --> 00:03:33.525 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: That's right.

00:03:33.525 --> 00:03:38.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they decided that
there is a symptom that is

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.520 align:middle line:90%
called--

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.060 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: White coat.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yup.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.850 align:middle line:84%
You walk into an office, you
just go right through the roof.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And after a while,
you calm down,

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.400 align:middle line:84%
they give it to you again,
and then maybe the third time,

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.900 align:middle line:90%
and then you're normal.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And I would guess that's
the same with somebody who's

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.670 align:middle line:84%
innocent, telling the
truth, but you wire him up,

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.250 align:middle line:90%
it's just-- choom.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.149 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well, and
think about it this way.

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:02.940 align:middle line:84%
When you go to your
doctor, and by the way,

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.100 align:middle line:84%
they don't wear white coats
anymore for that reason.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.099 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, they don't.

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:06.730 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.560 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: But when
you go to your doctor,

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.280 align:middle line:84%
he's just running a test to see
if you're well or maybe what's

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.300 align:middle line:84%
behind the symptoms that
you're manifesting, OK?

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.530 align:middle line:84%
But you can just go
in for a physical

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.610 align:middle line:84%
to play sports and
be nervous about it.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.320 align:middle line:84%
Imagine, now, how much
amplified that is when you go in

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.720 align:middle line:84%
to take a lie detection
test because perhaps you're

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.960 align:middle line:84%
a suspect in a crime
that could lock you away.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.612 align:middle line:84%
They put handcuffs on
you and take you to jail.

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:40.820 align:middle line:90%
Your kids see that happening.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.120 align:middle line:90%


00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.690 align:middle line:90%
So there's a tremendous--

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And then you also have the
perpetrator who schools himself

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.000 align:middle line:90%
in countermeasures.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.940 align:middle line:84%
John DeLorean's
lie detection test,

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.170 align:middle line:84%
among lie detection examiners,
is a perfect example of this.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.800 align:middle line:84%
You see him moving,
and he won't sit still.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.435 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was he doing
that on purpose?

00:05:04.435 --> 00:05:05.310 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Absolutely.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.559 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Somebody trained him.

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:07.730 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah, absolutely.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.940 align:middle line:84%
He had been prepared to take
that lie detection test.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And when it was given
to him, David Raskin,

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.510 align:middle line:84%
University of Utah, conducted
the test I'm talking about.

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:22.100 align:middle line:84%
He, too, passed the test,
or it was inconclusive.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.670 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't say he was
practicing deception

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:25.560 align:middle line:90%
on the basis of it.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.500 align:middle line:84%
But if you can't get somebody
to sit still, it's irrelevant.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.130 align:middle line:90%
That's a whole other story.

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.000 align:middle line:90%
Bottom line is this.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.030 align:middle line:84%
I thought if I could
use this information

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.930 align:middle line:84%
to minimize the impact
of inconclusives,

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.670 align:middle line:84%
if I could do away
with inconclusives,

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.237 align:middle line:84%
my agency would be at
the top of the charts.

00:05:46.237 --> 00:05:46.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huge.

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:47.486 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Right.

00:05:47.486 --> 00:05:51.060 align:middle line:84%
So I went to work on
finding everything

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.050 align:middle line:84%
that I could find about
subliminal communication.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.610 align:middle line:84%
How did they do it,
da-da-da, da-da-da-da.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.110 align:middle line:84%
Make a long story short, I
bought all the audiotapes

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.735 align:middle line:84%
that were out there
on the marketplace.

00:06:01.735 --> 00:06:02.985 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everything out there.

00:06:02.985 --> 00:06:05.294 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah, because I
called them on the phone.

00:06:05.294 --> 00:06:07.960 align:middle line:84%
I had called these manufacturers
and said, "how do you do this?"

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.187 align:middle line:84%
And you'd think I was
asking for the secret recipe

00:06:10.187 --> 00:06:10.770 align:middle line:90%
for Coca-Cola.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:11.395 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:06:11.395 --> 00:06:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And they deny it,
first of all, right?

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:14.830 align:middle line:90%
We don't do this stuff.

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.070 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well, the people
I was calling actually

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.622 align:middle line:84%
claimed to make
subliminal programs.

00:06:19.622 --> 00:06:21.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They made
this, all right.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.663 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: So I bought
all these tapes,

00:06:22.663 --> 00:06:25.040 align:middle line:84%
and I sent them to audio
forensic laboratories.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.360 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what's on these?

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where's the message?

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:27.715 align:middle line:90%
How are they doing this?

00:06:27.715 --> 00:06:28.340 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.880 align:middle line:90%
Well, I get this phone call.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.750 align:middle line:84%
It says, Eldon, there's
nothing on these.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.940 align:middle line:84%
We have stripped it off,
whatever they've done.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.756 align:middle line:84%
Well, I subsequently
learned that, most of,

00:06:39.756 --> 00:06:42.490 align:middle line:84%
every one of these
tapes, they bury

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.530 align:middle line:84%
it 50, 60 dB beneath
the primary carrier.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:46.920 align:middle line:90%
So you don't really get it out.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:47.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can't pull it out.

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:47.730 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: No, it's not there.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But does the
human mind pull it out?

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.660 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: No, not
at that level, no.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:51.451 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I see, OK.

00:06:51.451 --> 00:06:53.310 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: No, you
have to have a signal

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.675 align:middle line:84%
strength sufficient to
cause the neuron to fire,

00:06:55.675 --> 00:06:58.560 align:middle line:84%
or you're not going to
process any information.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.520 align:middle line:84%
So at any rate,
I then set about,

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.040 align:middle line:90%
what hard evidence is there?

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And we went to the
university library.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:10.340 align:middle line:84%
We pulled all the psych
and med abstracts.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:14.260 align:middle line:84%
We ended up
developing a mast way

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:20.230 align:middle line:84%
to deliver information that
bypasses critical awareness.

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And then we took this back to
the lie detection scenario.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:28.360 align:middle line:84%
Not only did it end
inconclusives almost virtually,

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.020 align:middle line:84%
but the confession
rate, George--

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.920 align:middle line:84%
we were dealing with just
some simple messages that

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:39.440 align:middle line:84%
'truth shall set you
free', simple messages.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.990 align:middle line:84%
Honestly, and I know
you'll never be,

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:47.040 align:middle line:84%
but if you're ever in
a situation like that,

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.025 align:middle line:84%
interrogations don't get serious
in the first three hours.

00:07:50.025 --> 00:07:51.400 align:middle line:84%
You just kind of
cool your heels.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.570 align:middle line:84%
Because everybody knows you're
not going to get a confession.

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:58.150 align:middle line:84%
So it's after that
first three hours

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:01.296 align:middle line:84%
that the interrogations
start heating up.

00:08:01.296 --> 00:08:04.060 align:middle line:84%
I was getting
confessions so rapidly it

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.395 align:middle line:84%
was almost like I wanted
to say, whoa, wait,

00:08:06.395 --> 00:08:07.709 align:middle line:90%
I'm paid by the hour.

00:08:07.709 --> 00:08:09.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you gotten
the point, though,

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:14.510 align:middle line:84%
that the guilty person wanted
to take a lie detector test just

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:17.526 align:middle line:84%
to prove that he wasn't
guilty even though he was?

00:08:17.526 --> 00:08:18.790 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Oh, yes.

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:24.155 align:middle line:84%
You have those overconfident,
sometimes sociopathic people.

00:08:24.155 --> 00:08:26.446 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because they figure
they have nothing to lose,

00:08:26.446 --> 00:08:26.510 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:28.560 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah, I
mean, "I'll volunteer

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.950 align:middle line:84%
to take a lie detection test"
is evidence in their minds

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:34.742 align:middle line:84%
a priori that they
didn't commit the crime.

00:08:34.742 --> 00:08:36.158 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They
didn't do it, right?

00:08:36.158 --> 00:08:36.830 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Right.

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:40.440 align:middle line:84%
It becomes, well, why
would I have volunteered

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.530 align:middle line:90%
if they failed the test, see?

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:46.230 align:middle line:84%
So it can become all
a part of their alibi.

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, are these
tests admissible or not?

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.020 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: They can be
admissible by stipulation.

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.870 align:middle line:90%


00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:58.310 align:middle line:84%
The real art of lie
detection, which is really

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:01.190 align:middle line:84%
what we're here to talk
about, but the real art of lie

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:04.130 align:middle line:84%
detection is not
in the equipment.

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:05.005 align:middle line:90%
It's in the examiner.

00:09:05.005 --> 00:09:06.296 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How they interpret it.

00:09:06.296 --> 00:09:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Your equipment is
just sophisticated biofeedback,

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.250 align:middle line:90%
that's all.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:16.670 align:middle line:84%
It's what follows the lie
detection examination that

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:18.740 align:middle line:90%
leads to its real merit.

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:19.764 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:09:19.764 --> 00:09:21.555 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: But during
the interview process,

00:09:21.555 --> 00:09:27.170 align:middle line:84%
there's an unbelievable amount
of uncovering that goes on.

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:30.540 align:middle line:84%
You and I-- if I were to say
to you, OK, George, today

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:33.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to ask you
a couple of questions

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:35.700 align:middle line:84%
that we'll use in a
zone of comparison

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.170 align:middle line:84%
to just be sure you're
telling me the truth.

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:41.575 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to ask
you, did you ever

00:09:41.575 --> 00:09:43.090 align:middle line:90%
lie to someone that trusted you?

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:44.290 align:middle line:90%
You're not a liar, are you?

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:47.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No, I didn't lie on
purpose, not to hurt them.

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:48.710 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Well, we know, right?

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:49.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah. [LAUGHS]

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.076 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: So we know
that that's a forced lie.

00:09:51.076 --> 00:09:54.220 align:middle line:84%
We know there's no such thing
as somebody who didn't lie

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:55.490 align:middle line:90%
to somebody that trusted them.

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:57.020 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm going to
say to you, did you

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.364 align:middle line:90%
ever steal anything, George?

00:09:58.364 --> 00:09:59.530 align:middle line:90%
You're not a thief, are you?

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:01.071 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Once when
I was a little boy

00:10:01.071 --> 00:10:03.560 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't think
I was stealing,

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.990 align:middle line:84%
there were some little
pocket knives down

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:10.440 align:middle line:84%
on the floor next to a
cash register as if they

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.280 align:middle line:90%
were in the garbage or rubbish.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.870 align:middle line:90%
I was 10 years old.

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:20.680 align:middle line:84%
I reached down in the dust and
the rubble and took it home.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.390 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: OK, but today you
recognize that was wrong.

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:25.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My mother
made me take it back.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.805 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Oh, that was nice
of you to take it back.

00:10:27.805 --> 00:10:29.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But I didn't
do it to steal it.

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.186 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was
being thrown out.

00:10:30.186 --> 00:10:32.269 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: When I asked
this question to you today,

00:10:32.269 --> 00:10:35.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to say, other than
that pocket knife, George,

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.900 align:middle line:84%
you've never stolen
anything, have you?

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:38.621 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Correct.

00:10:38.621 --> 00:10:40.120 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: And the
fact of the matter

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.251 align:middle line:84%
is that you and I both
know that's not true.

00:10:42.251 --> 00:10:43.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean to put
you on the spot.

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, I haven't.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.821 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: No doubt
you took something

00:10:45.821 --> 00:10:47.222 align:middle line:84%
from your parents
or your brother

00:10:47.222 --> 00:10:48.930 align:middle line:84%
or a pencil from the
place that you work.

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:50.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, sir.

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:50.812 align:middle line:90%
No, sir.

00:10:50.812 --> 00:10:52.970 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: [LAUGHS]

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:55.534 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But it is a
part of mind programming.

00:10:55.534 --> 00:10:56.200 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: It is.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.366 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: People can do that.

00:10:57.366 --> 00:11:01.240 align:middle line:84%
So let's get into the
basis of why they do this.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.540 align:middle line:90%
And who does it?

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:07.637 align:middle line:84%
Government, industry, stores--
who's mind programming us?

00:11:07.637 --> 00:11:08.470 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Everybody.

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:14.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think that the
greatest misconception today is

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:18.820 align:middle line:84%
that I make my own choices,
that I am an informed person,

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:22.430 align:middle line:84%
and I can decide what
I want to decide.

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:28.800 align:middle line:84%
We live in a society where--
by now trillions of dollars--

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:33.050 align:middle line:84%
in the '80s it was a $10 billion
a year, the estimate that

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:36.170 align:middle line:84%
was spent by industry
and government

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:39.090 align:middle line:84%
on learning to plumb
your subconscious,

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:42.380 align:middle line:84%
learning to motivate
you, control you.

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:47.440 align:middle line:84%
Our mandatory educational system
is a copy of a Prussian 1812

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:52.120 align:middle line:84%
system that Dewey and
Thorndike both said

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:56.780 align:middle line:84%
essentially existed to teach
you to be a good citizen,

00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:00.790 align:middle line:84%
to think in a certain way, to
give you the alternatives that

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:03.860 align:middle line:90%
were the appropriate decisions.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:08.460 align:middle line:84%
We didn't look at the
history of this country.

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:11.650 align:middle line:10%
And we have to go to a man
by the name of Edward Bernays

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:12.610 align:middle line:10%
when we look at--

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:14.270 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Mr. Public
Relations, right?

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:15.300 align:middle line:10%
He was the first--

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:19.610 align:middle line:10%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah, the father of
what today we call propaganda.

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:21.910 align:middle line:84%
In his famous book,
"Propaganda," he

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:25.960 align:middle line:84%
said it's the duty of
the elite to orchestrate

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:29.370 align:middle line:84%
the understanding of
the masses in order

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:31.790 align:middle line:90%
to have a cohesive society.

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:33.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What year was
he around doing this?

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well, Bernays was
a nephew of Sigmund Freud.

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:39.085 align:middle line:90%
And he saw what Freud did.

00:12:39.085 --> 00:12:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And he said, hey, there's
a real opportunity here,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000 align:middle line:84%
not for purposes
of healing someone

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.110 align:middle line:90%
but for purposes of controlling.

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:50.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Manipulation.

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:50.845 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:12:50.845 --> 00:12:54.790 align:middle line:84%
And so he advised
President Woodrow Wilson.

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:59.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're talking the
turn of the 20th century,

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:01.860 align:middle line:90%
early 1900s.

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:08.360 align:middle line:84%
He was involved in government
takeovers in South America,

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:13.490 align:middle line:84%
supporting companies
like the food industry.

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:17.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think Hitler
watched what he did or maybe

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:18.590 align:middle line:90%
even read what he did?

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:20.227 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well, we
know that Goebbels--

00:13:20.227 --> 00:13:21.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Minister of Propaganda.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:24.580 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah, he ate it up.

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:25.580 align:middle line:90%
He was a hero.

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:28.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Bernays
was Goebbels' hero.

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:32.850 align:middle line:84%
So there's no doubt
about that whatsoever.

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And what we have
to understand is

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.460 align:middle line:84%
Bernays really
fathered something

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:38.800 align:middle line:90%
we call scientific marketing.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.340 align:middle line:84%
But the scientific
marketing of those days,

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:47.920 align:middle line:84%
maybe a blood pressure
cuff or a pneumo,

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:51.480 align:middle line:84%
like a lie detection,
that was designed

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:55.860 align:middle line:84%
see how you responded
to an ad or to a picture

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:59.990 align:middle line:84%
in order to be able to
present something to you

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:02.490 align:middle line:90%
that stimulated you, all right?

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:04.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then they went
into the galvanic skin response.

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah, they
used GSR all the time.

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:09.001 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And now what they
have going-- listen to this.

00:14:09.001 --> 00:14:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And you're probably
aware of this.

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:14.780 align:middle line:84%
They have eye tracking,
where they test you,

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:18.790 align:middle line:84%
and they'll play a commercial
to a group of people

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:22.550 align:middle line:84%
that this test tracks
their eye movements.

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:25.880 align:middle line:84%
So a car comes out
with a gorgeous woman.

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:28.350 align:middle line:84%
They want to know, what
is the guy looking at?

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:30.070 align:middle line:90%
Is he looking at the car?

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:31.530 align:middle line:90%
Is he looking at the woman?

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:34.160 align:middle line:84%
What is that mind
really trying to do?

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And they get their
data that way.

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:39.100 align:middle line:84%
And they realize the guy's
looking at the woman, not

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:40.000 align:middle line:90%
the car.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And so they know how to do their
commercials based around that.

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:44.380 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:46.660 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: It goes even
further than that.

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:50.030 align:middle line:84%
A friend of mine in Mexico
is using that technology

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:51.730 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it was
developed here in America.

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:57.110 align:middle line:90%
But here's how far it goes.

00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:01.330 align:middle line:84%
FMRI, Functional Magnetic
Resonance Imaging,

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.790 align:middle line:84%
gives us the ability to
watch the brain live-time.

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:08.480 align:middle line:84%
So we can see how the
brain responds to stimulus.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:13.720 align:middle line:84%
OK, we know that if you
show a cigarette smoker,

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:17.940 align:middle line:84%
the Surgeon General's warning
on a pack of cigarettes,

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:22.120 align:middle line:84%
that the reward center in
the brain becomes excited.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:25.460 align:middle line:84%
It causes him to
want to smoke more.

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:26.564 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That slogan?

00:15:26.564 --> 00:15:27.480 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: That slogan.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.730 align:middle line:90%
So they make it larger, bolder.

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:30.390 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:31.830 align:middle line:84%
Originally it was a
small, black thing.

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:33.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You would think
it would scare them away.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:33.742 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't...

00:15:33.742 --> 00:15:34.949 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: But it doesn't, no.

00:15:34.949 --> 00:15:36.180 align:middle line:90%
It has the opposite effect.

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:39.660 align:middle line:84%
So by using all
of these sciences,

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:43.860 align:middle line:84%
we've come to understand how to
motivate people to do things.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:49.050 align:middle line:84%
George, you talked about
the car and a girl.

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:53.320 align:middle line:84%
We know that one study,
and there are many,

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:56.430 align:middle line:84%
but one study
paired an automobile

00:15:56.430 --> 00:16:00.120 align:middle line:84%
with a beautiful woman
scantily dressed-- bikini, OK?

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And men in the study
were asked to rate

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:06.050 align:middle line:90%
the speeds of the automobiles.

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:08.490 align:middle line:84%
They always rated the one
with the beautiful woman

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:10.085 align:middle line:90%
as being the fastest.

00:16:10.085 --> 00:16:14.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, they were brought back a
week later-- same automobiles,

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:16.340 align:middle line:90%
different colors, mixed up.

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:18.360 align:middle line:90%
She was on a different car.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.940 align:middle line:84%
Again, they rated the
automobile that she

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:23.690 align:middle line:90%
stood with as the fastest car.

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:26.030 align:middle line:84%
When it was pointed
out to them, they

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:28.920 align:middle line:90%
rationalized their decisions.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.670 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't
admit that, indeed,

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:35.530 align:middle line:84%
this woman, just her presence
in front of that automobile,

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:38.700 align:middle line:90%
predisposed their decision.

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:40.780 align:middle line:84%
The sophistication
is so good that we

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:45.850 align:middle line:84%
know if I had a jar of hand
sanitizer on the table,

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:49.050 align:middle line:84%
and I were to give you
a test, and the test

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:51.650 align:middle line:84%
was designed to
measure whether you

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:54.910 align:middle line:84%
were conservative or liberal
in your characteristics,

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:58.330 align:middle line:84%
your beliefs, that that
jar of hand sanitizer

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:01.517 align:middle line:84%
would skew you to the
conservative side.

00:17:01.517 --> 00:17:02.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just by using it?

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:04.380 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Just by
having it on the table.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:05.380 align:middle line:90%
Now, you think about it.

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:06.220 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.819 align:middle line:90%
Well, what is a hand sanitizer?

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:11.220 align:middle line:90%
It's protection.

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:12.079 align:middle line:90%
It's conservative.

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:12.780 align:middle line:90%
It's conscious.

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:15.619 align:middle line:84%
It's washing your hands and make
sure that there are no germs,

00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:16.490 align:middle line:90%
you see.

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:21.500 align:middle line:84%
All these little primes
are known so well.

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:25.010 align:middle line:84%
During Barack Obama's
last campaign,

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:29.060 align:middle line:84%
he utilized what everybody
calls a dream team.

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:32.400 align:middle line:84%
This was a group of the
best social psychologists

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.890 align:middle line:84%
on the planet who have studied
all of this kind of thing.

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:38.500 align:middle line:84%
They've written books on
compliance principles.

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:39.389 align:middle line:90%
They've run studies.

00:17:39.389 --> 00:17:40.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're
experts at this.

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:43.200 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: They are
the experts, OK?

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:46.620 align:middle line:84%
They scripted
literally every word

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:49.160 align:middle line:84%
that his canvas people
used on the phone

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.290 align:middle line:90%
or when they went door to door.

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:54.930 align:middle line:84%
And they weren't
allowed to vary from it.

00:17:54.930 --> 00:18:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And he carried out probably
the best-executed engineering

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:04.760 align:middle line:84%
of belief systems
that we've ever

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:11.590 align:middle line:84%
seen in a political campaign due
to these social psychologists.

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:16.120 align:middle line:84%
Both parties-- I'm not meaning
to say liberals do something,

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:17.460 align:middle line:90%
conservatives don't.

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:19.330 align:middle line:84%
They were just a little
more sophisticated

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:20.500 align:middle line:90%
in the last campaign.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:24.530 align:middle line:84%
But both parties are using a lot
of these compliance principles.

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:28.210 align:middle line:84%
Government has done all kinds
of this sort of research.

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:31.500 align:middle line:84%
But private industry
has as well.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:35.240 align:middle line:90%
And the data is robust.

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:40.250 align:middle line:84%
When we come to think about why
we did what we did, most of us

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:43.730 align:middle line:84%
do it without understanding
what was behind it.

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:47.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In Missouri, they
have a Republican gubernatorial

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:50.090 align:middle line:90%
candidate who committed suicide.

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:51.610 align:middle line:90%
He was the state auditor.

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:53.590 align:middle line:90%
He committed suicide.

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:56.880 align:middle line:84%
Many think he
committed suicide over

00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:02.970 align:middle line:84%
the aggressive political ads of
his other Republican opponents.

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:05.120 align:middle line:90%
This was a primary fight.

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And he killed himself over it,
I mean, strange and bizarre

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:10.630 align:middle line:90%
as it was.

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:12.330 align:middle line:90%
But they attacked him.

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:14.460 align:middle line:84%
They called him the
Barney Fife, that he

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.790 align:middle line:90%
looked like Don Knotts did.

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:18.220 align:middle line:90%
And he couldn't handle it.

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:20.240 align:middle line:90%
And he killed himself over it.

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:24.290 align:middle line:84%
Words and manipulation
can be destructive.

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:26.100 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Absolutely.

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:31.690 align:middle line:84%
We see that a lot today
with teenagers and abuses

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:35.190 align:middle line:84%
and bullying that goes
on, not just in person

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:36.360 align:middle line:90%
but over the internet.

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:40.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are a number of
stories about Facebook postings

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:43.590 align:middle line:84%
that have driven
people to suicide.

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:48.950 align:middle line:84%
We live in a time-- Philip
Zimbardo, who I know you know,

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:51.480 align:middle line:84%
wrote a book called
"The Lucifer Effect."

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And his comment was, whenever
we're dealing with stimulus

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:03.260 align:middle line:84%
that we don't understand, it
produces anxiety, keeps us

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.380 align:middle line:84%
in a heightened
state of arousal.

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:08.480 align:middle line:84%
It will lead to
manifesting symptoms that

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.940 align:middle line:90%
are psychological in nature.

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:16.900 align:middle line:84%
So we live in a time that
our threshold of arousal

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:22.450 align:middle line:84%
is such that we're all
basically inundated 24/7

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:26.120 align:middle line:84%
with so much information
that we're on a verge.

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And most of this
stimulus is unrecognized.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And because it's unrecognized,
we try to sort it out.

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.370 align:middle line:84%
We try to decide,
well, what is it?

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:39.670 align:middle line:90%
Why am I feeling this way?

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:41.260 align:middle line:90%
What has me on edge?

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And we see all kinds of
ways that that's acted out.

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And many of them are
just simply not healthy.

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:52.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: During the tragedy
of 9/11 back in 2001,

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:56.740 align:middle line:84%
they came out with a color
scheme, a coded color scheme,

00:20:56.740 --> 00:21:01.500 align:middle line:84%
to tell you how bad the next
terrorist possibility would be.

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:02.640 align:middle line:90%
I hated that.

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.120 align:middle line:90%
I thought it was manipulation.

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:07.110 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was fear-mongering,
where they would change

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:11.750 align:middle line:84%
their colors, and the closer you
got to red, the more dangerous

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:12.710 align:middle line:90%
it was going to be.

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:15.280 align:middle line:84%
They've subsequently
stopped that.

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.960 align:middle line:84%
I've always wondered
what happened

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.450 align:middle line:90%
to have them stop that.

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:22.750 align:middle line:84%
I know why they started it, of
course, to keep us all on edge.

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:23.650 align:middle line:90%
Something happened.

00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:26.120 align:middle line:84%
Somebody told them,
"don't do this anymore."

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:27.139 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:21:27.139 --> 00:21:28.430 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: I don't know, George.

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:30.180 align:middle line:10%
The answer is, I don't know.

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:31.570 align:middle line:10%
There are many possibilities.

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:34.450 align:middle line:10%
I think essentially
my take on that

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:36.330 align:middle line:10%
is it had served its purpose.

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:39.690 align:middle line:84%
We gave away a whole
lot of our rights

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:43.764 align:middle line:90%
in this country due to that.

00:21:43.764 --> 00:21:45.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was it
great programming?

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:46.390 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Yeah, I believe so.

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:48.320 align:middle line:90%
I absolutely believe so.

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:51.010 align:middle line:84%
Let's contrast it
with something.

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:54.049 align:middle line:84%
You remember David Koresh in
Waco, Texas, Janet Napolitano.

00:21:54.049 --> 00:21:54.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I sure do.

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:59.760 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: OK,
during Desert Storm,

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:03.380 align:middle line:84%
Operation Solo would
take frequencies--

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:10.160 align:middle line:84%
we think of these frequencies as
being in the infra-sound area,

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:13.420 align:middle line:90%
like 20 to 24 Hertz base.

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:18.540 align:middle line:84%
We don't hear them,
but we process them.

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And what happens when
we process them is

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:24.030 align:middle line:90%
they create a level of anxiety.

00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:27.100 align:middle line:84%
They make us feel anxious,
like something bad is

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:28.570 align:middle line:90%
about to happen.

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And a continued delivery of this
can cause nervous breakdowns.

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:41.370 align:middle line:84%
So during Desert Storm, we
pumped these frequencies on top

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:43.350 align:middle line:84%
of, piggybacked
them if you will,

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:45.780 align:middle line:90%
on top of normal broadcasts.

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And many people say
that was a good deal

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:53.810 align:middle line:84%
of the reason behind why so
many of the Republican Guard

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:58.130 align:middle line:84%
just surrendered, just put down
their weapons and walked in.

00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:04.180 align:middle line:84%
OK, David Koresh--
Soviet advisers--

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:05.820 align:middle line:84%
and I know this from
Shelia Ostrander,

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:08.460 align:middle line:90%
author of "Superlearning."

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:10.140 align:middle line:90%
She sent me information.

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.080 align:middle line:90%
We'd correspond and talk.

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:16.240 align:middle line:84%
Soviet advisers told
our people, don't

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:19.650 align:middle line:90%
do this in the Waco situation.

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:21.420 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what could happen.

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:29.100 align:middle line:84%
If you take these Tibetan
mantras and then piggyback

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.950 align:middle line:84%
these frequencies on them,
anything could happen.

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:33.740 align:middle line:90%
It could become very explosive.

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:36.560 align:middle line:84%
They're not necessarily going
to-- well, he did it anyway.

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:39.664 align:middle line:84%
We ran trucks, sound
trucks around the facility.

00:23:39.664 --> 00:23:40.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The compound.

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:43.170 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: That's right,
the compound doings.

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:45.030 align:middle line:90%
So everybody knows what happens.

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:47.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all that
anxiety built up,

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:50.250 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly there was a
shootout, an explosion.

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:54.132 align:middle line:90%
And we provoked that.

00:23:54.132 --> 00:23:55.590 align:middle line:84%
What would have
happened otherwise?

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:56.560 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:00.090 align:middle line:84%
But it's easy to look in
20/20 hindsight and see

00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:03.434 align:middle line:84%
that the Soviets, who worked
a lot with this technology,

00:24:03.434 --> 00:24:05.460 align:middle line:90%
in fact--

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:06.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They knew.

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:09.260 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Carl Schleicher,
the late Carl Schleicher,

00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:14.710 align:middle line:84%
who was the founder of Mankind
Research-- Mankind is still

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:16.820 align:middle line:84%
involved in some of
this kind of thing--

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:22.330 align:middle line:84%
told me the Soviets were
using it during the Cold War.

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:26.780 align:middle line:84%
They were pumping this
information on our embassy,

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:29.560 align:middle line:84%
and that's why we had
so many ambassadors

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:33.430 align:middle line:84%
that we lost over there
due to physical conditions.

00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:36.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they would
become very ill.

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:37.340 align:middle line:90%
We had to pull them out.

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:39.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing, though.

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:42.630 align:middle line:84%
Mind programming--
when you go to a store,

00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:44.340 align:middle line:90%
are they manipulating us?

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:47.220 align:middle line:84%
You remember they used to talk
about the Blue Light Special,

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:49.540 align:middle line:84%
but is there something
else going on when

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:51.830 align:middle line:90%
you walk into a store or not?

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:56.260 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well, the answer
to that is yes, yes, and yes.

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:59.050 align:middle line:84%
Marketing is, as you've
already pointed out,

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:01.720 align:middle line:90%
very sophisticated today.

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:04.900 align:middle line:84%
Product placement is a
critical aspect of that.

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:08.150 align:middle line:84%
Color marketing is an
important ingredient.

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:13.210 align:middle line:84%
But you could also be exposed
to subliminal messages.

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:18.710 align:middle line:84%
Back in the '80s, I attempted
to get some legislation that

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:20.860 align:middle line:90%
would require informed consent.

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:23.200 align:middle line:84%
You remember the
microwave oven when they--

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.822 align:middle line:84%
you were in the
Navy, so you know

00:25:24.822 --> 00:25:28.450 align:middle line:84%
they had microwaves on
submarines way back.

00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:30.750 align:middle line:84%
But when they became
popular in America,

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:33.690 align:middle line:84%
everyone was concerned
about this microwave energy.

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:37.060 align:middle line:84%
So if you went into a
restaurant that had a microwave,

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:40.620 align:middle line:84%
there was a warning decal on the
door, we have a microwave oven.

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:43.900 align:middle line:84%
OK, well I just wanted
some kind of decal,

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:48.220 align:middle line:84%
some kind of notification that
if you visited a store and they

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:54.450 align:middle line:84%
had, quote, "anti-theft"
subliminal messages,

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:55.800 align:middle line:90%
that they would disclose that.

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:58.152 align:middle line:84%
Because they'll tell you
that this is anti-theft.

00:25:58.152 --> 00:25:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And there's been
a lot of work that

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:04.480 align:middle line:84%
shows that anti-theft
subliminal messages are

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:08.780 align:middle line:84%
capable of lowering
reserve requirements, theft

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:10.230 align:middle line:90%
in the store, OK?

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:13.480 align:middle line:84%
The problem with these
anti-theft messages

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:17.520 align:middle line:84%
is very often they will
be constructed this way,

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:20.550 align:middle line:90%
buying is honest.

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:22.480 align:middle line:90%
You want to be honest.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.230 align:middle line:90%
Now what does that say to you?

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:25.460 align:middle line:90%
It says buy.

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:28.040 align:middle line:90%
This is a motivational message.

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:32.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, we were unsuccessful
with the legislation.

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:36.570 align:middle line:84%
Virtually the who's who
of the marketing world

00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:39.960 align:middle line:84%
came in to oppose
this legislation.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And they all said, we
don't do it, and if we did,

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:45.480 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't work.

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, the fact of the matter
is that argument has been since

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:49.920 align:middle line:90%
dismissed many, many times.

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:51.300 align:middle line:90%
Of course they do it.

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:52.630 align:middle line:90%
That's a proven instance.

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:53.960 align:middle line:90%
And of course, it works.

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:58.940 align:middle line:84%
There's no question about
that any longer, either.

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:03.450 align:middle line:84%
The bottom line to this
story, in my view, is this.

00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:06.060 align:middle line:84%
Most people believe
they're protected

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:08.795 align:middle line:84%
against subliminal messages,
whether on a television

00:27:08.795 --> 00:27:12.970 align:middle line:84%
or in the radio or
in the grocery store.

00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:14.160 align:middle line:90%
And they're really not.

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:16.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because it's
subliminal. [LAUGHS]

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:17.530 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Well, not only that.

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:19.120 align:middle line:90%
There are no laws.

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:23.300 align:middle line:84%
There's an FCC codification that
says a station cannot knowingly

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:26.319 align:middle line:84%
do that without
risking their license.

00:27:26.319 --> 00:27:27.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Knowingly.

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.943 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Knowingly.

00:27:27.943 --> 00:27:30.900 align:middle line:84%
But you remember the
Bush Rats ad, don't you?

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:31.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:35.450 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: OK, so here Bush
puts behind Al Gore's head

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:42.550 align:middle line:84%
"rats" bolded out in a
bold subliminal message

00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:49.230 align:middle line:84%
during the election
between Gore and Bush II.

00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:54.070 align:middle line:84%
That ad has been researched
at Adelphi University

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:57.550 align:middle line:84%
in mock elections to
see if it would indeed

00:27:57.550 --> 00:27:59.580 align:middle line:90%
affect the outcome of election.

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And there's no doubt
that statistically

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:04.590 align:middle line:90%
it did impact the election.

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:09.940 align:middle line:84%
Tennessee is one of the
states where the ad ran more

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:11.160 align:middle line:90%
than any other place.

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.850 align:middle line:84%
And Tennessee is
Al Gore's state.

00:28:12.850 --> 00:28:15.970 align:middle line:90%
And Al Gore lost his home state.

00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:20.180 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, the DNC, the
Democratic National Committee,

00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:22.540 align:middle line:84%
they've got all
power in the world.

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:26.860 align:middle line:84%
They went after the Bush
people over this ad.

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:32.290 align:middle line:84%
First, the Bush people argued
that it didn't exist, OK?

00:28:32.290 --> 00:28:36.060 align:middle line:84%
Then when it's so bold, they
said, well, it was an accident.

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:38.270 align:middle line:84%
But once you see
it, there's no way

00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:40.050 align:middle line:90%
it could have been an accident.

00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:42.690 align:middle line:84%
So then they finally
admitted to doing it.

00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:45.430 align:middle line:84%
Bush, I think, did a great
job of dismissing it,

00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:48.500 align:middle line:84%
because when asked, he
couldn't pronounce the word.

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:51.210 align:middle line:90%
Su-- sub-- "sublimi?"

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:54.045 align:middle line:90%
So everybody laughed at it.

00:28:54.045 --> 00:28:57.030 align:middle line:84%
Bottom line is, when they
were all said and done,

00:28:57.030 --> 00:29:01.430 align:middle line:84%
the DNC was unable to
get anything as a result.

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:05.770 align:middle line:84%
The station denied knowing
that it had been there.

00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:07.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
possible, right?

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:08.720 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: Of course, of course.

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.710 align:middle line:84%
The ad agency did
it, and there's

00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:13.540 align:middle line:84%
no way to pursue the ad
agency, because it's not

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:15.310 align:middle line:90%
a criminal matter.

00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:17.900 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to be
exposed to it every day.

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:20.640 align:middle line:84%
There are a number
of ads, print ads.

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:24.930 align:middle line:84%
In the book, I show
you several print ads

00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:28.620 align:middle line:84%
that have been specifically
designed to embed sex

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:32.500 align:middle line:90%
and demonic taboos, et cetera.

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
say, well, why would

00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:36.180 align:middle line:90%
you embed a demonic taboo?

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:39.230 align:middle line:84%
I get the sex, because
that gets my attention,

00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:44.130 align:middle line:84%
and then my attention
remembers, oh, Imperial Whiskey.

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:46.420 align:middle line:90%
But why the taboos?

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And they're just as
powerful as the sex.

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:52.535 align:middle line:84%
We all have what Freud
called a Thanatos urge.

00:29:52.535 --> 00:29:55.080 align:middle line:90%


00:29:55.080 --> 00:30:00.010 align:middle line:84%
Bungee jumping, skydiving--
all these things

00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:04.800 align:middle line:84%
that we do to terrify ourselves,
to get this big thrill,

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:08.610 align:middle line:84%
they're all about reminding
ourselves that we're alive.

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:11.240 align:middle line:84%
We have this death
urge that kind of

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:14.760 align:middle line:84%
sits there, because after
all, we know it's coming.

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:16.830 align:middle line:90%
It's just a matter of when.

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:23.530 align:middle line:84%
And so these kinds of
demonic images, they

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:25.860 align:middle line:84%
have just as much
power as the sex.

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:29.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do they plant--
when you say subliminal,

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:32.790 align:middle line:84%
give me a definition of
what that actually is.

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:37.790 align:middle line:84%
>>TAYLOR: Well, now you're
going to cross several areas.

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:41.080 align:middle line:84%
We can say, technically
today, that if you

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:43.317 align:middle line:84%
had a Macintosh
computer on your desk,

00:30:43.317 --> 00:30:44.400 align:middle line:90%
and you see a lot of that.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:45.960 align:middle line:90%
That's why I say Mac.

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And it was up, and you could
see the Mac logo, well,

00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:52.630 align:middle line:90%
that's a product placement.

00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And that product placement
doesn't consciously

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:58.210 align:middle line:90%
get recognized.

00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:01.210 align:middle line:84%
But it definitely
influences you.

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:04.470 align:middle line:84%
It absolutely has been
proven to influence you.

00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:09.540 align:middle line:84%
So whether it's an automobile,
a computer, or what have you,

00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:11.960 align:middle line:84%
that has a very
powerful influence.

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And because it's not
consciously recognized,

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:18.000 align:middle line:84%
some people will call it
a subliminal influence.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.290 align:middle line:84%
I think of that as really
being a supraliminal influence

00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:24.570 align:middle line:90%
because we could see it.

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:26.399 align:middle line:90%
A true subliminal influence--

00:31:26.399 --> 00:31:27.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is hidden.

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:28.530 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYLOR: That's right.

00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And your perceptual mechanism
is not made in such a way

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:37.770 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to
distinguish it, recognize it.

00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:39.700 align:middle line:90%
You're going to process it.

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:41.870 align:middle line:90%
A neuron's gonna fire.

00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:44.360 align:middle line:84%
But you're not
going to recognize

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:46.420 align:middle line:90%
what you're processing.

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:51.450 align:middle line:84%
In visual, usually, I've
given you-- in the book,

00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:54.340 align:middle line:84%
I show you an
actual layout where

00:31:54.340 --> 00:32:00.700 align:middle line:84%
we take a rendition-- this
is an airbrush drawing--

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:02.720 align:middle line:84%
and it has all of
the symbols in it,

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:06.630 align:middle line:84%
including the phallic
symbols, et cetera.

00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And then we get a model, and
we get the model to pose.

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And so perhaps she
has a glass that

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:17.740 align:middle line:84%
appears to be a glass of
whiskey with ice cubes in it,

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:19.760 align:middle line:90%
about to put it in her mouth.

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:22.210 align:middle line:10%
And the way it's
airbrushed, you look at it,

00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:25.070 align:middle line:10%
and you don't see anything
out of the ordinary other

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:28.080 align:middle line:10%
than a very beautiful
woman with some

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:33.040 align:middle line:10%
suggestive-- a collar and
whatnot around her, very

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:34.770 align:middle line:10%
suggestive, beautiful woman.

00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:38.120 align:middle line:84%
But when you start
pulling this ad apart--

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:40.290 align:middle line:84%
and one of the things
that I do in the book

00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:44.060 align:middle line:84%
is show you an actual
advertising manual and an ad.

00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And they explain
in their words--

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:53.390 align:middle line:84%
it's a teaching manual-- how
and why they created this ad.

00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:56.330 align:middle line:84%
When you see, when you
understand what's there,

00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:57.750 align:middle line:90%
then you can begin to see it.

00:32:57.750 --> 00:33:01.260 align:middle line:84%
So you can see that she's about
to put a phallus in her mouth.

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:05.020 align:middle line:84%
So it becomes very,
very suggestive.

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And when we think
about liquor, we

00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:09.510 align:middle line:84%
typically think
about excitement,

00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:12.920 align:middle line:84%
partying, I'm going to
relax, I'm going to enjoy.

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:19.470 align:middle line:84%
And so these images in that
context make a big difference.

00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:23.295 align:middle line:84%
Context programming is a huge
part of everything as well.

00:33:23.295 --> 00:33:26.010 align:middle line:90%


00:33:26.010 --> 00:33:30.290 align:middle line:84%

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:40.580 align:middle line:84%

circa '50s house dress.

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:41.960 align:middle line:90%
Her hair's kind of a mess.

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:44.270 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's laughing at her.

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:48.080 align:middle line:84%
The judges are even-- they're
eyes are rolling, et cetera.

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:51.370 align:middle line:84%
But she opens her mouth to sing,
and the most mellifluous sound

00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:52.130 align:middle line:90%
comes out.

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:55.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, the real
question is, what makes

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:58.230 align:middle line:84%
us think a singer is supposed
to look a certain way?

00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:59.220 align:middle line:90%
