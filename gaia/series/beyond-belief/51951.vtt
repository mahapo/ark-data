And I think many people

00:00:07.372 --> 00:00:08.830 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.590 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.510 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.255 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:26.359 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:27.900 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE NOORY:
Well, hello friends,

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.191 align:middle line:90%
and welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:31.870 align:middle line:10%
We deal with a number of
subjects on this program--

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:37.240 align:middle line:10%
all kinds of different
issues, inspirational shows,

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.610 align:middle line:10%
cutting-edge science
programs, ghostly shows.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.600 align:middle line:84%
But there's one
topic, one topic,

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.050 align:middle line:90%
that always has fascinated me.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
subject of angels.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.160 align:middle line:84%
What are they, who are
they, and how does it work?

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've got an expert
on angels with us--

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.090 align:middle line:84%
Radleigh Valentine-- noted
author and researcher,

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.829 align:middle line:90%
does his own programs.

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.370 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to "Beyond
Belief," Radleigh.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:03.420 align:middle line:90%
Always a pleasure.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH VALENTINE:
Thank you, George.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.120 align:middle line:90%
Good to see you.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.290 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: You're writing and
doing research with Doreen

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.441 align:middle line:84%
Virtue on a number of things,
and these are like angel tarot

00:01:12.441 --> 00:01:12.940 align:middle line:90%
cards--

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:13.500 align:middle line:90%
>> RADLEIGH: They are.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.333 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Which we'll
talk about and stuff.

00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:16.790 align:middle line:90%
But tell me about you.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.897 align:middle line:84%
How did you get interested
in the angelic realm?

00:01:20.897 --> 00:01:23.480 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: I was always sort
of the kid with something extra

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.340 align:middle line:84%
when I was growing up, so I had
that little psychic edge when I

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.520 align:middle line:90%
was a child.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.220 align:middle line:10%
And I was very,
very blessed to have

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.110 align:middle line:10%
a mom who supported
that, who really

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.460 align:middle line:10%
wanted me to experience it.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.240 align:middle line:10%
And so as I got
older, I just started

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.890 align:middle line:10%
realizing that the energies
that I were feeling around me

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.340 align:middle line:10%
were angels.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.470 align:middle line:90%
And I met my guardian angel.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And who-- whose name
is Joshua, and with me

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.849 align:middle line:84%
as we speak, and
everywhere I go.

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:51.890 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Hello, Joshua.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:52.840 align:middle line:90%
>> RADLEIGH: That's right.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.630 align:middle line:90%
He says hello back.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:54.470 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Do I have
one around here?

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.094 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: You do,
you absolutely do.

00:01:56.094 --> 00:01:57.890 align:middle line:84%
You actually have
several, because I

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.860 align:middle line:84%
think that people
like you who are

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.630 align:middle line:84%
out in the eye of the public
so much have extra angels.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:03.630 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: We need that.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.463 align:middle line:90%
>> RADLEIGH: You do.

00:02:04.463 --> 00:02:05.360 align:middle line:90%
You do need that.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.259 align:middle line:84%
So I got very
interested in angels,

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.630 align:middle line:84%
and I started hanging paintings
all over my house of angels,

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.450 align:middle line:84%
and talking to Josh,
and learning about him.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.790 align:middle line:84%
And then one day, I
met Doreen Virtue.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.219 align:middle line:90%
And took a class with her.

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:21.510 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: An angel by herself.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.176 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: She is
an angel by herself.

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:24.910 align:middle line:84%
She is, and a very
dear friend now.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.640 align:middle line:84%
But when I met her, I actually
didn't even know who she was.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.250 align:middle line:84%
Someone just said, "You
should take her angel therapy

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.920 align:middle line:90%
practitioner class."

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.630 align:middle line:90%
And so I went into the class.

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.360 align:middle line:84%
And right from the
very beginning,

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.970 align:middle line:84%
I did this reading with
the angels for a woman

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.590 align:middle line:90%
that I had never met.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.200 align:middle line:90%
And that was glee for me.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.590 align:middle line:90%
That was bliss.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.917 align:middle line:84%
That was the first moment
where I knew I could do this.

00:02:52.917 --> 00:02:54.500 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: It flipped
a switch in you.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.833 align:middle line:90%
>> RADLEIGH: The switch flipped.

00:02:55.833 --> 00:02:57.720 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I wanted to dance.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.760 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to sing.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.390 align:middle line:84%
I was so happy in
that moment that I

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.930 align:middle line:84%
didn't know what
to do with myself.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.350 align:middle line:84%
But there are 15
primary archangels

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.870 align:middle line:90%
that most people work with.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.680 align:middle line:84%
And Doreen did this
meditation where

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.040 align:middle line:84%
she was bringing in each
of the 15 archangels.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And it was funny, because I
had had such a fabulous week,

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.240 align:middle line:84%
and everything
had been electric.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And this experience for
me was just sort of dead.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.150 align:middle line:84%
She was bringing in
all these angels,

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.600 align:middle line:84%
and she was bringing
them in alphabetically.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And nothing was
happening for me.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And she got to archangel
Uriel, and the room just

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.570 align:middle line:90%
flashed into gold light.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.500 align:middle line:90%
Glitter was all over the floor.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.710 align:middle line:90%
It was like angels were singing.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, "Oh,
I finally clicked in!"

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And then she brought
in archangel Zadkiel

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.010 align:middle line:90%
and it all went dead.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I knew
that archangel Uriel was

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.150 align:middle line:84%
going to be my
primary archangel.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And as that weekend progressed,
every single card that I pulled

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.570 align:middle line:90%
had archangel Uriel on it.

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.380 align:middle line:84%
And people, by the
end of the week,

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.210 align:middle line:90%
everybody was just laughing.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.814 align:middle line:84%
But that's how I really
got really into angels.

00:04:06.814 --> 00:04:08.230 align:middle line:84%
What a lot of
people don't know is

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.950 align:middle line:84%
that I'm actually a recovering
certified public accountant.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.150 align:middle line:90%
I was CPA.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.779 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: You're the
product of the Devil.

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:17.579 align:middle line:90%
>> RADLEIGH: I am.

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.290 align:middle line:90%
I was a CPA.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And I left all that
to do this full time.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.350 align:middle line:90%
Because this is what I love.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.060 align:middle line:90%
This is what I love.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.570 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: It's changed
your life, hasn't it?

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:28.403 align:middle line:90%
>> RADLEIGH: It did.

00:04:28.403 --> 00:04:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And the tarot connection
came because my teacher--

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.620 align:middle line:84%
I was growing up in
Knoxville, Tennessee.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.200 align:middle line:90%
There were not a lot of angel--

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.280 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: No, no.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.321 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: There weren't
when I was growing up.

00:04:41.321 --> 00:04:44.010 align:middle line:84%
But I found a teacher, and she
taught both angels and tarot.

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.220 align:middle line:84%
So it was a natural
connection for me.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.140 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Now, when you talk,
Radleigh, about archangels,

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.270 align:middle line:84%
they are-- based on what
I think I've been taught--

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.959 align:middle line:84%
on the higher plane
of the angelic realm.

00:04:56.959 --> 00:04:57.500 align:middle line:90%
Are they not?

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.480 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: Well, there's
actually nine realms of angels.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And the one closest to us
is our guardian angels.

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And the next level up from
that are the archangels.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.210 align:middle line:84%
Because their purpose is
to be messengers from God.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.290 align:middle line:90%
Their purpose is to--

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: So there's
higher than them?

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:13.763 align:middle line:90%
>> RADLEIGH: Oh yes.

00:05:13.763 --> 00:05:16.040 align:middle line:84%
There are seven levels
higher than them.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And the archangels' purpose
is to help us through life,

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.520 align:middle line:90%
to guide us through life.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.400 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is,
you have to ask.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:32.100 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of like that whole
Star Trek non-intervention rule

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.530 align:middle line:84%
where you-- but you
have to ask the angels.

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.430 align:middle line:84%
If you ask them for their
help, then you'll get answers.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.300 align:middle line:84%
You'll get signs--
wonderful signs will happen.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.750 align:middle line:84%
The archangels also--
people sort of think

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.520 align:middle line:84%
of them as being the type
of angels that you only

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.330 align:middle line:90%
call in an emergency.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.910 align:middle line:90%
But really, that's not true.

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's like they want
to help with everything,

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.342 align:middle line:84%
because they can be
everywhere simultaneously.

00:05:56.342 --> 00:05:58.550 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Now where's
Michael on that pecking order?

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.000 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: He is the
head of the archangels.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And people really, really
get in tune with Michael,

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.180 align:middle line:84%
because their interest--
because he's for protection.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.595 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
he does is he's

00:06:09.595 --> 00:06:11.780 align:middle line:90%
the Patron Saint of the police.

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And he carries the
golden sword of light

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.070 align:middle line:84%
in order to keep people safe,
and make people feel protected.

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.590 align:middle line:84%
He's also the archangel
that people call upon

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.750 align:middle line:84%
for, what is my life
purpose, career?

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.470 align:middle line:84%
Which in this day and age, is
a really big issue right now.

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:33.450 align:middle line:84%
People are very concerned
about that issue after what

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.570 align:middle line:84%
we went through
in 2007 and 2008.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.060 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people were disrupted.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.180 align:middle line:90%
And so they're, like--

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:39.800 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: They're
still disrupted.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.341 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: They're
still disrupted.

00:06:41.341 --> 00:06:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And they can ask for
help from the angels,

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.010 align:middle line:90%
and from their guardian angels.

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:50.790 align:middle line:84%
You cannot pull an archangel
away from an emergency,

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:54.280 align:middle line:84%
because they can simultaneously
be in all places.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.124 align:middle line:84%
So you can ask archangel
Michael to make you feel safe

00:06:57.124 --> 00:06:59.290 align:middle line:84%
as you walk down the street
in a neighborhood that's

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:03.120 align:middle line:84%
unfamiliar to you, because
at the exact same moment,

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.580 align:middle line:84%
he's rescuing somebody from
being harmed in a terrible way

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.010 align:middle line:90%
somewhere else.

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:10.820 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Every
Christmas night,

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.920 align:middle line:84%
I run a little clip
on my "Coast to Coast"

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.850 align:middle line:84%
radio show called "A
Letter from Michael."

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:22.140 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do with an episode
during World War II where

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:26.550 align:middle line:84%
a soldier was in a very
precarious situation.

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:30.570 align:middle line:84%
And he's got this
story from Michael

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:33.590 align:middle line:84%
that he's written this
letter back to his mother.

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:38.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's an amazing clip done
by an old-time radio broadcaster

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.550 align:middle line:84%
Lee Allan about the
power of this angel.

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And when you ask for
help, they come and help.

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:50.960 align:middle line:84%
I got to ask you-- this--
don't strike me down--

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.382 align:middle line:90%
but Satan was an angel, Lucifer.

00:07:55.382 --> 00:07:56.090 align:middle line:90%
>> RADLEIGH: Yes.

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:56.960 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: He was an angel.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:57.668 align:middle line:90%
>> RADLEIGH: Yes.

00:07:57.668 --> 00:07:59.930 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: What the
heck happened to him?

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:02.250 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: Well, I mean
there's a lot of debate about

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:02.750 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And in my belief system, he
wasn't really ever an angel.

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:13.059 align:middle line:90%
He was a spirit of some sort.

00:08:13.059 --> 00:08:13.850 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Of evil.

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:15.280 align:middle line:90%
>> RADLEIGH: Of evil, yes.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.570 align:middle line:84%
But I don't believe in
angels that are fallen.

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:20.620 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe in dark angels.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:25.050 align:middle line:84%
In my experience, angels
are only facets of God.

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:26.670 align:middle line:84%
If you could think
of a diamond that

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:30.330 align:middle line:84%
has all these different facets--
well, the diamond is God,

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:33.159 align:middle line:90%
but each facet is an angel.

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And you can't have a
piece of that fall off

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:37.860 align:middle line:90%
and become something else.

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:41.440 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't just fall off and
turn into carbon or something.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.370 align:middle line:90%
It is a diamond.

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:45.419 align:middle line:84%
So I actually don't believe
in the fallen angels.

00:08:45.419 --> 00:08:46.710 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe in dark angels.

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:48.010 align:middle line:90%
I've never experienced one.

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:50.477 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Could be a great
story that religion created?

00:08:50.477 --> 00:08:52.810 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: I think it's a
story that religion created.

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:56.150 align:middle line:84%
Religion created
a lot of stories,

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:58.530 align:middle line:84%
a lot of stories that
were meant to help

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:02.450 align:middle line:84%
them be empowered
over the people.

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And Satan's a great
story for that.

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:08.230 align:middle line:84%
I just don't really believe in
that, because I don't believe--

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:09.980 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: But you
believe in evil, right?

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:10.730 align:middle line:90%
>> RADLEIGH: I do.

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:11.540 align:middle line:90%
I believe in evil.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:13.620 align:middle line:90%
I believe in evil here on Earth.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.100 align:middle line:90%
I believe that there is evil.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.799 align:middle line:84%
Mankind is evil in
its ways, and in its--

00:09:18.799 --> 00:09:20.090 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: We see it every day.

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:21.640 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: We
see it every day.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.350 align:middle line:84%
I believe that
there are people who

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:28.080 align:middle line:84%
can get stuck between worlds,
for sure, because they have

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.910 align:middle line:84%
unfinished business
here or something,

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:32.249 align:middle line:84%
or they were addicted
to substances,

00:09:32.249 --> 00:09:34.540 align:middle line:84%
and they don't want to walk
away from those substances.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:35.940 align:middle line:90%
And so they're stuck here.

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:37.520 align:middle line:84%
But to be honest
with you, George,

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:38.870 align:middle line:90%
I don't really believe in Hell.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:39.820 align:middle line:90%
I don't.

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:42.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think
that when we die,

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:46.410 align:middle line:84%
eventually, eventually,
there's only one place to go.

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:47.109 align:middle line:90%
And it's Heaven.

00:09:47.109 --> 00:09:48.900 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Do you
believe in reincarnation?

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:49.730 align:middle line:90%
>> RADLEIGH: I do.

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:51.620 align:middle line:90%
I do, I think we come back.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:52.600 align:middle line:90%
I do, I really do.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.500 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: To become perfect
over, and over and over?

00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:01.710 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: I think this is
the biggest amusement park ride,

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:03.060 align:middle line:90%
and we just don't know it.

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:06.751 align:middle line:84%
Because we're caught in the
moments where it's negative,

00:10:06.751 --> 00:10:08.250 align:middle line:84%
or we're caught in
the moments where

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.460 align:middle line:90%
it's difficult and challenging.

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:13.260 align:middle line:84%
But I think that when
we go back to Heaven,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.260 align:middle line:84%
we're, like, chomping at
the bit to get back to Earth

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:20.680 align:middle line:84%
again, because it's
such a wild ride.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:21.840 align:middle line:90%
And people don't know that.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.330 align:middle line:90%
They miss that.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:27.020 align:middle line:84%
When I sign off of my
radio show every week,

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:31.570 align:middle line:84%
I always end it with,
"Remember, life is magic."

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:32.602 align:middle line:90%
Because it is.

00:10:32.602 --> 00:10:33.560 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: It is magic.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:34.601 align:middle line:90%
>> RADLEIGH: It is magic.

00:10:34.601 --> 00:10:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's what we make of
it that makes it magic.

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.430 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: You got
involved with tarot cards.

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:43.790 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about that, how that
happened, what are they?

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:44.950 align:middle line:90%
>> RADLEIGH: Sure.

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:46.730 align:middle line:90%
I love tarot cards.

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:50.390 align:middle line:84%
I consider them to be a way
to communicate with God, a way

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:53.320 align:middle line:90%
to communicate with angels.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.810 align:middle line:84%
Tarot is 78 cards
with five suits.

00:10:56.810 --> 00:11:00.010 align:middle line:84%
If you were to take out
the major arcana, which

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:04.110 align:middle line:84%
is the 21 cards on the top,
it would look very much to you

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:06.920 align:middle line:84%
like playing cards,
because it's 56 cards.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's ace
through 10, and it's

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:11.120 align:middle line:84%
the page, the knight,
the queen, the king.

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And actually, tarot, as
far back as we can go,

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:16.810 align:middle line:84%
which is about 600
years, was originally

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:18.850 align:middle line:90%
a parlor game like bridge.

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:20.350 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Something
for them to do.

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:21.500 align:middle line:90%
They didn't have television.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:22.458 align:middle line:90%
They didn't have radio.

00:11:22.458 --> 00:11:23.870 align:middle line:90%
They didn't have video games.

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:24.710 align:middle line:90%
>> RADLEIGH: But they had this.

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:25.580 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: They had
to do something.

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:25.740 align:middle line:90%
>> RADLEIGH: That's right.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:26.770 align:middle line:90%
They had this.

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:31.730 align:middle line:84%
And so the major
arcana was considered

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:37.420 align:middle line:84%
a bunch of trump cards to
play over the 56 basic cards.

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And even as far
back as when tarot

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.220 align:middle line:84%
was being created
in northern Italy,

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:46.900 align:middle line:84%
we had evidence that people
were using regular playing

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:49.000 align:middle line:90%
cards for divinatory purposes.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.080 align:middle line:84%
So it's not crazy to
believe that tarot

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.780 align:middle line:84%
was used for divinatory
purposes all the way back then,

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:57.150 align:middle line:84%
but most of our evidence
of when this started

00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:00.320 align:middle line:84%
to turn into some sort of
language with the divine

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.110 align:middle line:90%
happens around the 1800s.

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:07.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's when England and
France got really, really

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:13.360 align:middle line:84%
into the whole concept of
spiritualism and ghosts,

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.250 align:middle line:84%
and occult, and
things like that.

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:20.730 align:middle line:84%
So what happened to make tarot
kind of get the reputation that

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:28.776 align:middle line:84%
it has or had was that a man
by the name of Ghibelline--

00:12:28.776 --> 00:12:29.400 align:middle line:90%
he was French--

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:29.940 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: A
Frenchman, no doubt.

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:31.590 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: Yes, of
course, of course.

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:34.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually he
was Swiss, but he

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:35.870 align:middle line:84%
moved to France
shortly thereafter

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:38.280 align:middle line:90%
and changed his name.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.500 align:middle line:84%
So he started walking
around telling everybody

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.960 align:middle line:84%
that these came
from ancient Egypt,

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.530 align:middle line:84%
and that he could read the
hieroglyphics in ancient Egypt,

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:49.890 align:middle line:84%
and that they had secret
messages that were only

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:51.379 align:middle line:84%
meant for certain
special people.

00:12:51.379 --> 00:12:52.920 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: And they
all believed him.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:56.190 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: Oh, the story
ran wild through Paris.

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:58.860 align:middle line:90%
I mean, everybody bought it.

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:01.660 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Now, the tarot
cards that I know of, the death

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:04.292 align:middle line:84%
and all that-- are those
the same as the angel cards,

00:13:04.292 --> 00:13:05.250 align:middle line:90%
or are they different?

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:07.170 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: Well, what we
did was we made a change.

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:08.170 align:middle line:90%
We did make a change.

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:12.010 align:middle line:84%
What we did was we
wanted our decks of cards

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:14.180 align:middle line:90%
to be accessible to people.

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.489 align:middle line:84%
We wanted people to feel
like they were safe.

00:13:16.489 --> 00:13:18.280 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: And not
dealing with the occult.

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.590 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: And not
dealing with the occult,

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:21.990 align:middle line:84%
because that's not really
what tarot was supposed to be

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.490 align:middle line:90%
anyway.

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:24.500 align:middle line:10%
It's just the
reputation it wound up

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.890 align:middle line:10%
with due to many reasons.

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:31.570 align:middle line:10%
And so what we did was we
took the Devil card out,

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:34.350 align:middle line:10%
but we replaced it with Ego,
because the Devil card never

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:36.290 align:middle line:10%
meant that some
guy in a red suit

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:38.090 align:middle line:10%
was going to be
chasing after you.

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:41.180 align:middle line:84%
It didn't mean that you were
going to be possessed by Satan.

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:45.210 align:middle line:84%
That card meant that you were
being trapped by your own ego,

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:47.300 align:middle line:90%
by your own--

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:48.274 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Internal.

00:13:48.274 --> 00:13:49.690 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH:
Internal challenges--

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:51.356 align:middle line:84%
thank you for helping
me get past that--

00:13:51.356 --> 00:13:52.930 align:middle line:90%
your own internal challenges.

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:55.620 align:middle line:90%
Your imprisonment was false.

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:57.450 align:middle line:90%
It's an illusion.

00:13:57.450 --> 00:13:59.720 align:middle line:84%
Death never means
death in tarot,

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.065 align:middle line:84%
and yet every time that
card hits the table--

00:14:02.065 --> 00:14:04.392 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Oh, it scares
you to death, literally.

00:14:04.392 --> 00:14:06.260 align:middle line:90%
That's how you die.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:07.590 align:middle line:90%
You see the Death card and die.

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:08.790 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: That's
exactly right.

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:10.206 align:middle line:84%
You've got-- I've
got a client who

00:14:10.206 --> 00:14:12.960 align:middle line:84%
is bringing in a brown paper
bag as soon as that happens.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.960 align:middle line:84%
But Death doesn't
mean physical death.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:18.020 align:middle line:84%
It means the ending, an
ending of a situation, perhaps

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:20.125 align:middle line:84%
a situation that we
want to be over with.

00:14:20.125 --> 00:14:22.000 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Can we do a
little reading for me?

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.124 align:middle line:90%
>> RADLEIGH: Oh absolutely.

00:14:23.124 --> 00:14:24.160 align:middle line:90%
I would love to.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:24.860 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: I'll let
you do what we do.

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:25.290 align:middle line:90%
>> RADLEIGH: All right.

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:26.850 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: You tell
me what we do, and--

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:27.390 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: All
right, let's do that.

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:30.340 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: We'll hold the cards
up to the camera when you do

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:30.980 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:32.277 align:middle line:90%
>> RADLEIGH: Sure.

00:14:32.277 --> 00:14:34.110 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Will this
be enlightening for me?

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:34.880 align:middle line:90%
>> RADLEIGH: I hope so.

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: OK.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.854 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: Is there something
in particular you want me

00:14:37.854 --> 00:14:38.420 align:middle line:90%
to ask about?

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:40.662 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Now, do I need
to ask you something,

00:14:40.662 --> 00:14:42.590 align:middle line:84%
or do you just tell
me about things?

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:44.500 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: People
do it different ways.

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:46.170 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: I'll let you
just tell me about me.

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:47.295 align:middle line:90%
>> RADLEIGH: Sure, why not.

00:14:47.295 --> 00:14:49.532 align:middle line:90%
Let's just do that.

00:14:49.532 --> 00:14:51.240 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Those are
thick-looking cards.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.520 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: Well,
there's 78 tarot cards.

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.070 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: What's
it supposed to do?

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:57.790 align:middle line:90%
What's it supposed to tell me?

00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:02.139 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: I think it's, well,
most people call in or if they

00:15:02.139 --> 00:15:04.680 align:middle line:84%
come for a reading, they have
something that they really want

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:05.680 align:middle line:90%
to know about.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And the top three that
people really care about

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:11.390 align:middle line:84%
are-- they care about
relationships, finances,

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:12.391 align:middle line:90%
and health.

00:15:12.391 --> 00:15:12.890 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:13.890 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Bingo.

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:16.390 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: Exactly, exactly--
that's the main three things

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:17.750 align:middle line:90%
that people care about.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:22.180 align:middle line:84%
So usually, and because
my last name is Valentine,

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:24.580 align:middle line:84%
I have a tendency to get
relationship questions

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:26.770 align:middle line:90%
on my show, and stuff like that.

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:29.160 align:middle line:84%
But career has been really
big for the last few years,

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.970 align:middle line:90%
for obvious reasons.

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:33.670 align:middle line:84%
So usually people call in,
they say, "Can you just tell me

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:35.350 align:middle line:84%
when I'm going to
meet my soul mate,"

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:38.450 align:middle line:90%
or "I really want this job.

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:41.237 align:middle line:84%
Am I going to get it? " But
people do sometimes just call

00:15:41.237 --> 00:15:43.570 align:middle line:84%
and say, "Just tell me what
the angels want me to know."

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:45.430 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: OK, And
then how does it work?

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:49.090 align:middle line:84%
Because you're selecting the
card, not the individual.

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:50.350 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:52.620 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: Well, that's
because my energy is infused

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:55.890 align:middle line:84%
into the cards,
and so I believe--

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:58.520 align:middle line:84%
as does Doreen
Virtue, my mentor,

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:00.920 align:middle line:84%
that we should keep our
cards completely clean,

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:04.340 align:middle line:84%
because otherwise everybody
else is putting their energy

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:05.590 align:middle line:90%
into the cards.

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:06.930 align:middle line:90%
But this is law of attraction.

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:08.374 align:middle line:84%
That's why it can't
be done wrong.

00:16:08.374 --> 00:16:10.290 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: If I touch
it will anything happen?

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:11.037 align:middle line:90%
Will I spoil it?

00:16:11.037 --> 00:16:12.370 align:middle line:90%
>> RADLEIGH: You won't spoil it.

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:12.720 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: You're
not going to hit me?

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:13.386 align:middle line:90%
>> RADLEIGH: No.

00:16:13.386 --> 00:16:15.850 align:middle line:90%


00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:16.500 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:19.350 align:middle line:90%
So it's law of attraction.

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:21.470 align:middle line:84%
So the perfect cards
are going to come out

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:23.680 align:middle line:90%
for whatever the question is.

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And because I have this
accounting background,

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:28.770 align:middle line:84%
and numbers really matter
to me, I hear in my head

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:30.520 align:middle line:90%
the number of times to shuffle.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.880 align:middle line:84%
So once I get the question,
I'll hear, like, three.

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.088 align:middle line:84%
And so I'll shuffle three
times, and then pull cards.

00:16:35.088 --> 00:16:38.050 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: What if the question
has to do with world events

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:40.500 align:middle line:90%
or episodes like that?

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:41.426 align:middle line:90%
Can that be done?

00:16:41.426 --> 00:16:43.300 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: Sure,
absolutely it can be done.

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:47.730 align:middle line:84%
We can ask about world
events, and if I'm

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:51.284 align:middle line:84%
going to do a reading
that's for somebody else,

00:16:51.284 --> 00:16:52.700 align:middle line:84%
like if someone
comes in and says,

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:55.540 align:middle line:84%
"Can you do a reading
for my cousin Nate?"

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:58.180 align:middle line:84%
Then I kind of go within
and ask the angels,

00:16:58.180 --> 00:16:59.554 align:middle line:90%
"Is this OK with cousin Nate?"

00:16:59.554 --> 00:17:00.220 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Right

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:03.687 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: And 90% of the
time, it's OK with cousin Nate.

00:17:03.687 --> 00:17:06.020 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Do you need to be
tuned in to the cousin Nate

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:06.790 align:middle line:90%
at all?

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:08.540 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: I just ask my
angels, and they tell me.

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:08.880 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Let them do this.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.296 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: That's
my connection.

00:17:10.296 --> 00:17:13.000 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: OK, so who's
basically passing this

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.270 align:middle line:90%
information on to us?

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:16.730 align:middle line:90%
Is it the angel that's doing it?

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:19.640 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: For
me, it's my angels.

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:22.339 align:middle line:84%
It's like it's all a facet
of God, like I said before.

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:24.829 align:middle line:90%
So we're talking to God.

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:27.130 align:middle line:84%
The angels are
messengers of God.

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And we are partially,
we're part of God.

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:31.700 align:middle line:90%
I believe that firmly.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:36.780 align:middle line:84%
I believe firmly that
when God created mankind,

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:39.980 align:middle line:84%
it was like throwing
a rock into the ocean.

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And all those little
drops of water

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:44.630 align:middle line:84%
that went flying
out-- that's us.

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:48.000 align:middle line:84%
That's why there's nowhere else
for us to go but back to God.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.940 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: OK, well,
let's give it a try.

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And tell us what you're
doing as you do this.

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:54.026 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: What I'm doing
is I'm asking my angels,

00:17:54.026 --> 00:17:56.947 align:middle line:84%
what is the most important thing
that I can tell George right

00:17:56.947 --> 00:17:58.280 align:middle line:90%
now that would be of use to him.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:59.710 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: All right.

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:01.830 align:middle line:90%
Shuffling the cards does what?

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:03.910 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: Shuffling
allows the cards to get

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:07.870 align:middle line:84%
into the proper order,
so that when I pull them,

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:10.727 align:middle line:84%
it's the three-- because I'm
going to pull three for you.

00:18:10.727 --> 00:18:12.560 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Can anybody
learn how to do this?

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:13.810 align:middle line:90%
>> RADLEIGH: Absolutely.

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:16.150 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons that--
I'll tell you in a moment.

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:19.470 align:middle line:90%
This is Eight of Fire.

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:22.710 align:middle line:84%
This says that George has
way too much stuff going on.

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:23.210 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:23.590 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: OK.

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:25.590 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: And one of
the things that we did--

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:26.950 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: That may not be bad.

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:28.950 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: No, actually,
I like Eight of Fire,

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:32.660 align:middle line:84%
because there's another card in
the deck that is too much going

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:35.410 align:middle line:84%
on, and it doesn't
feel very good.

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:35.999 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:18:35.999 --> 00:18:37.040 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Eight of Fire.

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:38.180 align:middle line:90%
>> RADLEIGH: Eight of Fire.

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.660 align:middle line:90%
But this card is-- great.

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:43.360 align:middle line:84%
Like, this could represent
my life as well right now,

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.040 align:middle line:84%
because I have so much going
on I don't know what to do.

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:45.860 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Well,
I agree with that.

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:46.985 align:middle line:90%
>> RADLEIGH: And I love it.

00:18:46.985 --> 00:18:50.290 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: I do have a lot
going on, and I thrive on it.

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:52.690 align:middle line:90%
But I do have a lot going on.

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:56.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are sometimes
I will say gosh, George,

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:58.490 align:middle line:90%
you're just doing too much.

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:00.200 align:middle line:90%
Slow down.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.640 align:middle line:90%
But I can't.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:02.140 align:middle line:90%
And I won't.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:03.431 align:middle line:90%
>> RADLEIGH: And you shouldn't.

00:19:03.431 --> 00:19:05.000 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: And it's accurate.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.541 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: Yeah,
and you shouldn't.

00:19:06.541 --> 00:19:07.410 align:middle line:90%
This is the wheel.

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:09.170 align:middle line:90%
This means you're traveling.

00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:11.720 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Oh, there's
no doubt about that.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.620 align:middle line:84%
The wheel should have
an airplane engine,

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.847 align:middle line:90%
a car-- you name it.

00:19:15.847 --> 00:19:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: Planes,
trains and automobiles.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:20.320 align:middle line:84%
It's also, George, a
card of really good luck,

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:24.980 align:middle line:84%
because every tarot card has an
astrological attribution to it,

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:26.770 align:middle line:90%
and this one is Jupiter.

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:28.520 align:middle line:90%
And Jupiter is expansive.

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.650 align:middle line:90%
It's the biggest planet.

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:31.350 align:middle line:90%
It's good luck.

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:33.130 align:middle line:90%
So that's a good thing.

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:37.005 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: And it coincides
with doing too much.

00:19:37.005 --> 00:19:37.880 align:middle line:90%
>> RADLEIGH: It does.

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.350 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: And now should
we have a drum roll?

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:40.300 align:middle line:90%
Is this my last card?

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:42.383 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: This is your
last card for right now.

00:19:42.383 --> 00:19:43.430 align:middle line:90%
This is Seven of Fire.

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:44.270 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Seven of Fire.

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:45.395 align:middle line:90%
What does this mean for me?

00:19:45.395 --> 00:19:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: This means
defend your beliefs.

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:47.930 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:50.710 align:middle line:84%
Don't let other people
tell you what you know

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:53.140 align:middle line:90%
is the right thing right now.

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:54.660 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: OK.

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:56.350 align:middle line:84%
All right, so when
I take all this,

00:19:56.350 --> 00:20:01.750 align:middle line:84%
these three things, these advice
given to you by the angels,

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:03.840 align:middle line:90%
how do I apply it to my life?

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.630 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: Well,
what it would tell me--

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:08.920 align:middle line:84%
how I would apply this to your
life is I would say you've got

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:11.650 align:middle line:84%
so much going on right now, and
that you're traveling so much

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:14.970 align:middle line:84%
that you could
actually tell some--

00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:18.150 align:middle line:84%
sort of back down on something
you really, really want,

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:22.940 align:middle line:84%
let someone tell you what to do,
when it really isn't what you

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:24.130 align:middle line:90%
want to do.

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:28.332 align:middle line:84%
And so these cards give you that
heads up-- that heads up of--

00:20:28.332 --> 00:20:29.540 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Stand your ground?

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:30.831 align:middle line:90%
>> RADLEIGH: Stand your ground.

00:20:30.831 --> 00:20:34.170 align:middle line:84%
Don't give in to what
you really, really want.

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:37.920 align:middle line:84%
But when we're tired, you
know, it's like I'm travelling

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:38.620 align:middle line:90%
constantly, too.

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:40.690 align:middle line:90%
I've got 26 events this year.

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:42.740 align:middle line:90%
In Europe and Canada-- all over.

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And when we get tired, we
just start saying, OK fine.

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:47.000 align:middle line:90%
Whatever, I don't care.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:47.170 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Enough is enough.

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:49.170 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: I don't care,
or whatever you want.

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:50.740 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Or do
you keep taking it?

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:51.780 align:middle line:90%
>> RADLEIGH: Do I personally?

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:52.820 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Yeah, do you
ever turned down an event?

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:54.524 align:middle line:90%
>> RADLEIGH: No.

00:20:54.524 --> 00:20:55.884 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm like--

00:20:55.884 --> 00:20:56.550 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: I do.

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:56.726 align:middle line:90%
>> RADLEIGH: Do you?

00:20:56.726 --> 00:20:57.070 align:middle line:90%
Good for you.

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:57.660 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Yeah, I do.

00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:58.743 align:middle line:90%
>> RADLEIGH: Good for you.

00:20:58.743 --> 00:21:01.010 align:middle line:84%
I, no, I kind of
don't at this point,

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:04.820 align:middle line:84%
because the main thing that
matters to me in my life right

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:06.300 align:middle line:90%
now is teaching.

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:08.060 align:middle line:84%
That is the main
thing that matters.

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:12.140 align:middle line:84%
This was taken by a
bunch of crazy people,

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:13.980 align:middle line:90%
and turned into something scary.

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:16.370 align:middle line:90%
And that breaks my heart.

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:17.870 align:middle line:84%
Because that's not
what this is for.

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:19.578 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Devil,
yeah, things like that.

00:21:19.578 --> 00:21:22.000 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: This is for--
right, and scaring people,

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.910 align:middle line:84%
telling people in the
1800s and that 1900s,

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:28.210 align:middle line:84%
that this is secret knowledge,
and only certain people can

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:28.711 align:middle line:90%
have it.

00:21:28.711 --> 00:21:30.501 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: It was great
control, wasn't it?

00:21:30.501 --> 00:21:32.850 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: Right, just like
any kind of belief system.

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:36.110 align:middle line:90%
There's a control element to it.

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And then in the '20s and
the '30s, what did you see?

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:40.770 align:middle line:90%
You saw gypsies throwing cards.

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And it was always
the death card.

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:44.150 align:middle line:90%
Was it ever anything else?

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:46.170 align:middle line:90%
It was always the death card.

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And so it's like what I
love, what matters more to me

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:52.790 align:middle line:84%
than anything is when
someone comes to me says,

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:55.540 align:middle line:90%
"I'm no longer scared of tarot."

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:59.380 align:middle line:84%
When people come to me,
that is when I almost

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:01.350 align:middle line:84%
start to cry because
I am so happy.

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:02.940 align:middle line:90%
That's what I wanted.

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And you ask can
anybody learn this?

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:07.940 align:middle line:84%
Yes, because we did something
that nobody else had done.

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:11.164 align:middle line:84%
We put the meanings of
the cards on the cards.

00:22:11.164 --> 00:22:12.830 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Almost
like a training guide.

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:15.270 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: Right, because
when I was learning tarot,

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:19.560 align:middle line:84%
what I did was I bought a deck
and I used a black Sharpie,

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.690 align:middle line:90%
and wrote what the card meant.

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:23.860 align:middle line:90%
And that's how I learned.

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:26.420 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Does the card
mean the same to everybody?

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:27.960 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: No,
I don't think so.

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:30.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think the
tarot has a guideline.

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:33.760 align:middle line:84%
There's a story line to tarot,
much like a movie or something.

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:38.450 align:middle line:84%
But we always teach people
to look where your eye falls.

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:41.170 align:middle line:84%
And if where your
eye falls is the fact

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:45.210 align:middle line:84%
that she's riding on a dragon,
and that means something

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:49.160 align:middle line:84%
to you more so than the
words, always go with that.

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:51.925 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Why three cards,
instead of five, or one?

00:22:51.925 --> 00:22:53.800 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: It's
generally meant to be past,

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:57.680 align:middle line:84%
present and future, or what's
dictating your life right now.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:00.170 align:middle line:84%
But this is actually not
the most famous spread

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:01.087 align:middle line:90%
in all of tarot.

00:23:01.087 --> 00:23:02.670 align:middle line:84%
The most famous
spread in all of tarot

00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:03.794 align:middle line:90%
is called the Celtic Cross.

00:23:03.794 --> 00:23:04.930 align:middle line:90%
And there's 10 cards.

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:05.570 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Ten cards in that.

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:05.940 align:middle line:90%
>> RADLEIGH: Mhm.

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:06.910 align:middle line:90%
There's 10 in that one.

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:08.540 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: And they each
represent something different?

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:09.000 align:middle line:90%
>> RADLEIGH: They do.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.840 align:middle line:84%
That-- and that's a
very detailed reading.

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:12.923 align:middle line:84%
That's when you're going
to sit down with somebody

00:23:12.923 --> 00:23:16.350 align:middle line:84%
and really get a 30-minute
or 45-minute reading,

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:18.200 align:middle line:84%
and you want to
get lots of detail.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:20.350 align:middle line:84%
And that tells you
things like what's

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:23.020 align:middle line:84%
going on in their life, what's
crossing it or affecting

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:25.260 align:middle line:84%
their life, what's the
subconscious element, what's

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:27.190 align:middle line:84%
the conscious element,
what from the past

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:29.650 align:middle line:84%
affected them, what from the
future is affecting them,

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:31.212 align:middle line:84%
how other people
are affecting them--

00:23:31.212 --> 00:23:33.170 align:middle line:84%
it gives you all of those
kinds of information.

00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:36.180 align:middle line:84%
And that is actually the most
famous tarot spread of all.

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:40.050 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: And again, is this
the angelic realm that is doing

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:42.290 align:middle line:84%
this, that is
making this happen?

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:44.860 align:middle line:84%
Or was this Radleigh
Valentine who

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:47.280 align:middle line:84%
was able to feel
something within me,

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.080 align:middle line:90%
and pick these three cards?

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: I believe it's
my angels talking to me,

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:55.910 align:middle line:84%
and I believe that anybody
can talk to angels.

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:58.620 align:middle line:84%
I believe that
anybody can do this.

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:01.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying, like, it's
like playing the piano.

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:03.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying everybody's
a concert pianist,

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:05.942 align:middle line:84%
but anybody can play the
piano if they want to.

00:24:05.942 --> 00:24:07.400 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Even if
it's Chopsticks.

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.941 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: Even
if it's Chopsticks.

00:24:08.941 --> 00:24:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And the angelic realm is
desperate to talk to us.

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:13.460 align:middle line:90%
They want to talk to us.

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:15.970 align:middle line:90%
And so anybody can do that.

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:18.860 align:middle line:84%
I believe that one of
the reasons I can do this

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:21.070 align:middle line:84%
is because I have
such a passion for it.

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:23.390 align:middle line:84%
I believe this is my
life purpose, which

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:25.740 align:middle line:84%
is to take tarot
out of the darkness

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:29.560 align:middle line:84%
and bring it into the light,
make it accessible to people,

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:32.730 align:middle line:84%
make it a situation where
people will buy these cards

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:37.130 align:middle line:84%
and go, "Oh, I don't have to
be afraid of this anymore.

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And I can get the information
that I need from my angels,

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:43.580 align:middle line:84%
or from my spirit guides, or
from the universe, or from God,

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:45.090 align:middle line:84%
or whatever name
you want to give

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:48.370 align:middle line:90%
it to make my life better."

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And if we can do that,
if we can tell people

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:54.020 align:middle line:84%
you can make your life
better, then we're

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:56.520 align:middle line:84%
right back where you and I
were talking before-- that's

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:58.780 align:middle line:84%
when they figure out
that life is magic.

00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:00.190 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: The angelic realm.

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:01.910 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: The
angelic realm, yes.

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:05.280 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Does the person
who is doing this need to be

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:07.317 align:middle line:90%
spiritual?

00:25:07.317 --> 00:25:09.400 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: Does the
person doing this need to be

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:09.960 align:middle line:90%
spiritual?

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:12.310 align:middle line:84%
Wow, that's a really
interesting question.

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:15.270 align:middle line:84%
I think that if
you're not spiritual,

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:18.640 align:middle line:84%
then you're not going to be open
to the answer to the question.

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:25.190 align:middle line:84%
So I would have to say depending
on the definition of spiritual,

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:29.470 align:middle line:84%
if that word to you means
open to hearing what

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:33.070 align:middle line:84%
the universe has to say
to you, and they're not,

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:35.250 align:middle line:84%
then you're not going
to get a good reading.

00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:38.840 align:middle line:84%
The only readings that I've ever
had that were really, really

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:41.870 align:middle line:84%
unpleasant for me
were people who

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:44.489 align:middle line:84%
came in, sat down
and went like this.

00:25:44.489 --> 00:25:45.530 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Non-believers.

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:47.570 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: And you could
tell that they were just there

00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:48.330 align:middle line:90%
to test me.

00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:50.270 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Right they
wanted you to screw up.

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:54.120 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: That's what they
wanted, and still I didn't.

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.470 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't want
to talk to them.

00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:57.429 align:middle line:90%
I ended those readings.

00:25:57.429 --> 00:25:59.095 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: You'd
prefer they just leave.

00:25:59.095 --> 00:26:01.130 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: It's just,
please, let's not.

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:02.610 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to play this game.

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:07.310 align:middle line:84%
So I think if you're not
open, you're not open.

00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:09.400 align:middle line:84%
You're not going
to get anything.

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:14.100 align:middle line:84%
And I also think that
the different archangels

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:17.200 align:middle line:84%
have different abilities
to help people.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.680 align:middle line:84%
Like archangel Haniel
is known for being

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:21.890 align:middle line:90%
archangel of psychic ability.

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:22.649 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:26:22.649 --> 00:26:24.690 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Can you call
on them as an individual?

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:26.840 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: Oh yes,
absolutely, absolutely.

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:27.880 align:middle line:90%
Any time you want to.

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and they're
that fast-- you know,

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:33.990 align:middle line:84%
10,000 angels if you
want them that quickly.

00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And it does help to know which
archangel does which thing.

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:40.210 align:middle line:90%
That is helpful for people.

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:44.150 align:middle line:84%
But if you live in this
life, if you believe,

00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:47.890 align:middle line:84%
then the angels give
you signs all the time.

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:51.090 align:middle line:84%
This morning, I-- just
this morning, seriously, I

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:56.270 align:middle line:84%
woke up at 5:55 AM and 555 is
change, change in our life.

00:26:56.270 --> 00:26:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And so I went downstairs, and I
was doing some angel research.

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And there was this
book, and I decided

00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:03.860 align:middle line:84%
this would be
easier on my Kindle.

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:06.880 align:middle line:84%
So I went to Kindle and I
downloaded it onto my Kindle.

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:09.380 align:middle line:84%
It didn't start on page
one when I opened it.

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:12.700 align:middle line:84%
It started on the very same page
that I had in the hardbound.

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:14.200 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: You
have it all set up.

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:15.580 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: Which
was chapter five.

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:17.538 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: What are the
odds of that happening?

00:27:17.538 --> 00:27:19.120 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: Right,
chapter five,

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:21.150 align:middle line:90%
just like the 5:55 that morning.

00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:25.930 align:middle line:84%
So this morning I had messages
from archangel Samael all time

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:29.039 align:middle line:84%
saying, "I'm helping you find
what you're looking for."

00:27:29.039 --> 00:27:30.830 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: What has
been for you, Radleigh,

00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:37.570 align:middle line:84%
the most sobering, incredible
story associated with angel

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:39.220 align:middle line:90%
tarot cards, for example?

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:45.340 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: Well, I think
one of my favorite stories is

00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:50.030 align:middle line:84%
a woman came to me, and she said
that she couldn't get pregnant.

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:52.800 align:middle line:84%
She was desperate to get
pregnant, and she couldn't.

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And I threw cards for
her, and in that moment

00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:59.500 align:middle line:90%
I said, "But you are pregnant."

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:01.452 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: She was
already pregnant?

00:28:01.452 --> 00:28:03.660 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: According to
my cards, she was pregnant.

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:05.010 align:middle line:90%
She said, "I can't be pregnant.

00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:06.820 align:middle line:84%
I took a pregnancy
test last night.

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:08.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm not pregnant."

00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:10.707 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Go home
and take another one."

00:28:10.707 --> 00:28:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And she called me the
next morning and said,

00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:13.500 align:middle line:90%
"I am pregnant."

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:14.287 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Wow.

00:28:14.287 --> 00:28:16.870 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: And then she wanted
to know the sex of the child,

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:19.620 align:middle line:90%
which I gave her, and was right.

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:21.120 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Those
cards are powerful.

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.036 align:middle line:90%
>> RADLEIGH: They are.

00:28:22.036 --> 00:28:26.080 align:middle line:84%
Another thing I think that was
really, really powerful-- that

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:28.500 align:middle line:84%
had to do with the cards,
but also with angels--

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:32.620 align:middle line:84%
is a gentleman came to me and
he had never known his dad,

00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:33.710 align:middle line:90%
not ever.

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And so the messages
I was getting

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:38.380 align:middle line:84%
for him was that well,
your dad loved you,

00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:39.860 align:middle line:90%
and your dad is with you.

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:41.070 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:42.160 align:middle line:90%
Blah, blah, blah.

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:45.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's like, where is
the validation in that for him?

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:48.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, anybody's going to
want to say that to him, right?

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And so as he was
getting ready to leave,

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:55.340 align:middle line:84%
archangel Uriel whispered
in my ear and said,

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:57.710 align:middle line:90%
"He has siblings."

00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:58.760 align:middle line:90%
And I just spit it out.

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:00.612 align:middle line:90%
I said, "You have siblings."

00:29:00.612 --> 00:29:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And he turned around, and he
looked at me and said, "Yeah."

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:04.197 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Was he in shock?

00:29:04.197 --> 00:29:06.530 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: Yeah, he was
like, yeah, so he knew he did,

00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:07.600 align:middle line:90%
but he hadn't told me.

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:08.950 align:middle line:90%
And he said, "That's right."

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:11.084 align:middle line:84%
I said, "You have a
brother and sister."

00:29:11.084 --> 00:29:11.750 align:middle line:90%
And he sat down.

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:12.640 align:middle line:90%
He said, "That's right."

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "The sister is
dead, but the brother is still

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:15.330 align:middle line:90%
alive."

00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:16.570 align:middle line:90%
He said, "I can't find him."

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:17.050 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Wow.

00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:19.050 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: And I said,
"He's in a nursing home

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:19.700 align:middle line:90%
in Australia."

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:22.680 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Are you
almost like a medium?

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:25.380 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: I wouldn't say
that, because that, to me,

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:27.310 align:middle line:84%
was just still
working with angels.

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:34.120 align:middle line:84%
That was getting the information
from his father to give to him.

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And the beautiful
thing about this

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.350 align:middle line:90%
was that he flew to Australia.

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:39.010 align:middle line:90%
He found his uncle.

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:43.860 align:middle line:10%
He wasn't in great shape, but
because I was able to do that,

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:46.560 align:middle line:10%
everything that I told him
about his father loving him

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:47.574 align:middle line:10%
was validated.

00:29:47.574 --> 00:29:48.240 align:middle line:90%
>> GEORGE: Sure.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:48.990 align:middle line:90%
And it helped him.

00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:51.150 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: Suddenly, in
a moment, he knew-- yeah,

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:52.620 align:middle line:90%
my dad really does love me.

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:55.120 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Radleigh, if people
want more information on what

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:57.112 align:middle line:90%
you do and how to find you--

00:29:57.112 --> 00:29:58.320 align:middle line:90%

You can find me at
RadleighValentine.com.

00:30:00.348 --> 00:30:01.965 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: You
better spell it out.

00:30:01.965 --> 00:30:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: I do
have an unusual name.

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:10.590 align:middle line:10%
It's R-A-D-L-E-I-G-H Valentine,

And are you accessible?

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:17.430 align:middle line:90%
Can people email you?

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:18.346 align:middle line:90%
>> RADLEIGH: They can.

00:30:18.346 --> 00:30:19.580 align:middle line:90%
They absolutely can.

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And we are booking-- I am
booking my events for 2015

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:24.990 align:middle line:90%

00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:27.100 align:middle line:84%

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:30.550 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE: Thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:31.860 align:middle line:84%
>> RADLEIGH: Thank
you, George, so much.

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:32.526 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:30:32.526 --> 00:30:36.530 align:middle line:10%

I'm George Noory.

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:50.900 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for watching

00:30:50.900 --> 00:31:06.368 align:middle line:90%
