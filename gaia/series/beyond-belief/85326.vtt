00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.960 align:middle line:10%
Because we are
going out into space

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.810 align:middle line:10%
with author and astrophysicist
Jeffrey Bennett.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.890 align:middle line:84%
Jeffrey, welcome to
be "Beyond Belief."

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:37.890 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY BENNET: Thanks
very much for having me

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:38.590 align:middle line:90%
here today, George.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.260 align:middle line:90%
Really appreciate it.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.093 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know, since
I was a little kid,

00:00:41.093 --> 00:00:44.220 align:middle line:84%
I've been just mesmerized
by space and everything

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.760 align:middle line:84%
that we've done since my
days with my little telescope

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.700 align:middle line:84%
to the moon landing
and where we are today.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.000 align:middle line:84%
As an astrophysicist,
you too, I guess,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.224 align:middle line:84%
you were very interested
in science as a kid.

00:00:57.224 --> 00:00:58.140 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Absolutely.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And I also grew up
with Apollo, and it's

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.690 align:middle line:84%
hard to believe it's
been 45 years since Neil

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.230 align:middle line:90%
Armstrong walked on the moon.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With that
technology, too.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: With that
technology, too, yes.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.450 align:middle line:90%
But it got me really enthused.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think every
human being in history

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.550 align:middle line:84%
has wanted to know, what's
our place in the universe?

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:18.800 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean?

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very fortunate,
as an astrophysicist,

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.920 align:middle line:84%
it means I get to, as a job,
learn about that kind of thing.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is astrophysicist?

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.990 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.030 align:middle line:10%
>>BENNETT:
Astrophysics is really

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.580 align:middle line:10%
just the physics
of the universe.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.890 align:middle line:10%
And really today, it's a
synonym with the word astronomy.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.890 align:middle line:10%
So it's the study of the stars,
the planets, the galaxies,

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.630 align:middle line:10%
and the entire universe and
how Earth fits into that.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.300 align:middle line:10%
And the physics part
comes from the fact

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.324 align:middle line:10%
that today, if you want
to study those things,

00:01:47.324 --> 00:01:48.740 align:middle line:10%
you have to do it
through physics.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.630 align:middle line:90%
There's no other way.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have got to ask
you about this emerging

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.860 align:middle line:90%
theory of the multiverses.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.860 align:middle line:84%
I saw a picture a
couple weeks ago,

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.110 align:middle line:84%
Jeffrey, where they had
this massive emptiness.

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.810 align:middle line:90%
Let's call it the universe.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:04.720 align:middle line:90%
Massive.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And each one had
a little bubble.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And each bubble, they
said, was a universe.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And they're scattered
all over the place

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.950 align:middle line:84%
of this massive--
this massive whatever.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.800 align:middle line:90%
It is that possible?

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: It's
definitely possible.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure it's probable yet.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.120 align:middle line:84%
So the multiverse
is this new idea

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.210 align:middle line:84%
that's come about to try to
reconcile some of the things

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.340 align:middle line:84%
that-- some of the
questions that we don't know

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.270 align:middle line:84%
the answers to
yet, the multiverse

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.580 align:middle line:84%
might give us a
way to get answers.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.820 align:middle line:84%
But so far, I think it's
important to remember,

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.240 align:middle line:90%
we know about the universe.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.240 align:middle line:84%
We can study the universe
with our telescopes.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.610 align:middle line:90%
We know all about it.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.930 align:middle line:84%
We have zero evidence that
there are other universes.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.224 align:middle line:84%
It's just kind of an idea that's
floating around right now.

00:02:48.224 --> 00:02:49.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bizarre idea.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.610 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: A bizarre idea.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.010 align:middle line:84%
And personally, if I
had to place a bet,

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.790 align:middle line:84%
I would probably bet
that it'll turn out

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:55.940 align:middle line:90%
there is no multiverse.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just us.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Just
one universe, yes.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.020 align:middle line:84%
But other scientists will
disagree with me on that.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.270 align:middle line:84%
We'll just have to see
where the evidence points us

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:06.020 align:middle line:90%
in the future.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.561 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's
take the posture

00:03:07.561 --> 00:03:10.020 align:middle line:90%
that there's only one universe.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.520 align:middle line:84%
I still have a very difficult
time understanding the Big Bang

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.390 align:middle line:90%
theory.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand how
all this was created,

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.200 align:middle line:84%
how it started in the
first place, what happened,

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.860 align:middle line:90%
what was the bang.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.680 align:middle line:90%
Help us, Jeff.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.482 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Well, one
of the things that's

00:03:26.482 --> 00:03:27.940 align:middle line:84%
important to remember
about science

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.680 align:middle line:84%
is science looks
at the evidence,

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.650 align:middle line:84%
and it can then tell us, here's
what it looks like happened.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.460 align:middle line:84%
It won't tell us
why that happened.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.860 align:middle line:84%
So the Big Bang,
there's a large deal

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.820 align:middle line:84%
of evidence pointing to the
fact that the universe was all

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.960 align:middle line:84%
compressed to a very small
size 14 billion years ago.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How small?

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Everything was
basically smashed together

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.990 align:middle line:90%
into essentially one point.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:55.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a dot?

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.100 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Yeah.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.100 align:middle line:84%
There's some complexities
with the infinities there.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.570 align:middle line:84%
You can be infinitely
compressed and still infinite

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.660 align:middle line:84%
in size, if you're
infinite total.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.147 align:middle line:84%
Probably best to ignore that
and just think of it as--

00:04:07.147 --> 00:04:08.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That'll
confuse me even more.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:09.060 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Right.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.559 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:11.601 align:middle line:84%
Everything that we see in
our observable universe

00:04:11.601 --> 00:04:13.475 align:middle line:84%
would have been compressed
to a single point.

00:04:13.475 --> 00:04:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Every
physical thing we see.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.260 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Everything.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Every star.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:16.549 align:middle line:90%
Every planet.

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.715 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: All the way to
the 14 billion light years

00:04:18.715 --> 00:04:20.570 align:middle line:84%
in every direction
was all in one point.

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I can't handle it.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: I don't think
anybody really can.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.820 align:middle line:84%
But the evidence says
that it was like that,

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.840 align:middle line:84%
and it started to expand
14 billion years ago.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What was the bang?

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: The
bang is a misnomer.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.790 align:middle line:90%
It's actually a funny story.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.100 align:middle line:10%
Fred Hoyle was an
astrophysicist who

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.510 align:middle line:10%
did not believe that
the universe had

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.780 align:middle line:10%
a beginning like that, and he
gave it the name, this idea,

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.060 align:middle line:10%
the name the Big Bang in
order to make fun of it.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.510 align:middle line:90%
But the name stuck.

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:49.740 align:middle line:90%
There's not really a bang.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.060 align:middle line:90%
It's just the fact that today--

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.995 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
confusing to people.

00:04:51.995 --> 00:04:52.703 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: It is.

00:04:52.703 --> 00:04:55.080 align:middle line:84%
Today we see the
universe as expanding.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.207 align:middle line:84%
If it's expanding,
that means in the past,

00:04:57.207 --> 00:04:58.290 align:middle line:90%
it must have been smaller.

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And if you go back far enough,
it was all in one spot.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.230 align:middle line:84%
So the Big Bang is nothing
more than the moment

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:05.900 align:middle line:90%
when the expansion began.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.151 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 14 billion years ago?

00:05:07.151 --> 00:05:08.483 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: 14 billion years ago.

00:05:08.483 --> 00:05:10.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What started
the expansion?

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.699 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: No one knows.

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:12.240 align:middle line:90%
No one knows.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did it get there?

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: No one knows.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.050 align:middle line:84%
Scientifically, what we
can say is the evidence

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.340 align:middle line:84%
says it began expanding
14 billion years ago.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.350 align:middle line:84%
But why, whether there
was anything before that,

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.950 align:middle line:84%
those are questions that
today we cannot answer.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, that multiverse
idea is actually

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.410 align:middle line:84%
an attempt to try to come
up with some answers to it.

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.170 align:middle line:84%
But as I said, I'm
not convinced yet.

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it possible the
universe, in its present state,

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.750 align:middle line:90%
was always the way it is?

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Not according
to the evidence

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.760 align:middle line:84%
that we see because
of several things.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.169 align:middle line:90%
We see that it is expanding--

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:48.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Expansion.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Which means it
was smaller in the past.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.380 align:middle line:84%
Also, Einstein's
theory of relativity

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.960 align:middle line:84%
tells us it has to be either
expanding or contracting.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.280 align:middle line:84%
So it can't just be
static all the time.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.002 align:middle line:84%
And then when you look out
with telescopes, you know,

00:06:04.002 --> 00:06:05.600 align:middle line:84%
as you look to
greater distances,

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.600 align:middle line:84%
you're actually looking
farther back in time

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.210 align:middle line:84%
because the light has
taken time to reach us.

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And when we look
to great distances,

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.730 align:middle line:84%
like when we look to seven
billion light years away,

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.610 align:middle line:84%
we're looking halfway back into
the history of the universe.

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And what you see
is galaxies that

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.590 align:middle line:84%
look half the age of
the ones around here.

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.030 align:middle line:84%
So we see direct evidence
that the universe

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.810 align:middle line:84%
has been changing and
evolving through time.

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When we talk
about expansion, to me,

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.620 align:middle line:90%
you expand into something.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.300 align:middle line:84%
The universe is
just merely getting

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.910 align:middle line:90%
a bigger and bigger and bigger.

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:44.400 align:middle line:90%
Do you believe it's endless?

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.691 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to come up
against a wall, for example?

00:06:46.691 --> 00:06:48.010 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: There is no wall.

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:51.110 align:middle line:84%
And Einstein's general
theory of relativity

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:52.780 align:middle line:84%
gives us the way
of picturing that.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And the trick, which can't
really put very simply quickly,

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.180 align:middle line:84%
is to think of it
in four dimensions.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.890 align:middle line:84%
The analogy that we can
use in two dimensions

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:03.750 align:middle line:90%
is the surface of a balloon.

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.620 align:middle line:84%
So if you imagine
that the universe is

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:10.050 align:middle line:84%
the surface of a balloon, not
the inside, not the outside,

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:12.550 align:middle line:84%
the galaxies are
dots on the surface,

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:14.940 align:middle line:84%
the Big Bang was when
the balloon was very tiny

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.620 align:middle line:90%
before it started to blow up.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And as it expands, you
notice the surface just

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.970 align:middle line:84%
keeps getting bigger
and bigger and bigger.

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:25.190 align:middle line:84%
But there isn't a
pre-existing surface there.

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:27.070 align:middle line:90%
The surface is just growing.

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.650 align:middle line:84%
And in the same way,
our whole universe,

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:32.140 align:middle line:84%
except for in four
dimensions instead of two,

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:34.030 align:middle line:90%
is growing as it expands.

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:35.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like a
balloon, the bigger it

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.150 align:middle line:84%
gets, it's going
to pop eventually.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:41.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Probably
not, at least

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:43.637 align:middle line:84%
according to anything
we understand today.

00:07:43.637 --> 00:07:44.970 align:middle line:90%
So that would be the difference.

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:48.760 align:middle line:84%
We'd have to imagine a balloon
that can stretch indefinitely.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now the
primordial soup,

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.690 align:middle line:84%
as I call it in
the universe, which

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:56.230 align:middle line:84%
I believe is the
same everywhere.

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:59.820 align:middle line:84%
This solar system, it's the
same in another solar system.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.867 align:middle line:90%
The elements are all the same.

00:08:01.867 --> 00:08:03.450 align:middle line:84%
I really doubt if
you're going to have

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:07.900 align:middle line:84%
any different kind of element
possible, but maybe not.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.150 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that could
be the case, where

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:13.270 align:middle line:84%
everything is the
same out there?

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:16.400 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Very much it
is, and we know that it is.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.440 align:middle line:84%
Because when you look
out with telescopes,

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:22.240 align:middle line:84%
you not only can see images,
but you can take the light,

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.081 align:middle line:84%
put it through a prism
or diffraction ring,

00:08:24.081 --> 00:08:25.330 align:middle line:90%
and spread it into a spectrum.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And you can measure the
composition of things

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:29.340 align:middle line:90%
at great distances.

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:31.819 align:middle line:84%
And what you find is that
everywhere in the universe,

00:08:31.819 --> 00:08:33.860 align:middle line:84%
the chemical composition
is essentially the same.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:35.765 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is the same.

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:36.390 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Yes.

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And as you know, one of our
favorite topics, both of us,

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.400 align:middle line:90%
is extraterrestrial life.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the reasons
why scientifically we think

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:45.380 align:middle line:84%
it's very, very
likely that there

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.510 align:middle line:84%
is lots of extraterrestrial
life out there.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:50.760 align:middle line:84%
Because there's nothing special
about the composition here

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.762 align:middle line:84%
or anything that
happened here on Earth

00:08:52.762 --> 00:08:54.970 align:middle line:84%
that shouldn't have happened
in much the same way all

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:55.380 align:middle line:90%
over the place.

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if happened here,
it probably happened there.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.330 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Exactly.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.405 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if they're a
billion years ahead of us--

00:09:01.405 --> 00:09:03.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Then they're a
billion years ahead of us, yes.

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.488 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: More knowledge,
more everything.

00:09:05.488 --> 00:09:06.550 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Absolutely.

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:08.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
civilizations, Jeffrey,

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:13.330 align:middle line:84%
get to a point where they
will eventually die out?

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:14.240 align:middle line:90%
Even the humans.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.260 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, we're going to
reach a peak, a saturation

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.940 align:middle line:90%
point, and then tail off.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: It's a really
interesting question.

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:25.410 align:middle line:84%
My own belief is that
you either-- and this

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:28.290 align:middle line:84%
is very important, because
it's where we are today.

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:31.710 align:middle line:84%
You reach a point like we
are now, where we actually

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:34.440 align:middle line:84%
have so much power
in our technology

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.120 align:middle line:84%
that we can do a lot of
really horrible things.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And we could easily
wipe ourselves out

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:41.910 align:middle line:84%
of existence over
this next century.

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:47.430 align:middle line:84%
If we don't, if we find a
way to solve our problems,

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:51.110 align:middle line:84%
that's going to require
creating political structures,

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:53.080 align:middle line:84%
social structures
that prevent people

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.570 align:middle line:84%
from using this
technology in bad ways.

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And if we do that,
then the doors

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.800 align:middle line:84%
are wide open for us
to set out to colonize

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.950 align:middle line:84%
the planets, and maybe
thousands of years

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:05.270 align:middle line:84%
from now to begin
colonizing the stars.

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And once you do
that, it would seem

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:11.000 align:middle line:84%
like you're almost immune
to being wiped out,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.060 align:middle line:84%
because as you spread yourselves
around to many worlds,

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.750 align:middle line:84%
even if one world
suffered a catastrophe,

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:18.370 align:middle line:84%
you will survive
on-- your species

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:20.120 align:middle line:90%
will survive on other worlds.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And you already have
these structures,

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.570 align:middle line:84%
political and
social, in place that

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:25.960 align:middle line:90%
are allowing you to survive.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:30.230 align:middle line:84%
So I think civilizations get to
this point where we are today,

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:31.850 align:middle line:84%
and this is where
it all has to--

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:32.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's the turning point.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.941 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: This is
the turning point.

00:10:33.941 --> 00:10:36.790 align:middle line:84%
It's over the next
50, 100 years for us

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:38.610 align:middle line:84%
that we make all
the decisions that

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:43.130 align:middle line:84%
will decide whether we
end up wiping ourselves

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:45.630 align:middle line:84%
out and falling off,
or whether we're

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:48.060 align:middle line:84%
on our way to becoming
a galactic civilization.

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:50.212 align:middle line:84%
Or joining a galactic
civilization that

00:10:50.212 --> 00:10:51.170 align:middle line:90%
may already predate us.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:52.224 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Federation.

00:10:52.224 --> 00:10:53.390 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Correct, exactly.

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:58.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I suspect that mankind
may have obliterated itself

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:01.960 align:middle line:84%
a long time ago and then
just started over again.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that's
happened a couple times.

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:08.600 align:middle line:84%
There is some evidence
of atomic explosions

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:12.210 align:middle line:84%
in the desert in the Middle
East, where, deep down, they

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:13.580 align:middle line:90%
see glass.

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.270 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if that was
an asteroid explosion

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:19.460 align:middle line:84%
or if it was a
nuke that went off.

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:20.650 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:23.910 align:middle line:84%
Could mankind, 100
million years ago,

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:26.122 align:middle line:84%
have been where we
are today, and they

00:11:26.122 --> 00:11:27.080 align:middle line:90%
obliterated themselves?

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Well, I think
in terms of humans,

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:33.520 align:middle line:84%
of Homo sapiens,
humans only evolved

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.740 align:middle line:84%
over the past couple
of million years.

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:38.160 align:middle line:84%
So if you go that
far back, it wouldn't

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.390 align:middle line:90%
have been Homo sapiens.

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:41.300 align:middle line:84%
Could there have
been dinosaurs that

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:44.020 align:middle line:84%
were intelligent
enough to do that?

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:45.164 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that still seems--

00:11:45.164 --> 00:11:46.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or something.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.090 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Yes.

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:49.550 align:middle line:84%
It's within the
realm of possibility.

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:52.092 align:middle line:84%
The more fossil evidence
we get, the harder

00:11:52.092 --> 00:11:54.050 align:middle line:84%
it is to see if that
could have really happened

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:56.490 align:middle line:84%
because we're not seeing
anything in the record

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:58.690 align:middle line:90%
quite like that.

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And certainly in
other worlds, this

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:03.937 align:middle line:84%
may have happened
multiple times.

00:12:03.937 --> 00:12:06.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jeffrey, you're an
accomplished author, as well

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:08.280 align:middle line:90%
as being an astrophysicist.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And you've written a
number of books, primarily

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:12.830 align:middle line:90%
children's books.

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:14.715 align:middle line:84%
Tell me how that evolution
occurred for you.

00:12:14.715 --> 00:12:16.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Well, I actually
write-- most of my time

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:20.230 align:middle line:84%
is spent working on college
textbooks in math and science

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:21.070 align:middle line:90%
that I write.

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:23.520 align:middle line:84%
But I'd always wanted to
write children's books.

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And so once my
college textbooks were

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:30.320 align:middle line:84%
doing well enough that I could
afford to indulge some hobbies,

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.496 align:middle line:90%
I decided that my hobbies--

00:12:31.496 --> 00:12:32.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Have a little fun.

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:35.244 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Yes, was going to be
writing these children's books.

00:12:35.244 --> 00:12:38.140 align:middle line:84%
So I got started
working on these.

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:41.425 align:middle line:84%
This is my dog Max, who
stars in four of them.

00:12:41.425 --> 00:12:42.550 align:middle line:90%
And I thought it would be--

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:43.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Max is a
regular, isn't he?

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:44.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Max is a regular.

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:45.996 align:middle line:84%
I thought it would
be fun for kids

00:12:45.996 --> 00:12:49.450 align:middle line:84%
to have a story where Max
goes off to various places.

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:52.340 align:middle line:84%
The space station, the
moon, Mars, Jupiter.

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And so he goes on these
little adventures,

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:58.200 align:middle line:84%
which are what a real
dog might actually do.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.820 align:middle line:84%
But in the background,
there's always

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:02.160 align:middle line:84%
something science-oriented
taking place.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And then on the
sides of the pages,

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:07.210 align:middle line:84%
I explain that science
in more detail.

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:09.960 align:middle line:84%
So the goal is to get
kids hooked with the story

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.170 align:middle line:84%
and then teach them
some real science.

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:14.287 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Always a good
ending for Max, I hope.

00:13:14.287 --> 00:13:15.620 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Always a good ending.

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:18.500 align:middle line:84%
He comes out the
hero every time, yes.

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've got
some of the astronauts

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:24.140 align:middle line:84%
aboard the International Space
Station recording or reading

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:24.690 align:middle line:90%
these books.

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:26.190 align:middle line:90%
What's going on there?

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:29.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Well, I work at home,
and I do everything by email.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.090 align:middle line:90%
My phone hardly ever rings.

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:32.590 align:middle line:84%
So I screen it
because it's usually

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:35.160 align:middle line:90%
a solicitation or something.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:36.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or us.

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.119 align:middle line:90%
Can you come on the show?

00:13:38.119 --> 00:13:40.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: I get this
phone call from this woman.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.880 align:middle line:84%
She starts saying, we're
looking for the Max author.

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:42.640 align:middle line:90%
So I picked it up.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.980 align:middle line:84%
And she says, I'm here
with astronaut Alvin Drew.

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And her name was
Patricia Tribe, and she

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:48.630 align:middle line:84%
had been the
Director of Education

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:50.730 align:middle line:84%
down at the Houston
Space Center.

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:54.590 align:middle line:84%
And we have this idea to read
books from the Space Station,

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:55.560 align:middle line:90%
or the space shuttle.

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:56.640 align:middle line:90%
And we like yours.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.920 align:middle line:10%
Can we do that?

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.670 align:middle line:10%
First, I thought it
was a joke, of course.

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:04.250 align:middle line:10%
But yeah, of course I'm
going to say yes, you

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:05.620 align:middle line:10%
can read my books from space.

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:09.320 align:middle line:10%
And so astronaut Alvin Drew
read "Max Goes to the Moon"

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.205 align:middle line:10%
from the space shuttle
Discovery in 2011.

00:14:11.205 --> 00:14:12.070 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Live?

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:13.120 align:middle line:10%
>>BENNETT: Not live.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.790 align:middle line:10%
They videoed reading it.

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:17.280 align:middle line:10%
But the video's
posted on the web now.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:20.540 align:middle line:10%
And there he read a
PDF because the weight

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:22.680 align:middle line:10%
of sending it was
too much at the time,

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:26.010 align:middle line:10%
but it was successful enough
that the folks running

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:30.760 align:middle line:10%
the Space Station, the Center
for the Advancement of Science

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.881 align:middle line:10%
In Space, CASIS, they send
all the payloads to the space

00:14:33.881 --> 00:14:34.380 align:middle line:10%
station.

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:35.849 align:middle line:84%
And they got excited
about the idea

00:14:35.849 --> 00:14:37.640 align:middle line:84%
and said, well, let's
send the actual books

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.220 align:middle line:84%
up there so the
astronauts can read them.

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:40.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Physically have them.

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.030 align:middle line:10%
>>BENNETT: And they decided to
take these five books that I

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:43.890 align:middle line:10%
wrote, and they were
launched in January.

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:45.554 align:middle line:10%
They're still orbiting.

00:14:45.554 --> 00:14:47.220 align:middle line:84%
So they're up there
going over our heads

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.626 align:middle line:84%
every 90 minutes right now
at 17,000 miles an hour.

00:14:49.626 --> 00:14:51.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And this is
in English, right?

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:54.340 align:middle line:10%
>>BENNETT: So they're reading
the books-- all five books have

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:55.410 align:middle line:10%
now been read in English.

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:58.990 align:middle line:10%
The videos are done raw.

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:01.340 align:middle line:10%
Now they have post production
and stuff to go through.

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:03.840 align:middle line:10%
But one of them's already posted
on storytimefromspace.com.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.740 align:middle line:10%
But in the meantime,
we've also sent up

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:08.830 align:middle line:10%
translations of the
books for astronauts

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:10.000 align:middle line:10%
who speak those languages.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.330 align:middle line:84%
So Japanese astronaut
Koichi Wakata

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:15.410 align:middle line:84%
read one of the books
in Japanese already.

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:17.550 align:middle line:84%
There is a German astronaut
up there right now,

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:19.500 align:middle line:84%
so we have sent-- we're
working on getting

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.580 align:middle line:84%
German translations ready
for him to read from.

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:25.040 align:middle line:84%
So he'll have the book to
show the pictures in English,

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.570 align:middle line:90%
but he'll read in German.

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:28.340 align:middle line:84%
The Russian cosmonauts,
we've already

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:29.920 align:middle line:90%
sent them the translation.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as the
Russians and Americans

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:34.725 align:middle line:84%
start talking better again--
hopefully that will be soon.

00:15:34.725 --> 00:15:35.558 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's hope.

00:15:35.558 --> 00:15:36.240 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Yes.

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.490 align:middle line:84%
They will hopefully
read in Russian.

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:39.990 align:middle line:84%
So we're getting
multiple languages.

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:42.569 align:middle line:84%
The videos are posted for
anyone to read around the world.

00:15:42.569 --> 00:15:44.610 align:middle line:84%
I actually just got back
from a trip to Ethiopia.

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:47.380 align:middle line:90%


00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.760 align:middle line:10%
There, even in the
poorer schools,

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:53.670 align:middle line:10%
there's usually at least one
computer with internet access.

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:55.040 align:middle line:10%
And so they're really excited.

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:57.260 align:middle line:10%
They're going to be able
to show these videos.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do they
think of space, those kids?

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:02.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: You know,
it's really interesting.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.580 align:middle line:84%
The older kids at the good
schools will know quite a bit,

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:09.310 align:middle line:84%
but the younger kids have very
little knowledge about space.

00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:11.850 align:middle line:84%
So we're really trying
to use this program,

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:15.140 align:middle line:84%
not just to-- some of this
is pretty advanced for them

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.270 align:middle line:84%
if they don't even realize
yet that the Earth goes

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:19.560 align:middle line:84%
around the sun, which is the
case for a lot of the younger

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:20.059 align:middle line:90%
kids.

00:16:20.059 --> 00:16:22.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's only
6,000 years old, right?

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:26.597 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: They don't have that
part in their culture there.

00:16:26.597 --> 00:16:28.930 align:middle line:84%
They have a lot of things
that they need for background.

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:32.240 align:middle line:84%
So one of the beauties of this
program, Story Time from Space,

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:35.030 align:middle line:84%
is in addition to the
videos being posted,

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:37.430 align:middle line:84%
we can post all kinds
of curricular materials

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:40.180 align:middle line:84%
that will work for different
cultures, different levels

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:42.890 align:middle line:90%
of education around the world.

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:44.970 align:middle line:84%
That work hasn't been
done yet, but we're

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:47.750 align:middle line:84%
hoping over the next
few years that we'll

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:50.710 align:middle line:84%
be able to post things so that
it'll make it possible for kids

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:52.541 align:middle line:84%
all around the world
to learn a lot more.

00:16:52.541 --> 00:16:54.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jeffrey,
when we were kids,

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.940 align:middle line:90%
we all wanted to be astronauts.

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:57.500 align:middle line:90%
We loved space.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.390 align:middle line:84%
I sense that that's
not the case anymore.

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:02.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't hear young
people talking

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.270 align:middle line:90%
about being an astronaut.

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:08.099 align:middle line:84%
They're more interested in being
sports figures or something.

00:17:08.099 --> 00:17:10.569 align:middle line:84%
What has happened to
the space program?

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:12.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Well, I think
in large part that's

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:15.530 align:middle line:84%
a function of the fact that the
space program has kind of faded

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:16.214 align:middle line:90%
into the background.

00:17:16.214 --> 00:17:17.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It sure has.

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:18.478 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: When
you put it forward,

00:17:18.478 --> 00:17:21.657 align:middle line:84%
when I go and I do my school
visits, I always talk about it.

00:17:21.657 --> 00:17:23.490 align:middle line:84%
In "Max Goes to the
Moon," one of the things

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:24.948 align:middle line:84%
that happens at
the end of the book

00:17:24.948 --> 00:17:28.670 align:middle line:84%
is they build the University of
the Moon, where kids can go to,

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:31.270 align:middle line:84%
if they do well in school,
can go to college on the moon.

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And after my school
presentations,

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:36.350 align:middle line:84%
I say how many of you would like
to go to college on the moon?

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And you can bet every
single hand is going up.

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:43.750 align:middle line:84%
So I think the interest is
still there when it is sparked.

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:45.860 align:middle line:84%
The problem is,
when we were kids,

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:48.110 align:middle line:84%
that Apollo was out there
in front of us all the time.

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:49.568 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was
there all the time.

00:17:49.568 --> 00:17:51.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Today, it's
in the background.

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, one of the
really interesting things,

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:55.160 align:middle line:84%
when I do my school
presentations with these books,

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.860 align:middle line:84%
one of the first
things I'll ask is

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:58.800 align:middle line:84%
if I'm doing "Max Goes
to the Moon," I'll say,

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:00.230 align:middle line:90%
is this a true story?

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm dealing with
kindergarten and first grade,

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:06.190 align:middle line:84%
about half the kids will
think that my dog has really

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:07.250 align:middle line:90%
been to the moon.

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:08.666 align:middle line:84%
They think we're
going to the moon

00:18:08.666 --> 00:18:12.370 align:middle line:84%
all the time because they've
seen Star Wars, all the science

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:13.330 align:middle line:90%
fiction.

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:15.400 align:middle line:84%
They're kind of shocked
when they find out

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.760 align:middle line:84%
that this is not something
that we're doing all the time.

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And they're disappointed
when they find that out.

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.520 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's a real
opportunity and an imperative

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.160 align:middle line:84%
for us as a nation
and as a world

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.520 align:middle line:84%
to really start pushing
the space program again.

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:33.200 align:middle line:84%
Because this is what kids
are interested in-- if we

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:34.440 align:middle line:90%
can provide it for them.

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.720 align:middle line:84%
So if we do it, if we start
building colonies on the moon,

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:43.150 align:middle line:84%
if we start sending people out
to Mars and Jupiter and beyond,

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:45.310 align:middle line:84%
I think that will
make kids all around

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:48.000 align:middle line:84%
the world get more excited
about an education,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.240 align:middle line:84%
be more inspired
to try and solve

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.200 align:middle line:84%
the problems we have today and
make this world a better place.

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Aren't we the lucky
ones to have experienced

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:59.570 align:middle line:84%
man walking on the moon and
different things like that?

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:00.520 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Absolutely.

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:03.780 align:middle line:84%
And as Carl Sagan
used to point out,

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.650 align:middle line:84%
you only get to do
things first once.

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:07.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: One time.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:10.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: And we sent--
during our lifetimes, you

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:15.300 align:middle line:84%
and I anyway, we visited every
planet for the first time

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:17.350 align:middle line:90%
with robotic spacecraft.

00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And we're very fortunate
to have lived through that.

00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:24.230 align:middle line:84%
But of course, first
is only the beginning.

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:26.270 align:middle line:10%
The kids of today
have the opportunity

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:28.710 align:middle line:10%
to be the ones who
take it from oh,

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:31.470 align:middle line:10%
let's just take a peek,
to let's make it real.

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:32.700 align:middle line:10%
Let's make it permanent.

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:35.180 align:middle line:10%
And we need to give
them that opportunity

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.687 align:middle line:10%
by pushing our space
program forward.

00:19:37.687 --> 00:19:39.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are we
going to do as a nation

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:41.650 align:middle line:84%
to get the space
program going again?

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:45.850 align:middle line:84%
Because NASA, I
think, is under siege.

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:47.900 align:middle line:84%
They don't have quite
even the money to make

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:50.340 align:middle line:84%
some launches that
they should be.

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And privatization of
space is starting, too.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.370 align:middle line:84%
You think it's going
to go that way, where

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:58.570 align:middle line:84%
the private companies will
get us back to the moon,

00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:02.659 align:middle line:84%
get us to Mars, and that NASA
may simply be a funnel point?

00:20:02.659 --> 00:20:04.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Well, I think we
need a combination of both.

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:07.630 align:middle line:84%
Private companies are
doing fantastic things.

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:12.240 align:middle line:84%
But in most cases, they're doing
them under contract with NASA.

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:16.100 align:middle line:84%
So you need NASA
to seed that market

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:17.360 align:middle line:90%
for these private companies.

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:19.036 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, the
private companies

00:20:19.036 --> 00:20:20.660 align:middle line:84%
will be able to take
over those things.

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:24.330 align:middle line:84%
But you're going to need
NASA and the government money

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:26.950 align:middle line:84%
to make it happen, to get
that moon colony started,

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:29.670 align:middle line:84%
to get the Mars mission
started, and so on.

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's really all just a
matter of political will.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:36.500 align:middle line:84%
NASA's budget today
is, in real dollars,

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:39.320 align:middle line:84%
about a fifth of what it
was during the Apollo era.

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:40.860 align:middle line:84%
We just don't fund
it well anymore.

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:41.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is.

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:42.221 align:middle line:10%
It's dwarfed what it was.

00:20:42.221 --> 00:20:45.060 align:middle line:10%
>>BENNETT: And the amount, every
year when you hear the horror

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:47.663 align:middle line:10%
stories about the
federal deficit,

00:20:47.663 --> 00:20:50.340 align:middle line:10%
even come October when
they publish the numbers,

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:52.992 align:middle line:10%
until the week before they
get the final numbers,

00:20:52.992 --> 00:20:54.450 align:middle line:10%
they don't know
within $20 billion,

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:57.860 align:middle line:10%
$30 billion what the actual
deficit's going to be.

00:20:57.860 --> 00:20:59.560 align:middle line:90%
That's more than NASA's budget.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:04.210 align:middle line:84%
It's in the error bar
of the federal deficit.

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:08.980 align:middle line:84%
So we could easily afford
to put a lot more into NASA.

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps the most
disappointing part of all this

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:14.250 align:middle line:84%
is that studies
by economists show

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:17.460 align:middle line:84%
that every dollar we put
into NASA comes back to us

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:21.340 align:middle line:84%
between 5 and 10 times over
in the economic benefits

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:22.430 align:middle line:90%
that we get out of it.

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:24.390 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And the
overt space program

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:27.872 align:middle line:10%
I think for the
military is ongoing.

00:21:27.872 --> 00:21:28.830 align:middle line:10%
>>BENNETT: That's true.

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:32.390 align:middle line:10%
And fortunately, there has
been some interaction there.

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:34.190 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the
military programs do

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:37.220 align:middle line:84%
come into the civilian
program eventually.

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:40.020 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, we need to do
a lot more with NASA,

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:41.296 align:middle line:90%
and more internationally.

00:21:41.296 --> 00:21:42.670 align:middle line:84%
You know, the
Chinese are getting

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:44.420 align:middle line:90%
ready to build a space station.

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:45.524 align:middle line:90%
Which is wonderful.

00:21:45.524 --> 00:21:47.190 align:middle line:10%
But why are they doing
it by themselves?

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:48.250 align:middle line:10%
Why are we not
doing it together?

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:49.583 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Where's the Federation?

00:21:49.583 --> 00:21:51.540 align:middle line:10%
>>BENNETT: Where is
the Federation, right.

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:53.460 align:middle line:10%
And even the International
Space Station,

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:56.370 align:middle line:10%
where the Russians and the
United States and Europe

00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:57.960 align:middle line:10%
and Japan have all
worked together

00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:02.800 align:middle line:10%
to make this happen, right now
that partnership is in danger

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.330 align:middle line:10%
because of the political events.

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:07.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, right now
we have to rely on Russia

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:09.860 align:middle line:90%
to get up and to get down.

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:12.540 align:middle line:84%
Would they ever be to the
point where they would say,

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:17.150 align:middle line:84%
sorry, we're not going to take
your people up or down anymore?

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:21.089 align:middle line:10%
Do we have astronauts that
could be stuck up there?

00:22:21.089 --> 00:22:21.880 align:middle line:10%
Would they do that?

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:24.338 align:middle line:10%
>> BENNETT: They've already
said that they're going to stop

00:22:24.338 --> 00:22:26.617 align:middle line:10%
giving us the rides
as of, I think, 2020.

00:22:26.617 --> 00:22:28.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they'll
bring them down, I hope.

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:28.840 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Yes.

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe they'd leave
anybody really stranded,

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:33.066 align:middle line:84%
although you never know
what people are going to do.

00:22:33.066 --> 00:22:35.550 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting thing is
all these political things

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:38.380 align:middle line:84%
on the ground, the
astronauts and the cosmonauts

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:40.914 align:middle line:84%
up on the space station,
they all get along just fine.

00:22:40.914 --> 00:22:43.080 align:middle line:84%
The scientists have been
working together just fine.

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:43.280 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.090 align:middle line:10%
It's the politicians, Jeffrey.

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:45.530 align:middle line:10%
>>BENNETT: It's just
the politicians.

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:46.946 align:middle line:10%
And that's another
reason why it's

00:22:46.946 --> 00:22:49.740 align:middle line:10%
so important for us in the space
program to do things globally

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:51.230 align:middle line:10%
and internationally.

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:55.080 align:middle line:10%
I like to point out that if
we had a colony on the moon,

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:58.070 align:middle line:10%
and international scientists
all working up there,

00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:00.682 align:middle line:10%
then you'd have these kids
in Iraq and Iran and Israel

00:23:00.682 --> 00:23:02.390 align:middle line:10%
and Palestine, and
they could all look up

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:05.375 align:middle line:10%
at the moon in the night sky,
and they'd say, you know,

00:23:05.375 --> 00:23:07.930 align:middle line:10%
our scientists are all
working together up there

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:09.340 align:middle line:10%
and just getting along fine.

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:11.200 align:middle line:90%
What's our problem down here?

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.500 align:middle line:84%
And I think that might
have a real effect

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:16.720 align:middle line:84%
in changing the way that people
interact with each other,

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:19.114 align:middle line:84%
and hopefully bringing
out our better side.

00:23:19.114 --> 00:23:20.530 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Do you
have-- and I think

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:22.880 align:middle line:10%
you do, just by
looking at your books--

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.390 align:middle line:10%
hope for the future
with our young people?

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:27.830 align:middle line:10%
>>BENNETT: I have a lot
of hope for the future.

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's very
important to have that hope.

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:33.380 align:middle line:84%
I like to think of education
as being a three-prong thing.

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:35.980 align:middle line:84%
Education, perspective,
and inspiration.

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:38.960 align:middle line:10%
You'll see that in the books,
the education is the science

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.930 align:middle line:10%
content that's in all of these.

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:43.370 align:middle line:10%
The perspective though is
when you're on the moon

00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:45.900 align:middle line:10%
or on the space station or
on Mars, and you look back,

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.210 align:middle line:10%
and you see how tiny
Earth looks from there.

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:52.650 align:middle line:84%
It changes the way you think
about us and our interactions

00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:53.900 align:middle line:90%
with each other.

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:56.080 align:middle line:84%
But then we also have to
have that inspiration.

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:57.870 align:middle line:10%
We have to show the
kids that, look,

00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:00.630 align:middle line:10%
if we get our act together,
this is what you can do.

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:06.090 align:middle line:10%
You can go to Jupiter or have
some people going to Jupiter

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:10.080 align:middle line:10%
on our behalf and discover
these amazing things.

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:13.630 align:middle line:10%
Spoiler alert, in both "Max
Goes to Mars" and "Max Goes

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:15.430 align:middle line:10%
to Jupiter," they find life.

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:18.370 align:middle line:10%
In "Max Goes to Mars,"
microscopic life on Mars.

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:20.660 align:middle line:10%
In "Max Goes to Jupiter,"
they discover life swimming

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:22.610 align:middle line:10%
in the ocean of the moon Europa.

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:26.460 align:middle line:84%
And kids can see that and
say, gosh, we really do need

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:28.670 align:middle line:84%
to work and get our
act together because I

00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:30.204 align:middle line:90%
want that future for me.

00:24:30.204 --> 00:24:31.620 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Have you
turned Max loose

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:34.770 align:middle line:10%
where he runs into
extraterrestrials?

00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:37.666 align:middle line:10%
>>BENNETT: Well, the
microbes on Mars,

00:24:37.666 --> 00:24:38.790 align:middle line:10%
they are extraterrestrials.

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:39.805 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yeah, I mean--

00:24:39.805 --> 00:24:40.410 align:middle line:10%
>>BENNETT: They're not--

00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:41.570 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You know what I
mean by "extraterrestrial."

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:42.970 align:middle line:10%
The big Grays with the big eyes.

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:45.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: I have
not had Max do that.

00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:48.925 align:middle line:84%
But of course, in my book
for grownups, "Beyond UFOs,"

00:24:48.925 --> 00:24:52.225 align:middle line:84%
I talk about what we
might do in that case,

00:24:52.225 --> 00:24:54.100 align:middle line:84%
and what the possibilities
for that might be.

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:57.230 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Do you think life
like us is teeming out

00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:59.270 align:middle line:10%
there in the universe somewhere?

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:01.020 align:middle line:10%
>>BENNETT: I would be
shocked if it's not.

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:03.180 align:middle line:10%
Because as we talked
about a little while ago,

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:05.960 align:middle line:10%
the ingredients are
there everywhere.

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:09.560 align:middle line:84%
The conditions, the Earth-like
planets, we now know

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:10.400 align:middle line:90%
are out there.

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:11.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Goldilocks zone.

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:12.558 align:middle line:10%
>>BENNETT: Right.

00:25:12.558 --> 00:25:14.460 align:middle line:10%
There's planets
all over the place.

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:17.620 align:middle line:10%
There's probably 100 billion
planets in our galaxy

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:19.800 align:middle line:10%
alone that have
Earth-like conditions.

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And so given that, it seems
to me life should have got

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.230 align:middle line:90%
started on them.

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:27.260 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be
evolution on them.

00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:30.430 align:middle line:10%
The same predator-prey
evolutionary relationships

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:32.910 align:middle line:10%
are going to occur everywhere.

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:34.597 align:middle line:10%
Why shouldn't there be?

00:25:34.597 --> 00:25:36.930 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Don't you think the
species, too, will probably

00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:39.190 align:middle line:10%
look the same, generally?

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:41.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: It's an
interesting question.

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:44.050 align:middle line:84%
Species certainly, we know
from evolution on Earth,

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:47.125 align:middle line:84%
there's a great diversity
of body types and so on.

00:25:47.125 --> 00:25:48.250 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: With similarities.

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:49.925 align:middle line:10%
Eyes, nose, ears, and mouth.

00:25:49.925 --> 00:25:50.550 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Yes.

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:52.540 align:middle line:90%
But there's a lot of difference.

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:55.939 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to
actually build stuff,

00:25:55.939 --> 00:25:56.980 align:middle line:90%
there's some limitations.

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:59.990 align:middle line:84%
Dolphins could perhaps
be as smart as us,

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:01.039 align:middle line:90%
but they have no hands.

00:26:01.039 --> 00:26:03.080 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: If they had
thumbs, I've always said it.

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.870 align:middle line:10%
>>BENNETT: They
can't build things.

00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:07.510 align:middle line:10%
And so it's very likely
that when you get

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:11.050 align:middle line:10%
to extraterrestrials who might
be communicating and travelling

00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:15.580 align:middle line:10%
in space, that they're going to
have some physical resemblance

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:16.080 align:middle line:10%
to us.

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:19.970 align:middle line:84%
Whether two hands and two
eyes is the common thing,

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:20.890 align:middle line:90%
we'll have to see.

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:22.280 align:middle line:90%
But it works.

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:23.090 align:middle line:90%
We know it works.

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:23.740 align:middle line:90%
So why not?

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:25.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that
brings up the question

00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:27.970 align:middle line:90%
of the great design.

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:30.930 align:middle line:84%
How incredible is
it, Jeffrey, that we

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:36.300 align:middle line:84%
were born with legs to
move, with arms to create,

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:39.350 align:middle line:84%
with a mouth to eat
and talk, with ears

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:44.020 align:middle line:84%
to hear, with a nose to
smell, with eyes to see.

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:45.980 align:middle line:84%
Who in the heck
would invent this?

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:47.680 align:middle line:10%
It's brilliant.

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:50.050 align:middle line:10%
>>BENNETT: Well, you
know, it is brilliant.

00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:53.170 align:middle line:84%
But it's also, when you look
at the evolutionary history

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:56.320 align:middle line:90%
of life on Earth, it works.

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.520 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the
evolutionary pressure

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:00.880 align:middle line:84%
is going to push
in that direction.

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:04.270 align:middle line:84%
So from my point of
view, this great design

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:06.670 align:middle line:84%
is exactly what you'd
expect if you give nature

00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:08.370 align:middle line:84%
4 and 1/2 billion
years to experiment.

00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:10.770 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It sounds
like nature has

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:14.640 align:middle line:10%
a brain to itself
to figure this out.

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: That's a
really good question.

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that's
one that we have no idea.

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And I actually tend to think--
I like the force in Star Trek.

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:24.885 align:middle line:90%
Maybe there's some--

00:27:24.885 --> 00:27:25.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something.

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:26.640 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Star Wars, excuse me.

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:28.160 align:middle line:90%
That somehow, it's all together.

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:33.140 align:middle line:84%
But certainly, even from a
purely biological viewpoint,

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:36.050 align:middle line:84%
life has its self
interest in survival.

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:39.470 align:middle line:10%
And evolving these things that
we have-- I mean, look at us.

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:42.260 align:middle line:10%
We've taken over
the planet with it.

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:44.710 align:middle line:84%
It's a great
evolutionary adaptation.

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:48.890 align:middle line:84%
So it seems perfectly natural
to me that all of these things

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:50.450 align:middle line:90%
came to pass.

00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:52.730 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: When will
we, or how will we,

00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:54.991 align:middle line:10%
make these discoveries?

00:27:54.991 --> 00:27:56.490 align:middle line:10%
>>BENNETT: We have
to keep studying.

00:27:56.490 --> 00:27:58.430 align:middle line:10%
And we have to keep pushing.

00:27:58.430 --> 00:27:59.740 align:middle line:90%
That's the only way you do it.

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:01.080 align:middle line:90%
You keep studying the science.

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And the thing about science is
that it's never, ever finished.

00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:06.610 align:middle line:84%
Every time you make
a new discovery,

00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:10.690 align:middle line:84%
as you probe through it, you
end up with a new question

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:12.360 align:middle line:90%
that it doesn't answer yet.

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:14.580 align:middle line:90%
So then you ask that question.

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:16.760 align:middle line:10%
And you make a discovery
that answers that one.

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:18.520 align:middle line:10%
And then you move
the next steps.

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:21.690 align:middle line:10%
There's lots of
history with this.

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:25.350 align:middle line:84%
Newton discovered the law of
gravity, led to questions.

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:28.164 align:middle line:84%
Einstein answered those,
led to more questions.

00:28:28.164 --> 00:28:30.330 align:middle line:10%
And we're still trying to
find the answers to those.

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:33.070 align:middle line:10%
The kids today,
they will, I think,

00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:34.880 align:middle line:10%
come up with the
answers to the mysteries

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.465 align:middle line:10%
that we're now discussing.

00:28:36.465 --> 00:28:37.090 align:middle line:90%
But that will--

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:39.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Computers have made
it easy, too, haven't they?

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:39.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Excuse me?

00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:40.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Computers
have made it easy.

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:41.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: Computers
make it easier

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:44.400 align:middle line:84%
to study things because you
can do the calculations so

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:44.980 align:middle line:90%
much faster.

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:48.320 align:middle line:84%
But the creativity part still
requires the human brain.

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:51.421 align:middle line:84%
We still need the kids to
get involved and come up

00:28:51.421 --> 00:28:52.920 align:middle line:84%
with the creative
thinking that will

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:55.850 align:middle line:84%
make it possible to
answer these questions.

00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:58.480 align:middle line:84%
Then we'll have new
questions, but we'll hopefully

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:01.871 align:middle line:84%
have answers to some of the
ones that we're discussing now.

00:29:01.871 --> 00:29:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jeffrey, if school
districts want your books,

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:07.345 align:middle line:84%
or if people individually
want them, where do they go?

00:29:07.345 --> 00:29:08.220 align:middle line:90%
How do they find you?

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:10.428 align:middle line:10%
>>BENNETT: They can, in
principle, buy them anywhere.

00:29:10.428 --> 00:29:14.630 align:middle line:10%
But first of all, go to the
storytimefromspace.com website,

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:16.640 align:middle line:10%
where you'll get
to see the videos.

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:19.825 align:middle line:10%
And then also go to my personal
website, jeffreybennett.com,

00:29:19.825 --> 00:29:22.390 align:middle line:10%
and you can click
to get direct links

00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:25.470 align:middle line:10%
to order the books from
Barnes & Noble or Amazon,

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:27.420 align:middle line:10%
or go to your local book shop.

00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:28.830 align:middle line:90%
And I hope you will.

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:31.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does Max
think about these books?

00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:34.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BENNETT: I think-- I
always show him the pictures,

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.200 align:middle line:90%
but he doesn't react too much.

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:39.640 align:middle line:84%
Max is a dog, and we're very
careful in these stories

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:43.400 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that he only
does what a real dog would do.

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.920 align:middle line:84%
It's the people around
him who go, wow, Max,

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:46.810 align:middle line:90%
you're so amazing.

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:48.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, is
Max controlling

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:50.584 align:middle line:84%
the ship when he gets
to these destinations?

00:29:50.584 --> 00:29:51.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Nope.

00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:53.130 align:middle line:84%
He's just-- in
fact, he's usually

00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:56.062 align:middle line:84%
misbehaving in some way,
but accidentally makes

00:29:56.062 --> 00:29:57.520 align:middle line:84%
a discovery that
they wouldn't have

00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:00.420 align:middle line:84%
made if he hadn't
been misbehaving.

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:03.190 align:middle line:84%
So all the antics that
Max does in the story

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:05.710 align:middle line:84%
are actually based on our real
dog and the things he does.

00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:08.234 align:middle line:84%
And then the artist puts on
the space suit and the space.

00:30:08.234 --> 00:30:09.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:10.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, continued success
to you, Jeffrey.

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:11.790 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Thank you very much.

00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:12.770 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate it.

00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:15.353 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: We're going to be back
on our next edition of "Beyond

00:30:15.353 --> 00:30:18.930 align:middle line:10%
Belief" as we talk more about
space with Jeffrey Bennett.

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:20.510 align:middle line:10%
So just stay in touch with us.

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:24.220 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:40.200 align:middle line:90%
