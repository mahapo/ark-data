>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.750 align:middle line:10%
We're going to do this
program with some hesitation,

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.700 align:middle line:10%
and I'll tell you
why in just a moment.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.330 align:middle line:84%
Robert Murch is the world's
foremost collector, historian,

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.330 align:middle line:84%
and expert on Ouija
and talking boards.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.840 align:middle line:84%
He serves as the chairman of
the board for the Talking Board

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.680 align:middle line:84%
Historical Society, which
he founded some time ago.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.990 align:middle line:90%
Robert, welcome to the program.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.990 align:middle line:10%
>>ROBERT MURCH: Thank you
so much for having me,

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.630 align:middle line:10%
and I appreciate you having
me even with hesitation.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:52.430 align:middle line:90%
Hopefully we'll--

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Hesitation because
I hate Ouija boards.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MURCH: I know.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But you like them.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.400 align:middle line:90%
>>MURCH: I love them.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
not afraid of them.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.942 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: I'm not afraid of them
even being this close to one.

00:01:01.942 --> 00:01:02.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My gosh.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.879 align:middle line:84%
Well, Murch, you
collect Ouija boards.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.855 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: I do, or
they collect me.

00:01:06.855 --> 00:01:07.655 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:01:07.655 --> 00:01:10.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How old is the
oldest board you have?

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.880 align:middle line:10%
>>MURCH: Ouija was named
and first manufactured

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.310 align:middle line:10%
in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1890.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.650 align:middle line:84%
But talking boards,
including the board

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.230 align:middle line:84%
that would become
Ouija, predate that.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.190 align:middle line:84%
So 1886, there's this
explosion of talking boards.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.150 align:middle line:84%
There's an article in the early
Associated Press takes that

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.000 align:middle line:84%
article, describes how
to make a talking board,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.280 align:middle line:84%
what it's used for--
talking to the dead--

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.960 align:middle line:90%
and tells everyone how to do it.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And it goes everywhere
all over the world.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.210 align:middle line:10%
And so talking boards
start to pick up steam,

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.720 align:middle line:10%
but they were close right out
of the spiritualist movement.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.300 align:middle line:10%
So right from 1848,
they were already

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.660 align:middle line:10%
using devices to help people
who maybe didn't have the gift.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was it serious, or
was it a game at the time?

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: In the
beginning, it was serious.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.230 align:middle line:90%
It was all about death.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.350 align:middle line:10%
And for me as a
historian, what I always--

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.270 align:middle line:10%
how I look through the
lens of the Ouija board

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.740 align:middle line:10%
is every decade how
are people seeing

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.840 align:middle line:10%
and what was their
relationship with death

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.650 align:middle line:10%
because today we are
so far away from death.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.910 align:middle line:90%
We look better.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:14.900 align:middle line:90%
We go to the gym.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.340 align:middle line:90%
We have better treatments.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.600 align:middle line:10%
We dye our hair.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.780 align:middle line:10%
We have plastic surgery.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.550 align:middle line:10%
All of these things keep
us farther away from death.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.700 align:middle line:10%
When talking boards or any
spirit communication devices

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.450 align:middle line:10%
came out in the 1800s, it was
because we were coming out

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.590 align:middle line:10%
of massive death.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.280 align:middle line:10%
The Civil War,
everyone lost someone.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.080 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yep.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.530 align:middle line:10%
>>MURCH: And so reaching
out to talk to the dead

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.710 align:middle line:10%
was an obvious thing
to do as opposed

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.422 align:middle line:10%
to nefarious or evil things.

00:02:41.422 --> 00:02:43.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they were into
those things, seances and stuff

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.858 align:middle line:90%
like that in a big way.

00:02:44.858 --> 00:02:46.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: We didn't
have the internet,

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.600 align:middle line:90%
and we didn't have Netflix.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.300 align:middle line:10%
And so late at night,
the entire family

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.220 align:middle line:10%
would gather around
one of these boards

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.050 align:middle line:10%
that they probably
made themselves.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Again until 1890, these were
just homemade things, things

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.000 align:middle line:84%
that you would
just make yourself.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.130 align:middle line:10%
And the very first boxes of the
official Ouija board from 1890

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.580 align:middle line:10%
would show an entire family
sitting around that table

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.480 align:middle line:10%
with a little kid holding a
teddy bear, everyone playing.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.620 align:middle line:84%
So this game was
meant for everyone,

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.220 align:middle line:84%
and that's because the
relationship with death

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.100 align:middle line:84%
was closer, more intimate
than it is today.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.105 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It wasn't as scary
as it comes across these days.

00:03:22.105 --> 00:03:23.480 align:middle line:84%
How did you get
involved with it?

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.210 align:middle line:10%
>>MURCH: Well, I
don't look like it,

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.040 align:middle line:10%
but I was raised Orthodox Jew.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.070 align:middle line:84%
When you're raised in
an orthodox religion,

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.250 align:middle line:90%
it's all real.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.860 align:middle line:10%
So your superstitions, your--

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.160 align:middle line:10%
and God, ghosts,
demons, all of that's

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.860 align:middle line:10%
baked into your very foundation.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.220 align:middle line:10%
So it's not as scary, especially
in the Jewish religion,

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.330 align:middle line:10%
because you can ask
rabbis and talk to them.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.820 align:middle line:84%
My grandmother was fantastic,
and she loved creature

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.200 align:middle line:90%
double feature.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.720 align:middle line:84%
She loved all of these things
that were not your typical way.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.520 align:middle line:90%
She snuck me into--

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.437 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For a granny.

00:03:58.437 --> 00:04:00.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: Yeah, for a
grandmother that was orthodox.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.402 align:middle line:84%
And my mother would say he can't
see or do this, this, or this.

00:04:04.402 --> 00:04:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And as she left the
house, my grandmother

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.902 align:middle line:84%
would say we're doing
this, this, and this.

00:04:07.902 --> 00:04:09.170 align:middle line:10%
Don't tell your mother.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.400 align:middle line:10%
And so she snuck me in 1986 to
a movie called "Witchboard."

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.630 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: "Witchboard"?

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.339 align:middle line:10%
>>MURCH: And when I
say she snuck me in,

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:18.019 align:middle line:10%
I mean she genuinely
snuck me in.

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.970 align:middle line:10%
She distracted
the person while--

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.845 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: She had you
covered up or something?

00:04:21.845 --> 00:04:23.810 align:middle line:10%
>>MURCH: Well, I snuck in.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.760 align:middle line:10%
And it's funny because
I was 13 years old

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.860 align:middle line:10%
and we probably just
could've paid the person.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.775 align:middle line:90%
But she snuck me in, and I was--

00:04:29.775 --> 00:04:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you
not allowed to go in?

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.537 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: It was rated R,
and I was just too young.

00:04:33.537 --> 00:04:35.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You weren't
allowed to go in.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.245 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: Yeah, I wasn't
allowed, but my grandmother

00:04:37.245 --> 00:04:38.940 align:middle line:84%
didn't, I guess, care
about those rules.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And so I went in,
and we watched.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.090 align:middle line:10%
And it was fascinating
to me that something

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.570 align:middle line:10%
that is made out of wood
or paper and cardboard

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:48.552 align:middle line:10%
would terrify someone.

00:04:48.552 --> 00:04:49.385 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:04:49.385 --> 00:04:52.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: And that is
what fascinated me.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.910 align:middle line:10%
And then fast
forward to 1992 when

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.550 align:middle line:10%
I first started collecting,
I went to the University

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:59.480 align:middle line:10%
of New Hampshire.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.260 align:middle line:90%
Great school.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.950 align:middle line:84%
I was in a quad, so I
had three roommates.

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:07.070 align:middle line:10%
And those roommates decided--

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.660 align:middle line:10%
[CLEARING THROAT]
excuse me-- they

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.960 align:middle line:90%
wanted to go into a fraternity.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that if I
went to a fraternity,

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.620 align:middle line:90%
it wouldn't end well for me.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.600 align:middle line:10%
Probably college wasn't
going to go anywhere.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.370 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It wasn't
your cup of tea.

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.350 align:middle line:10%
>>MURCH: It was
great to have friends

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.080 align:middle line:10%
to go to fraternity parties but
also to have a place to study.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.880 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.650 align:middle line:10%
>>MURCH: In their rushing
for the fraternity, they--

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.240 align:middle line:10%
it was on a list
of a treasure hunt

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.220 align:middle line:10%
that they needed to
find Ouija boards.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.600 align:middle line:10%
Just an old Ouija board.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.440 align:middle line:10%
Coming from Boston where I lived
most of my life, New Englander,

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.020 align:middle line:10%
every weekend, you
would go to yard sales

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.230 align:middle line:10%
and you go to flea
markets and antiquing.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.700 align:middle line:10%
I knew I'd seen
them, very cheap.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.920 align:middle line:10%
So I picked a bunch up,
and when I was done,

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.340 align:middle line:10%
they gave them all back
to me and there were 10.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.020 align:middle line:90%
And they were all different.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And I thought to myself isn't
there only one Ouija board?

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:56.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: So hopefully
many of your viewers

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:00.370 align:middle line:90%
will remember this.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.130 align:middle line:84%
I had to actually go to a
physical place, a library,

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:07.120 align:middle line:84%
which was basically
Wikipedia only in a place.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.940 align:middle line:10%
And every encyclopedia
I looked into

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.580 align:middle line:10%
said the Ouija board came
from a different place.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And I thought how can everyone
I talk to know what it is.

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.520 align:middle line:10%
Most people have played
it or have a story right,

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.500 align:middle line:10%
but we don't know
where it comes from.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.290 align:middle line:10%
And that moment in 1992 in
a library in the University

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:29.620 align:middle line:10%
of New Hampshire set me off
into a worldwide journey

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.460 align:middle line:10%
of searching for who are the
people behind the Ouija board.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.080 align:middle line:90%
What were they thinking?

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.075 align:middle line:90%
Why did they create this?

00:06:37.075 --> 00:06:38.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What moves
the planchette?

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:39.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MURCH: The whole thing.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:40.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All that stuff.

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:41.552 align:middle line:90%
>>MURCH: The whole thing.

00:06:41.552 --> 00:06:43.120 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know
everything about it,

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.328 align:middle line:90%
and I'm still learning today.

00:06:44.328 --> 00:06:46.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'll tell
you my story of why I

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.880 align:middle line:90%
turned against the Ouija board.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.870 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning, I thought it
was, hey, a fun little game,

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.480 align:middle line:84%
couple people put their
fingertips on a planchette.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.740 align:middle line:90%
It moves around.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.080 align:middle line:84%
They're probably
moving it I would say,

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.550 align:middle line:90%
and you do your thing.

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:04.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, one day I brought it into
my radio studio in St. Louis.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.970 align:middle line:84%
I was doing the
Nighthawk Radio Show,

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:10.420 align:middle line:84%
and I had a Ouija
board in the studio.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:14.410 align:middle line:84%
My producer was in his little
booth, and I'm doing my show.

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:18.930 align:middle line:10%
All of a sudden,
Murch, the board--

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:23.200 align:middle line:10%
the audio board for the radio
council starts going haywire.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.020 align:middle line:90%
It never went haywire.

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.760 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to go to a commercial,
which was on a computer, just

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.100 align:middle line:90%
so I could regroup myself.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:33.780 align:middle line:90%
It wouldn't play.

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:34.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm dying.

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:38.340 align:middle line:84%
So I go to the phones to
answer callers who are calling

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:40.350 align:middle line:90%
going get rid of that thing.

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:42.120 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't get them on the air.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.080 align:middle line:10%
Nothing would work.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.270 align:middle line:90%
So I gave--

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:46.918 align:middle line:84%
Howard was my
producer at the time,

00:07:46.918 --> 00:07:48.210 align:middle line:90%
and I gave him the Ouija board.

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:50.160 align:middle line:90%
And I said Howard-- on the air--

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.920 align:middle line:84%
get rid of this thing,
and he said, OK.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.570 align:middle line:84%
So he takes it out, and
the first thing he does

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:01.407 align:middle line:84%
is he gives it to one of
our news guys named Darryl.

00:08:01.407 --> 00:08:02.490 align:middle line:90%
Gives it to him as a gift.

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:03.290 align:middle line:90%
He said take this.

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:04.260 align:middle line:90%
George doesn't want it.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:05.680 align:middle line:90%
Oh, OK, yeah, I'll take it.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.480 align:middle line:90%
It's in a box.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.390 align:middle line:90%
It's got all this.

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:08.730 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:11.910 align:middle line:90%
Darryl gets fired the next day.

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:13.290 align:middle line:90%
We don't see him after that.

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:14.310 align:middle line:90%
He's gone.

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:18.970 align:middle line:84%
I run into him two months later
at about a little nightclub.

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:20.880 align:middle line:90%
Said, Darryl, how you doing?

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.320 align:middle line:90%
Rotten.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.130 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong?

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:25.230 align:middle line:90%
He said you want to know.

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:26.700 align:middle line:90%
I said, yeah, what's wrong.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:30.570 align:middle line:84%
He said ever since Howard
gave me that Ouija board,

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:33.030 align:middle line:90%
my life has gone downhill.

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:36.240 align:middle line:84%
I lost my job as you
well know, but I also

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.600 align:middle line:90%
lost my relationship.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.669 align:middle line:84%
My parents, one of
them got very sick.

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:44.070 align:middle line:84%
Everything negative
has happened to me.

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:45.270 align:middle line:90%
I finally got rid of it.

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:48.780 align:middle line:84%
I burned it, and things are
getting a little better for me.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:51.150 align:middle line:84%
I heard that story and
said you know what.

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:53.100 align:middle line:84%
There's something
evil about this thing.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.790 align:middle line:90%
Now you don't agree with me.

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:57.000 align:middle line:84%
Karen Dahlman, who's
into Ouija boards,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.405 align:middle line:90%
she won't agree with me.

00:08:58.405 --> 00:09:00.030 align:middle line:84%
But there's something
about this thing.

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:01.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MURCH: You know there is.

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:03.390 align:middle line:10%
And what's unique about it is--

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:05.940 align:middle line:10%
so we talked about
talking boards originally

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.790 align:middle line:10%
in the 1800s were meant
to talk to the dead.

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:11.010 align:middle line:10%
That's what they
were supposed to do.

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:14.490 align:middle line:10%
And Ouija itself
that Hasbro owns

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.192 align:middle line:10%
the trademark and the
rights to it today

00:09:16.192 --> 00:09:17.400 align:middle line:10%
and they continue to make it.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Used to
be Parker Brothers.

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: They bought
Parker Brothers in 1991.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:24.180 align:middle line:10%
And Parker Brothers
bought it in 1966

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:27.930 align:middle line:10%
from the William Fuld family who
made it from under their name

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:29.280 align:middle line:10%
1901 to 1966.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They manufacture them?

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:31.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MURCH: Yep.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:36.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: And Ouija itself, the
originators of the Ouija board,

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:41.820 align:middle line:84%
who create this board, they come
up with a different solution.

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.220 align:middle line:10%
They see other talking boards
that people are making,

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:50.010 align:middle line:10%
and they decide those
people are telling

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:51.780 align:middle line:10%
their customers
or the people who

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:53.970 align:middle line:10%
are making them why it works.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:56.837 align:middle line:10%
Well, that means you have to
believe to want to use it.

00:09:56.837 --> 00:09:57.637 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:09:57.637 --> 00:10:00.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: They wanted to
make a million dollars.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.960 align:middle line:10%
So the Ouija board is actually
capitalism and spiritualism

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.490 align:middle line:10%
meeting head on.

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:07.800 align:middle line:10%
And what happens is
they decide let's put it

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.100 align:middle line:10%
in every room and every
parlor in America instead

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.200 align:middle line:10%
of just the spiritualists
because that's

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.278 align:middle line:10%
a small group of people.

00:10:14.278 --> 00:10:15.570 align:middle line:10%
We wanted to put it everywhere.

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:17.220 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: We and
everyone to have this.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.680 align:middle line:10%
>>MURCH: And so they
immediately put on their boxes

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.070 align:middle line:10%
we don't claim to know how
or why the Ouija board works,

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:25.770 align:middle line:10%
but with your patience, it
will exceed your greatest

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:27.090 align:middle line:10%
expectations.

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:29.910 align:middle line:10%
So by allowing it to be
what you want it to be,

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:32.160 align:middle line:10%
a fortune teller,
parting the veil

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.180 align:middle line:10%
and talking to the dead,
some psychic device, whatever

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:39.840 align:middle line:10%
you decide, whether you
call it Ouija tell me this

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.780 align:middle line:10%
or whether you just say,
Granny, are you there,

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.520 align:middle line:10%
you're in charge.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.050 align:middle line:10%
What's really unique
is in all the--

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:49.882 align:middle line:10%
in the years of me investigating
this, I lived close in Boston

00:10:49.882 --> 00:10:51.840 align:middle line:10%
to Ed and Lorraine Warren
being in Connecticut.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, absolutely.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:53.760 align:middle line:90%
They were the best.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.380 align:middle line:10%
>>MURCH: And they
would call me trying

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:59.670 align:middle line:10%
to impress upon me how
dangerous I was living with all

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:00.880 align:middle line:10%
these Ouija boards around me.

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:01.680 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.557 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Take heed.

00:11:02.557 --> 00:11:03.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MURCH: Yes, I did.

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:03.870 align:middle line:90%
I listened.

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:04.670 align:middle line:90%
I listened.

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:06.390 align:middle line:10%
But it didn't stop
me, but I did--

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:10.530 align:middle line:10%
I kept them in the basement,
so I guess that was good.

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:12.330 align:middle line:10%
All over the walls.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:16.350 align:middle line:10%
But the-- years later, I
had a wonderful conversation

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:19.920 align:middle line:10%
with Lorraine and it was
about a long, long interview.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.750 align:middle line:10%
And we came to-- and
something I didn't

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:26.310 align:middle line:10%
think we'd agree on which was
the behind the Ouija board.

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:29.040 align:middle line:10%
And she said I think
all of these things

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.255 align:middle line:10%
are equally dangerous because
I was asking her, well,

00:11:31.255 --> 00:11:32.130 align:middle line:10%
what about the tarot.

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:33.463 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I would agree with her.

00:11:33.463 --> 00:11:36.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: And she said
because the act of conjuring

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.280 align:middle line:84%
is what's happening--
the board doesn't have

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.960 align:middle line:90%
any power you don't give to it.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.850 align:middle line:84%
You're calling something
you don't know.

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:43.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
pulling something in.

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:45.598 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: And you don't know,
and you don't know what to do.

00:11:45.598 --> 00:11:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And so-- and I said if
there's danger, I agree.

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.062 align:middle line:10%
That's what you're-- it's
like getting on the train

00:11:51.062 --> 00:11:52.770 align:middle line:10%
and talking to the
first person you meet.

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:54.420 align:middle line:10%
You might be talking
to a serial killer.

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:55.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You might be.

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: Or you might be
talking to the nicest person

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.350 align:middle line:84%
in the world, the
next Mother Teresa.

00:11:58.350 --> 00:11:59.150 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:00.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Doubtful.

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:02.760 align:middle line:10%
>>MURCH: In this world today--

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.940 align:middle line:10%
but what's neat
is the Ouija board

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:10.290 align:middle line:10%
has power that other spirit
communication devices that we

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:14.040 align:middle line:10%
use today don't have like a
K2 meter or an EVP recorder,

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.660 align:middle line:10%
and I'll just give
you an example

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.690 align:middle line:10%
of why I think that is--

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:20.610 align:middle line:10%
and why it's a little dangerous.

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:22.440 align:middle line:10%
The Ouija board does nothing.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.740 align:middle line:10%
It's the telephone we happen to
be using to talk to whatever,

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:30.450 align:middle line:10%
and there's nothing special or
magic about paper and cardboard

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:31.990 align:middle line:10%
or wood and plastic.

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:32.790 align:middle line:10%
There just isn't.

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:33.900 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's the individual.

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:34.700 align:middle line:10%
>>MURCH: Right.

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:36.600 align:middle line:10%
Because we believe--

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.360 align:middle line:10%
9/10 of our reality
is our beliefs.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.930 align:middle line:10%
We carry this with us.

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:42.810 align:middle line:10%
And if we believe--

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:46.710 align:middle line:10%
like you were just telling
that story about your friend

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:49.170 align:middle line:10%
that he believed by
getting it out of the house

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:50.550 align:middle line:10%
his luck would change.

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:53.880 align:middle line:10%
He has given power over
himself to the Ouija board

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:56.550 align:middle line:10%
by saying it's the Ouija board.

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:59.580 align:middle line:10%
If you and I were using the
Ouija board and something bad

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:02.390 align:middle line:10%
happened, you would want
it gone like you mentioned.

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:03.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like I do now.

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:04.140 align:middle line:90%
>>MURCH: Right, exactly.

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:05.557 align:middle line:84%
Already you want
edging backwards.

00:13:05.557 --> 00:13:07.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's looking at me.

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:10.380 align:middle line:10%
>>MURCH: And-- but if
we were on the phone

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.090 align:middle line:10%
and we got into a
fight, an argument,

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:14.673 align:middle line:10%
called each other names and said
terrible things to each other

00:13:14.673 --> 00:13:16.860 align:middle line:10%
and hung it up, you wouldn't
throw out the iPhone

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.860 align:middle line:10%
and say I'll never have another
one of these in my house

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:21.150 align:middle line:10%
because it doesn't make sense.

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:24.550 align:middle line:10%
The fight was between us, and
we were doing the bad stuff.

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:27.390 align:middle line:10%
The phone-- the iPhone
was just what we're using,

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:31.380 align:middle line:10%
it's the same thing with a Ouija
board except because we believe

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:34.440 align:middle line:10%
the Ouija board has power, get
the Ouija board out of here.

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.800 align:middle line:10%
Make sure you sign off
don't leave the planchette.

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.540 align:middle line:10%
There are all these
Ouija-stitions,

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:41.640 align:middle line:10%
these urban legends
that have grown out.

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.400 align:middle line:10%
And every time one
of those is born,

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.740 align:middle line:10%
the Ouija board gains a little
bit more power over you.

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:49.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Murch, paranormal
investigator Jim Harold,

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:51.750 align:middle line:84%
talked to me about how
some of these spirits

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:53.490 align:middle line:90%
come through the Ouija board.

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:55.320 align:middle line:90%
Ouija boards.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.305 align:middle line:10%
I stay away from them.

00:13:56.305 --> 00:13:57.180 align:middle line:10%
>>JIM HAROLD: I know.

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:59.550 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I had some
bad episodes with them.

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:01.350 align:middle line:10%
There's something about them.

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:03.915 align:middle line:10%
You've looked at them through
your paranormal podcasts.

00:14:03.915 --> 00:14:05.370 align:middle line:10%
>>HAROLD: I'm with you.

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:07.945 align:middle line:10%
Now I know there are people
like Karen Dahlman and Rosemary

00:14:07.945 --> 00:14:08.745 align:middle line:10%
Ellen--

00:14:08.745 --> 00:14:09.630 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Karen loves them.

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:11.297 align:middle line:10%
>>HAROLD: Rosemary
Ellen Guiley tells me

00:14:11.297 --> 00:14:12.630 align:middle line:10%
that they're just a tool.

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:14.070 align:middle line:10%
And I love Rosemary.

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:17.010 align:middle line:10%
She's fantastic as you know
having worked with her.

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:22.060 align:middle line:10%
But the thing is is that to
me it's like an instrument.

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:23.830 align:middle line:10%
It's like a chainsaw.

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:27.600 align:middle line:10%
Now there are people very
skilled with a chainsaw who

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.008 align:middle line:10%
can make beautiful carvings.

00:14:29.008 --> 00:14:30.883 align:middle line:10%
We see people make
carvings out of chainsaws.

00:14:30.883 --> 00:14:32.190 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I wouldn't want
to be next to somebody

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:32.880 align:middle line:10%
with a chainsaw.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.463 align:middle line:10%
>>HAROLD: But you
wouldn't want to put

00:14:34.463 --> 00:14:35.685 align:middle line:10%
that chainsaw in my hand.

00:14:35.685 --> 00:14:37.560 align:middle line:10%
And that's the way I
feel about Ouija boards.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:41.400 align:middle line:10%
I think many times that they're
put in the hands of people

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:45.300 align:middle line:10%
are just playing a game, and the
thing is that one of my callers

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:49.380 align:middle line:10%
I thought they had
a great description.

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.600 align:middle line:10%
It's like--
spiritually speaking,

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:55.020 align:middle line:10%
it's like wearing your best
clothes, your finest jewelry,

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:59.250 align:middle line:10%
all decked out walking in the
worst possible part of town

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:01.890 align:middle line:10%
at 3:30 AM in the
morning down the street

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:04.240 align:middle line:10%
waiting for something
to spiritually mug you.

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.040 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.560 align:middle line:10%
>>HAROLD: That's what I think
because I think a lot of times

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:11.640 align:middle line:10%
when people have let's say
Aunt Millie contact them,

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.827 align:middle line:10%
I think they could very well be
an imposter spirit, something

00:15:14.827 --> 00:15:16.410 align:middle line:10%
that's latched on
and said we're going

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:17.580 align:middle line:10%
to have a little bit of fun.

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:18.510 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It could be.

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:19.560 align:middle line:10%
Or they want something.

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:19.880 align:middle line:10%
>>HAROLD: Yeah.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:20.680 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:21.550 align:middle line:10%
I'm not an expert.

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:23.050 align:middle line:10%
I just asked the
questions, and I've

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:26.280 align:middle line:10%
learned via the people who
I've spoken to over the years

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:29.010 align:middle line:10%
but I believe that
it's very dangerous

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:30.090 align:middle line:10%
to treat it as a game.

00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:31.500 align:middle line:10%
And just last week
I had a caller

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:35.300 align:middle line:10%
who said I had a great
experience with a Ouija board.

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.190 align:middle line:10%
We had the spirit
and we would talk

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:40.700 align:middle line:10%
and it was a very
nice relationship.

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:42.758 align:middle line:10%
But he's got more
guts than I do.

00:15:42.758 --> 00:15:43.800 align:middle line:10%
I'll give you an example.

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.470 align:middle line:10%
I have a young lady
who had a Ouija board.

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:49.220 align:middle line:10%
I believe it was one
of the Carolinas.

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:52.610 align:middle line:10%
And she was there with a friend.

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:54.592 align:middle line:10%
Teenagers, they had
candles lit and so forth,

00:15:54.592 --> 00:15:56.300 align:middle line:10%
and they had more of
those old lava lamps

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:57.040 align:middle line:10%
if you remember those.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:57.420 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I've seen those.

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:58.640 align:middle line:10%
>>HAROLD: Yes.

00:15:58.640 --> 00:15:59.550 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, exactly.

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:01.880 align:middle line:10%
So anyway they said,
well, if you're real,

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:03.800 align:middle line:10%
you'll show us the sign.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.900 align:middle line:10%
So they looked over
at the lava lamp,

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:09.590 align:middle line:10%
and the gloopy stuff
started to formulate

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:12.230 align:middle line:10%
and formulate and formulate, and
it looked like a face, a face.

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:13.760 align:middle line:10%
What kind of face would that be?

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:14.597 align:middle line:10%
Then she said--

00:16:14.597 --> 00:16:15.680 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: In the lava lamp?

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:16.805 align:middle line:10%
>>HAROLD: In the lava lamp.

00:16:16.805 --> 00:16:21.710 align:middle line:10%
It formed into the face
of a snarling devil face.

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:23.210 align:middle line:10%
It snarled at them.

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:26.120 align:middle line:10%
Then they shut the
board, and the gloop

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:29.630 align:middle line:10%
went back those little
gloopy like normal.

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:32.030 align:middle line:84%
Now anything that can
do that, George, I'm

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:33.365 align:middle line:90%
going to stay away from.

00:16:33.365 --> 00:16:35.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So Jim is
basically saying,

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:39.540 align:middle line:84%
Murch, what you are that it's
not necessarily the board.

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:42.230 align:middle line:84%
It's the person
touching the board.

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:43.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MURCH: It's the intention.

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:45.330 align:middle line:90%
It's what you bring with it.

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:47.150 align:middle line:10%
For instance, we
did a Ouija Con.

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.400 align:middle line:10%
We celebrated the
125th anniversary

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:50.515 align:middle line:10%
of the naming of Ouija.

00:16:50.515 --> 00:16:51.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ahh, I
bet that was fun.

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:52.807 align:middle line:90%
>>MURCH: It was great.

00:16:52.807 --> 00:16:54.740 align:middle line:90%
It was in Baltimore.

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:56.553 align:middle line:10%
It was really a
unique experience

00:16:56.553 --> 00:16:58.470 align:middle line:10%
because people came from
all over in the city.

00:16:58.470 --> 00:16:59.428 align:middle line:10%
The mayor was involved.

00:16:59.428 --> 00:17:01.000 align:middle line:10%
She issued a proclamation.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.500 align:middle line:10%
We tend to do these things with
the Talking Board Historical

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.650 align:middle line:10%
Society, and we put in a
plaque in the building that

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:09.349 align:middle line:10%
still stands that you can go
visit where the Ouija board got

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:10.470 align:middle line:10%
its name.

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:13.790 align:middle line:10%
And we had these people
come up to us, these girls,

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:16.265 align:middle line:10%
and they were screaming one
night during the convention.

00:17:16.265 --> 00:17:17.790 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Like the
Beatles were here.

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:18.290 align:middle line:10%
>>MURCH: Exactly.

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:20.832 align:middle line:10%
And they were saying we've used
the Ouija board and something

00:17:20.832 --> 00:17:21.632 align:middle line:10%
terrible happened.

00:17:21.632 --> 00:17:22.619 align:middle line:10%
And it's three of them.

00:17:22.619 --> 00:17:25.069 align:middle line:10%
They couldn't calm down,
and we were like calm down.

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:27.290 align:middle line:10%
Tell me what happened.

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:31.580 align:middle line:10%
So we're using the Ouija board,
and it told us how and when

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:32.522 align:middle line:10%
we were going to die.

00:17:32.522 --> 00:17:33.980 align:middle line:10%
And they all start
screaming again.

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:35.640 align:middle line:10%
And I said, OK, OK, calm down.

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:37.730 align:middle line:10%
That's very specific.

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:41.910 align:middle line:10%
What were you asking the Ouija
board when it told you that?

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:44.360 align:middle line:10%
And they said, well, we
asked how and when we

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.670 align:middle line:10%
were going to die
to which a lot of us

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:48.380 align:middle line:10%
started snickering a little bit.

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:52.790 align:middle line:10%
And the beware there is
don't ask the Ouija board

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:55.220 align:middle line:10%
things you don't want to hear.

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:57.680 align:middle line:10%
It's like if you
believe this works,

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.390 align:middle line:10%
ask for the lottery numbers.

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:00.830 align:middle line:90%
I want to be a millionaire.

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:03.770 align:middle line:10%
I wouldn't ask how I was
going to die because then I

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:06.350 align:middle line:10%
would be worried about, oh,
if the Ouija board told me

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:09.470 align:middle line:10%
I was going to die in a red
car, even if I think it's crap

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:12.008 align:middle line:10%
and it's not true, somehow
in the back of my head--

00:18:12.008 --> 00:18:12.572 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You're
gonna think about it.

00:18:12.572 --> 00:18:13.850 align:middle line:10%
>>MURCH: Exactly.

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:15.927 align:middle line:84%
Why plant a seed that
I don't need to do so--

00:18:15.927 --> 00:18:18.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you have a friend
pick you up in a red car.

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.990 align:middle line:84%
You're gonna go I don't know
if I'm going to go into this.

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:22.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: If after
this interview there's

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:23.810 align:middle line:84%
a red car waiting for
me, I'm not getting in.

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:24.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:26.277 align:middle line:84%
I've got you a red
limo waiting for you.

00:18:26.277 --> 00:18:27.077 align:middle line:90%
>>MURCH: Perfect.

00:18:27.077 --> 00:18:29.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You talked about
Karen Dahlman, Ms. Ouija Board.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MURCH: Yes.

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jim Harold talked
about Karen Dahlman as well.

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:34.040 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at Karen Dahlman.

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:34.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MURCH: Great.

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:36.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How old
is the Ouija board?

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:37.730 align:middle line:10%
How did it first start?

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:38.940 align:middle line:10%
Who developed it?

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.107 align:middle line:10%
>>KAREN DAHLMAN: Well, those
are some good questions

00:18:41.107 --> 00:18:43.400 align:middle line:10%
because the Ouija board
as we know it, the Ouija--

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.470 align:middle line:10%
it's actually pronounced
Ouija, not weegee--

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:48.220 align:middle line:10%
is from 1891.

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:50.150 align:middle line:10%
In 1890, they filed
a patent on it,

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:52.790 align:middle line:10%
and 1891 is when the patent was
granted by the United States

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:53.960 align:middle line:10%
Patent Office.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:55.400 align:middle line:10%
And it started being made.

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:59.570 align:middle line:10%
Now there were spirit boards
and maybe other kinds of devices

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:02.570 align:middle line:10%
they use that -- alphabet cards
they used as one or a board

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:04.190 align:middle line:10%
they had the letters
on or numbers.

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:07.100 align:middle line:10%
And people would point to it
or use other kinds of devices,

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:10.640 align:middle line:10%
and that's about mid-1800s
when the spiritualist movement

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.170 align:middle line:10%
came about the United States.

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:15.560 align:middle line:10%
People were wanting a way to
communicate with their loved

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:17.040 align:middle line:10%
ones that were beyond.

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:20.040 align:middle line:10%
So when this board
came out, this item,

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:22.790 align:middle line:10%
which is very unique because
they took a planchette, which

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:24.920 align:middle line:10%
is this item right
here, which they usually

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:27.050 align:middle line:10%
used with their hand
on it and a pencil

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:29.960 align:middle line:10%
was an aperture for a pencil
and had to castor wheels

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.850 align:middle line:10%
and would roll around
and they would write.

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:35.480 align:middle line:10%
They'd write these phenomenal
messages from the beyond.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:39.200 align:middle line:10%
And what happened was they took
this, retrofitted if you will,

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.460 align:middle line:10%
took off the pencil and it
ended up with three legs--

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:43.460 align:middle line:10%
they could be wooden, or
they could be casters--

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:45.650 align:middle line:10%
and they put it-- they
call it the little table--

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:47.660 align:middle line:10%
and they put it
on top of a board.

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.297 align:middle line:10%
And this here is the
1902 board, circa 1902--

00:19:50.297 --> 00:19:51.380 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: God, this is old.

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:52.965 align:middle line:10%
I'm not sure I want to hold it.

00:19:52.965 --> 00:19:53.284 align:middle line:10%
>>DAHLMAN: You touched it.

00:19:53.284 --> 00:19:54.080 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I don't
want to hold it.

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:54.950 align:middle line:10%
Bad luck.

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:57.590 align:middle line:10%
>>DAHLMAN: No, goodness, it's
really good luck actually.

00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:59.400 align:middle line:10%
So this would go on
top of it like this,

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.442 align:middle line:10%
and it would roll around.

00:20:00.442 --> 00:20:02.550 align:middle line:10%
So they got rid of the
pencil, the writing,

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:03.703 align:middle line:10%
which was awfully--

00:20:03.703 --> 00:20:05.120 align:middle line:10%
most of the time,
it became really

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.010 align:middle line:10%
illegible and
scribbly where this

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:10.580 align:middle line:10%
became a more concise, exact
way, quick way, of being

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:12.605 align:middle line:10%
in contact with the beyond.

00:20:12.605 --> 00:20:14.075 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She loves those things.

00:20:14.075 --> 00:20:14.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MURCH: It's great.

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:15.980 align:middle line:90%
I love seeing Karen.

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:17.660 align:middle line:84%
She's a wonderful
person, and, yeah,

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:19.285 align:middle line:84%
that's why her and
I get along so well.

00:20:19.285 --> 00:20:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And she's a member of the
Talking Board Historical

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.373 align:middle line:90%
Society, a nonprofit.

00:20:22.373 --> 00:20:24.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which we'll
talk about in the second.

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:27.840 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever had a bad
Ouija board experience?

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:33.040 align:middle line:10%
>>MURCH: The worst
experience I've ever had--

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.980 align:middle line:10%
and let's explain what is
a bad experience first.

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:36.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah.

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:38.085 align:middle line:90%
>>MURCH: So those girls--

00:20:38.085 --> 00:20:38.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You tell me.

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: Those girls
had a bad experience

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:43.713 align:middle line:84%
because they asked a
question that scared them.

00:20:43.713 --> 00:20:45.880 align:middle line:10%
So they were afraid of dying
and how they would die,

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:46.695 align:middle line:10%
and they asked that question.

00:20:46.695 --> 00:20:48.153 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
got a bad answer.

00:20:48.153 --> 00:20:50.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: And to them that
was a bad experience.

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:53.350 align:middle line:10%
What I get to do working
for TV shows and movies

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:56.110 align:middle line:10%
and consulting in
different shows that

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:57.880 align:middle line:10%
want to show the Ouija
board a certain way

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.830 align:middle line:10%
is what's really scary.

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:04.030 align:middle line:10%
It's not super scary to play
the Ouija board unless you

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:06.940 align:middle line:10%
hear a sound or the lights go
out or something really strange

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:07.080 align:middle line:10%
happens--

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.130 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Or the radio
studio gets screwed up.

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:11.080 align:middle line:90%
>>MURCH: Or like-- right.

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:13.867 align:middle line:84%
Your whole radio studio
goes on the blink.

00:21:13.867 --> 00:21:14.950 align:middle line:90%
That's what scares people.

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:17.980 align:middle line:84%
But most of the time,
it's what happens after.

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.800 align:middle line:10%
And this is where we give even
more power to the Ouija board.

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:24.910 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, our brains are wired
to make sense of the nonsense.

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:28.210 align:middle line:84%
It's like looking up at
the sky and seeing clouds.

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:31.247 align:middle line:10%
There is no face in the clouds
even if we recognize one.

00:21:31.247 --> 00:21:32.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But we see faces.

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:33.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MURCH: We see it.

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And so we're trying to
make sense of nonsense.

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:38.860 align:middle line:84%
So we go home after you play the
Ouija board and maybe something

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:39.790 align:middle line:90%
spooked you.

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:42.573 align:middle line:10%
Suddenly, you're hearing
things you never heard before,

00:21:42.573 --> 00:21:44.740 align:middle line:10%
and you're seeing shadows
you've never heard before.

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:47.500 align:middle line:84%
It's possible all of
those things were there,

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:50.470 align:middle line:84%
but using the Ouija board
has now given the chance

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:52.180 align:middle line:90%
to weave a story.

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:53.620 align:middle line:10%
And it doesn't
mean that the Ouija

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:56.650 align:middle line:10%
board can't be used
to part the veil

00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:59.410 align:middle line:10%
or talk to your subconscious.

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:01.570 align:middle line:10%
This debate's been going
on since the beginning.

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:05.890 align:middle line:10%
Faraday himself did
experiments to prove

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:12.015 align:middle line:10%
whether doing a table talking
or table turning would work.

00:22:12.015 --> 00:22:14.140 align:middle line:84%
People were coming to him
as this modern scientist,

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:15.670 align:middle line:84%
and they were saying, hey,
I'm talking to spirits

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:16.870 align:middle line:90%
by using this table.

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And he was creating experiments
way back in the 1880s.

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.173 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How does the
board work, Murch?

00:22:22.173 --> 00:22:24.340 align:middle line:10%
>>MURCH: Depends on the
person or who you're asking.

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:26.455 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You need
two people at least?

00:22:26.455 --> 00:22:29.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: The makers would
say you need two people

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:31.000 align:middle line:90%
because it was a date game.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.025 align:middle line:84%
So let's look back
in Victorian times.

00:22:33.025 --> 00:22:35.650 align:middle line:84%
You're not supposed to be alone
with a woman you're not married

00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:36.980 align:middle line:90%
to or not related to.

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:38.980 align:middle line:10%
You're certainly not
supposed to be in the dark,

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:40.605 align:middle line:10%
and you're not supposed
to be touching.

00:22:40.605 --> 00:22:43.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, the manufacturer--
manufacturers

00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:46.540 align:middle line:84%
of the Ouija board realized
something really quickly.

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:50.200 align:middle line:10%
If you took this board and put
it on the knees of two people,

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:54.190 align:middle line:10%
opposite sex preferred,
and suddenly their knees

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:57.845 align:middle line:10%
are touching, their fingers
are touching, they've got--

00:22:57.845 --> 00:22:58.645 align:middle line:10%
this is--

00:22:58.645 --> 00:22:59.750 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's a dating game.

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:00.940 align:middle line:10%
>>MURCH: It's a
date game for a guy.

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:03.370 align:middle line:10%
Every guy is willing to play
the Ouija board because--

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:07.180 align:middle line:10%
and the woman is
looking to make contact.

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:10.180 align:middle line:10%
Spiritualism was more
popular with women than men,

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:11.770 align:middle line:10%
not always, but it
was at the time.

00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:14.500 align:middle line:10%
And just look at
like Norman Rockwell

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:19.225 align:middle line:10%
painted a cover in 1920 of
the "Saturday Evening Post"

00:23:19.225 --> 00:23:21.100 align:middle line:10%
of a man and a woman
playing the Ouija board.

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:24.680 align:middle line:10%
And if you look at that picture,
she is looking up to the ethers

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:25.480 align:middle line:10%
asking a question.

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:26.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's looking at her.

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:28.317 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: He's looking
at her right here.

00:23:28.317 --> 00:23:29.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:32.020 align:middle line:90%
Who's moving the planchette?

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:33.280 align:middle line:90%
What's moving the planchette?

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:36.790 align:middle line:10%
>>MURCH: Scientists very early
on would say it was something

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:39.430 align:middle line:10%
called ideomotor response,
and that's the marrying

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:41.310 align:middle line:10%
of the small movements
in your hands and--

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:42.310 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Subconsciously?

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:44.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MURCH: Your subconscious.

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:46.330 align:middle line:10%
Because your hands
were made of muscles

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:49.240 align:middle line:10%
and we don't like to stay
still and they want to move

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:51.910 align:middle line:10%
and because we want
the board to work,

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:55.090 align:middle line:10%
we put our hands on and ask a
question and unbeknownst to us,

00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:57.340 align:middle line:10%
scientists believe,
your subconscious,

00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:58.570 align:middle line:10%
you are pushing it.

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:00.020 align:middle line:10%
You just don't know it.

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And it might be the other
person whose subconscious

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.210 align:middle line:90%
is stronger than you.

00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:06.880 align:middle line:10%
Spiritualists or people
in the paranormal today

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:10.280 align:middle line:10%
believe you're talking to
something other than yourself.

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.233 align:middle line:10%
So it's not your subconscious.

00:24:12.233 --> 00:24:13.900 align:middle line:10%
Maybe it's something
that's passed over.

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:15.680 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's something that's
never been here before.

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.305 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it
always move, Murch?

00:24:17.305 --> 00:24:20.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: I've always had an
easy time getting it to work.

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:20.140 align:middle line:90%
Other people--

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:20.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You have?

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:21.060 align:middle line:90%
Quickly?

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:22.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MURCH: Yeah, pretty quickly.

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:23.620 align:middle line:90%
I think it's doing it a lot.

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:24.620 align:middle line:90%
It's like anything else.

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:26.078 align:middle line:10%
And what I tell
people when they're

00:24:26.078 --> 00:24:29.080 align:middle line:10%
using it is if you've
never used it before,

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:30.992 align:middle line:10%
do it with four
people to begin with.

00:24:30.992 --> 00:24:32.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Four little fingers.

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:35.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: It works better
when more people are on it.

00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:37.497 align:middle line:10%
And then as you
get better at it,

00:24:37.497 --> 00:24:38.830 align:middle line:10%
you can do less and less people.

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:41.935 align:middle line:84%
And ask questions that
you want answered.

00:24:41.935 --> 00:24:44.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's got felt
on the bottom right?

00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:46.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: Exactly, to
make it easy and--

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:47.170 align:middle line:90%
there's a sound to it.

00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:48.378 align:middle line:10%
I think we all heard a board.

00:24:48.378 --> 00:24:49.690 align:middle line:90%
It's like [IMITATING STATIC].

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:51.580 align:middle line:84%
It's-- when you
use a Ouija board,

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:53.590 align:middle line:90%
something very magical happens.

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:54.850 align:middle line:90%
We focus.

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:57.850 align:middle line:10%
In this world of tap,
swipe, and news--

00:24:57.850 --> 00:25:01.270 align:middle line:10%
24 news going on, you sit
down at the Ouija board,

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:02.470 align:middle line:10%
and everyone goes quiet.

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:05.260 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Can you fake it if
you're doing it with somebody?

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:07.900 align:middle line:10%
>>MURCH: I am sure I have played
with people who have purposely

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:10.275 align:middle line:10%
pushed it, so I guess that
would be considered faking it.

00:25:10.275 --> 00:25:11.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can you feel that?

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:14.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MURCH: It's hard to tell.

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:16.730 align:middle line:84%
If they're good, if they-- or
if they're just having fun,

00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:17.530 align:middle line:90%
then it's obvious.

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:21.790 align:middle line:10%
But I have-- if they don't
know they're doing it,

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:25.540 align:middle line:10%
it's hard to know because the
planchette how it's based,

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:27.700 align:middle line:10%
if everyone's hands
are spaced out evenly

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:30.400 align:middle line:10%
and it's not turning away
from them or towards them,

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.380 align:middle line:10%
but I've never had that.

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:34.530 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen
someone purposely do it

00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:36.210 align:middle line:90%
to-- unless it was a real joke.

00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:38.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mitch
Horowitz, noted author,

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:41.760 align:middle line:84%
talks about people's
fascination with Ouija boards.

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:45.240 align:middle line:10%
Well, our agents obviously
were into all kinds

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:46.380 align:middle line:10%
of metaphysical things.

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:46.920 align:middle line:10%
>>MITCH HOROWITZ: Oh, for sure.

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:47.400 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Weren't they?

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:47.730 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah.

00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:50.280 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What got them so
turned on by this stuff?

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:53.460 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: They believed that
every aspect of life was sacred

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:55.680 align:middle line:10%
and that everything
that was going on

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:56.980 align:middle line:10%
was part of a continuum.

00:25:56.980 --> 00:26:00.220 align:middle line:84%
So if you could freeze
in time a certain moment,

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:02.020 align:middle line:84%
maybe you're using
a divinitory method

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:05.970 align:middle line:84%
like the I Ching or tarot cards
or something else or the stars.

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:08.133 align:middle line:10%
If you could freeze in
time a certain moment,

00:26:08.133 --> 00:26:10.050 align:middle line:10%
they believe that you
might be able to discern

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:13.320 align:middle line:10%
everything else that's going
on-- past, present future.

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:15.690 align:middle line:10%
Everything is like a
three-dimensional photograph

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:18.960 align:middle line:10%
of life, and in that sense,
you could use almost any

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:21.420 align:middle line:10%
pictogramatic device to--

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:23.175 align:middle line:10%
for foresight, for prophecy.

00:26:23.175 --> 00:26:26.970 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Did they not have any
bad experiences with the Ouija

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:29.450 align:middle line:10%
board or the talking board
as they called it then?

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:29.640 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Sure.

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:30.440 align:middle line:10%
Sure.

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:33.160 align:middle line:10%
Look, I think people had lots
of good and bad experiences,

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:36.540 align:middle line:10%
but we are so hungry to touch
something beyond the physical,

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:38.550 align:middle line:10%
beyond flesh and
bone, that I think

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:41.610 align:middle line:10%
we're very attached to anything
that seems to be a kind of line

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:43.850 align:middle line:10%
of communication to the unseen.

00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:45.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's spot on isn't he?

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:46.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MURCH: Spot on.

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:48.630 align:middle line:84%
Mitch Horowitz is a
wonderful human being,

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:49.690 align:middle line:90%
a good friend of mine--

00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:50.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good author.

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:52.020 align:middle line:10%
>>MURCH: Has helped
me in my research.

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:54.845 align:middle line:10%
He actually found a
extremely rare article

00:26:54.845 --> 00:26:56.220 align:middle line:10%
that I had not
been able to find.

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:58.387 align:middle line:84%
He went to the New York
Library and found it for me.

00:26:58.387 --> 00:26:59.762 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
he's good at that.

00:26:59.762 --> 00:27:00.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MURCH: He's wonderful.

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:03.540 align:middle line:10%
What he's talking
about is very true,

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:06.360 align:middle line:10%
and here's something
about this belief.

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:09.690 align:middle line:10%
Why do-- why would we use a
Ouija board in the first place?

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:13.530 align:middle line:10%
And what if someone passed
away suddenly that you just

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:14.800 align:middle line:10%
didn't expect it at all.

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.860 align:middle line:90%
So it was very sudden.

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:19.878 align:middle line:84%
What if the last thing you said
to someone was terrible and--

00:27:19.878 --> 00:27:21.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
wanted to apologize.

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:22.152 align:middle line:90%
>>MURCH: They got hit by a car.

00:27:22.152 --> 00:27:22.875 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or make
good good for it.

00:27:22.875 --> 00:27:24.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MURCH: Guilt. Exactly.

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:25.900 align:middle line:90%
What's going to happen to me?

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:27.100 align:middle line:84%
What's going happen
to my loved ones?

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:28.892 align:middle line:10%
These are all questions
that everyone asks.

00:27:28.892 --> 00:27:32.790 align:middle line:10%
And the Ouija board people
go to because nothing else

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:34.500 align:middle line:10%
can answer it for sure.

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.420 align:middle line:84%
Just like their
religious beliefs,

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:38.540 align:middle line:90%
they have to take a step.

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:39.540 align:middle line:90%
They have to have faith.

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:43.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, why do
people, Murch, including me

00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:45.730 align:middle line:84%
think that by playing
with the Ouija board

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:48.220 align:middle line:84%
you could open up
the door to evil?

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:49.510 align:middle line:90%
Why do I believe that?

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:51.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: Because of
unfortunately people like me

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:54.970 align:middle line:84%
who worked in the industry who
portray it that way in movies--

00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do you--
why do you do that to us?

00:27:57.410 --> 00:27:58.702 align:middle line:90%
>>MURCH: It's a great way--

00:27:58.702 --> 00:28:00.160 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't the first
person to do it.

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.350 align:middle line:10%
It was happening long before me.

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:04.960 align:middle line:84%
But what it is is,
just like Mitch said,

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.660 align:middle line:84%
it's that yearning
to have some type

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:10.360 align:middle line:84%
of communication
other than ourselves,

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:12.640 align:middle line:84%
something bigger than
us, something after us,

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:15.200 align:middle line:84%
something around us
that we can't see.

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:19.870 align:middle line:10%
And so using this
board to open a portal

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:21.700 align:middle line:10%
that maybe you can't close--

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:24.010 align:middle line:10%
here's the wonderful
Ouija-stitions of the Ouija

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:26.290 align:middle line:10%
board that scare you.

00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:30.130 align:middle line:10%
We're told if we don't say
goodbye, if you don't sign off,

00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:32.540 align:middle line:10%
you've left the line open.

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:34.360 align:middle line:10%
If you leave the
planchette on it

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:35.800 align:middle line:10%
you haven't closed it per se.

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:37.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You mean
just like it is now?

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:38.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: Just sitting
there right now.

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, we haven't used
it and opened it up,

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:43.140 align:middle line:84%
but say we didn't say
goodbye, we've left it open.

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:44.395 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We just walk away.

00:28:44.395 --> 00:28:45.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: That's
what people believe.

00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:48.250 align:middle line:10%
People believe you can't get
rid of it, that if you try to--

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:50.410 align:middle line:10%
the only way to get rid
of is to give it away.

00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:52.390 align:middle line:84%
If you try to throw it
away, it'll come back.

00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:54.227 align:middle line:84%
If you try to burn
it, it won't burn.

00:28:54.227 --> 00:28:55.060 align:middle line:90%
You have to bury it.

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:58.240 align:middle line:84%
People have all of these
Ouija-stitions that have grown

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.610 align:middle line:90%
up all along this belief--

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:02.530 align:middle line:84%
in this uncomfortableness
with death.

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:04.490 align:middle line:10%
What are we really
afraid of when we're

00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:05.740 align:middle line:10%
talking about the Ouija board?

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:06.145 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The unknown.

00:29:06.145 --> 00:29:07.750 align:middle line:10%
>>MURCH: The unknown, exactly.

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:09.850 align:middle line:10%
And nothing--
we're lucky that we

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:12.640 align:middle line:10%
have the Ouija board that
has been around since 1890

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:14.800 align:middle line:10%
as we see it today.

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:18.610 align:middle line:10%
Having something be that long,
it's generations of stories.

00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:22.300 align:middle line:10%
And you asked Mitch did
people have bad experiences

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:23.200 align:middle line:10%
with the Ouija board.

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:24.397 align:middle line:90%
Right away.

00:29:24.397 --> 00:29:26.230 align:middle line:84%
Right away people were
saying that the Ouija

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:27.640 align:middle line:90%
board drove them crazy.

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:29.590 align:middle line:10%
It just wasn't the
overwhelming public.

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:32.350 align:middle line:10%
The overwhelming public
was having fun with it.

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:35.110 align:middle line:10%
The news stories wanted
things like the Ouija board

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:36.845 align:middle line:10%
told me to kill my
mother, so I did.

00:29:36.845 --> 00:29:39.220 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want to hear about
how use of the Ouija board

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:41.710 align:middle line:84%
and found a ring that you
lost three months ago.

00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:43.195 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is like a pendulum?

00:29:43.195 --> 00:29:45.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: Similar
belief behind using it.

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:47.530 align:middle line:84%
If you believe
that you're using--

00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:49.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because it's
got yes, no up there,

00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:51.700 align:middle line:90%
you can ask it questions.

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:53.030 align:middle line:90%
It spells out things.

00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:53.950 align:middle line:90%
It's got numbers.

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:55.810 align:middle line:90%
Why does it say goodbye on it.

00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:57.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: Goodbye
was Elijah Bond,

00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:01.240 align:middle line:84%
who was one of the originators,
he patents the board.

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.230 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't invent it,
but he patents it.

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:05.320 align:middle line:10%
And one of the things
he did was originally

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:06.820 align:middle line:10%
they said good night.

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:08.410 align:middle line:84%
The original talking
boards drawings

00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:10.690 align:middle line:84%
we'd have would say
good eve and good night.

00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:13.150 align:middle line:84%
It was Victorian times,
and they manners.

00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:15.520 align:middle line:10%
So when you started to
talk to the spirits,

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:17.168 align:middle line:10%
you would say good eve.

00:30:17.168 --> 00:30:18.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Blink out the candles.

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: And then when
you're done, good night.

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:25.090 align:middle line:10%
So as pop culture evolved,
good eve and good night

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:27.130 align:middle line:10%
were pushed away to goodbye.

00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:28.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now after
this program, you're

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:31.180 align:middle line:84%
probably going to
call Karen Dahlman

00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:34.420 align:middle line:84%
and tell her we did a Ouija
board show, and she'll love it.

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And she'll go was
George afraid of it?

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:37.870 align:middle line:90%
Did he get rid of it?

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:39.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: And I'll tell
her, yes, and he sent me

00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:40.450 align:middle line:90%
home in a red car.

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:41.367 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:30:41.367 --> 00:30:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And said he'll never
put you on again.

00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:45.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MURCH: Yeah, that's right.

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:46.570 align:middle line:10%
But over the years,
you and I have

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:48.135 align:middle line:10%
talked about a lot of things--

00:30:48.135 --> 00:30:52.540 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: But do you admit
evil can come through this?

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:55.807 align:middle line:10%
>>MURCH: If anything can
come through the Ouija board,

00:30:55.807 --> 00:30:57.640 align:middle line:10%
then, of course, evil
could come through it.

00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:59.598 align:middle line:84%
If it's anything other
than-- even if it's you,

00:30:59.598 --> 00:31:01.030 align:middle line:90%
it's potentially evil.

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:03.880 align:middle line:10%
You think about breaking
through your subconscious.

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:06.298 align:middle line:10%
If your mind has made
a wall that you are not

00:31:06.298 --> 00:31:08.590 align:middle line:10%
supposed to be touching, if
you start playing with this

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:11.680 align:middle line:10%
and pulling out bricks,
it's not always great.

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:14.316 align:middle line:84%
There is danger in playing
with something you don't know.

00:31:14.316 --> 00:31:15.816 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what
causes that though?

00:31:15.816 --> 00:31:18.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: I think-- what causes
the subconscious to want

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:19.450 align:middle line:84%
to hide things
from you you mean?

00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:20.176 align:middle line:90%
Like a traumatic experience.

00:31:20.176 --> 00:31:21.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I
mean why would evil

00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:23.650 align:middle line:84%
come through this when a
couple of kids are playing

00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:25.510 align:middle line:90%
and they're not bad kids?

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:26.680 align:middle line:90%
How would that happen?

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: What happens
in the movies is

00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:31.600 align:middle line:84%
far different than necessarily
what happens at home.

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you saying
evil doesn't come through?

00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:35.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: I'm saying
anything's possible.

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:38.620 align:middle line:10%
But in the thousands
of Ouija board cases

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:43.810 align:middle line:10%
that I have taken and cataloged
and gone through and looked at,

00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:46.330 align:middle line:10%
there are always other factors.

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:47.933 align:middle line:10%
There's always
something else going on

00:31:47.933 --> 00:31:49.850 align:middle line:10%
whether it's something
going on in the family,

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:52.540 align:middle line:10%
whether there is any type of
mental illness in the family.

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:55.930 align:middle line:10%
Now whether that opens them
up to these things more

00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:59.085 align:middle line:10%
or whether this is
just their creation--

00:31:59.085 --> 00:32:00.460 align:middle line:10%
One of the things
that fascinates

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:02.990 align:middle line:10%
me the most in talking to
Jeff Belanger who I know you

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:03.790 align:middle line:10%
know well.

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:04.590 align:middle line:90%
He's a good friend.

00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:05.815 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You know them all.

00:32:05.815 --> 00:32:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: He's-- yeah, we've
been around too long I guess.

00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:10.315 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're all into
Ouija boards aren't they.

00:32:10.315 --> 00:32:12.340 align:middle line:10%
>>MURCH: It's interesting
because him and I went

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:15.980 align:middle line:10%
to Australia, and we had 75
people playing the Ouija board

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:16.780 align:middle line:10%
all at once.

00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:19.720 align:middle line:10%
And what we did was an
interesting experiment.

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:22.403 align:middle line:10%
We were in a jail, and
lots of terrible things

00:32:22.403 --> 00:32:23.320 align:middle line:10%
happened in this jail.

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:24.235 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely, I bet.

00:32:24.235 --> 00:32:26.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: But we told people
nothing happened bad.

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:27.550 align:middle line:90%
This was just a regular jail--

00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:27.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In Australia?

00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:30.787 align:middle line:10%
>>MURCH: In Australia, regular
jail, and we had 75 people.

00:32:30.787 --> 00:32:32.620 align:middle line:10%
Looked like the Last
Supper of Ouija boards.

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:34.090 align:middle line:10%
We're all playing
the Ouija board.

00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:35.830 align:middle line:10%
Everyone had a great time.

00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:38.020 align:middle line:10%
The next time we did it,
we did it telling everyone

00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:39.130 align:middle line:10%
there were bad stories.

00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:41.270 align:middle line:10%
And everyone was having
a bad time with it.

00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:42.070 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:45.310 align:middle line:10%
>>MURCH: Knowing that
us planting the seed,

00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:48.160 align:middle line:10%
whether again it helped create
a story in their mind out

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:50.770 align:middle line:10%
of nothing or whether it
open them up to something.

00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:53.770 align:middle line:10%
Because again remember,
the conversation

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:57.370 align:middle line:10%
is happening between
you and something else,

00:32:57.370 --> 00:32:59.110 align:middle line:10%
but you are half of that.

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:01.390 align:middle line:10%
So whatever happens to
the-- with the Ouija board,

00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:03.280 align:middle line:10%
you are 50% responsible for.

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:05.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it true
that Milton Bradley, one

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:08.350 align:middle line:84%
of the developers of the
game, will not publicly

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:09.623 align:middle line:90%
discuss the Ouija board?

00:33:09.623 --> 00:33:12.040 align:middle line:10%
>>MURCH: Well, it's-- so a lot
of people think it's Milton

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:12.840 align:middle line:10%
Bradley.

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:16.690 align:middle line:10%
It was Parker Brothers from 1966
to 1991 when Hasbro bought it,

00:33:16.690 --> 00:33:21.430 align:middle line:10%
so Hasbro currently is and--
they do answer questions.

00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:24.100 align:middle line:84%
They don't answer whether
it's supernatural or not.

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:24.340 align:middle line:90%
To them--

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:25.965 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't
touch that do they?

00:33:25.965 --> 00:33:28.840 align:middle line:10%
>>MURCH: And again,
Ouija from the beginning

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:31.870 align:middle line:10%
has always been sold as
a game, Ouija proper.

00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:33.280 align:middle line:10%
It has been sold in toy stores.

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:37.030 align:middle line:10%
So for people who have a
hard time seeing children--

00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:39.040 align:middle line:10%
8 and above it says on the box--

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:41.470 align:middle line:10%
when people see children,
they get really upset.

00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:43.420 align:middle line:10%
And I always say
to them children

00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:46.360 align:middle line:10%
have been playing with the
Ouija board since 1890.

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:48.310 align:middle line:10%
And let's go back and
look at it for a second.

00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:49.990 align:middle line:10%
Let's look through the lens.

00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:53.890 align:middle line:10%
In the 1800s-- late 1800s,
if you had 12 children,

00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:56.050 align:middle line:10%
six of them could die.

00:33:56.050 --> 00:33:56.850 align:middle line:90%
And when they die--

00:33:56.850 --> 00:33:57.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or more.

00:33:57.650 --> 00:33:58.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MURCH: Right, or more.

00:33:58.660 --> 00:33:59.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sad times.

00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:02.170 align:middle line:10%
>>MURCH: When they died,
you would dress them up

00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:04.307 align:middle line:10%
in their Sunday best,
take a picture-- one

00:34:04.307 --> 00:34:06.640 align:middle line:10%
last picture with your family,
and put that on the wall.

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:07.810 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And they're dead.

00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:09.699 align:middle line:10%
>>MURCH: That was how
close death was to you.

00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:10.520 align:middle line:10%
So you're OK.

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.699 align:middle line:10%
Now you can understand
why we talk to the dead.

00:34:12.699 --> 00:34:15.790 align:middle line:10%
But here's a funny kind
of thing we've figured out

00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:18.605 align:middle line:10%
as we've looked through Ouija
history that may have something

00:34:18.605 --> 00:34:20.230 align:middle line:10%
to do with our
relationship with death,

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:22.300 align:middle line:10%
and I find that fascinating.

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:24.820 align:middle line:84%
It was a parlor game
originally, Ouija.

00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:26.960 align:middle line:84%
Play it, have fun,
ask questions.

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:31.540 align:middle line:10%
So today like what
happened in the Civil War,

00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:34.420 align:middle line:10%
funeral parlors started
popping up because embalming

00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:35.679 align:middle line:10%
hadn't existed before this.

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:40.940 align:middle line:84%
Before embalming, you helped
change the ice in your house.

00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:42.840 align:middle line:84%
They were in laid
out in your parlor.

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:44.590 align:middle line:84%
They might even be
buried in your backyard

00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:46.900 align:middle line:90%
if you had a personal cemetery.

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:48.589 align:middle line:90%
So again death very close.

00:34:48.589 --> 00:34:49.389 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:50.139 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They had wakes.

00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:51.097 align:middle line:90%
>>MURCH: As we-- right.

00:34:51.097 --> 00:34:54.760 align:middle line:10%
Everything was-- and you would
even go visit the cemetery

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:56.110 align:middle line:10%
and have parties.

00:34:56.110 --> 00:34:57.130 align:middle line:90%
You miss them.

00:34:57.130 --> 00:34:59.320 align:middle line:84%
To them, the only way
instead of mourning

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:01.660 align:middle line:84%
all the time was to keep
them involved in your life.

00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:03.580 align:middle line:84%
The Ouija board was
one of those ways.

00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And what's really
interesting, though,

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:08.920 align:middle line:84%
is this is how uncomfortable
with death we are today.

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:11.527 align:middle line:84%
And we live-- this is
in an interesting time

00:35:11.527 --> 00:35:12.610 align:middle line:90%
that we're also living in.

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:17.168 align:middle line:10%
But what is the room that you
would call the parlor today,

00:35:17.168 --> 00:35:18.460 align:middle line:10%
the room everything happens in?

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:19.502 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The living room.

00:35:19.502 --> 00:35:20.860 align:middle line:10%
>>MURCH: The living room.

00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:22.420 align:middle line:10%
We no longer call it the parlor.

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:25.030 align:middle line:84%
The funeral parlor took
death out of the house,

00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:27.970 align:middle line:84%
and we whitewashed it
with the living room.

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:30.650 align:middle line:84%
So that's how uncomfortable we
just naturally are with death.

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:31.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I never
thought of that.

00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:33.910 align:middle line:10%
>>MURCH: Which is really fun
because again the Ouija board

00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:38.000 align:middle line:10%
lets me see it
through this lens how

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.522 align:middle line:10%
people feel about death in
every decade, which does shift.

00:35:40.522 --> 00:35:42.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Karen Dahlman
believes the Ouija

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:45.365 align:middle line:84%
board can be used to discover
who we are on the inside.

00:35:45.365 --> 00:35:46.992 align:middle line:90%
>>MURCH: Of course.

00:35:46.992 --> 00:35:48.677 align:middle line:10%
>>DAHLMAN: Well,
a Ouijalogist is

00:35:48.677 --> 00:35:51.260 align:middle line:10%
somebody who works with a board
and understands how to use it.

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:53.380 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And how do you use it?

00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:55.760 align:middle line:10%
>>DAHLMAN: Well I use the
board for only one purpose,

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:58.520 align:middle line:10%
and the purpose is for spiritual
development and growth.

00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:00.100 align:middle line:10%
So I make sure that
it's always used

00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:01.450 align:middle line:10%
under those kind of auspices.

00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:03.640 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: When you wrote
"The Spirit of Creativity"

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:06.640 align:middle line:10%
and "The Spirits of
the Ouija," two books,

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:08.140 align:middle line:10%
they're both different.

00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:12.970 align:middle line:10%
One deals more with the
inner spirituality of people.

00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:16.310 align:middle line:10%
The other one deals
with the Ouija board.

00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:19.628 align:middle line:10%
How can somebody
be so different?

00:36:19.628 --> 00:36:21.670 align:middle line:10%
>>DAHLMAN: Well, that's
a good way of putting it,

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:23.380 align:middle line:10%
yet they are very similar.

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:25.570 align:middle line:10%
When I was writing the
first book, "The Spirit

00:36:25.570 --> 00:36:27.610 align:middle line:10%
of Creativity," I
actually was consulting

00:36:27.610 --> 00:36:30.490 align:middle line:10%
with the Ouija board, my
spirit friends, on some topics

00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:31.480 align:middle line:10%
to write about.

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:33.730 align:middle line:10%
So this book came
with the topics

00:36:33.730 --> 00:36:35.530 align:middle line:10%
that I was working on
with the Ouija board,

00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:41.560 align:middle line:10%
meaning personal development,
learning to access creativity,

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:44.870 align:middle line:10%
learning to evolve myself,
become a better person.

00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:47.050 align:middle line:10%
So when I wrote "The
Spirits of Ouija--

00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:48.880 align:middle line:10%
Four Decades of
Communication," that's

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:50.680 align:middle line:10%
really what was going
on behind the scenes

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:51.597 align:middle line:10%
why I wrote this book.

00:36:51.597 --> 00:36:54.340 align:middle line:10%
So really what's been going on
behind the scenes for 40 years

00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:56.590 align:middle line:10%
when I wrote this book and
beyond because it talks

00:36:56.590 --> 00:36:59.950 align:middle line:10%
about how to go more internally
with yourself, that spirits

00:36:59.950 --> 00:37:01.960 align:middle line:10%
actually-- our guides
are here to help

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:04.090 align:middle line:10%
us become more
powerful in our self,

00:37:04.090 --> 00:37:05.350 align:middle line:10%
not to go outside our self.

00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:07.420 align:middle line:10%
Although the Ouija
board seems like a tool

00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:09.370 align:middle line:10%
for outside
ourselves, it's really

00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:10.810 align:middle line:10%
a tool to help
you go back within

00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:13.780 align:middle line:10%
and to learn great things
about your talents, who

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:16.520 align:middle line:10%
you are, capabilities,
abilities, and those kinds

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:17.320 align:middle line:10%
of things.

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:18.862 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Murch, what
advice would you

00:37:18.862 --> 00:37:21.910 align:middle line:84%
give people who want to use
a Ouija board first time?

00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:23.980 align:middle line:10%
>>MURCH: First time,
so I would tell them

00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:28.570 align:middle line:10%
that they should write down
10 questions they actually

00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:31.340 align:middle line:10%
want answers to, not questions
that are going to scare them.

00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:32.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:32.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MURCH: Just practice.

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:33.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Legitimate questions?

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:34.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: Legitimate
questions to get

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:36.250 align:middle line:90%
them going like anything else.

00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And then also to pick
three other friends

00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:41.228 align:middle line:84%
that they trust as much
as you trust friends

00:37:41.228 --> 00:37:42.520 align:middle line:90%
that you want to have fun with.

00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:43.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:46.000 align:middle line:10%
>>MURCH: So knowing that there
is-- once we've added a human,

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.020 align:middle line:10%
we know that someone might fool
around and push it themselves.

00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:51.850 align:middle line:10%
But if-- find
people who genuinely

00:37:51.850 --> 00:37:54.010 align:middle line:10%
want to explore this
like anything else

00:37:54.010 --> 00:37:55.780 align:middle line:10%
and ask those questions.

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And what you'll find is as
you move around the board,

00:37:59.170 --> 00:38:01.887 align:middle line:84%
you start to feel how hard
to push and not to push,

00:38:01.887 --> 00:38:03.970 align:middle line:84%
that if you push too hard
it stops the planchette.

00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:04.870 align:middle line:10%
We don't want that.

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:07.415 align:middle line:84%
And if you take your fingers
off, it doesn't work.

00:38:07.415 --> 00:38:08.290 align:middle line:90%
That's in the movies.

00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:09.832 align:middle line:84%
I do that in the
movies all the time.

00:38:09.832 --> 00:38:13.240 align:middle line:10%
I can promise you I have never
witnessed-- other people have--

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:15.760 align:middle line:10%
but I have never witnessed the
planchette moving on its own.

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:16.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Never.

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:16.947 align:middle line:90%
>>MURCH: It's always--

00:38:16.947 --> 00:38:19.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now when you say other
people have, how in God's name

00:38:19.690 --> 00:38:20.680 align:middle line:90%
could that happen?

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:22.748 align:middle line:10%
>>MURCH: They-- people
believe that it could

00:38:22.748 --> 00:38:24.040 align:middle line:10%
be the spirit that's moving it.

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:25.960 align:middle line:10%
Maybe they believe it to them.

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:28.570 align:middle line:10%
One interesting thing I
talked to Jeff a lot about

00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:31.930 align:middle line:10%
is are ghosts that we're trying
to talk to through the Ouija

00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:36.820 align:middle line:10%
board actually our memories
and projections of that person.

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:39.610 align:middle line:84%
Can our thoughts have
weight in the world?

00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:41.170 align:middle line:90%
Can they actually affect things?

00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:42.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And create things.

00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:43.465 align:middle line:90%
>>MURCH: And create things.

00:38:43.465 --> 00:38:46.210 align:middle line:10%
So are we creating the ghost
of our grandmother or a demon

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:49.750 align:middle line:10%
or whatever it is we're
afraid of or most want to see?

00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:51.186 align:middle line:90%
And I recently--

00:38:51.186 --> 00:38:52.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It could be.

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:53.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MURCH: Who knows.

00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:53.380 align:middle line:90%
These are the people--

00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:53.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can't
rule that out.

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:54.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MURCH: Right.

00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:57.610 align:middle line:10%
The beauty of these things are
we'll have to pick a belief

00:38:57.610 --> 00:39:00.670 align:middle line:10%
or just continue being
skeptical all around

00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:01.705 align:middle line:10%
and exploring all of it.

00:39:01.705 --> 00:39:02.830 align:middle line:90%
And that's why I love this.

00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:06.820 align:middle line:10%
And I recently had an
experience in the paranormal

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:10.930 align:middle line:10%
that definitely, again, makes
you re-evaluate what you think,

00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:13.600 align:middle line:10%
and being so close to the Ouija
board in death all the time,

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:14.400 align:middle line:10%
it's interesting.

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:15.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had a
ghost experience.

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:16.780 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:17.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MURCH: I did.

00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:21.700 align:middle line:10%
So in 2004, there have
been two times in my life

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:23.950 align:middle line:10%
that I have been
very close to dying.

00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:28.030 align:middle line:10%
And in 2004, was the first
time I had a noncancerous tumor

00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:29.320 align:middle line:10%
taken out of my jaw.

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:32.710 align:middle line:84%
It should have been simple
like all surgeries, simple.

00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:35.050 align:middle line:10%
And it turned out I
got a staph infection

00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:36.490 align:middle line:10%
and got really, really sick.

00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:39.590 align:middle line:10%
And while I was in the
hospital, I was laying there,

00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:40.390 align:middle line:10%
and they warned me.

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:41.807 align:middle line:10%
They said, look,
you're very sick.

00:39:41.807 --> 00:39:44.500 align:middle line:10%
We don't know if the
medicine is going to work.

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:49.510 align:middle line:10%
If you start seeing things
from people who have passed on

00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:52.120 align:middle line:10%
or hearing voices, tell
us because we're not

00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:53.440 align:middle line:10%
saying it's real.

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:55.000 align:middle line:10%
We're saying that--
it's a ghost,

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.520 align:middle line:10%
but we're saying we noticed
that when people are very sick

00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:00.370 align:middle line:10%
and this happens, that
means you're close

00:40:00.370 --> 00:40:01.925 align:middle line:10%
and we want to see
if we can fix it.

00:40:01.925 --> 00:40:04.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they think you're
hallucinating or something?

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:05.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MURCH: Could be hallucinating.

00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:06.030 align:middle line:90%
Could be medicine.

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:09.160 align:middle line:84%
Could be your--
the veil is so thin

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.200 align:middle line:84%
because you're so close
to death yourself.

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:14.627 align:middle line:84%
So they explain it to
me, and immediately I

00:40:14.627 --> 00:40:15.460 align:middle line:90%
think I go to sleep.

00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:17.710 align:middle line:84%
And in comes my grandmother
who passed away four years

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:20.463 align:middle line:84%
before, the grandmother who
snuck me into "Witchboard,"

00:40:20.463 --> 00:40:21.380 align:middle line:90%
and I was very close--

00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:22.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She loves you much.

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:23.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: She-- I
loved her very much.

00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:24.813 align:middle line:10%
She was very missed to this day.

00:40:24.813 --> 00:40:27.130 align:middle line:10%
But she came home with her
walker, and we caught up.

00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:29.650 align:middle line:10%
And I knew she was
dead in my-- in this.

00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:31.490 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like,
oh, she's not dead.

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:32.290 align:middle line:90%
I don't know this.

00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:34.310 align:middle line:90%
I knew something was wrong.

00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:36.587 align:middle line:10%
And I said to her they
told me that if I started

00:40:36.587 --> 00:40:38.170 align:middle line:10%
seeing things, and
she said, well, you

00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:40.993 align:middle line:10%
need to tell them
because you're sick

00:40:40.993 --> 00:40:42.910 align:middle line:10%
and they're not giving
you the right medicine.

00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:44.140 align:middle line:10%
And you need to wake up.

00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And she grabbed my arm,
and it made me wake up.

00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:48.760 align:middle line:90%
And I told the doctors.

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, they
tested, and it turned out

00:40:50.890 --> 00:40:53.080 align:middle line:84%
I had a different
form of the staph.

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:54.550 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't helping me.

00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And had they not done
that, I would have died.

00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:57.078 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You would have died.

00:40:57.078 --> 00:40:58.610 align:middle line:90%
>>MURCH: Fast forward to 2020.

00:40:58.610 --> 00:41:01.607 align:middle line:84%
I've had back surgeries
that unfortunately got me--

00:41:01.607 --> 00:41:03.190 align:middle line:84%
I was almost here
once before and then

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:04.863 align:middle line:84%
had to reschedule because
of my back surgery.

00:41:04.863 --> 00:41:05.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I remember that.

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:06.480 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:09.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: But-- so thank you for
having me back, first of all.

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was is I
had this big back surgery,

00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:16.790 align:middle line:84%
and it was from
T10 to my pelvis.

00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:17.590 align:middle line:90%
So it's basically--

00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:19.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ouch, it's
like that right?

00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:23.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: It's very big
and a nasty looking scar.

00:41:23.070 --> 00:41:25.980 align:middle line:84%
There were complications,
again, surgery.

00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:26.880 align:middle line:90%
I got home.

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:28.905 align:middle line:10%
It was on my birthday,
February 20th.

00:41:28.905 --> 00:41:30.450 align:middle line:90%
I did not want a birthday party.

00:41:30.450 --> 00:41:31.660 align:middle line:90%
I just want to be left alone.

00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:33.660 align:middle line:84%
I was feeling sicker
every day I was home.

00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:34.575 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No mood to celebrate.

00:41:34.575 --> 00:41:35.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MURCH: Yeah.

00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:35.870 align:middle line:90%
I was just ugh.

00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:37.560 align:middle line:90%
And I went to sleep.

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:40.800 align:middle line:10%
And it was around 7:00, and
I woke up say around 10:00.

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:43.020 align:middle line:10%
But what I woke up
to was my grandmother

00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:46.965 align:middle line:10%
had come in the room, and
I knew immediately uh oh.

00:41:46.965 --> 00:41:48.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Here we go again.

00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:49.013 align:middle line:90%
>>MURCH: Here we go.

00:41:49.013 --> 00:41:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And this time she
wasn't as nice.

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:55.230 align:middle line:84%
She was urgent and very
like you need to wake up.

00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:57.930 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to talk to her
and just ask her questions

00:41:57.930 --> 00:41:59.170 align:middle line:90%
I hadn't asked before.

00:41:59.170 --> 00:42:00.562 align:middle line:10%
And I was tired and--

00:42:00.562 --> 00:42:02.520 align:middle line:10%
when you're sick and it
goes into sepsis, which

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:05.760 align:middle line:10%
is what was happening to me, I
was getting sicker and sicker,

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:07.980 align:middle line:10%
and I just told her
I just want to sleep.

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:09.510 align:middle line:90%
I just want to be left alone.

00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And she grabbed my arm
again and said wake up.

00:42:12.070 --> 00:42:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And when I woke up, I told
my husband something's wrong.

00:42:15.370 --> 00:42:16.170 align:middle line:90%
I don't feel good.

00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:17.610 align:middle line:10%
And he took my
temperature, and it

00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:22.840 align:middle line:10%
was 105.9, which I didn't know
thermometers went to 105.9.

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:24.210 align:middle line:90%
I assumed I broke it.

00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:25.690 align:middle line:90%
And it was real.

00:42:25.690 --> 00:42:27.150 align:middle line:90%
And so I had gone into sepsis.

00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:29.850 align:middle line:10%
And if it wasn't for my
grandmother-- so twice--

00:42:29.850 --> 00:42:32.190 align:middle line:10%
I'm seen as a big skeptic,
and yet twice I've

00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:33.900 align:middle line:10%
had these very
personal experiences,

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:36.660 align:middle line:10%
which if it wasn't for her,
I wouldn't be sitting here

00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:36.850 align:middle line:10%
with you.

00:42:36.850 --> 00:42:37.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You'd be gone.

00:42:37.350 --> 00:42:39.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: So whether that's
my own mind creating

00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:43.500 align:middle line:84%
that to save me or whether
she actually intervened,

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:44.928 align:middle line:90%
either way I love.

00:42:44.928 --> 00:42:46.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
your website, Murch?

00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:48.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: So, yeah, people
can learn more about us

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:54.060 align:middle line:84%
at the Talking Board
Historical Society at tbhs.org.

00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And if they want to learn
specifically about me,

00:42:56.970 --> 00:42:58.230 align:middle line:90%
it's Robert Murch--

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:01.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Murch, thanks
for being on the program.

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:02.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MURCH: Thank you so
much for having me.

00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:03.723 align:middle line:90%
It's been wonderful.

00:43:03.723 --> 00:43:06.960 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: So you may think will
George play with the Ouija

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:09.150 align:middle line:10%
board after this interview.

00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:10.200 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:12.780 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
