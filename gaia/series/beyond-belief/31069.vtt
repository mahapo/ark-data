>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.490 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.114 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:18.114 --> 00:00:21.060 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.320 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.040 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.845 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

>>NARRATOR: And now, the host of
the nationally syndicated Coast

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.780 align:middle line:84%
to Coast AM and Gaiam TV
bring you Beyond Belief

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:41.720 align:middle line:90%
with George Noory.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.480 align:middle line:10%
Like the movie "Armageddon,"
President Obama

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.320 align:middle line:10%
has a plan, a $100 million
plan to send astronauts

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.500 align:middle line:10%
to an asteroid, capture it,
tow it back around the moon.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.410 align:middle line:90%
What does that all mean?

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And will planet Earth
get hit by an asteroid?

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.740 align:middle line:84%
Once again, we turn to
planetary expert, Dan Durda,

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.989 align:middle line:90%
on Beyond Belief.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.290 align:middle line:90%
Dan, welcome to the show.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.405 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:08.405 --> 00:01:09.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How are you?

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.844 align:middle line:90%
>>DAN DURDA: Hi, George.

00:01:09.844 --> 00:01:10.220 align:middle line:90%
Great to see ya.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.094 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Have a seat.

00:01:11.094 --> 00:01:12.091 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Great, thanks.

00:01:12.091 --> 00:01:13.965 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Always good to
see you in the flesh.

00:01:13.965 --> 00:01:16.190 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's this plan
of sending astronauts

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.100 align:middle line:84%
to an asteroid, capturing it,
and towing it around the moon?

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.240 align:middle line:90%
What's that for?

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.140 align:middle line:10%
>>DURDA: Well,
it's about actually

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.190 align:middle line:10%
moving the human presence off
this planet out of low Earth

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.141 align:middle line:10%
orbit and into near Earth space.

00:01:32.141 --> 00:01:33.890 align:middle line:10%
And we've got to start
somewhere and learn

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.580 align:middle line:10%
to practice those techniques.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And we might as well start
with something that sometimes

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.780 align:middle line:84%
directly affects us here on
Earth, which is getting out

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.080 align:middle line:84%
there, grabbing a little
asteroid, the kinds that

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.110 align:middle line:84%
occasionally hit us, the
kinds that, in the future,

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.630 align:middle line:84%
will be great sources
for mineral resources

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.064 align:middle line:84%
out there in space, and
learning to interact with it,

00:01:51.064 --> 00:01:53.230 align:middle line:84%
learning to grab them,
learning to move them around.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And demonstrate that
we humans have finally

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.392 align:middle line:84%
gotten the capability to
alter our solar system.

00:01:58.392 --> 00:01:59.100 align:middle line:90%
Think about that.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.470 align:middle line:84%
We are at a point in our
species where we can literally

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.266 align:middle line:84%
change the shape of
the solar system.

00:02:05.266 --> 00:02:06.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How far out
does this asteroid

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.389 align:middle line:84%
have to be before
they land on it?

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:09.764 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: Well we
haven't actually

00:02:09.764 --> 00:02:11.470 align:middle line:90%
found the asteroid yet.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.500 align:middle line:84%
The way this mission
would work is,

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.800 align:middle line:84%
once as it progresses
further, we will actually

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.960 align:middle line:84%
go out and target,
complete the search

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.410 align:middle line:84%
for these little small
near-Earth asteroids

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.880 align:middle line:84%
and find the most appropriate
target at the time

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.470 align:middle line:84%
that we actually
fly the mission.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And then go out and grab
that one and pull it in.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, how you are
you going to pull it in?

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.280 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.899 align:middle line:90%
You put a lasso around it?

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:32.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: Almost literally,
that's the case.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's not a lasso in
this particular case.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.620 align:middle line:90%
It's a big net, in a sense.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.240 align:middle line:84%
The spacecraft,
which really looks

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.860 align:middle line:84%
like many other sort of
communications satellites

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.280 align:middle line:84%
from the way it looks--
except this one has

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.100 align:middle line:84%
a big, deployable bag, literally
a big, deployable bag--

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.660 align:middle line:84%
that would go out and
ensnare the asteroid,

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.190 align:middle line:90%
and net it down, close it down.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.560 align:middle line:84%
And then it becomes
attached to the spacecraft,

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.912 align:middle line:84%
a part of the spacecraft
at that point,

00:02:58.912 --> 00:03:00.870 align:middle line:84%
and then literally is
maneuvered back to Earth.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How fast is an asteroid
speeding through the universe

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.662 align:middle line:90%
right now?

00:03:05.662 --> 00:03:08.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: Very much, the ones
in the near Earth environment,

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.157 align:middle line:84%
the ones near us in space, are
moving around the sun in space

00:03:12.157 --> 00:03:13.740 align:middle line:84%
pretty much the same
way the Earth is.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.070 align:middle line:84%
We're moving at
about 30 kilometers

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.644 align:middle line:90%
every second around the sun.

00:03:17.644 --> 00:03:18.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's pretty fast.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.076 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: That's pretty fast.

00:03:20.076 --> 00:03:21.950 align:middle line:84%
Let's see, I have to do
the math very quickly

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.159 align:middle line:90%
in my head, 6, 12--

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:26.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's why I just
said it's pretty fast.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.172 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: It's pretty
fast, exactly.

00:03:28.172 --> 00:03:29.630 align:middle line:84%
But all the asteroids
around us are

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.260 align:middle line:90%
moving at those kinds of speeds.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.720 align:middle line:84%
Now like a bunch of cars
in traffic on the highway,

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.850 align:middle line:84%
you're all generally
moving the same speed,

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.420 align:middle line:84%
but some are changing
lanes, some are passing.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.380 align:middle line:84%
So the speeds relative to us
are a lot lower than that,

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.719 align:middle line:84%
but still pretty high compared
to things we're used to.

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:47.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.010 align:middle line:84%
So if you tow it
in, and then you

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.650 align:middle line:84%
put it around the orbit of
the moon, how do you do that?

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: The way they maneuver
other spacecraft in space.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.280 align:middle line:84%
They're very slow,
gentle maneuvers.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.550 align:middle line:84%
It's not like in the movies
where things happen very fast.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.100 align:middle line:84%
It'll take days,
days of maneuvers,

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.660 align:middle line:84%
probably even weeks,
quite frankly,

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.330 align:middle line:84%
but days of
spacecraft operations.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.410 align:middle line:84%
You'll use the thrusters
on the spacecraft itself.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.540 align:middle line:84%
This is not going to be
a big asteroid, right?

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.560 align:middle line:84%
The one we go after
to net like this

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.284 align:middle line:84%
will probably be not much bigger
than this stage, quite frankly.

00:04:19.284 --> 00:04:20.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's small.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: It'll be a
rock in space, right?

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: I mean, technically
it's an asteroid,

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.186 align:middle line:90%
but it's going to be small.

00:04:24.186 --> 00:04:24.685 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:04:24.685 --> 00:04:25.945 align:middle line:90%
I was thinking something huge.

00:04:25.945 --> 00:04:26.630 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to be that--

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.338 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: It's not
going to Mount Everest.

00:04:28.338 --> 00:04:30.520 align:middle line:84%
No, it's going to be
the size of the stage,

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.140 align:middle line:90%
or the size of half this studio.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.460 align:middle line:84%
So something small,
but that's how you get

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:35.880 align:middle line:90%
started, quite frankly.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.056 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, I'll remind you
that an object of that size

00:04:39.056 --> 00:04:40.430 align:middle line:84%
can do a lot of
damage plummeting

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.100 align:middle line:90%
through the atmosphere.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, sure.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.780 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Right?

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.690 align:middle line:84%
So if that's the kind
of object that you

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.980 align:middle line:84%
want to learn to maneuver
and work around with,

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.160 align:middle line:90%
it's a great place to start.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.826 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, Dan,
we saw what happened

00:04:48.826 --> 00:04:53.072 align:middle line:84%
when the meteor exploded over
Siberia several months ago.

00:04:53.072 --> 00:04:53.655 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Yeah.

00:04:53.655 --> 00:04:55.321 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know,
1,000 people injured.

00:04:55.321 --> 00:04:58.320 align:middle line:84%
Had that blown up a little
closer to the atmosphere,

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.952 align:middle line:84%
that could have really
sustained some damage.

00:05:00.952 --> 00:05:01.910 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: We were lucky.

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.830 align:middle line:90%


00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.920 align:middle line:84%
So this was back in February,
it was about 55 feet across.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:10.992 align:middle line:90%
This was pretty big.

00:05:10.992 --> 00:05:12.450 align:middle line:84%
This is, in fact,
the biggest thing

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.790 align:middle line:84%
we've ever seen
historically since we've

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.790 align:middle line:84%
been looking for objects
coming near the Earth,

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.210 align:middle line:84%
actually plummet
through the atmosphere.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.001 align:middle line:90%
It was a big event.

00:05:20.001 --> 00:05:21.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.199 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: But we were lucky.

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:25.240 align:middle line:84%
So this thing plummeted
in through the atmosphere

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.640 align:middle line:90%
at a very grazing angle.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.710 align:middle line:84%
Actually we ran into it
as it was approaching us

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.410 align:middle line:84%
from inside the
orbit of the Earth.

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.220 align:middle line:84%
We ran into it, but it
entered our atmosphere

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.530 align:middle line:90%
at a very grazing angle.

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.990 align:middle line:90%
And that is why we were lucky.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.200 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of
opportunity for the atmosphere

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.160 align:middle line:84%
to break this
object, and I mean,

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.392 align:middle line:90%
in both uses of the words.

00:05:46.392 --> 00:05:47.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.808 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: --to slow it
down and literally,

00:05:48.808 --> 00:05:50.630 align:middle line:90%
to break it into bits.

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.910 align:middle line:84%
Had this thing come at a more
plunging angle straight down,

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.270 align:middle line:84%
the damage in Chelyabinsk
there in Russia--

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Would've been huge.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: --would've
been a lot worse.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:58.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huge.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: People could
have been killed.

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.636 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know,
we've talked on Coast

00:06:00.636 --> 00:06:04.030 align:middle line:84%
to Coast for years, you and
I, about the possibility

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.610 align:middle line:90%
of getting hit by an asteroid.

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:06.590 align:middle line:90%
What could happen?

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And what is scary, not the
ones that we know about,

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.287 align:middle line:84%
it's the ones we
don't know about.

00:06:13.287 --> 00:06:14.370 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Like Chelyabinsk.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:15.286 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:06:15.286 --> 00:06:18.250 align:middle line:84%
This meteor that became a
meteorite because once it hits,

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.010 align:middle line:90%
that's what it's called.

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:21.510 align:middle line:90%
We didn't know about it, did we?

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:22.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: No, we didn't.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.930 align:middle line:84%
It was one of these cases
we've talked about for years

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.260 align:middle line:84%
that, you know,
it's not the ones

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:27.090 align:middle line:90%
I know about that worry me.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.048 align:middle line:90%
It's the ones we don't.

00:06:28.048 --> 00:06:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And it literally
came out of the blue

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.121 align:middle line:84%
just like the event in 1908
also in Russia in Siberia.

00:06:34.121 --> 00:06:34.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tunguska.

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: The
Tunguska event-- that

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.800 align:middle line:84%
was another one of these
very early morning objects

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.110 align:middle line:84%
that came in from
out of the sun--

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.318 align:middle line:84%
from the direction of the
sun, not literally from out

00:06:43.318 --> 00:06:45.510 align:middle line:84%
of the sun, and
caught us unaware.

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:47.170 align:middle line:90%
And that was the case here.

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:52.110 align:middle line:84%
It was a relatively
small object that

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.350 align:middle line:84%
evaded our detection
from telescopes.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.495 align:middle line:84%
These small things--
asteroids are dark.

00:06:57.495 --> 00:06:59.620 align:middle line:84%
They're black effectively
from most things we know.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.310 align:middle line:84%
They're like an
asphalt parking lot.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And you put a small one of
these things far out in space,

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.480 align:middle line:90%
they're very hard to see.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.996 align:middle line:84%
And this object, far
enough out coupled

00:07:08.996 --> 00:07:11.370 align:middle line:84%
with the fact that it came
from the direction of the sun,

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.036 align:middle line:84%
it was in the daylight
sky for the weeks

00:07:13.036 --> 00:07:14.300 align:middle line:90%
preceding the actual event.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.690 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have a
chance of seeing it.

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:17.065 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there
seemed to have

00:07:17.065 --> 00:07:22.730 align:middle line:84%
been a lot of meteor showers
or sightings weeks after that.

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.116 align:middle line:90%
Is it like they came in a swarm?

00:07:25.116 --> 00:07:27.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: I think it's the
reports that come in the swarm.

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:29.537 align:middle line:84%
It's more like the
shark attack summer

00:07:29.537 --> 00:07:31.120 align:middle line:84%
that we had a couple
years ago, right,

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.017 align:middle line:84%
where it gets a lot
of media attention.

00:07:34.017 --> 00:07:34.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: And so that
builds on itself.

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:39.700 align:middle line:84%
We are hit by objects
every single day.

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, things do
come in swarms.

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:44.960 align:middle line:84%
We have meteor showers, right,
because the Earth will actually

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.570 align:middle line:84%
pass through the swarm of debris
left in the trail of comets.

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And so for a period
of several days

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:54.660 align:middle line:84%
before and after that passage,
we will get a swarm of things.

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:57.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's possible certainly
for near-Earth asteroids

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.500 align:middle line:84%
to have those kinds of
fragments near them.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And so conceptually
it's possible to have

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:03.210 align:middle line:90%
a swarm like that.

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:05.219 align:middle line:84%
In this case, I will chalk
that up to just media

00:08:05.219 --> 00:08:06.010 align:middle line:90%
attention probably.

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:08.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nothing prettier,
hot summer night,

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:10.607 align:middle line:84%
watching meteors
darting across the sky.

00:08:10.607 --> 00:08:11.440 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Absolutely.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How big are they?

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:13.750 align:middle line:90%
They're not that bid, are they?

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:15.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: No, the ones you're
seeing when you're laying out

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:17.230 align:middle line:84%
on that summer night looking
at the perceived meteors,

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:19.196 align:middle line:84%
for instance, you're
watching grains of sand

00:08:19.196 --> 00:08:20.370 align:middle line:90%
burn up in the atmosphere.

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:21.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That small?

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:21.880 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: That small.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.440 align:middle line:84%
Most of that light, most of
the energy that you're seeing

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:29.120 align:middle line:84%
is from the shock wave
in the atmosphere.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.850 align:middle line:84%
As that little grain of sand
is coming through the air at,

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:34.120 align:middle line:84%
what, 40,000 or
50,000 miles an hour,

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.574 align:middle line:84%
right, it's creating a
little mini sonic boom just

00:08:36.574 --> 00:08:38.199 align:middle line:84%
like a supersonic
aircraft, except this

00:08:38.199 --> 00:08:40.960 align:middle line:84%
is a hypersonic
aircraft in this case.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.542 align:middle line:84%
And that literally shock
heats the atmosphere ahead

00:08:43.542 --> 00:08:44.750 align:middle line:90%
of that little grain of sand.

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:47.820 align:middle line:84%
It's like it's
heating the atmosphere

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.970 align:middle line:84%
to the point of incandescence
like a candle flame.

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.440 align:middle line:90%
That's the light that you see.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And that little grain of sand
will create that glowing cloud

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:58.130 align:middle line:84%
of plasma around it
that is literally

00:08:58.130 --> 00:08:59.380 align:middle line:90%
visible for hundreds of miles.

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If it were
a little bigger,

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.027 align:middle line:84%
would it be a bigger
visual for us?

00:09:04.027 --> 00:09:04.860 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Absolutely.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:06.443 align:middle line:84%
And when you get to
something the size

00:09:06.443 --> 00:09:09.230 align:middle line:84%
of this desk or the
Chelyabinsk object,

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:13.640 align:middle line:84%
in that particular case, it
can be blindingly bright.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.980 align:middle line:84%
The Chelyabinsk meteor
back in February

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.570 align:middle line:84%
was as-- it was
literally, literally

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:19.487 align:middle line:90%
brighter than the sun.

00:09:19.487 --> 00:09:20.069 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:09:20.069 --> 00:09:20.780 align:middle line:90%
That was daytime.

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:22.155 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: It was
right at sunrise.

00:09:22.155 --> 00:09:24.571 align:middle line:84%
And for just a little bit,
there were two suns in the sky,

00:09:24.571 --> 00:09:26.860 align:middle line:84%
right, because it was literally
brighter than the sun.

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:29.190 align:middle line:84%
There were some reports--
a few of the eyewitnesses

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:31.881 align:middle line:84%
actually reported feeling
the heat on their face

00:09:31.881 --> 00:09:32.880 align:middle line:90%
from the radiant energy.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.830 align:middle line:84%
Just like you turn your head up
to the sun on a hot summer day,

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:38.262 align:middle line:90%
you can feel the heat on you.

00:09:38.262 --> 00:09:39.720 align:middle line:84%
They felt the heat
from the meteor.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they
hear an explosion?

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:46.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: They heard
several chains of booms,

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:49.110 align:middle line:90%
literally like sonic booms.

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:51.430 align:middle line:84%
About two minutes after
the visual display was over

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:53.721 align:middle line:84%
because this happened pretty
high up in the atmosphere,

00:09:53.721 --> 00:09:56.620 align:middle line:84%
over 20 miles up, it took
that long for the sounds

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:57.630 align:middle line:90%
to propagate.

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:00.761 align:middle line:84%
And there were many
booms that were heard.

00:10:00.761 --> 00:10:02.510 align:middle line:84%
You're effectively
hearing the sonic booms

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:05.532 align:middle line:84%
from the main fragment
and its pieces traveling

00:10:05.532 --> 00:10:06.490 align:middle line:90%
through the atmosphere.

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:08.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you feel the
concussion of the sound?

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:09.846 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: If it's big enough.

00:10:09.846 --> 00:10:12.400 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in the
case of Chelyabinsk,

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.380 align:middle line:84%
you can tell how much you
could have felt that concussion

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.110 align:middle line:84%
by the windows
that were blown out

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:20.470 align:middle line:84%
and literally brick walls,
cinder block walls that

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:21.250 align:middle line:90%
were blown in.

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:25.360 align:middle line:84%
I saw video of garage
doors that were blown off

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.850 align:middle line:90%
the rails indoors, right?

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:30.690 align:middle line:84%
So people were blown
off their feet.

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:32.930 align:middle line:84%
Again, I saw videos of
people standing inside,

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:35.150 align:middle line:84%
the windows shattering
at them as they

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:37.180 align:middle line:84%
were blown to the floor
from that asteroid.

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:38.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So if it
were closer, it

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:40.460 align:middle line:84%
could have really
killed some people.

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:41.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: That was small object.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:41.723 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:10:41.723 --> 00:10:43.327 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: That was
a small object.

00:10:43.327 --> 00:10:45.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why can't we
detect 'em beyond that

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.100 align:middle line:84%
with all this kind of
technology that we have?

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And how long have we had
the near Earth tracking

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:51.790 align:middle line:90%
system going on?

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:53.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: Yeah, for
about a decade.

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:57.419 align:middle line:84%
You may remember back in
1994 Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9--

00:10:57.419 --> 00:10:57.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:58.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: --broke
up near Jupiter,

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:00.340 align:middle line:84%
and the fragments rained
into the atmosphere.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:00.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right into Jupiter.

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.401 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: That was
a real wake up call

00:11:02.401 --> 00:11:04.380 align:middle line:84%
for a lot of people,
especially Congress

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:07.350 align:middle line:84%
who finally took note that
these scars, these impact

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:09.020 align:middle line:84%
scars on the
atmosphere of Jupiter

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:11.050 align:middle line:90%
were as big as the planet Earth.

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:13.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, what
if those had hit us.

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.494 align:middle line:84%
So that was a wake up
call that things really

00:11:15.494 --> 00:11:17.160 align:middle line:84%
do happen in the solar
system like this.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.826 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
times, Daniel, have we

00:11:18.826 --> 00:11:23.100 align:middle line:84%
been hit over the course of
the existence of this planet?

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.644 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:11:24.644 --> 00:11:25.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Look up in the sky.

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:28.482 align:middle line:84%
Look at the cratered,
scarred surface of the moon.

00:11:28.482 --> 00:11:29.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's peppered.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: It's
peppered, absolutely

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:34.340 align:middle line:84%
bombarded with not just little
craters, I mean, huge impact

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:37.240 align:middle line:84%
basins, right, covering
half the face of the moon.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.270 align:middle line:84%
For every one of those
you see on the moon,

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:42.340 align:middle line:84%
you have to remember the Earth
is a bigger target in space,

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:46.704 align:middle line:84%
a bigger gravitational
attractor of passing objects.

00:11:46.704 --> 00:11:48.120 align:middle line:84%
For every one you
see on the moon,

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.435 align:middle line:90%
we were hit 20, 30, 40 times.

00:11:50.435 --> 00:11:53.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In that time
period, I always thought

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:57.260 align:middle line:84%
that the moon looked so
impacted as it was forming.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And that these asteroids
were everywhere,

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:04.040 align:middle line:84%
or does that just
show that you can

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.434 align:middle line:90%
get hit over billions of years?

00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:07.600 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Little bit of both.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.814 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the biggest scars
that we see on the moon

00:12:09.814 --> 00:12:11.480 align:middle line:84%
were formed shortly
after its formation.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.210 align:middle line:84%
In the several hundred million
years after the Earth formed,

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:14.997 align:middle line:90%
the moon formed.

00:12:14.997 --> 00:12:16.080 align:middle line:90%
We were hit the same way--

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.095 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And these asteroids
must have been everywhere.

00:12:17.095 --> 00:12:18.345 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: They were everywhere.

00:12:18.345 --> 00:12:23.180 align:middle line:84%
And what was happening is
the accretionary epoch,

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:25.221 align:middle line:84%
the planet-forming
epoch was tailing off.

00:12:25.221 --> 00:12:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And so we were sweeping
up all that debris

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:28.845 align:middle line:84%
and cleaning up the
solar system if you will.

00:12:28.845 --> 00:12:31.490 align:middle line:84%
We were big cosmic
vacuum cleaners.

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:33.960 align:middle line:84%
But, of course, there's
still material out there.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.730 align:middle line:84%
Asteroids are still
colliding to this day

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:38.540 align:middle line:84%
in the main asteroid belt
between Mars and Jupiter.

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:41.830 align:middle line:84%
That debris still finds its
way to the inner solar system

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:43.260 align:middle line:90%
even today, obviously.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And we are living
now in an epoch

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:49.002 align:middle line:84%
of kind of a slow, continuous
sweep up phase ever since.

00:12:49.002 --> 00:12:50.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we take
questions, too, from you

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:52.920 align:middle line:84%
here on Beyond Belief
with Dan Durda.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:54.785 align:middle line:90%
Who's got a question for Dan?

00:12:54.785 --> 00:12:55.660 align:middle line:90%
Just raise your hand.

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:56.240 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir?

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.476 align:middle line:90%
Right here.

00:12:57.476 --> 00:13:00.250 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I had a question,
like on the meteorite that

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:02.950 align:middle line:84%
exploded over
Russia, what causes

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:04.460 align:middle line:90%
them to explode like that?

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:06.000 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it wasn't an impact.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:06.625 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Right.

00:13:06.625 --> 00:13:07.580 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:09.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, in a way,
it was an impact.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.033 align:middle line:84%
It was an impact with
the atmosphere, right?

00:13:11.033 --> 00:13:13.490 align:middle line:84%
When these objects come
barreling into the-- you're

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:16.440 align:middle line:84%
going from the vacuum of
space into the dense lower

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.460 align:middle line:84%
atmosphere in a
matter of seconds.

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:23.372 align:middle line:84%
And from our perspective, this
air is not that big a problem,

00:13:23.372 --> 00:13:25.330 align:middle line:84%
but when you're coming
from the vacuum of space

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:27.659 align:middle line:84%
at those speeds, it's
like doing a belly flop

00:13:27.659 --> 00:13:29.200 align:middle line:84%
from a very high
diving board, right?

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.090 align:middle line:84%
You smack into that water,
and it makes quite an impact

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:32.780 align:middle line:90%
on you.

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:35.780 align:middle line:84%
So the dynamic
pressure of that entry

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:38.900 align:middle line:84%
is what actually
literally presses,

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:44.400 align:middle line:84%
squeezes on the meteoroid over
the course of just two or three

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.620 align:middle line:84%
seconds, going from nothing
to incredible forces.

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:50.060 align:middle line:84%
And that will crack
and split the object.

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:54.040 align:middle line:84%
As that happens, each
fragment that now comes off

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.450 align:middle line:84%
is all of a sudden
feeling its own forces

00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:59.650 align:middle line:84%
on it, which cracks
and splits that object.

00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:01.935 align:middle line:84%
And there's a kind
of a chain reaction

00:14:01.935 --> 00:14:03.730 align:middle line:84%
of cracking and
breaking that goes on

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:05.870 align:middle line:84%
within literally a
matter of split seconds.

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we effectively
see as an explosion.

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:10.460 align:middle line:84%
All that energy is now
coupled into the atmosphere

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:12.610 align:middle line:90%
in just a couple seconds.

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:15.190 align:middle line:84%
And from our perspective,
that's a big boom and explosion.

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:17.481 align:middle line:84%
The shock wave will actually
couple into the atmosphere

00:14:17.481 --> 00:14:18.634 align:middle line:90%
and propagate out.

00:14:18.634 --> 00:14:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's the big boom that
happened with the Chelyabinsk

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:22.690 align:middle line:90%
event.

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:25.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If these asteroids
have a different complexity,

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:29.021 align:middle line:84%
if some are more rock
than iron, or vice versa,

00:14:29.021 --> 00:14:31.520 align:middle line:84%
does that have anything to do
with what happens to them when

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:32.570 align:middle line:90%
they come into the atmosphere?

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:32.990 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Absolutely.

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:34.114 align:middle line:90%
It makes a huge difference.

00:14:34.114 --> 00:14:37.110 align:middle line:84%
In the case of the
Chelyabinsk object, as we saw,

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:39.587 align:middle line:84%
it broke up mostly in
the atmosphere like 20--

00:14:39.587 --> 00:14:40.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It disintegrated.

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:41.280 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: --miles up.

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:41.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:44.680 align:middle line:84%
Chunks fell on the ground,
but small pieces like that.

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.930 align:middle line:84%
An object about the same
size, maybe twice as big,

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:52.010 align:middle line:84%
but the point is it was
made out of iron in the case

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:55.840 align:middle line:84%
of the Meteor Crater impact
in Arizona 50, 000 years ago.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And there we see an object
not a whole lot larger

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.774 align:middle line:84%
made a mile wide crater in
the ground, big difference.

00:15:02.774 --> 00:15:03.815 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huge difference.

00:15:03.815 --> 00:15:05.986 align:middle line:84%
How about another
question for Dan Durda?

00:15:05.986 --> 00:15:07.360 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: With
George's mention

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:10.670 align:middle line:84%
of "Armageddon" in the
beginning of your introduction,

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:11.550 align:middle line:90%
it makes me wonder.

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:15.380 align:middle line:84%
If with early enough warning,
would we possibly, maybe

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:19.840 align:middle line:84%
be able to deflect, or deter, a
comet or some type of meteorite

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.197 align:middle line:90%
coming into the atmosphere?

00:15:21.197 --> 00:15:22.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Absolutely, absolutely.

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:24.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
hope, of course, is

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:26.330 align:middle line:84%
that, as we detect
more objects in space--

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:29.930 align:middle line:84%
that was the whole purpose
of the Spaceguard program

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:33.400 align:middle line:84%
that was started after the Comet
Shoemaker-Levy 9 impact was

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:37.930 align:middle line:84%
to actually survey the sky to
know the enemy, so to speak,

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:40.180 align:middle line:84%
to be ready for objects that
might actually impact us

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:42.800 align:middle line:84%
so that we can then actually
have a plan in place

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.290 align:middle line:84%
to go out and
prevent that impact.

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:47.330 align:middle line:84%
This is the one natural
disaster that we humans have

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:50.670 align:middle line:84%
in our power to be able to
actually prevent altogether.

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:54.980 align:middle line:84%
So how would you actually go out
and stop an asteroid like that?

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:55.950 align:middle line:90%
It depends on the size.

00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:56.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:57.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: If Mount Everest
is coming toward us,

00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry to tell you,
there's just nothing

00:15:59.180 --> 00:15:59.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're in trouble.

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:00.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: We're in trouble.

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:02.070 align:middle line:84%
We just don't have
the technology

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:02.630 align:middle line:84%
to deal with
something that large.

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:04.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And is that possible?

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:06.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: Well, it's
certainly possible.

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.080 align:middle line:84%
We thankfully, with
the Spaceguard survey,

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.700 align:middle line:84%
we have chalked off
most of the objects--

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:13.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Those big
ones, like a Apophis.

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:15.230 align:middle line:90%
How big is a Apophis?

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:19.074 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: Apophis is actually one
of the slightly smaller ones.

00:16:19.074 --> 00:16:21.490 align:middle line:84%
There are many more Apophis'
out there that we haven't yet

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:22.650 align:middle line:90%
discovered.

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:24.510 align:middle line:90%
It's the big dinosaur killers.

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:27.850 align:middle line:84%
We've now found pretty
much all of them.

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:30.392 align:middle line:84%
And so we don't stay up nights
worrying about those too much.

00:16:30.392 --> 00:16:32.766 align:middle line:84%
And we couldn't do anything
about something of that scale

00:16:32.766 --> 00:16:33.900 align:middle line:90%
anyway, quite frankly.

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:37.000 align:middle line:84%
But an Apophis-scale
object, maybe half a mile

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.940 align:middle line:84%
across or a quarter
mile across, something

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:42.670 align:middle line:84%
on that sort of size
scale, if found soon enough

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:44.600 align:middle line:84%
before potential
impact, we could

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.460 align:middle line:84%
think about actually
going out and nudging

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:48.856 align:middle line:90%
that object in some way.

00:16:48.856 --> 00:16:51.480 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do is change the
speed of an object typically--

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:52.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just a little bit, huh?

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: Yeah, if
it's 10 years out,

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:55.560 align:middle line:84%
20 years out from
impacting us, you just

00:16:55.560 --> 00:17:00.320 align:middle line:84%
change its speed by 0.02
miles per hour, right?

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.010 align:middle line:84%
That'll be enough
to cause what would

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:05.817 align:middle line:84%
have been an impact in the
future into a near miss.

00:17:05.817 --> 00:17:06.900 align:middle line:90%
That's all you have to do.

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:07.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:08.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: So you want
to go out there,

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:11.550 align:middle line:84%
and you want to change
the speed of that object.

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:15.040 align:middle line:84%
You can run a spacecraft
into the asteroid.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:19.359 align:middle line:84%
If it's a small enough asteroid,
you just fly a spacecraft--

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:20.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just collide it.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Just collide it.

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:22.710 align:middle line:90%
We've practiced that.

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:25.867 align:middle line:84%
The deep impact
mission was a mission

00:17:25.867 --> 00:17:27.950 align:middle line:84%
to a comet to study how
to make craters on comets.

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:29.810 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't meant to
practice this technique,

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:32.520 align:middle line:84%
but it certainly gave us a lot
of information on how to do it.

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:34.420 align:middle line:90%
So that's one we can do.

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:37.714 align:middle line:84%
We could go out and
tow an asteroid away.

00:17:37.714 --> 00:17:39.130 align:middle line:84%
You just take your
spacecraft, you

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:43.270 align:middle line:84%
park it next to the asteroid,
let the gravity of the two

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:45.330 align:middle line:84%
that would normally pull
each other together--

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:48.440 align:middle line:84%
if you keep your spacecraft
always just hovered off

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:51.940 align:middle line:84%
the surface of the asteroid,
that gravity that you normally

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:53.390 align:middle line:84%
would have let
just fall together,

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:55.300 align:middle line:84%
you're now letting
the spacecraft

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:56.680 align:middle line:90%
tow the asteroid along with it.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:57.700 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't take much.

00:17:57.700 --> 00:17:59.379 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you blow
it up with a nuke?

00:17:59.379 --> 00:18:00.420 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: You can do that.

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.489 align:middle line:84%
And that's sort of a
favorite Hollywood--

00:18:02.489 --> 00:18:04.155 align:middle line:84%
that's the "Armageddon"
approach, right,

00:18:04.155 --> 00:18:06.450 align:middle line:90%
the favorite Hollywood approach.

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:07.850 align:middle line:84%
You know, it would
actually work.

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:11.120 align:middle line:84%
For a small enough asteroid,
that would actually work.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:13.540 align:middle line:84%
It's not the preferred
approach because you still

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:16.240 align:middle line:84%
will have a lot of debris
coming toward the Earth

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:18.980 align:middle line:84%
if it's on an impact course, if
you don't get it early enough.

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.187 align:middle line:84%
And frankly, there
are a lot of folks

00:18:21.187 --> 00:18:23.270 align:middle line:84%
who just aren't too keen
on the idea of blowing up

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:24.311 align:middle line:90%
nuclear weapons in space.

00:18:24.311 --> 00:18:26.067 align:middle line:84%
That's another
deterrent in itself.

00:18:26.067 --> 00:18:28.150 align:middle line:84%
But probably the biggest
deterrent, quite frankly,

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:31.160 align:middle line:84%
aside from those sort
of philosophical issues

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:34.580 align:middle line:84%
is just the controlability
of something like that.

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:36.740 align:middle line:84%
The best techniques
are the ones where--

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:40.070 align:middle line:84%
the last thing you want to
do is to move an asteroid off

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:44.170 align:middle line:84%
of a collision course for
today, but have accidentally

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:46.440 align:middle line:84%
moved onto another collision
course for the future.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.690 align:middle line:84%
You want a very controllable
technique, right,

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:51.550 align:middle line:84%
something that's predictable,
something you can monitor.

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:54.772 align:middle line:84%
And a nuclear weapon is
kind of a pretty blunt--

00:18:54.772 --> 00:18:57.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and you can also
create other particles like

00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:58.352 align:middle line:90%
a shot gun--

00:18:58.352 --> 00:18:59.060 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Exactly.

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And all of a sudden
it scatters everywhere.

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:01.220 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Exactly.

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:03.380 align:middle line:84%
And here's the other problem
with something like that.

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:05.171 align:middle line:84%
If you don't catch it
early enough, if this

00:19:05.171 --> 00:19:08.370 align:middle line:84%
is your last minute, sort of
your last desperate attempt

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:11.894 align:middle line:84%
to prevent the impact, most of
the worst things with impacts

00:19:11.894 --> 00:19:13.310 align:middle line:84%
are the effects
in the atmosphere.

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:14.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:16.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: A typical
rocky asteroid

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:18.940 align:middle line:84%
is made out of-- we know
what that material is like.

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.273 align:middle line:90%
We have meteorites on the Earth.

00:19:20.273 --> 00:19:23.120 align:middle line:90%
We can study them pretty easily.

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.660 align:middle line:84%
We know that in
those objects which

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:28.440 align:middle line:84%
have their natural cosmic
abundance of elements

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.070 align:middle line:84%
like chlorine, and
bromine, and sulfur,

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:34.850 align:middle line:84%
there is enough ozone
destroying chlorine and bromine

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:39.190 align:middle line:84%
in a fairly large asteroid
to destroy the ozone layer.

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:41.907 align:middle line:84%
Now it doesn't matter if that
object comes in one impact.

00:19:41.907 --> 00:19:43.490 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
if that object comes

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:45.877 align:middle line:84%
in in one piece or
lots of little pieces.

00:19:45.877 --> 00:19:47.460 align:middle line:84%
All that chlorine
and bromine is still

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:48.980 align:middle line:90%
delivered into the atmosphere.

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.350 align:middle line:84%
So that's why you don't want
to do something like that.

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:52.595 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take one
more question for Dan Durda.

00:19:52.595 --> 00:19:53.640 align:middle line:90%
Who's got one?

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:54.970 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:57.422 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Is that a
question about there's

00:19:57.422 --> 00:19:59.500 align:middle line:84%
like a planet-killer
asteroid like coming

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:02.830 align:middle line:84%
in like 2026 or
2036, whatever it is?

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:04.467 align:middle line:84%
Is there any new
information on that?

00:20:04.467 --> 00:20:05.050 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Yeah.

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:08.930 align:middle line:84%
That's the asteroid Apophis
that George referred to.

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:12.190 align:middle line:84%
It's going to make a very close
approach to us in the year 2029

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:15.010 align:middle line:84%
on April 13th of all
things, Friday the 13th.

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:16.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, that's great.

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:17.379 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Figures, right?

00:20:17.379 --> 00:20:18.320 align:middle line:90%
It just figures.

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.040 align:middle line:84%
We know with absolute
certainty it's

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:23.290 align:middle line:84%
not going to hit us on
that particular approach.

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:24.960 align:middle line:84%
The orbit is tracked
precise enough

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:28.400 align:middle line:84%
with-- we have enough optical
telescopic observations

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.960 align:middle line:84%
of the object and
good radar pings

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.860 align:middle line:84%
off of the object, which
are a very good way

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:35.440 align:middle line:84%
to nail down where it is in
space and where it's going.

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:38.800 align:middle line:84%
So it won't hit us on that
date, but there was always

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:42.030 align:middle line:84%
this possibility that as it did
approach the Earth-- of course,

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Earth's gravity is going
to bend the path of that

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:46.220 align:middle line:90%
asteroid as it passes near us.

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And there was always
the possibility

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:51.150 align:middle line:84%
that depending on exactly
how that path was bent,

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:54.020 align:middle line:84%
it could set up another
potential impact

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:56.570 align:middle line:90%
seven years later in 2036.

00:20:56.570 --> 00:21:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And that was hanging
in there at the sort

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:04.000 align:middle line:84%
of one in a few hundred,
one in a few thousand

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.520 align:middle line:90%
sort of possible odds.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:09.240 align:middle line:84%
After this last
close approach, we've

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:11.490 align:middle line:84%
been able to refine
the orbit well enough

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:13.870 align:middle line:84%
to know that we're down
into the noise level

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:16.120 align:middle line:84%
now of potential impact
for that particular event.

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:17.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do computers do that?

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:18.869 align:middle line:84%
Is that how we
create this model--

00:21:18.869 --> 00:21:19.410 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Yes.

00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:20.451 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --by a computer?

00:21:20.451 --> 00:21:22.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Yes, absolutely.

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:24.350 align:middle line:84%
Through optical and
radar observations,

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:26.700 align:middle line:84%
you track the position
of the object with time.

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And that allows you to
then propagate forward

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:30.470 align:middle line:84%
where that object is
going to be in the future,

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:31.850 align:middle line:84%
accounting for the
gravity of the Earth--

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:33.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how
accurate is all that?

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: It's
accurate enough to be

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:41.100 align:middle line:84%
able to track these things out
for like centuries to come.

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:43.857 align:middle line:84%
But you get beyond about
maybe 100 or 200 years

00:21:43.857 --> 00:21:45.440 align:middle line:84%
for most of these
objects-- especially

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.760 align:middle line:84%
the smaller ones where
the action of sunlight

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:51.530 align:middle line:84%
is important in determining its
future motion because sunlight

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:53.800 align:middle line:84%
will push on these
objects, right?

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And it pushes on
the objects in ways

00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:00.000 align:middle line:84%
that are dependent on its
exact shape, and size,

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.590 align:middle line:90%
and the color patterns on it.

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:05.050 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know that detail
for most of these objects

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:05.640 align:middle line:90%
very well.

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:08.599 align:middle line:84%
And so at that limit, beyond
about 100 or 200 years,

00:22:08.599 --> 00:22:10.640 align:middle line:84%
the biggest uncertainty
in where those things are

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:11.910 align:middle line:84%
going in the future
after that is

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:13.250 align:middle line:90%
how sunlight's acting on them.

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:14.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Strange.

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:16.160 align:middle line:90%
What an interesting science.

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:20.740 align:middle line:84%
They say that the event
that wiped out the dinosaurs

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:25.360 align:middle line:84%
65 million years ago might have
been a comet, not an asteroid.

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:26.240 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Yeah.

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:29.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do they keep
kicking that back and forth?

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:32.934 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: Because we know
roughly the energy involved

00:22:32.934 --> 00:22:33.600 align:middle line:90%
with the impact.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:37.560 align:middle line:84%
We have the hole in the ground
in Mexico in the Yucatan.

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:39.249 align:middle line:84%
But you can make a
hole in the ground

00:22:39.249 --> 00:22:41.040 align:middle line:84%
of this size in a couple
of different ways.

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.390 align:middle line:84%
You can have a relatively
large object impacting

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:47.179 align:middle line:84%
at a lower speed
or a smaller object

00:22:47.179 --> 00:22:49.220 align:middle line:84%
impacting at a higher
speed and get the same hole

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:49.803 align:middle line:90%
in the ground.

00:22:49.803 --> 00:22:51.700 align:middle line:84%
All we have is the
hole in the ground now.

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And so the uncertainty
comes from modeling

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:56.320 align:middle line:84%
out the conditions
that will form

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:57.720 align:middle line:84%
a crater of that
particular size.

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And you can do that with
larger, slower-moving asteroids

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:05.250 align:middle line:84%
or potentially a smaller,
but faster moving comet.

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:07.580 align:middle line:84%
Comets will impact the Earth
typically at higher speeds

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:08.830 align:middle line:90%
than the asteroids do.

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:12.140 align:middle line:84%
Asteroids moving around
in the population near us

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:14.356 align:middle line:84%
have orbits that are
kind of similar to ours.

00:23:14.356 --> 00:23:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And the crossing
speeds when they

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:17.210 align:middle line:90%
hit us are a little bit lower.

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Typical asteroids are going
to hit us at speeds of 40,000

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:23.450 align:middle line:90%
or 50,000 miles an hour.

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:25.800 align:middle line:84%
Comets come from the
outer solar system.

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And so when they pass through
the inner solar system,

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:30.000 align:middle line:84%
their crossing speed
is a lot higher.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.690 align:middle line:84%
It can be three or four
times higher than that.

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:32.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:34.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: And as
the speed goes up,

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:36.320 align:middle line:84%
the energy goes up
exponentially with that.

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:38.390 align:middle line:10%
So the uncertainty
comes from that.

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:40.270 align:middle line:10%
There's one clue
we have as to what

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:44.600 align:middle line:10%
actually hit us 65
million years ago.

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.700 align:middle line:84%
There have been a number
of drill cores made

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:48.830 align:middle line:84%
all around the world
to try to pierce

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:51.432 align:middle line:84%
that portion, that
layer of debris--

00:23:51.432 --> 00:23:52.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of that time period?

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: --from
that time period.

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.415 align:middle line:84%
Well, there was
a drill core made

00:23:55.415 --> 00:23:57.614 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of
the Pacific Ocean.

00:23:57.614 --> 00:23:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And these drills
are not that big.

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:01.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're talking
about a little area of drill

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:02.440 align:middle line:84%
going down into the
ocean, that big.

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.856 align:middle line:84%
Well, would you
believe it or not?

00:24:03.856 --> 00:24:05.850 align:middle line:84%
By chance, the one
drill core happened

00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:10.286 align:middle line:84%
to pull up an actual fragment
of the asteroid itself

00:24:10.286 --> 00:24:11.910 align:middle line:84%
that was ejected out
in the crater that

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:13.120 align:middle line:90%
came down in the debris layer.

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:13.661 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:24:13.661 --> 00:24:17.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: We have a fragment, a
piece of the actual impactor.

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:22.270 align:middle line:84%
It really does look sort of
like a weak, rocky asteroid.

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:24.260 align:middle line:84%
But really, quite
frankly, we don't

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:26.990 align:middle line:84%
have any big samples like
that of comets either.

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:28.640 align:middle line:84%
And so it could be
a similar material.

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.660 align:middle line:84%
A comet could be made of
something very similar.

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:32.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was it
water at the time?

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:33.820 align:middle line:90%
It is now where it hit.

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:34.819 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: In the Yucatan?

00:24:34.819 --> 00:24:37.540 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it was at the time a
shallow sea, probably 300 feet

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:38.350 align:middle line:90%
deep or so.

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:41.790 align:middle line:84%
Now from the perspective
of that was a Mount Everest

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:42.690 align:middle line:90%
size asteroid, right?

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:43.830 align:middle line:84%
This was, you know,
ten kilometers.

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:44.775 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They must
have thrown water

00:24:44.775 --> 00:24:45.830 align:middle line:84%
up in the air and
everything, right?

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:46.770 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Oh, absolutely.

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:49.186 align:middle line:84%
From the perspective of a Mount
Everest, 300 feet of water

00:24:49.186 --> 00:24:49.930 align:middle line:90%
is not that much.

00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:52.388 align:middle line:84%
It didn't even see the water
in terms of the impact itself,

00:24:52.388 --> 00:24:53.820 align:middle line:90%
but the water did react.

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:56.040 align:middle line:10%
And all through
the Gulf of Mexico,

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:57.870 align:middle line:10%
enormous tsunamis were created.

00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:02.530 align:middle line:10%
It made the event in Southeast
Asia in 2004 look like nothing.

00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:04.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dwarfed it.

00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:06.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: We know that happened
because we can see tsunami

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:11.150 align:middle line:84%
deposits as far inland as
the Brazos River in Texas.

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And we can see debris
in the Gulf Coast

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:17.920 align:middle line:84%
in the sediments in the Gulf of
Mexico that came from inland.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:20.940 align:middle line:84%
The waves washed inland
and pulled debris

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:23.020 align:middle line:84%
from hundreds of miles
inland back out to sea

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:25.310 align:middle line:84%
and deposited them in
a very chaotic mess

00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:28.636 align:middle line:90%
of stuff, so nasty event.

00:25:28.636 --> 00:25:30.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You wanted
to be an astronaut?

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:33.262 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Yeah, I still do.

00:25:33.262 --> 00:25:34.970 align:middle line:84%
Who all would like to
go to space, right?

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:37.712 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what a great view.

00:25:37.712 --> 00:25:40.170 align:middle line:84%
Working for a lot of years, I
applied to the NASA astronaut

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:42.670 align:middle line:90%
program for a lot of years.

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And actually in 2004 made the
final cut, the final selection

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:51.580 align:middle line:84%
to go to Houston and
interview for the job.

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:54.500 align:middle line:84%
Missed it by that much
as Don Adams used to say.

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:56.800 align:middle line:84%
But when you have 99
people to interview

00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:59.660 align:middle line:84%
and only 12 slots for the
job, those are the odds.

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:00.650 align:middle line:90%
But I'm going anyway.

00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:01.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, you are?

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:02.011 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about this.

00:26:02.011 --> 00:26:05.600 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: There's a revolution
in cheap, low cost,

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:08.520 align:middle line:84%
very frequent access to space
that's happening out there.

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:11.280 align:middle line:84%
Virgin Galactic, right,
Richard Branson's company.

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.940 align:middle line:84%
XCOR Aerospace,
SpaceX, Blue Origin,

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:16.080 align:middle line:84%
there are a number of
commercial companies

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:21.010 align:middle line:84%
that are right now, as we
speak, test flying vehicles

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:26.380 align:middle line:84%
to fly us in space, right,
all of us, everyday folks.

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very fortunate
in my research position,

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:33.052 align:middle line:84%
my job, my day job
to have a few tickets

00:26:33.052 --> 00:26:34.760 align:middle line:84%
on a couple of these
vehicles to actually

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:35.718 align:middle line:90%
fly in space next year.

00:26:35.718 --> 00:26:37.007 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you nervous?

00:26:37.007 --> 00:26:38.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: I'm realistic about it.

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:40.187 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, this is dangerous.

00:26:40.187 --> 00:26:41.270 align:middle line:90%
There's no doubt about it.

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:42.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is dangerous.

00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:44.779 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: These companies are
doing a really great job,

00:26:44.779 --> 00:26:49.620 align:middle line:84%
though, at trying to make
this as safe as practically

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:50.960 align:middle line:90%
can be made safe, right?

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:52.354 align:middle line:90%
Nothing in life is safe.

00:26:52.354 --> 00:26:54.270 align:middle line:84%
You took a risk driving
in the car here today.

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:55.103 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:26:55.103 --> 00:26:58.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: But these companies
are doing a really good job

00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:00.210 align:middle line:90%
at being as safe as they can.

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:02.350 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, you do
have to acknowledge.

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:04.800 align:middle line:84%
You're doing the Wile E.
Coyote, strap a rocket

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:07.360 align:middle line:84%
to your rear end, and being
launched out of the atmosphere,

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:07.860 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:09.276 align:middle line:84%
So there's no
getting around that.

00:27:09.276 --> 00:27:11.390 align:middle line:90%
But I wouldn't say nervous.

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:13.451 align:middle line:84%
I am realistic about
what's going to happen.

00:27:13.451 --> 00:27:15.700 align:middle line:84%
But more than that, I am
looking forward to that view.

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:15.860 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be amazing.

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:17.505 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long
will you be up there?

00:27:17.505 --> 00:27:19.254 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: This is the
Alan Shepard special.

00:27:19.254 --> 00:27:22.410 align:middle line:84%
Most of these companies,
Virgin Galactic-- yeah.

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:24.649 align:middle line:84%
These are the
suborbital flights.

00:27:24.649 --> 00:27:26.190 align:middle line:84%
You're launched out
of the atmosphere

00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:30.000 align:middle line:84%
typically at about mach
three sort of speeds, 3

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.204 align:middle line:90%
and a half g's on the way up.

00:27:32.204 --> 00:27:33.870 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be
lofted out of the top

00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:35.500 align:middle line:84%
of the atmosphere
for about three

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:38.180 align:middle line:84%
or four minutes over the top
of this nice ballistic arc--

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:38.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:43.505 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: 0 g, reenter the
atmosphere, six g's, mach

00:27:43.505 --> 00:27:45.170 align:middle line:84%
three and a half on
the way back down.

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:46.628 align:middle line:84%
But you're going
to be high enough.

00:27:46.628 --> 00:27:50.500 align:middle line:84%
You're up at those altitudes,
oh, 135 kilometers up, 360,

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:52.210 align:middle line:90%
000 feet.

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:54.180 align:middle line:84%
You're going to see the
curvature of the Earth.

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:55.320 align:middle line:90%
The sky will be pitch black.

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:55.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, wow.

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:58.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: You'll have that little
thin blue ribbon of atmosphere.

00:27:58.670 --> 00:27:59.878 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be spectacular.

00:27:59.878 --> 00:28:02.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For one
moment, one split moment

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:03.937 align:middle line:84%
you get as close to God
as you've ever been.

00:28:03.937 --> 00:28:05.270 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Absolutely, absolutely.

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, it's
astronaut wings time.

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:10.006 align:middle line:84%
Formally by international
agreement, anything over 328,

00:28:10.006 --> 00:28:11.950 align:middle line:90%
000 feet is space.

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:13.196 align:middle line:90%
So get your astronaut wings.

00:28:13.196 --> 00:28:15.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And will the
craft come back intact,

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:16.350 align:middle line:90%
or do you come back in a--

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:18.933 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: Well, I hope so because
I'm going to be inside of it.

00:28:18.933 --> 00:28:19.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:21.476 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So there's no
parachute capsule, huh?

00:28:21.476 --> 00:28:24.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: Well, there actually
are a lot of different designs.

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:26.670 align:middle line:84%
The Virgin Galactic
vehicle, SpaceShipTwo,

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:31.780 align:middle line:84%
is this really brilliant design,
this shuttlecock sort of design

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:33.880 align:middle line:90%
where it's the carefree reentry.

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.440 align:middle line:84%
Unlike the space
shuttle which had

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:39.379 align:middle line:84%
to be very carefully
oriented for its reentry,

00:28:39.379 --> 00:28:41.295 align:middle line:84%
SpaceShipTwo can come
down in any orientation,

00:28:41.295 --> 00:28:45.622 align:middle line:84%
and it will self-right itself
to settle into the atmosphere.

00:28:45.622 --> 00:28:47.580 align:middle line:84%
Other companies have
different designs, though.

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:48.750 align:middle line:90%
Some are winged vehicles.

00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:50.800 align:middle line:90%
Some are capsules.

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:52.690 align:middle line:84%
But there's enough
of them out there

00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:55.800 align:middle line:84%
that we're all-- the price
will come down to the point

00:28:55.800 --> 00:29:01.080 align:middle line:84%
where-- I tell people save
for a very extravagant family

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:03.310 align:middle line:90%
vacation to Europe, right?

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:06.102 align:middle line:84%
By the time you've saved
to that level of money,

00:29:06.102 --> 00:29:08.560 align:middle line:84%
the ticket prices are going to
be at the prices where you--

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because they're
pretty high right now?

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:14.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: It's kind of like
when the first big flat screen

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.292 align:middle line:90%
TVs came out, right?

00:29:15.292 --> 00:29:17.000 align:middle line:84%
You and I couldn't
afford them, but there

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.460 align:middle line:90%
were people who could.

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:21.537 align:middle line:84%
And those people who bought
them created the market

00:29:21.537 --> 00:29:23.620 align:middle line:84%
to have more of them made,
which may them cheaper.

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:25.357 align:middle line:84%
And then now, you
know, you go to--

00:29:25.357 --> 00:29:26.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Now they're disposable.

00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:27.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: Now they're
almost disposable.

00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:30.360 align:middle line:84%
And space flight is going
to get to that point too.

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And what's going to be
remarkable about that

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:37.409 align:middle line:84%
is it's not just going to be
the sort of military test pilot

00:29:37.409 --> 00:29:38.950 align:middle line:84%
sort of folks that
have traditionally

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:40.350 align:middle line:90%
flown in space, right?

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:43.810 align:middle line:84%
As wonderful and diverse as
that population of people is,

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:48.750 align:middle line:84%
it's not the poets, the artists,
the radio and television hosts,

00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:49.390 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:51.360 align:middle line:84%
When you get the
chance to fly in space,

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.110 align:middle line:84%
it's going to
bring a perspective

00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:55.280 align:middle line:84%
to everybody else that's
going to be different

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:56.410 align:middle line:90%
than we've had before.

00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:58.076 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
going to be remarkable

00:29:58.076 --> 00:29:59.910 align:middle line:84%
about this democratization
of space flight.

00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:01.743 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've definitely
got to wire you up

00:30:01.743 --> 00:30:04.510 align:middle line:84%
on the day you go up there,
so we can either get you live

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:07.250 align:middle line:84%
or on tape explaining
what it's like.

00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:09.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: There'd be a lot
of ooo's and ahh's I'm sure.

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:11.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have
to train much for this?

00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:14.020 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Well, yes and no.

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:16.590 align:middle line:84%
If you're going as a tourist
to go and fly and have fun,

00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:18.040 align:middle line:90%
it's very minimal training.

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:19.340 align:middle line:90%
I mean, really very minimal.

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:21.631 align:middle line:84%
You'll want to have some
familiarization with what it's

00:30:21.631 --> 00:30:24.550 align:middle line:84%
going to feel like, maybe a spin
in a centrifuge might be good,

00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:27.270 align:middle line:84%
maybe a flight on the
zero gravity aircraft,

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:29.290 align:middle line:84%
which is not that
expensive at all.

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:31.980 align:middle line:84%
Might be good, but you don't
have to do those things.

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:32.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do a job.

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:34.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm going there to
actually do research.

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:37.210 align:middle line:84%
These vehicles are going to
be wonderful opportunities

00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:40.920 align:middle line:84%
for space scientists
to get out to the field

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:43.700 align:middle line:84%
to do their research and their
work the same way botanists

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:45.760 align:middle line:84%
and geologists go
out to the field now.

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:45.984 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
you going to do?

00:30:45.984 --> 00:30:46.540 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell us?

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:47.623 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:30:47.623 --> 00:30:50.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be flying a--
I'm interested in asteroids,

00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:51.140 align:middle line:90%
obviously right?

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:53.270 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to be
taking advantage

00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:56.620 align:middle line:84%
of those very low gravity
conditions like the very

00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:59.450 align:middle line:84%
low gravity conditions on
most of these small asteroids

00:30:59.450 --> 00:31:02.540 align:middle line:84%
to study the rocks, the
soil, simulants of the rocks

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:05.450 align:middle line:84%
and soil on the surface
of these things.

00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:06.470 align:middle line:90%
So I have work to do.

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:07.560 align:middle line:84%
And so the training
is a little bit more.

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:09.601 align:middle line:84%
I want to make sure that
I'm able to do that job.

00:31:09.601 --> 00:31:12.590 align:middle line:84%
So I've been flying jets,
and doing centrifuge runs,

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:15.461 align:middle line:84%
and pressure suit runs in the
centrifuge, and zero gravity

00:31:15.461 --> 00:31:15.960 align:middle line:90%
flights.

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:19.110 align:middle line:84%
I had a zero gravity flight
just three weeks ago.

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:22.670 align:middle line:84%
So I'm spending time to be
ready so that when I'm flying

00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:25.810 align:middle line:84%
and that view out the window
and those sensations are not

00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:28.380 align:middle line:84%
the first time I've seen that,
or heard that, and felt that.

00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:30.255 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many people
will go up with you?

00:31:30.255 --> 00:31:31.740 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Depends on the vehicle.

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:36.006 align:middle line:84%
The Virgin Galactic vehicle
is a 8-person vehicle,

00:31:36.006 --> 00:31:38.410 align:middle line:84%
two Virgin Galactic
pilots in the front,

00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:41.197 align:middle line:90%
and six passengers in the back.

00:31:41.197 --> 00:31:43.280 align:middle line:84%
When I fly with XCOR
Aerospace, on the other hand,

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:45.490 align:middle line:84%
in their Lynx
vehicle, it's just me

00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:47.170 align:middle line:84%
and the pilot
sitting in the front.

00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:47.910 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:48.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:50.695 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: In fact, the pilot
I'll be flying next to,

00:31:50.695 --> 00:31:53.490 align:middle line:84%
I've flown with in F18s in the
past, a former space shuttle

00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:54.126 align:middle line:90%
commander.

00:31:54.126 --> 00:31:55.750 align:middle line:84%
So I will get to fly
to space with him.

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:56.355 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's exciting.

00:31:56.355 --> 00:31:56.670 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Yeah.

00:31:56.670 --> 00:31:57.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know,
I've talked to a lot

00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.500 align:middle line:90%
of astronauts over the years.

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:02.030 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
they would ever

00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:03.330 align:middle line:90%
have traded that experience.

00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:03.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: No.

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:05.176 align:middle line:90%
No, it's going to be unique.

00:32:05.176 --> 00:32:07.300 align:middle line:84%
I've done a lot of the
elements, but obviously I've

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:08.290 align:middle line:90%
not yet had that view.

00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:09.370 align:middle line:90%
And I can't wait.

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think what's going to be
magic about that is the ability

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:15.690 align:middle line:84%
to come back and
share that with people

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:18.010 align:middle line:84%
and encourage more folks
to get to go and do that.

00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what's so
magic about this commercial

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:23.327 align:middle line:84%
space flight, personalization of
space flight revolution that's

00:32:23.327 --> 00:32:25.410 align:middle line:84%
happening is that more and
more everyday folks are

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:26.222 align:middle line:90%
going to get to go.

00:32:26.222 --> 00:32:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And when that
happens, I think it's

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:28.750 align:middle line:84%
going to make space
that much more

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:29.916 align:middle line:90%
relevant to a lot of people.

00:32:29.916 --> 00:32:33.231 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to have
that many more just amazing,

00:32:33.231 --> 00:32:34.730 align:middle line:84%
beautiful experiences
that are going

00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:37.170 align:middle line:84%
to be related from folks
with different backgrounds.

00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to think of
a lot of different things

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.200 align:middle line:84%
to do in space we never
conceived of before

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:42.914 align:middle line:90%
because of that.

00:32:42.914 --> 00:32:44.955 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wonder if it'll
change any perspective

00:32:44.955 --> 00:32:46.280 align:middle line:90%
that you have right now.

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:46.670 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: I hope it does.

00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:47.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I bet it will.

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:48.240 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: I hope it does.

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:50.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
see the awe of that,

00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:51.910 align:middle line:84%
it's got to have
some effect on you.

00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:52.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Absolutely.

00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:54.220 align:middle line:84%
You've talked to a
lot of astronauts.

00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:54.880 align:middle line:90%
I've talked a lot.

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:56.921 align:middle line:84%
You see in their eyes the
way they talk about it.

00:32:56.921 --> 00:32:58.380 align:middle line:84%
That view from
space really changes

00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:01.000 align:middle line:84%
the way you think about
our planet that we live on,

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.710 align:middle line:84%
ourselves, how we relate
to people, a lot of borders

00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:06.701 align:middle line:84%
disappear, a lot of
petty differences

00:33:06.701 --> 00:33:08.450 align:middle line:84%
disappear when you've
had that experience.

00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:09.830 align:middle line:84%
I think if more
people have that,

00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:10.954 align:middle line:90%
it'll only be a good thing.

00:33:10.954 --> 00:33:14.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And are we doing
this as a group of nations,

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:18.360 align:middle line:84%
or are all these nations
going to do it on their own?

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:21.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: At the moment, it's
a group of commercial entities

00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:23.530 align:middle line:84%
based primarily
here in the States,

00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:25.030 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't have
to be that way.

00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And already these
companies have agreements

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:30.730 align:middle line:84%
with nations around the
planet, Saudi Arabia,

00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:33.090 align:middle line:84%
Kursow up in Sweden
to do flights.

00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And so that will be something
that could and should

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:37.270 align:middle line:90%
have global reach.

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:40.200 align:middle line:84%
I think that ultimately
is the hope and the goal.

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: NASA says we're
not going back to the moon.

00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:45.939 align:middle line:84%
Other countries may,
private companies may.

00:33:45.939 --> 00:33:47.980 align:middle line:84%
I think that's probably
the way it's going to go.

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:49.605 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: I hope that's
the way it goes.

00:33:49.605 --> 00:33:53.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, NASA's role is to go
out there and really press

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:58.010 align:middle line:84%
the frontier to get-- I
mean, commercial entities

00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:00.120 align:middle line:84%
want to have a return for
their investment, right?

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:01.184 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes pushing--

00:34:01.184 --> 00:34:03.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's why
they're doing this, right?

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:04.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: That's why
they're doing it.

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:06.252 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes pushing
those bits of the frontier,

00:34:06.252 --> 00:34:07.751 align:middle line:84%
there's no immediate
commercial gain

00:34:07.751 --> 00:34:09.310 align:middle line:84%
to be made from
things like that.

00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:11.719 align:middle line:84%
There are obvious reasons
to go and do these things,

00:34:11.719 --> 00:34:13.725 align:middle line:84%
but that immediate
financial return

00:34:13.725 --> 00:34:14.850 align:middle line:90%
may not be there sometimes.

00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:17.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
proper role of NASA

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:20.429 align:middle line:84%
and government agencies to
go and press those frontiers.

00:34:20.429 --> 00:34:22.250 align:middle line:90%
And that's what NASA does best.

00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:25.679 align:middle line:84%
What we should be then doing is
letting NASA do that part best

00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:29.159 align:middle line:84%
and not spending NASA's precious
funds on the more mundane

00:34:29.159 --> 00:34:31.719 align:middle line:84%
things that commercial companies
can go out there and do just

00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:33.730 align:middle line:84%
as well and perhaps
even better, and then

00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:35.620 align:middle line:84%
make more efficient
and more cheap.

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
proper mix of the two

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:38.859 align:middle line:90%
together is the way to do it.

00:34:38.859 --> 00:34:39.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's exciting.

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:40.699 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: It's going to be fun.

00:34:40.699 --> 00:34:41.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's exciting.

00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:43.070 align:middle line:90%
What's fueling all of this?

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:45.239 align:middle line:84%
Technology changing
faster and faster?

00:34:45.239 --> 00:34:47.916 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Yeah, it's technology.

00:34:47.916 --> 00:34:50.620 align:middle line:84%
The press for the commercial
spaceflight really,

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:52.530 align:middle line:84%
quite frankly, was
adventure tourism.

00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:56.179 align:middle line:84%
That was the cork loosening
from the bottle initially.

00:34:56.179 --> 00:35:00.820 align:middle line:84%
The technology came
from visionary people

00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:05.570 align:middle line:84%
like Burt Rutan and
Richard Branson who

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:08.950 align:middle line:84%
just had the vision, who dared
to dream, to take the risk,

00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:11.885 align:middle line:84%
put their own personal
financial fortunes in investing

00:35:11.885 --> 00:35:12.760 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:15.093 align:middle line:84%
And that's what it takes
sometimes to crack that barrier

00:35:15.093 --> 00:35:17.300 align:middle line:84%
and make it all spill
forth, which we see.

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.804 align:middle line:84%
There's a pent up
want to go to space

00:35:19.804 --> 00:35:20.970 align:middle line:90%
and to have that experience.

00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And the adventure tourism
motivation I think

00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:26.840 align:middle line:90%
was the primary origin of that.

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And we're now at
the capability--

00:35:28.610 --> 00:35:30.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
someone like Bob Bigalow

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:32.030 align:middle line:90%
and his sending up pods?

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And eventually isn't he going to
build a hotel up their sort of?

00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:37.120 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:38.940 align:middle line:84%
Maybe even coupling
with Dennis Tito

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:42.830 align:middle line:84%
who wants to go to Mars, right,
The Inspiration Mars mission?

00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:48.870 align:middle line:84%
Inflatable capsules,
inflatable modules like this

00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:51.740 align:middle line:84%
are a pretty efficient way
to launch things, right?

00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And you could put bases
like that on the moon.

00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:56.350 align:middle line:90%
People think inflatable?

00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:57.810 align:middle line:84%
You're out in the
vacuum of space, right?

00:35:57.810 --> 00:35:58.830 align:middle line:90%
What if it pops like a balloon?

00:35:58.830 --> 00:35:59.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I know it.

00:35:59.340 --> 00:35:59.840 align:middle line:90%
Scary.

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:00.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: It doesn't
work that way actually.

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:01.445 align:middle line:90%
These are very--

00:36:01.445 --> 00:36:02.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're thick.

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Well, they're thick.

00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:04.360 align:middle line:84%
But even if you
punch a hole-- you

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:06.890 align:middle line:84%
can punch a hole in the space
station the size of a pencil.

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:09.260 align:middle line:84%
The space station
has the ability

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:13.420 align:middle line:84%
to pump and create
enough air to deal

00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:16.470 align:middle line:84%
with that for many,
many, many minutes

00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:19.700 align:middle line:84%
until you can go and pop a
piece of duct tape over the hole

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:21.901 align:middle line:84%
and then stem that tide
until you can figure out

00:36:21.901 --> 00:36:22.900 align:middle line:90%
a more permanent repair.

00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:25.427 align:middle line:84%
It's not as disastrous
as the Hollywood movies

00:36:25.427 --> 00:36:26.510 align:middle line:90%
want to make it out to be.

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:28.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you don't clearly want
to go around popping holes

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:30.430 align:middle line:84%
in your spacecraft,
but it can be done.

00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:31.607 align:middle line:90%
And you can deal with it.

00:36:31.607 --> 00:36:33.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you imagine what
room service would cost up

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:34.660 align:middle line:90%
there?

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:36.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: I don't know if you'll
get the 30 minutes or free like

00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:37.761 align:middle line:90%
some companies advertise, but--

00:36:37.761 --> 00:36:38.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:40.950 align:middle line:84%
As you look into
space-- I mean, you're

00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:43.340 align:middle line:84%
a planetary
scientist-- you've got

00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:46.247 align:middle line:84%
to have thought about
extraterrestrial life.

00:36:46.247 --> 00:36:46.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Yeah.

00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:48.450 align:middle line:84%
That's what got me in
this field to start with.

00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:50.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That we cannot
be alone in the universe.

00:36:50.410 --> 00:36:50.745 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Yeah.

00:36:50.745 --> 00:36:51.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:52.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
your thoughts on that?

00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:54.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: That's what got me in
the field in the first place.

00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:56.750 align:middle line:84%
It was a fascination
with this vision

00:36:56.750 --> 00:37:01.700 align:middle line:84%
that we live in a cosmos that's
filled to the brim with planets

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:05.360 align:middle line:84%
of all variety, and the great
stage for the play of life

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:07.630 align:middle line:90%
that those planets can offer.

00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:11.240 align:middle line:90%


00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:16.020 align:middle line:84%
Not speaking as a scientist,
just as a human being,

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:19.810 align:middle line:84%
I think it just means we're in
a universe filled with life.

00:37:19.810 --> 00:37:24.440 align:middle line:84%
To paraphrase the movie
"Contact," if it is just us,

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:25.940 align:middle line:84%
what an awful waste
of space, right?

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:26.773 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:37:26.773 --> 00:37:27.820 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And do you ever try to
answer that question?

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:32.300 align:middle line:90%
What's it all about?

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:33.420 align:middle line:90%
Why are we here?

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:36.086 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: In a sense, that's what
the whole enterprise of science

00:37:36.086 --> 00:37:39.300 align:middle line:84%
is all about is just a
different approach to answering

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:41.100 align:middle line:84%
those big questions,
exactly that question.

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:41.933 align:middle line:90%
What's it all about?

00:37:41.933 --> 00:37:42.760 align:middle line:90%
Why are we here?

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.320 align:middle line:90%
How did we get here?

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:47.944 align:middle line:84%
Human beings ask those
questions and approach answers

00:37:47.944 --> 00:37:49.860 align:middle line:84%
to those questions in a
lot of different ways.

00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And science is just another
vehicle to get there.

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:54.230 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we do every day.

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:57.395 align:middle line:84%
And that's the fun of
the job is, in a sense,

00:37:57.395 --> 00:37:59.020 align:middle line:84%
never growing up,
right, because that's

00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:01.550 align:middle line:84%
what children do all the
time is ask those questions.

00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:04.670 align:middle line:84%
And, in a lot of
ways, scientists

00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:06.910 align:middle line:84%
are kids who just never grew
up and are lucky enough,

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:11.400 align:middle line:84%
fortunate enough to get
to work at just asking

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:14.010 align:middle line:84%
those questions all the
time, and thinking of tests,

00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:18.926 align:middle line:84%
and detective stories
of how to get in there

00:38:18.926 --> 00:38:20.050 align:middle line:90%
and answer those questions.

00:38:20.050 --> 00:38:21.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It drives
us, doesn't it?

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:21.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: It does.

00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:22.199 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:38:22.199 --> 00:38:25.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's a great privilege
to be in a position

00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:26.374 align:middle line:90%
to do that as a job.

00:38:26.374 --> 00:38:28.373 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take some
more questions from you

00:38:28.373 --> 00:38:29.970 align:middle line:84%
for Dan Durda here
on Beyond Belief.

00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:31.180 align:middle line:90%
Who has got one for us?

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:31.954 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir?

00:38:31.954 --> 00:38:32.870 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: All right.

00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:35.729 align:middle line:84%
So I'm curious-- you
mentioned how difficult it

00:38:35.729 --> 00:38:37.520 align:middle line:84%
is to spot some of
these smaller asteroids.

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And visually, are we using more
radar technology to do that?

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.680 align:middle line:84%
Where does radar
technology play in,

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:49.145 align:middle line:84%
and is there room for
improvement there?

00:38:49.145 --> 00:38:50.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: Yeah,
absolutely, right.

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:52.436 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
techniques and technologies

00:38:52.436 --> 00:38:54.105 align:middle line:90%
we can throw at that problem.

00:38:54.105 --> 00:38:55.730 align:middle line:84%
Traditionally, we've
done it optically.

00:38:55.730 --> 00:39:00.930 align:middle line:84%
We've looked with visible light
telescopes into the night sky.

00:39:00.930 --> 00:39:04.176 align:middle line:84%
You find little dots of light
moving in the sky that way.

00:39:04.176 --> 00:39:06.300 align:middle line:84%
There are other techniques
that are very efficient.

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:08.950 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that one of
the most efficient ways

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:11.960 align:middle line:84%
of detecting these things in
the near-Earth environment

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:14.030 align:middle line:84%
is not visually,
but in the infrared.

00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:15.870 align:middle line:84%
I said before, these
are dark objects.

00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:18.190 align:middle line:84%
Dark objects in the
sunlight heat up.

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:20.729 align:middle line:84%
And so in visible
wavelengths, they're

00:39:20.729 --> 00:39:22.020 align:middle line:90%
as dark as a piece of charcoal.

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:23.603 align:middle line:84%
But if you go to the
infrared, they're

00:39:23.603 --> 00:39:26.170 align:middle line:84%
shining out there in space
against the cold depths

00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:26.685 align:middle line:90%
of space.

00:39:26.685 --> 00:39:28.810 align:middle line:84%
So if you launch an infrared
telescope like the one

00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:32.889 align:middle line:84%
I brought here-- you can pick
it up, George, off the base.

00:39:32.889 --> 00:39:34.097 align:middle line:90%
This is just a mounting base.

00:39:34.097 --> 00:39:34.650 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead and pick that up.

00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:35.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, there you go.

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:36.020 align:middle line:90%
Hold it.

00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:36.614 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:39:36.614 --> 00:39:38.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: That's a
spacecraft we call Sentinel.

00:39:38.530 --> 00:39:40.705 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How big would
this be in space?

00:39:40.705 --> 00:39:41.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Same size, George.

00:39:41.830 --> 00:39:44.625 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah, perfect.

00:39:44.625 --> 00:39:47.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: This is a smaller
model, obviously, of something

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.500 align:middle line:90%
that's actually 25 feet tall.

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:49.491 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:39:49.491 --> 00:39:51.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: Well, you
know, you standing next

00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:52.489 align:middle line:90%
to it would be about that big.

00:39:52.489 --> 00:39:53.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:55.433 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: So this is the
Sentinel spacecraft.

00:39:55.433 --> 00:39:56.820 align:middle line:84%
It's an infrared
telescope that's

00:39:56.820 --> 00:40:00.830 align:middle line:84%
meant to be deployed into
an orbit inside the orbit

00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:03.310 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth, closer to
like the planet Venus.

00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:04.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:06.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: And from that
perspective, looking back

00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:09.077 align:middle line:84%
to the Earth, all of those
dark, small, little objects

00:40:09.077 --> 00:40:10.910 align:middle line:84%
that we couldn't see
from here on the ground

00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:12.951 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden show up
like little bright lights

00:40:12.951 --> 00:40:13.870 align:middle line:90%
in the infrared.

00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:20.220 align:middle line:84%
So the B612 Foundation is--
basically, we-- I say we--

00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:22.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm on the board of
the B612 Foundation.

00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:27.690 align:middle line:84%
We are trying to
basically put forward

00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:31.270 align:middle line:84%
the first privately-funded
space mission like this.

00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:32.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's exciting.

00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:34.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: NASA's got
a lot on their plate.

00:40:34.770 --> 00:40:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And we are trying to basically
help out by saying, look,

00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:41.610 align:middle line:84%
we're going to go at this
at the level of the sort

00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:43.880 align:middle line:84%
of philanthropic
way of raising funds

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:47.710 align:middle line:84%
that a community might raise
to build a hospital, right?

00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:51.849 align:middle line:84%
Those same amount of funds we
could raise to literally help

00:40:51.849 --> 00:40:52.640 align:middle line:90%
protect the planet.

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:53.973 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That would be exciting.

00:40:53.973 --> 00:40:56.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: And as
a public venture,

00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:59.830 align:middle line:84%
you can contribute to helping
in almost literally saving

00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:00.330 align:middle line:90%
the planet.

00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:02.320 align:middle line:84%
So infrared is a
great way to go.

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:05.260 align:middle line:84%
Radar techniques are
a great way to go,

00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:07.630 align:middle line:84%
not so much for
detecting the objects,

00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:10.097 align:middle line:84%
but for characterizing
them once we've found them.

00:41:10.097 --> 00:41:11.180 align:middle line:90%
What are they made out of?

00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:12.730 align:middle line:90%
How rough are there surfaces?

00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:13.990 align:middle line:90%
What are their shapes?

00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:15.406 align:middle line:84%
Are there boulders
on the surface?

00:41:15.406 --> 00:41:16.260 align:middle line:90%
Are there craters?

00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:18.135 align:middle line:84%
Is it a metal object
or a rocky object?

00:41:18.135 --> 00:41:20.010 align:middle line:84%
That's important to
know, as we've discussed.

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:21.830 align:middle line:84%
So characterizing is
also very important.

00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:23.330 align:middle line:90%
And radar is great at that.

00:41:23.330 --> 00:41:26.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like new technology,
with our Beyond Belief cam,

00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:30.140 align:middle line:84%
we have our viewers from
all over this planet

00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:31.014 align:middle line:90%
checking in with us.

00:41:31.014 --> 00:41:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And they've got a
question for you, Dan.

00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:33.513 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Hi, Dan.

00:41:33.513 --> 00:41:35.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm Larissa from
Burbank, California.

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:38.810 align:middle line:84%
I was wondering if it's possible
that the sun could get close

00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:40.460 align:middle line:84%
enough to the Earth
to burn us up?

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:42.001 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: Oh, that's
a great question.

00:41:42.001 --> 00:41:44.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we get
burned up by the sun?

00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:46.845 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: It's actually
going to happen.

00:41:46.845 --> 00:41:48.470 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, not for
about another four

00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:50.300 align:middle line:90%
and a half billion years or so.

00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:52.515 align:middle line:84%
So not necessarily
in a literal sense

00:41:52.515 --> 00:41:54.640 align:middle line:84%
that the sun's going to
move position or the Earth.

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:59.740 align:middle line:84%
But when the sun runs out of
its hydrogen fuel about four

00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:02.430 align:middle line:84%
and a half billion
years from now,

00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:04.030 align:middle line:84%
the central core
of the sun is going

00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:07.490 align:middle line:84%
to-- there won't no longer
be that thermal energy

00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:11.140 align:middle line:84%
source in the core to keep
the gravity from squeezing

00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:11.950 align:middle line:90%
that core down.

00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:14.320 align:middle line:84%
Gravity will take over again,
squeeze it even tighter

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:16.020 align:middle line:84%
and hotter to the
point where helium

00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:18.370 align:middle line:84%
will start to fuse in
the core of the sun.

00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:21.510 align:middle line:84%
When that happens, the
outer envelopes of our sun

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:23.860 align:middle line:84%
is going to expand
out almost certainly

00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:26.810 align:middle line:84%
passed the orbit of Venus,
maybe even out as far

00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:27.850 align:middle line:90%
as the orbit of Mars.

00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:31.800 align:middle line:84%
Our sun will become a red
giant star like many others

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:32.700 align:middle line:90%
we see out there.

00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And in that sense,
I guess you could

00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:37.910 align:middle line:84%
say that the Earth will
get scorched and burned

00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:39.050 align:middle line:90%
from the sun that way.

00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:40.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But in her
lifetime, she really

00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:41.580 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have anything
to worry about.

00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:43.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: Probably nothing to
worry about in our lifetimes.

00:42:43.350 --> 00:42:44.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, no, absolutely.

00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:46.326 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of course, you
remember the movie "Knowing"

00:42:46.326 --> 00:42:48.510 align:middle line:84%
with Nicolas Cage where
something happened

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:51.625 align:middle line:84%
with the sun, and everything
was burned up on this planet?

00:42:51.625 --> 00:42:52.250 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Right.

00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:52.540 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:52.900 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:54.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that conceivable?

00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:58.730 align:middle line:84%
Could we get hit by something,
some kind of plasma flare?

00:42:58.730 --> 00:43:00.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Oh, that happens a lot.

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's not so
much a direct threat

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:05.590 align:middle line:90%
to biological life on the Earth.

00:43:05.590 --> 00:43:08.670 align:middle line:84%
It definitely can be a
threat to our technological

00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:09.460 align:middle line:90%
infrastructure.

00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:13.160 align:middle line:84%
The sun emits huge
explosions all the time,

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:15.010 align:middle line:90%
these solar flares.

00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:18.060 align:middle line:84%
Magnetic fields on the sun
get wrapped up and pent up.

00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And when they snap, when
those magnetic lines of force

00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:25.210 align:middle line:84%
rearrange themselves
catastrophically,

00:43:25.210 --> 00:43:28.179 align:middle line:84%
the energy released
can be-- I don't even

00:43:28.179 --> 00:43:29.720 align:middle line:84%
know where to go in
terms of how many

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:31.140 align:middle line:90%
megatons of energy that is.

00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:34.310 align:middle line:84%
It's more energy than the
Earth will ever generate.

00:43:34.310 --> 00:43:37.950 align:middle line:84%
And when the particles, the
plasma from those explosions

00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:40.480 align:middle line:84%
propagates through the solar
system, impacts the Earth,

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:42.589 align:middle line:84%
affects our magnetic
field, those

00:43:42.589 --> 00:43:44.380 align:middle line:84%
charged particles can
enter the atmosphere.

00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:45.990 align:middle line:90%
They can fry our satellites.

00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:48.180 align:middle line:84%
They can actually
affect our power grid.

00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:48.996 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:43:48.996 --> 00:43:51.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: There have been major
power outages from flares.

00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:51.953 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:43:51.953 --> 00:43:53.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: So that is
a concern actually,

00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:55.630 align:middle line:90%
a real actual concern.

00:43:55.630 --> 00:44:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And as our civilization becomes
more dependent on our little

00:44:00.010 --> 00:44:03.210 align:middle line:84%
handheld electronic devices,
the GPS' that are navigating

00:44:03.210 --> 00:44:06.037 align:middle line:84%
our aircraft, that
can be a bad thing.

00:44:06.037 --> 00:44:08.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got another
question for Dan Durda.

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:10.570 align:middle line:90%
Yes, way in the back?

00:44:10.570 --> 00:44:13.630 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Uh, yes, I'm
curious if any fragments were

00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:16.880 align:middle line:84%
discovered from the most
recent event over Siberia,

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:21.570 align:middle line:84%
and if we've been able to make
any new deductions about why

00:44:21.570 --> 00:44:25.450 align:middle line:84%
no fragments were found
from the Tunguska event?

00:44:25.450 --> 00:44:27.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: Yeah, actually
there have been.

00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:31.420 align:middle line:84%
That event dumped literally
hundreds of little black stones

00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:32.300 align:middle line:90%
into the snow.

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:33.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People are
selling this stuff.

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:34.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Oh, yeah.

00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:36.343 align:middle line:84%
Probably not long from now,
you'll be able to go on eBay

00:44:36.343 --> 00:44:39.400 align:middle line:90%
and buy pieces of it yourself.

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:41.390 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, lots of
fragments were found.

00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:46.710 align:middle line:84%
It turns out to be a very common
type of rocky, stony meteorite

00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:49.520 align:middle line:84%
material, one of the most common
things that are out there.

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:51.800 align:middle line:84%
We are going to be
looking at that in detail.

00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:54.360 align:middle line:84%
Every piece of meteorite
we get on the Earth

00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:57.840 align:middle line:84%
is a sample of some near-Earth
asteroid or some main belt

00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:58.340 align:middle line:90%
asteroid.

00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:01.070 align:middle line:84%
So they're precious
geologic clues for us

00:45:01.070 --> 00:45:02.560 align:middle line:84%
of how that material
was assembled.

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:05.610 align:middle line:90%


00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:08.580 align:middle line:84%
Knowing that it's a relatively
weak rocky object and not

00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:11.130 align:middle line:84%
a stony iron or an
iron object tells

00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:13.470 align:middle line:84%
a lot about how these
objects break up

00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:16.070 align:middle line:84%
and why things like
the Tunguska object

00:45:16.070 --> 00:45:18.850 align:middle line:84%
probably didn't really leave
any big pieces on the ground.

00:45:18.850 --> 00:45:21.840 align:middle line:84%
We know that there's no
craters on the ground.

00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:25.080 align:middle line:84%
All that has really ever been
found from the Tunguska event

00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:28.525 align:middle line:84%
are little bits of
dust-sized particles embedded

00:45:28.525 --> 00:45:31.810 align:middle line:84%
in the sap in the trees
that it blew down.

00:45:31.810 --> 00:45:34.139 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And millions of
trees were knocked down,

00:45:34.139 --> 00:45:34.680 align:middle line:90%
weren't they?

00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:36.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: I think the estimate is
something like 80 million trees

00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:37.770 align:middle line:90%
over 2, 000 square miles.

00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:38.645 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --wiped out.

00:45:38.645 --> 00:45:39.770 align:middle line:90%
Did anybody die then?

00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:41.240 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Not confirmed.

00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:43.880 align:middle line:84%
There are reports of at least
one person being blown off

00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:44.710 align:middle line:90%
their porch.

00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:45.900 align:middle line:90%
This is middle of--

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:46.902 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This was 190--

00:45:46.902 --> 00:45:47.260 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: 1908--

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:47.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --8.

00:45:47.850 --> 00:45:49.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: --in the
middle of Siberia.

00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:52.915 align:middle line:84%
So thankfully, very,
very low population.

00:45:52.915 --> 00:45:53.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:55.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: So we don't think
there were any people killed,

00:45:55.550 --> 00:45:56.770 align:middle line:90%
fortunately, from that.

00:45:56.770 --> 00:45:59.550 align:middle line:84%
There were reports of a herd
of reindeer being scorched,

00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:01.300 align:middle line:90%
but no people, fortunately.

00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:03.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are the odds
of this other situation that

00:46:03.850 --> 00:46:05.857 align:middle line:90%
occurred again over Siberia--

00:46:05.857 --> 00:46:06.440 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Yeah.

00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:09.504 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --I mean, two
spots over Siberia?

00:46:09.504 --> 00:46:10.295 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that strange?

00:46:10.295 --> 00:46:10.580 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Yeah.

00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:11.250 align:middle line:90%
That was a big question.

00:46:11.250 --> 00:46:13.400 align:middle line:84%
How come Russia's getting
all the big impacts?

00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:17.535 align:middle line:84%
But when you live in a country
that spans nine time zones,

00:46:17.535 --> 00:46:19.980 align:middle line:84%
that's a lot of fraction
of the area of the Earth

00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:20.750 align:middle line:90%
to catch stuff.

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:24.840 align:middle line:84%
So you're just playing the odds
by having a very large country.

00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:26.341 align:middle line:84%
The Pacific Ocean,
by far, gets most

00:46:26.341 --> 00:46:28.423 align:middle line:84%
of the things that impact
the planet Earth, right,

00:46:28.423 --> 00:46:30.070 align:middle line:84%
just by definition
today at least.

00:46:30.070 --> 00:46:32.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would we get hit
and not know about it?

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:33.500 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Oh.

00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:35.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm not
saying about seeing it.

00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:38.180 align:middle line:84%
Would the impact occur,
let's say in the ocean,

00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:40.200 align:middle line:84%
and we simply just
don't know about it?

00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:40.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Oh, yeah.

00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:42.750 align:middle line:90%
Sure, certainly in the past.

00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:45.710 align:middle line:84%
Today we have the same
network of sensors

00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:48.520 align:middle line:84%
that allowed us to learn so
much about this particular event

00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:49.940 align:middle line:84%
in Russia just a
few months back.

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:52.770 align:middle line:90%


00:46:52.770 --> 00:46:56.760 align:middle line:84%
So this is the global network
of infrasound detectors.

00:46:56.760 --> 00:47:00.170 align:middle line:84%
There are, of course,
military satellites orbiting

00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:03.210 align:middle line:84%
the Earth, which are scanning
the edge of the Earth's

00:47:03.210 --> 00:47:06.570 align:middle line:84%
atmosphere all the time looking
for interesting infrared

00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:07.572 align:middle line:90%
explosive events, right?

00:47:07.572 --> 00:47:10.030 align:middle line:84%
They have their other reasons
for looking for those things,

00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:11.880 align:middle line:84%
but they certainly
show asteroids as well.

00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:14.740 align:middle line:84%
So it's hard for
something of that scale

00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:17.000 align:middle line:90%
to go undetected these days.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.936 align:middle line:84%
But certainly the smaller ones,
this desk, or a basketball, it

00:47:21.936 --> 00:47:22.810 align:middle line:90%
happens all the time.

00:47:22.810 --> 00:47:25.310 align:middle line:84%
Things enter all over the place
without us knowing about it.

00:47:25.310 --> 00:47:27.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Daniel,
paint us a scenario.

00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:32.980 align:middle line:84%
An object five miles
wide heading this way,

00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:35.680 align:middle line:90%
and we've got a month's notice.

00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:38.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: Oh, that's
a bad scenario.

00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:39.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Paint that
picture for us.

00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:41.830 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:47:41.830 --> 00:47:43.540 align:middle line:90%
If it impacts, what happens?

00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:45.350 align:middle line:90%
Just lay it out for us.

00:47:45.350 --> 00:47:47.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: Well, first of
all, that's the proverbial,

00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:49.556 align:middle line:84%
you know, bend over and
kiss it goodbye moment

00:47:49.556 --> 00:47:54.130 align:middle line:84%
because if something of that
size several decades out,

00:47:54.130 --> 00:47:55.280 align:middle line:90%
there's maybe some--

00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:55.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Planning.

00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:56.370 align:middle line:90%
There's planning.

00:47:56.370 --> 00:47:57.953 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: --maybe you
can do something.

00:47:57.953 --> 00:47:59.525 align:middle line:84%
A month out,
absolutely nothing you

00:47:59.525 --> 00:48:01.810 align:middle line:90%
could do about it at that stage.

00:48:01.810 --> 00:48:04.860 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be like the
movie "Deep Impact," which

00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:07.116 align:middle line:84%
was a human story
about what people

00:48:07.116 --> 00:48:08.240 align:middle line:90%
did to prepare for the end.

00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --during
their last moments.

00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:09.314 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Yeah.

00:48:09.314 --> 00:48:10.440 align:middle line:84%
Do you spend time
with your family?

00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:11.250 align:middle line:90%
Do you go--whatever.

00:48:11.250 --> 00:48:12.110 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be that kind of--

00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:13.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it a planet killer?

00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:16.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: Five miles
across is very nearly

00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:19.620 align:middle line:84%
the size of the object that
wiped out the dinosaurs, right?

00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:21.249 align:middle line:84%
That's a civilization
ender, for sure.

00:48:21.249 --> 00:48:21.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:24.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: It's
maybe just possibly

00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:26.590 align:middle line:84%
even a species ender
for us at that point.

00:48:26.590 --> 00:48:28.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would there
be any survivors?

00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:30.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, could you
go underground?

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:31.342 align:middle line:90%
Could you hide?

00:48:31.342 --> 00:48:32.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: The problem
with an impact

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:36.280 align:middle line:84%
like that is you can escape the
initial ravages of the impact,

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:40.080 align:middle line:84%
the blast, perhaps scorching
wildfires depending

00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:43.210 align:middle line:84%
on the scale of the impact,
but you can't escape

00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:46.180 align:middle line:84%
the poisoning of the atmosphere,
the heating of the atmosphere.

00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:48.800 align:middle line:90%


00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:51.240 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be long-term
global warming after that,

00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:54.780 align:middle line:84%
right, because you're going
to put enough carbon dioxide

00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:59.044 align:middle line:84%
and other greenhouse gases
in the atmosphere to be bad.

00:48:59.044 --> 00:49:01.210 align:middle line:84%
In the short-term, it's
going to be cooling effects.

00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:03.793 align:middle line:84%
You're going to put aerosols in
the atmosphere and dust, which

00:49:03.793 --> 00:49:05.610 align:middle line:84%
is going to be the
nuclear winter scenario.

00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:05.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:06.835 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: So even if
you hide in a cave,

00:49:06.835 --> 00:49:08.945 align:middle line:84%
and you've got a week's
worth of food, that's--

00:49:08.945 --> 00:49:10.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's not
going to help you.

00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:10.430 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:12.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: Not to mention the
fact that the ozone-- we've

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:13.900 align:middle line:84%
talked about the
ozone layer before.

00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:14.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:15.646 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: An object
of that size is

00:49:15.646 --> 00:49:18.200 align:middle line:84%
going to have enough stuff
in it to destroy the ozone

00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:21.934 align:middle line:84%
layer many, many, many
thousands of times over.

00:49:21.934 --> 00:49:24.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then you
instantly get that effect too.

00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:25.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: And then
you've got all the UV.

00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:26.910 align:middle line:84%
It's just going to
kill plants, and algae,

00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:28.220 align:middle line:90%
and break down the food chain.

00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:29.220 align:middle line:90%
There's no place to go--

00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:31.666 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So if you and
I were on the planet,

00:49:31.666 --> 00:49:32.790 align:middle line:90%
and we're talking together.

00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:35.390 align:middle line:84%
Not that you'd want to you
end your moment with me,

00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:38.440 align:middle line:90%
but we're there.

00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:40.060 align:middle line:90%
Do we see something coming in?

00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:40.760 align:middle line:90%
What do we see?

00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:41.343 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Yeah.

00:49:41.343 --> 00:49:44.820 align:middle line:84%
So an object of that size
coming in for-- that's

00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:46.820 align:middle line:84%
big enough that for
the weeks before,

00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:49.370 align:middle line:84%
you're going to actually
see it in the sky as a star.

00:49:49.370 --> 00:49:49.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:49:49.870 --> 00:49:51.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: In the few
days before, it's

00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:54.050 align:middle line:84%
going to be a pretty
brilliant star in the sky

00:49:54.050 --> 00:49:56.096 align:middle line:90%
as it approaches you.

00:49:56.096 --> 00:49:57.470 align:middle line:84%
In those moments
as it's entering

00:49:57.470 --> 00:50:00.600 align:middle line:84%
through the atmosphere, its
many, many, many, many suns

00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:03.830 align:middle line:84%
in the sky, bright
enough, hot enough

00:50:03.830 --> 00:50:06.440 align:middle line:84%
that it will spontaneously
ignite any vegetation

00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:09.234 align:middle line:84%
within eye shot of
it over the horizon.

00:50:09.234 --> 00:50:10.150 align:middle line:90%
And then the big boom.

00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:11.108 align:middle line:90%
And then it's all over.

00:50:11.108 --> 00:50:13.687 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will government tell
us about it if it's that close?

00:50:13.687 --> 00:50:14.270 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Yeah.

00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:15.410 align:middle line:90%
That's-- well--

00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:17.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you
imagine the chaos

00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:20.056 align:middle line:90%
over the course of a month?

00:50:20.056 --> 00:50:21.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: Certainly
I think we all

00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:24.990 align:middle line:84%
have the impression that
governments wanting to control

00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:29.010 align:middle line:84%
information the way they
do, there will certainly

00:50:29.010 --> 00:50:32.557 align:middle line:84%
be people who will want
to control at least how

00:50:32.557 --> 00:50:33.890 align:middle line:90%
and what information is put out.

00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:35.265 align:middle line:84%
But I'll tell you,
with something

00:50:35.265 --> 00:50:38.120 align:middle line:84%
of that scale with the global
network of amateur citizen

00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:40.820 align:middle line:84%
scientists around the planet,
can't hide something like that.

00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:42.380 align:middle line:90%
It's just, there's no hiding it.

00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And would
you go-- would you

00:50:43.410 --> 00:50:45.200 align:middle line:84%
go on the radio
station show with me?

00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:45.620 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Yeah, my--

00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:47.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Coast to Coast, would
you tell me the way it is?

00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:49.323 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: I think
most of my colleagues

00:50:49.323 --> 00:50:52.620 align:middle line:84%
that I work with, our philosophy
is-- we're scientists, right?

00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:54.840 align:middle line:90%
We deal with information.

00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:57.130 align:middle line:84%
Our predilection is to
give as much information

00:50:57.130 --> 00:50:59.590 align:middle line:84%
to people as possible so you
have information to work with.

00:50:59.590 --> 00:51:01.980 align:middle line:84%
More information is always
better from that perspective,

00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:03.002 align:middle line:90%
from my perspective.

00:51:03.002 --> 00:51:04.960 align:middle line:84%
Certainly I know there
are people out there who

00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:08.262 align:middle line:84%
would like to not do
that, but everybody

00:51:08.262 --> 00:51:10.470 align:middle line:84%
I know in my community and
the asteroid impact hazard

00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:12.722 align:middle line:84%
community is all about
sharing that information.

00:51:12.722 --> 00:51:14.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You and I
have talked about this

00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:18.010 align:middle line:84%
for in excess of 12 years
about the possibilities

00:51:18.010 --> 00:51:19.959 align:middle line:90%
of these things happening.

00:51:19.959 --> 00:51:21.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: And then
we had Chelyabinsk,

00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:23.050 align:middle line:84%
which was what we've
been talking about.

00:51:23.050 --> 00:51:23.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We'd been
talking about it.

00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:25.020 align:middle line:90%
It was right there.

00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:28.510 align:middle line:84%
So is there that
possibility that one day we

00:51:28.510 --> 00:51:32.860 align:middle line:84%
could have a, if not a
planet killer, a city killer?

00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:35.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: Yeah, certainly
the city killers.

00:51:35.710 --> 00:51:39.950 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, as I said,
the telescopic surveys

00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:42.560 align:middle line:84%
have done a great job
at the big civilization

00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:45.170 align:middle line:90%
enders, the dinosaur killers.

00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:47.020 align:middle line:84%
Now there's always
the possibility

00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:51.650 align:middle line:84%
that a comet nucleus from
the outer solar system

00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:52.650 align:middle line:90%
can drift through.

00:51:52.650 --> 00:51:55.191 align:middle line:84%
Several years ago, we had Comet
Hale-Bopp if you'll remember.

00:51:55.191 --> 00:51:57.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah but, how much
time do we have on that?

00:51:57.910 --> 00:51:59.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: That's the
danger of comets

00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:01.870 align:middle line:84%
is they can come from the
outer solar system with only

00:52:01.870 --> 00:52:03.120 align:middle line:90%
a year or two of notice.

00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:04.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're kidding?

00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: And because of
the orbits that they're on,

00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:07.330 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing you
can do about those.

00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:09.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really nothing
you can do about those.

00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:10.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And how big is a comet?

00:52:10.550 --> 00:52:13.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: Comet Hale-Bopp
was 50 kilometers across.

00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:14.790 align:middle line:90%
Not 5, 50.

00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:15.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:16.346 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's huge.

00:52:16.346 --> 00:52:17.987 align:middle line:84%
That's like a
little tiny planet.

00:52:17.987 --> 00:52:19.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: That would
take us back to bacteria

00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:21.860 align:middle line:84%
on the planet,
something of that scale.

00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:26.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would that literally
shatter the planet if it hit?

00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:28.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: No.

00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:32.480 align:middle line:84%
Even the moon-forming
impact, which was something,

00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:34.830 align:middle line:84%
we think, nearly
the size of Mars

00:52:34.830 --> 00:52:39.290 align:middle line:84%
hitting the proto-Earth on
a glancing, shearing angle.

00:52:39.290 --> 00:52:41.210 align:middle line:84%
It certainly was
enough to splash off

00:52:41.210 --> 00:52:44.110 align:middle line:84%
most of the mantle of the
Earth and part of that object.

00:52:44.110 --> 00:52:46.402 align:middle line:84%
But big objects have
so much gravity,

00:52:46.402 --> 00:52:48.860 align:middle line:84%
it's really hard to kind of
really disperse them like that.

00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:51.450 align:middle line:84%
So certainly that
sort of comet impact,

00:52:51.450 --> 00:52:55.240 align:middle line:84%
the Earth as a physical
entity, is going to be fine.

00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:57.320 align:middle line:84%
Biologically, it's not a
good day for the planet,

00:52:57.320 --> 00:52:59.260 align:middle line:84%
but as a physical
entity, no problem.

00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:02.030 align:middle line:84%
But those, I have to
say, are extremely--

00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:05.420 align:middle line:84%
comets are only a tiny--they're
like 1% of the impact hazard we

00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:06.330 align:middle line:90%
worry about.

00:53:06.330 --> 00:53:10.440 align:middle line:84%
The real concern now
that we've completed

00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:12.630 align:middle line:84%
the survey for the big
near-Earth asteroids,

00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:15.440 align:middle line:84%
and given the fact that comets
are such a tiny fraction,

00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:18.160 align:middle line:84%
the real concern are
exactly what you said,

00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:19.880 align:middle line:90%
the city killers, right?

00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:23.399 align:middle line:84%
And those are what we want
to look for with Sentinel.

00:53:23.399 --> 00:53:25.690 align:middle line:84%
Those are what we want to go
out with other spacecraft,

00:53:25.690 --> 00:53:28.420 align:middle line:84%
and characterize,
and learn more about.

00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And those are the objects
that we're still discovering.

00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:35.100 align:middle line:84%
We have not yet discovered
most of those objects that

00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:36.540 align:middle line:84%
are in the near-Earth
population.

00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:40.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mile-long asteroid hits
in the middle of the Atlantic,

00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:43.640 align:middle line:84%
how big is the tsunami on the
eastern coast of the United

00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:44.200 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:46.283 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: Mile-wide impact,
those are big tsunamis.

00:53:46.283 --> 00:53:51.030 align:middle line:84%
Those are many, many
10s, probably a couple

00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:53.200 align:middle line:90%
hundred meters high.

00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:54.539 align:middle line:90%
It washes across--

00:53:54.539 --> 00:53:56.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It would knock down
every building as it hits.

00:53:56.830 --> 00:53:57.413 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Yeah.

00:53:57.413 --> 00:54:00.440 align:middle line:84%
You go along the entire Atl--
basically that tsunami will

00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:02.940 align:middle line:84%
propagate around the world, but
certainly the Atlantic basin

00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:03.200 align:middle line:90%
will--

00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:04.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how
far in do you think?

00:54:04.890 --> 00:54:05.540 align:middle line:90%
50 miles?

00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:05.860 align:middle line:90%
100 miles?

00:54:05.860 --> 00:54:06.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: It depends on
the coastline, right?

00:54:06.690 --> 00:54:09.064 align:middle line:84%
Certain coasts, you'll wash
a lot further in than others,

00:54:09.064 --> 00:54:12.390 align:middle line:84%
but yes, you're talking many,
many, dozens of miles inland.

00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:13.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Devastating
the whole area?

00:54:13.890 --> 00:54:14.473 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Yeah.

00:54:14.473 --> 00:54:15.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Done?

00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:17.288 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: Well, we saw what
happened in Southeast Asia

00:54:17.288 --> 00:54:18.944 align:middle line:84%
with only a-- that
was meters tall.

00:54:18.944 --> 00:54:20.110 align:middle line:90%
We're talking 10 kilometers.

00:54:20.110 --> 00:54:21.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that
was an earthquake.

00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:22.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: That was
an earthquake that

00:54:22.730 --> 00:54:25.642 align:middle line:84%
dropped a little
block in the ocean.

00:54:25.642 --> 00:54:28.070 align:middle line:84%
The tsunami profile
you get from an impact

00:54:28.070 --> 00:54:30.350 align:middle line:84%
is a little different than
those earthquake ones.

00:54:30.350 --> 00:54:34.177 align:middle line:84%
And so we used to worry about
those for smaller impactors.

00:54:34.177 --> 00:54:34.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:37.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: We learned, though,
by studying that process

00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:39.399 align:middle line:84%
that the splash
that you get creates

00:54:39.399 --> 00:54:40.690 align:middle line:90%
a slightly different wave form.

00:54:40.690 --> 00:54:46.072 align:middle line:84%
So the football-field-sized
impactors in the ocean,

00:54:46.072 --> 00:54:48.030 align:middle line:84%
we used to worry about
the tsunamis from those,

00:54:48.030 --> 00:54:49.613 align:middle line:84%
but now we know that
most of that gets

00:54:49.613 --> 00:54:53.980 align:middle line:84%
sucked up on the coastline,
the outer continental shelf.

00:54:53.980 --> 00:54:56.040 align:middle line:84%
The big ones, though,
a mile impactor, that's

00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:57.170 align:middle line:90%
going to go in anyway.

00:54:57.170 --> 00:54:58.022 align:middle line:90%
That's bad.

00:54:58.022 --> 00:55:00.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you still glad
you're doing what you're doing?

00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:02.410 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Absolutely, absolutely.

00:55:02.410 --> 00:55:06.070 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's not just the
hazards from the asteroids.

00:55:06.070 --> 00:55:10.800 align:middle line:84%
These same objects that
are potential impactors

00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:13.175 align:middle line:84%
because they are so
close to the Earth,

00:55:13.175 --> 00:55:14.550 align:middle line:84%
and because it's
so easy for them

00:55:14.550 --> 00:55:17.980 align:middle line:84%
to impact, that also can
conversely mean those

00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:22.240 align:middle line:84%
are the objects that are easier
for us to get to as well.

00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And they hold great
promise for exploration

00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:28.420 align:middle line:84%
for, as we discussed,
providing us that place

00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:31.370 align:middle line:84%
to go to expand the human
experience in space,

00:55:31.370 --> 00:55:34.070 align:middle line:84%
the human presence in our
solar system beyond the Earth,

00:55:34.070 --> 00:55:35.540 align:middle line:90%
Moon system.

00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:37.470 align:middle line:84%
Before we go to
Mars, it would be

00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:40.415 align:middle line:84%
great to practice
those techniques

00:55:40.415 --> 00:55:42.220 align:middle line:84%
on another deep
space object that's

00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:43.905 align:middle line:90%
further away than the Moon.

00:55:43.905 --> 00:55:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And those asteroids are
great targets for that.

00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:48.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They say a
comet could hit Mars--

00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:49.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Oh, yes.

00:55:49.290 --> 00:55:49.600 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:50.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --sometime next year.

00:55:50.590 --> 00:55:51.440 align:middle line:90%
Is that a real possibility?

00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:52.648 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Comet Siding Spring.

00:55:52.648 --> 00:55:54.310 align:middle line:90%
It's still a possibility.

00:55:54.310 --> 00:55:55.724 align:middle line:84%
It comes down to
this uncertainty

00:55:55.724 --> 00:55:56.890 align:middle line:90%
that we talked about before.

00:55:56.890 --> 00:55:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And in the case of a comet, it's
not the sunlight pushing on it.

00:55:59.710 --> 00:56:02.480 align:middle line:84%
It's the sunlight activating
all those gaseous jets

00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:03.662 align:middle line:90%
on the comet.

00:56:03.662 --> 00:56:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Better Mars than us.

00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:06.410 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Better Mars than us.

00:56:06.410 --> 00:56:09.370 align:middle line:84%
In some ways, it would
be a fantastic scientific

00:56:09.370 --> 00:56:09.910 align:middle line:90%
experiment--

00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:10.743 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --to watch.

00:56:10.743 --> 00:56:13.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: --to watch
an impact like that.

00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:15.875 align:middle line:84%
It would be bad for our
Mars program, space program,

00:56:15.875 --> 00:56:18.099 align:middle line:84%
though, because all of the
space assets we currently

00:56:18.099 --> 00:56:20.140 align:middle line:84%
have at Mars would be in
severe danger from that.

00:56:20.140 --> 00:56:21.223 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're all gone.

00:56:21.223 --> 00:56:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And what about the debris
from the impact for us?

00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:25.800 align:middle line:90%
Could it hit us?

00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:29.667 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: That would provide--
well, you know, it's

00:56:29.667 --> 00:56:31.250 align:middle line:84%
impacts like that
that that do deliver

00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:32.860 align:middle line:90%
Mars meteorites to Earth.

00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:34.705 align:middle line:84%
That would be a longer
time scale thing.

00:56:34.705 --> 00:56:36.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
we would necessarily

00:56:36.330 --> 00:56:38.235 align:middle line:84%
see, in the following
year or two,

00:56:38.235 --> 00:56:40.040 align:middle line:90%
a shower of Mars meteorites.

00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:43.150 align:middle line:84%
But that would certainly
be a new recent impact

00:56:43.150 --> 00:56:46.164 align:middle line:84%
that, over sort of short
term geologic time scales,

00:56:46.164 --> 00:56:48.080 align:middle line:84%
would certainly deliver
stuff to us, no doubt.

00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:49.663 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wouldn't
that be amazing just

00:56:49.663 --> 00:56:51.890 align:middle line:90%
to be able to watch that happen?

00:56:51.890 --> 00:56:54.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: Every year two
tons of Mars meteorites

00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:56.482 align:middle line:90%
falls on our planet, right?

00:56:56.482 --> 00:56:57.690 align:middle line:90%
We don't know where they are.

00:56:57.690 --> 00:56:59.230 align:middle line:84%
They're all falling
in the Atlantic.

00:56:59.230 --> 00:57:01.006 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And from how long ago?

00:57:01.006 --> 00:57:01.630 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: From--

00:57:01.630 --> 00:57:03.005 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --millions
of years ago?

00:57:03.005 --> 00:57:03.546 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: On--

00:57:03.546 --> 00:57:04.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Billions?

00:57:04.390 --> 00:57:05.931 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: --on time
scales of millions

00:57:05.931 --> 00:57:07.530 align:middle line:84%
to hundreds of
thousands of years.

00:57:07.530 --> 00:57:07.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:57:07.810 --> 00:57:09.210 align:middle line:84%
They've just been
orbiting around,

00:57:09.210 --> 00:57:10.370 align:middle line:90%
and then they get sucked in?

00:57:10.370 --> 00:57:11.078 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Exactly.

00:57:11.078 --> 00:57:12.960 align:middle line:84%
They are just that
many more little bits

00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:15.449 align:middle line:90%
of near-Earth material.

00:57:15.449 --> 00:57:17.740 align:middle line:84%
But it would be certainly
fascinating to actually watch

00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:18.807 align:middle line:90%
an impact of that scale.

00:57:18.807 --> 00:57:20.640 align:middle line:84%
We've never seen something
on a hard surface

00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:21.764 align:middle line:90%
of an object of that scale.

00:57:21.764 --> 00:57:24.040 align:middle line:84%
We can't reproduce
those in the laboratory.

00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And we don't yet know
enough about the physics

00:57:26.350 --> 00:57:27.495 align:middle line:90%
to model it in a computer.

00:57:27.495 --> 00:57:30.460 align:middle line:84%
We know a lot of the physics,
but an impact like that

00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:32.500 align:middle line:84%
would certainly help
really nail down

00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:34.809 align:middle line:84%
and constrain
those models better

00:57:34.809 --> 00:57:36.600 align:middle line:84%
to allow us to make
better predictions even

00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:37.850 align:middle line:90%
for the impacts here on Earth.

00:57:37.850 --> 00:57:40.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will we get better
in the next 5 or 10 years

00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:42.267 align:middle line:90%
for asteroid sighting?

00:57:42.267 --> 00:57:43.100 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Absolutely.

00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:46.650 align:middle line:84%
If Sentinel launches,
we're currently

00:57:46.650 --> 00:57:49.160 align:middle line:90%
targeting 2017 to 2018.

00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:53.190 align:middle line:84%
This infrared mission alone in
the first month of operation

00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:54.800 align:middle line:84%
would discover 20,000
new asteroids--

00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:55.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --that we
don't know about?

00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:56.600 align:middle line:10%
>>DURDA: That we
don't know about.

00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:57.766 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: We've got to do it.

00:57:57.766 --> 00:58:00.649 align:middle line:10%
>>DURDA: Over its lifetime, over
six and a half years orbiting

00:58:00.649 --> 00:58:02.190 align:middle line:10%
around inside the
orbit of the Earth,

00:58:02.190 --> 00:58:04.940 align:middle line:10%
it would find 500,000
new asteroids--

00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:05.980 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: In what size?

00:58:05.980 --> 00:58:08.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: Down to the things
that are of this concern, down

00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:11.300 align:middle line:84%
to about maybe a third the
size of a football field.

00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:13.110 align:middle line:84%
That's why we want to
launch this mission.

00:58:13.110 --> 00:58:15.660 align:middle line:84%
This mission will
literally completely

00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:18.990 align:middle line:84%
clean up the problem for us in
terms of knowing and predicting

00:58:18.990 --> 00:58:20.240 align:middle line:90%
when these small objects are--

00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:22.835 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there any
reason we won't launch this?

00:58:22.835 --> 00:58:26.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: We just need to
build up the funding for it.

00:58:26.830 --> 00:58:29.027 align:middle line:84%
We are privately raising
the money for this mission.

00:58:29.027 --> 00:58:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's the only
thing stopping us.

00:58:30.610 --> 00:58:31.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Privately?

00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:31.620 align:middle line:90%
>>DURDA: Privately.

00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:33.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why isn't government
spending the money?

00:58:33.700 --> 00:58:34.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: They have
other things to do.

00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:36.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You would think it
would be a great investment.

00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:38.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DURDA: Well, but there are
lots of other great investment

00:58:38.610 --> 00:58:39.318 align:middle line:90%
that NASA has to.

00:58:39.318 --> 00:58:41.541 align:middle line:84%
So I don't want to,
in any way, appear

00:58:41.541 --> 00:58:43.290 align:middle line:84%
to be pointing a finger
at NASA saying you

00:58:43.290 --> 00:58:44.998 align:middle line:84%
guys should be doing
this because there's

a lot of other things that
they need to be doing as well.

00:58:47.644 --> 00:58:49.810 align:middle line:84%

00:58:49.810 --> 00:58:53.430 align:middle line:84%
with the problem, taking on a
bit of this problem ourselves,

00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:55.940 align:middle line:84%
and letting NASA go on and
do other things that it

00:58:55.940 --> 00:58:56.950 align:middle line:90%
can do really well too.

00:58:56.950 --> 00:58:58.910 align:middle line:84%
