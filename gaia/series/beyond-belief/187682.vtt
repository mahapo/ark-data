[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:12.818 --> 00:00:24.538 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.538 --> 00:00:26.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.747 align:middle line:10%
Our dear friend, Richard Dolan,
with us, well known as one

00:00:28.747 --> 00:00:30.980 align:middle line:10%
of the world's leading
UFO researchers.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.760 align:middle line:84%
He has written four classic
historical books on UFOs,

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.940 align:middle line:84%
as well as the series
"False Flags" here on Gaia,

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.150 align:middle line:84%
and appears regularly on
television, my radio show,

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.450 align:middle line:84%
"Coast to Coast," and
other shows, as well.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And he is the publisher of
the Richard Dolan Press.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And you do a great
job with that, Rich.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.290 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD DOLAN: Hi, George.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.540 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for having me on,
and I appreciate that.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.070 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Things
seem to be changing

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.490 align:middle line:10%
in the field of ufology.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.120 align:middle line:84%
More information seems
to be coming out.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.210 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.730 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: It's an amazing thing.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.270 align:middle line:10%
Really, I think we can almost
identify things kicking

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.710 align:middle line:10%
off sometime during 2017, and
they have gone into high gear

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.660 align:middle line:10%
ever since over the
past two-plus years now.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.780 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
that I would have

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.032 align:middle line:84%
been able to predict
much prior to that.

00:01:16.032 --> 00:01:17.990 align:middle line:84%
I think many of us have
been working in the UFO

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.920 align:middle line:90%
field for many, many years.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.692 align:middle line:84%
I, certainly, was
wondering, how long

00:01:21.692 --> 00:01:23.525 align:middle line:84%
are we going to be
researching, researching?

00:01:23.525 --> 00:01:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And are we just spinning
our wheels here?

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.920 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything new going
to be happening in the larger

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.970 align:middle line:90%
culture?

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly, in 2017,
many things began to change.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And it I think it culminated
with the phenomenal coverage

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.260 align:middle line:84%
that we got in the mainstream
media, "New York Times"

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.680 align:middle line:84%
and "Politico," at
the end of the year.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, huge.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:41.120 align:middle line:90%
Huge.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: And I think
it shocked everyone.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.160 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.680 align:middle line:84%
My short answer, I guess,
is that maybe history

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.930 align:middle line:90%
is speeding up a little bit.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.480 align:middle line:84%
The long answer, I'm still
trying to work that one out.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.875 align:middle line:84%
But I think that we're in an era
where more and more toothpaste

00:01:54.875 --> 00:01:56.000 align:middle line:90%
is coming out of that tube.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And I ask myself, when
will we get to a point

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.010 align:middle line:84%
where it becomes an undeniable
momentum on its own?

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.918 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we're heading
into that already.

00:02:05.918 --> 00:02:08.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Steve Bassett from
the Paradigm Research Group

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.310 align:middle line:84%
has been pushing for government
disclosure on UFOs for years.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm at odds with Steven.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.290 align:middle line:84%
I love the guy, but
I've always told him,

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.200 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to
come from government.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.280 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.822 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: I go back
and forth on this.

00:02:20.822 --> 00:02:23.150 align:middle line:84%
I would say that
I wouldn't expect

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.290 align:middle line:84%
an honest, voluntary disclosure
from a government source.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.604 align:middle line:84%
And the more I think
about it, I don't even

00:02:29.604 --> 00:02:31.190 align:middle line:90%
know if it's possible.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.310 align:middle line:84%
When I really wonder about
this, how much information

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.760 align:middle line:84%
does the government
really have, as compared

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.460 align:middle line:84%
with maybe privatized,
highly secret,

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.140 align:middle line:90%
compartmented organizations?

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.360 align:middle line:84%
But having said that,
I do agree with you

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.540 align:middle line:84%
that I've never
expected any government

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.660 align:middle line:84%
to have a motivation to want
to get in front of this.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And like you, I've
argued with Steven.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.460 align:middle line:84%
Steven's a friend of
mine, and our arguments

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.527 align:middle line:84%
go back more than 15,
almost 20 years on this.

00:02:59.527 --> 00:03:00.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, same thing.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.693 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: He would say,
well, it's going to happen.

00:03:02.693 --> 00:03:04.540 align:middle line:84%
He said it in the
George W. Bush years.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.000 align:middle line:84%
He said it during
the Obama years.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And I've just never
been on board.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's put together some
great conferences and events

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.640 align:middle line:84%
which would
illustrate what would

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.700 align:middle line:90%
happen if disclosure occurred.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.470 align:middle line:84%
But it's just not
coming from government.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.110 align:middle line:84%
If it happens, it's going
to come from organizations,

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.750 align:middle line:90%
groups, AATIP, for example.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:26.662 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that.

00:03:26.662 --> 00:03:28.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well yeah,
AATIP, and then

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.070 align:middle line:84%
of course, the group that
is pushing that is TTSA,

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.300 align:middle line:90%
To The Stars Academy.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:40.230 align:middle line:84%
So the AATIP revelation
was one of these rather,

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to say
shocking, but almost shocking

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.860 align:middle line:84%
revelations that we
got at the end of 2017

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.600 align:middle line:84%
from "The New York
Times" and "Politico,"

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.130 align:middle line:84%
and that is this Advanced
Aerospace Threat Identification

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.000 align:middle line:84%
Program that was
out of the Pentagon.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.347 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: $22 million
program, something like that.

00:03:55.347 --> 00:03:57.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Yeah, not a lot
of money over five years.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.888 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we're
finding that there

00:03:58.888 --> 00:04:00.920 align:middle line:90%
are other programs, as well.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.990 align:middle line:84%
But having said that,
the fact that there

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.678 align:middle line:84%
was an admission at all, coming
from the number one established

00:04:06.678 --> 00:04:08.470 align:middle line:84%
source of information,
"The New York Times"

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.080 align:middle line:84%
basically, you don't get any
more establishment than that,

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.730 align:middle line:84%
acknowledging that the
Pentagon was studying UFOs

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:14.530 align:middle line:90%
quite recently.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.648 align:middle line:84%
So that was a major moment
where those of us who

00:04:18.648 --> 00:04:20.440 align:middle line:84%
had known that there
was something going on

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.300 align:middle line:90%
felt that moment of vindication.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And on top of that, what they
pointed out in that article

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.950 align:middle line:84%
was that they had
recovered materials

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.370 align:middle line:90%
from these alleged UAP or UFOs.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.035 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they talked
about some amazing military

00:04:36.035 --> 00:04:38.410 align:middle line:84%
encounters, or at least one
in particular that took place

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:39.490 align:middle line:90%
in '04.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.150 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, you mention AATIP,
and where is disclosure

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.840 align:middle line:90%
going to come from?

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're in a
situation, quite possibly,

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.170 align:middle line:84%
where we're looking
at there's definitely

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:56.680 align:middle line:84%
some coordination going on in
the release of information.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.580 align:middle line:84%
So the real question is,
where is it coming from?

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it timely and
strategic, the release?

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: It seems
to me that there's

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.400 align:middle line:90%
a method to all of this.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.010 align:middle line:84%
For example, "The New
York Times" and "Politico"

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.900 align:middle line:84%
releasing their information
on the same day.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.530 align:middle line:84%
For example, more recently, you
have another "New York Times"

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.680 align:middle line:84%
article in 2019
coinciding almost

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.980 align:middle line:84%
within days of the
roll-out of the television

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.110 align:middle line:84%
show "Unidentified" on
the History Channel,

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.260 align:middle line:84%
coinciding with
other news stories

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.590 align:middle line:84%
within a month of the Navy
updating its UAP guidelines

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:31.390 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.590 align:middle line:84%
So there definitely seems to be
a coordinated effort going on

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:36.470 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And again, the question is,
who's doing the coordinating?

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.820 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think that we've
really got the full answer.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.120 align:middle line:84%
Is it the CIA, as
some people have said?

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.660 align:middle line:84%
Or is it simply that
these guys in TTSA,

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.880 align:middle line:84%
they've all got intelligence
community backgrounds,

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.547 align:middle line:84%
and they've got their
media connections,

00:05:53.547 --> 00:05:57.790 align:middle line:84%
so are they a faction that,
for their own purposes,

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.838 align:middle line:84%
is promoting some
sort of disclosure?

00:05:59.838 --> 00:06:02.380 align:middle line:84%
And I don't really know that we
have the answers to that yet.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who is Luis Elizondo?

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Luis Elizondo is
someone that, I'll just say,

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.880 align:middle line:84%
I've not spoken
with him personally,

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.820 align:middle line:84%
but he is certainly,
along with Tom DeLonge,

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.650 align:middle line:84%
and probably now
even more than Tom

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.440 align:middle line:90%
DeLonge, the real face of TTSA.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.430 align:middle line:84%
He certainly was the face of
the TV show "Unidentified,"

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.020 align:middle line:90%
without a doubt.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.990 align:middle line:84%
He's always described the same
way, as a career intelligence

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:27.880 align:middle line:90%
officer within the Pentagon.

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The real
deal, we think.

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:30.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yeah.

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.400 align:middle line:84%
Not someone who has
been with CIA, as

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.200 align:middle line:84%
has been alleged
from time to time.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.360 align:middle line:90%
I've seen no evidence of that.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.610 align:middle line:84%
He may have worked with them,
but he's a Pentagon guy,

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:42.130 align:middle line:90%
and he's in intelligence there.

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:44.860 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot that's
not known, in my view,

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.090 align:middle line:84%
even now about why
he left when he did,

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.850 align:middle line:84%
what left the Pentagon
to join with TTSA.

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And having said all of that,
what I'm interested in,

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:59.320 align:middle line:84%
fundamentally, is the
content of what he is saying

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:04.390 align:middle line:84%
and the actual information
that he and the folks at TTSA

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:05.800 align:middle line:90%
are providing.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.360 align:middle line:84%
Motivations are
one thing, and it's

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.670 align:middle line:84%
important to
analyze motivations.

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:11.588 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, it's
really hard to know

00:07:11.588 --> 00:07:13.630 align:middle line:84%
and to speculate on what
everyone's motivation is

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:15.250 align:middle line:90%
or what their game plan is.

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.350 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, I'm much
more interested

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.540 align:middle line:84%
in actually seeing
what they're saying

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.610 align:middle line:84%
and what information
they are giving us.

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:24.623 align:middle line:84%
And on that basis, I would
say that he and his team

00:07:24.623 --> 00:07:26.290 align:middle line:84%
have given us quite
a lot of information

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.310 align:middle line:84%
to work with over these
last couple of years.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've mentioned
"The New York Times"

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.150 align:middle line:90%
and some other revelations.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:36.260 align:middle line:84%
MSNBC had a chance to
interview Elizondo.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.130 align:middle line:10%
>> A recent report by
"The New York Times"

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:41.370 align:middle line:10%
unveiled the distance of a
real-life "X-Files" department.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:43.500 align:middle line:10%
It's a five-year secret
government program

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.070 align:middle line:10%
to investigate mysterious
flying objects,

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:48.030 align:middle line:10%
and especially
focused on encounters

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:50.770 align:middle line:10%
by members of the
military, like this one.

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:54.002 align:middle line:10%
>> My gosh.

00:07:54.002 --> 00:07:55.460 align:middle line:10%
They're all going
against the wind.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.952 align:middle line:10%
The wind's 120
knots to the west.

00:07:57.952 --> 00:07:59.493 align:middle line:10%
Look at that thing, dude.

00:07:59.493 --> 00:08:01.410 align:middle line:10%
>> We're going to talk
about that in a second.

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:03.050 align:middle line:10%
The man who ran that
secret program now

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:05.180 align:middle line:10%
says the existence of
UFO those have been

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:06.690 align:middle line:10%
proved beyond reasonable doubt.

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:07.490 align:middle line:10%
He joins me now.

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:11.690 align:middle line:10%
Luis Elizondo, thank
you for joining us.

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:14.180 align:middle line:10%
Tell me why you ended
up working for a program

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.250 align:middle line:10%
that the Pentagon didn't
even want to admit existed?

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:20.720 align:middle line:10%
It was the Defense Department's
Advanced Aerospace Threat

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.040 align:middle line:10%
Identification Program.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.540 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't UFO hunters.

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:25.640 align:middle line:10%
You were looking
for explanations

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.860 align:middle line:10%
to things that were unexplained.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:29.810 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, that's
correct, Mr. Velshi.

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:33.049 align:middle line:10%
We basically were brought
into the program initially

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:36.320 align:middle line:10%
to identify and
try to figure out

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.159 align:middle line:10%
some of these phenomena
that were flying

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:42.578 align:middle line:10%
around our military
aircraft and our locations,

00:08:42.578 --> 00:08:44.870 align:middle line:10%
and basically try to collect
enough data where we could

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:47.030 align:middle line:10%
make some positive
analysis and identify

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:48.140 align:middle line:10%
what these things were.

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:50.515 align:middle line:10%
>> The things that I've been
reported are that it was $22

00:08:50.515 --> 00:08:52.760 align:middle line:10%
million spent over a few years.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:56.000 align:middle line:10%
It was people like you who had
other jobs in the military,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.660 align:middle line:10%
but came together to try
and figure these things out.

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:03.410 align:middle line:10%
And that there were facilities
that were leased and built

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:05.835 align:middle line:10%
to hold things that were found.

00:09:05.835 --> 00:09:06.710 align:middle line:10%
What can you tell me?

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:08.930 align:middle line:10%
What can you tell me about
what this program did?

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:10.280 align:middle line:10%
>> Sure.

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:14.770 align:middle line:10%
Well, first and foremost,
just so your viewers

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:18.090 align:middle line:10%
understand, I still hold
a security clearance,

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:20.030 align:middle line:10%
so there are certain
things I, unfortunately,

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:21.170 align:middle line:10%
will not be able to talk about.

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:21.740 align:middle line:10%
>> Understood.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.823 align:middle line:10%
>> And because I'm no
longer employed with the US

00:09:23.823 --> 00:09:26.240 align:middle line:10%
government, you're going to
have to bring up some of these

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.990 align:middle line:10%
questions with the US
government directly.

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:31.850 align:middle line:10%
But I can tell you, from
our perspective, since 2008,

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:33.860 align:middle line:10%
we collected a lot
of information.

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:35.930 align:middle line:10%
Frankly, it wasn't just
eyewitness testimony.

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:39.290 align:middle line:10%
It also included
signature data from radar.

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:40.220 align:middle line:10%
Video, as well.

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:43.730 align:middle line:10%
It also included other
eyewitness testimony

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:47.060 align:middle line:10%
from radar operators that
were on scene, air traffic

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:48.260 align:middle line:10%
controllers.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.510 align:middle line:10%
And so basically, we put all
this information together

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:53.442 align:middle line:10%
to try to identify, if we
could, a signature-- basically,

00:09:53.442 --> 00:09:55.400 align:middle line:10%
something that gave us
a common picture of what

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.690 align:middle line:10%
we were looking at.

00:09:56.690 --> 00:10:01.520 align:middle line:10%
And in many cases, we weren't
able to find what that was.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:05.210 align:middle line:10%
So it didn't match any signature
of a aircraft, or a drone,

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:08.810 align:middle line:10%
or a missile, or anything
else from a DOD or Department

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:11.905 align:middle line:10%
of Defense perspective that we
would normally be looking for.

00:10:11.905 --> 00:10:14.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Richard, sounds
like Project Blue Book all

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:15.230 align:middle line:90%
over again, doesn't it?

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: It does, but you
notice with this interview,

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:21.110 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of the other ones that
we're seeing on the mainstream

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:23.445 align:middle line:90%
media, is the tone.

00:10:23.445 --> 00:10:25.370 align:middle line:90%
This is a very serious tone.

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:29.870 align:middle line:84%
Like, that's actually a
very major shift going on,

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:32.560 align:middle line:84%
because these types of
encounters that Elizondo

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.010 align:middle line:90%
is describing here--

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:35.930 align:middle line:84%
they go back many,
many, many years.

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:37.430 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this is
not a new thing.

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:41.465 align:middle line:84%
But what's fascinating is,
and you saw this on MSNBC--

00:10:41.465 --> 00:10:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you got to
thank MSNBC for this.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:44.465 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: You see it on CNN.

00:10:44.465 --> 00:10:45.680 align:middle line:90%
You see it on Fox.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.550 align:middle line:84%
They're all handling
this in a way that

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:53.210 align:middle line:84%
is serious that had not
been the case in just

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:54.450 align:middle line:90%
a few years earlier.

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:58.640 align:middle line:84%
So there's a seismic shift
in the mainstream media

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.110 align:middle line:90%
portrayal of this.

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of the study
that they're talking about,

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.730 align:middle line:84%
you've mentioned it's
like another Blue Book.

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:08.360 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, to a certain extent,
I guess we could say that.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:12.680 align:middle line:84%
It's a government study
that's rebooting this,

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.870 align:middle line:84%
let's look into
the UFO phenomenon.

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:17.870 align:middle line:84%
The one thing that I've always
noticed that I have always

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:20.000 align:middle line:84%
taken a little bit
of issue with is

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.960 align:middle line:84%
how, when they're talking about
this UFO phenomenon nowadays,

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.060 align:middle line:84%
it's as if there's no
history to this whatsoever.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like it just started.

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:29.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Like it
just started, right.

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:31.130 align:middle line:84%
So we're like, well,
we've got these sightings.

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:32.340 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what they are.

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:33.140 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what?

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:37.070 align:middle line:84%
These sightings go back-- we've
got crystal-clear documentation

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:42.080 align:middle line:84%
going back to the 1950s, 1940s,
at the least of US government

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.240 align:middle line:84%
documents describing
objects moving

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.710 align:middle line:84%
at speeds in the multiple
thousands of miles per hour

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:47.510 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:49.980 align:middle line:90%
So it's not new.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost like
they're siphoning out

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.200 align:middle line:84%
the history from
this phenomenon.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.270 align:middle line:84%
I think I know why
they're doing that.

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:59.450 align:middle line:84%
I think it's basically a public
relations, political decision

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:00.380 align:middle line:90%
they've made.

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:05.300 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, it does
distort the actual narrative

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:06.380 align:middle line:90%
of what's happening.

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Even so, I'm very heartened
by the seriousness

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:12.260 align:middle line:84%
that we're seeing in that
and other types of interviews

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.540 align:middle line:84%
that we're getting in
the mainstream on this.

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:18.097 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is Elizondo
the new J. Allen Hyneck?

00:12:18.097 --> 00:12:19.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: I don't believe so, no.

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:21.530 align:middle line:90%
He's a spokesperson.

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:24.727 align:middle line:90%


00:12:24.727 --> 00:12:26.810 align:middle line:10%
When you look at the sum
total of what Hyneck did,

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:31.190 align:middle line:10%
he genuinely was
studying these reports

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:35.570 align:middle line:10%
for many, many years for
the United States Air Force.

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:38.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I think Hyneck
always was a believer.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:41.570 align:middle line:84%
For some reason, I think
the government kind

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:44.360 align:middle line:90%
of forced him to be a skeptic.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.670 align:middle line:84%
There's been some
discussion, for example,

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:51.300 align:middle line:84%
that he was told
something about swamp gas.

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:52.550 align:middle line:90%
Remember that one in Michigan?

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:53.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Oh, yeah.

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:54.260 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.082 align:middle line:84%
He always claimed that
Hector Quintanilla--

00:12:56.082 --> 00:12:57.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Forced him to do it.

00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:58.640 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yeah, he did say that.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.750 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's true what you say.

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:03.360 align:middle line:84%
There's a Hyneck speech that
I was just recently reading

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:08.650 align:middle line:84%
from like 1960, so this is
way before swamp gas happened.

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:11.880 align:middle line:84%
In the depths of the Air
Force cover-up of UFOs,

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.050 align:middle line:90%
Hyneck was their consultant.

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And I read a lecture he gave
to some Air Force people.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And what was very clear is
he had a detailed knowledge

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.760 align:middle line:84%
of the UFO phenomenon
through the '50s,

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:28.307 align:middle line:84%
and he was obviously taking it
very seriously even back then.

00:13:28.307 --> 00:13:29.390 align:middle line:90%
So I would agree with you.

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:31.710 align:middle line:84%
I think by virtue
of his position,

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:35.520 align:middle line:84%
he was kind of forced into
that skeptical attitude.

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.060 align:middle line:84%
So no, I don't think Elizondo
is quite like Hyneck,

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:40.230 align:middle line:90%
but he's Elizondo.

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And he's doing what he can in
his way to get this issue out

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:46.652 align:middle line:90%
to the public.

00:13:46.652 --> 00:13:48.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that
there are no ulterior

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.730 align:middle line:84%
motivations behind what
these guys are doing.

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:52.560 align:middle line:90%
There probably are.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:56.270 align:middle line:84%
What I'm glad to see, and I
make no bones about saying this,

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:58.470 align:middle line:90%
that I'm glad--

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:01.980 align:middle line:84%
the kinds of research that I've
done in my histories of the UFO

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:03.090 align:middle line:90%
phenomenon--

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:06.120 align:middle line:84%
the military encounters, the
hundreds of military encounters

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.320 align:middle line:90%
that we've documented--

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:13.290 align:middle line:84%
that, in fact, do indicate cause
for national security concern.

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:15.065 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote about
this to great lengths.

00:14:15.065 --> 00:14:17.190 align:middle line:84%
These are a lot of the
types of things that they're

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:21.240 align:middle line:84%
talking about here now with
TTSA in their public statements,

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.220 align:middle line:84%
and in their TV
show, "Unidentified."

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:26.387 align:middle line:84%
So I'm glad to see that
some of this is getting out.

00:14:26.387 --> 00:14:28.470 align:middle line:84%
Whether we're dealing with
a genuine threat or not

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:29.290 align:middle line:90%
is another issue.

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:31.800 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is that these
are military encounters,

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.320 align:middle line:84%
and the public needs
to know about them.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If somebody like
Elizondo simply said,

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:38.880 align:middle line:84%
I used to do this
for the government,

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.880 align:middle line:84%
and then started speaking
the way he's speaking,

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:44.850 align:middle line:84%
and he was not that person,
would the government

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:48.150 align:middle line:84%
come forward and say, We
have no idea who this guy is.

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:51.360 align:middle line:90%
He never worked for us.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.790 align:middle line:84%
I guess where I'm coming
from is, how do we

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:54.790 align:middle line:90%
know he's the real deal?

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:56.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Yeah, it's
a fair question.

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:58.560 align:middle line:84%
Of course, Christopher
Sherwood of the Pentagon--

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.300 align:middle line:84%
he's one of their
spokespersons--

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:03.270 align:middle line:84%
made such a statement
not too long ago,

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:06.510 align:middle line:84%
basically denying that
Elizondo was indeed

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:09.310 align:middle line:90%
part of the AATIP program.

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:12.510 align:middle line:84%
I remember when that came
out, and I was asked that day

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:13.560 align:middle line:90%
for a comment.

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And my answer then,
as it has always been,

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:21.110 align:middle line:84%
is, I'll wait to see real
confirmation of that.

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:26.220 align:middle line:84%
The fact is what I have come
to understand from journalists

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.680 align:middle line:84%
and military people
that I've spoken

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.500 align:middle line:84%
to about this is that there
is a war going on right now

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:32.760 align:middle line:90%
within the Pentagon.

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And there are Pentagon factions
that hate what TTSA is doing--

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:39.590 align:middle line:90%
hate it.

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And then there are
others that support it.

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:45.040 align:middle line:84%
When a Pentagon spokesperson
makes a statement,

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.980 align:middle line:84%
it could be true, or
it could not be true,

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:49.245 align:middle line:84%
or there could be
some other nuance

00:15:49.245 --> 00:15:50.370 align:middle line:90%
that we're not getting yet.

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:54.210 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just as soon waiting
to see what the full truth is.

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:58.110 align:middle line:84%
But no, I've spoken to one
other individual within TTSA who

00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:middle line:84%
said, No, he absolutely
was working in AATIP

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.836 align:middle line:84%
and he had a highly
responsible position there,

00:16:05.836 --> 00:16:07.242 align:middle line:90%
for what it's worth.

00:16:07.242 --> 00:16:08.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
these artifacts

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:09.700 align:middle line:90%
that you have mentioned?

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:10.960 align:middle line:90%
What do they have?

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well, this is really
where it gets interesting,

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:16.350 align:middle line:84%
because when "The New York
Times" article first came out

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:20.520 align:middle line:84%
in December 2017, they
talked about mysterious metal

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.878 align:middle line:84%
alloys-- was the phrase that
they used in that article.

00:16:22.878 --> 00:16:24.420 align:middle line:84%
But what we're
actually talking about

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.810 align:middle line:84%
are what are known
as metamaterials.

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:28.470 align:middle line:90%
What is a metamaterial?

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:31.210 align:middle line:84%
I had to look this up,
just like everyone else.

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:38.380 align:middle line:84%
So a metamaterial is a highly
engineered type of material,

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:41.820 align:middle line:84%
particularly at the
microscopic level,

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:44.370 align:middle line:84%
that is often described as
being constructed in what they

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:47.760 align:middle line:90%
call lattice-like structures.

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.850 align:middle line:84%
So I guess what
you could say is,

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:53.430 align:middle line:84%
at a very, very
small, tiny level,

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:57.720 align:middle line:84%
these are very sophisticated
artificially-constructed

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:58.855 align:middle line:90%
materials.

00:16:58.855 --> 00:17:00.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Much more than
carbon fibers, for example.

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:02.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: I guess so, yes.

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:04.859 align:middle line:84%
And what we have
come to understand

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:09.660 align:middle line:84%
is that they are in
possession of multiple samples

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:11.010 align:middle line:90%
of metamaterial.

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:14.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's one that's
fairly well-known.

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:17.880 align:middle line:84%
This has been discussed by
the physicist, Hal Puthoff,

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:18.960 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of 2018.

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.793 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he's with
To The Stars Academy.

00:17:20.793 --> 00:17:22.265 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: He is indeed.

00:17:22.265 --> 00:17:26.700 align:middle line:84%
I think he's listed as basically
the chief of their science

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:27.869 align:middle line:90%
division.

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:30.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, Hal Puthoff is
the one person in TTSA

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:31.560 align:middle line:84%
that I do know
personally and I've

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.840 align:middle line:90%
spoken to on many occasions.

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:38.640 align:middle line:84%
He gave an absolutely
astonishing lecture

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:43.720 align:middle line:84%
in June of 2018 for the Society
of Scientific Exploration.

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is a lecture
that's still available.

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:46.470 align:middle line:90%
It's on the web.

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:47.790 align:middle line:90%
People can look for it.

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:50.700 align:middle line:84%
The point is, what he
did is he described

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:55.440 align:middle line:84%
this artifact, this material,
and it is extraordinary.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.240 align:middle line:84%
His statement was,
well, this allegedly

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.980 align:middle line:90%
came from a crash retrieval.

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:02.333 align:middle line:10%
During the 1990s, his
lab looked at this.

00:18:02.333 --> 00:18:03.750 align:middle line:84%
And he said, for
the longest time,

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:06.960 align:middle line:84%
they couldn't even figure
out not only who could have

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.760 align:middle line:90%
made it, but what it was for.

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the
composition, right?

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:13.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Yeah, so it's a very,
very fine series of layers

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:15.510 align:middle line:90%
of bismuth and magnesium.

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And they're like,
What is this for?

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:17.790 align:middle line:90%
We have no idea.

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:19.457 align:middle line:84%
And then he said,
Well, we've eventually

00:18:19.457 --> 00:18:21.300 align:middle line:90%
realized what it can be for.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:24.660 align:middle line:84%
He said, Only recently, we
discovered it is a very--

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:27.780 align:middle line:84%
he called it an
outstanding wave guide

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:30.690 align:middle line:84%
for high frequency
electromagnetic radiation,

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:31.990 align:middle line:90%
terahertz range.

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:33.790 align:middle line:90%
Had to look all that up.

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:35.610 align:middle line:84%
So with that meant,
essentially, is

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:37.350 align:middle line:84%
that it provides an
anti-gravitic effect.

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:38.270 align:middle line:90%
It's a wave guide.

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:42.480 align:middle line:84%
It guides a wave and
creates some version

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:43.780 align:middle line:90%
of an anti-gravitic effect.

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:47.602 align:middle line:84%
So this is the skin of
the craft, apparently.

00:18:47.602 --> 00:18:49.560 align:middle line:84%
That's a takeaway that
I'd never really thought

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:51.000 align:middle line:90%
about, to be honest with you.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.310 align:middle line:10%
When we talk about how
these UFOs do what they do,

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:55.920 align:middle line:10%
we're thinking of their engine.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:58.230 align:middle line:84%
But what about the skin
of the craft itself?

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:01.260 align:middle line:84%
And in his estimation,
that's what this

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:03.330 align:middle line:90%
appears to be functioning as.

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:04.957 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it's very physical.

00:19:04.957 --> 00:19:06.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: And it's
something that, when

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:08.610 align:middle line:84%
you look at the level
of the engineering,

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:11.370 align:middle line:84%
we're talking down to
the nanometer level,

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:14.820 align:middle line:84%
and even apparently down
to the Angstrom level.

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:17.580 align:middle line:84%
This is a level of
engineering that, as far

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:20.650 align:middle line:84%
as I've been able to see,
we are not there yet.

00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And what I would like to
see is additional scientific

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.720 align:middle line:84%
laboratories really
dig into this

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.970 align:middle line:84%
because one lab is
important, but we

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:33.810 align:middle line:84%
need many, many
confirmation labs here.

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:35.340 align:middle line:84%
And I would love
to see that happen.

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:37.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how did we
get the material, Richard?

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:38.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: This came
to Coast to Coast

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.830 align:middle line:84%
back in the '90s, back
in the Art Bell days.

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:41.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Art's Parts.

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:42.457 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: That's right.

00:19:42.457 --> 00:19:45.690 align:middle line:84%
He gave it to Linda Moulton
Howe, who held it for a while,

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:47.590 align:middle line:90%
and she shopped it around.

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
places she shopped

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:50.903 align:middle line:90%
it too was Hal Puthoff's lab.

00:19:50.903 --> 00:19:52.320 align:middle line:84%
So that's the whole
story of that.

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:54.158 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
quite fascinating.

00:19:54.158 --> 00:19:55.200 align:middle line:90%
So there's no provenance.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.810 align:middle line:84%
We don't really know where
this ultimately is from,

00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:00.302 align:middle line:84%
but we've known about
it since the '90s.

00:20:00.302 --> 00:20:01.260 align:middle line:90%
And that's interesting.

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:03.390 align:middle line:90%
That's at least 25 years.

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:05.700 align:middle line:84%
Even aside from the
provenance, the material

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:08.130 align:middle line:84%
itself seems to be
quite extraordinary.

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:09.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's dramatic.

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: It's quite
amazing, and allegedly

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:12.780 align:middle line:90%
from a UFO crash retrieval.

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:13.740 align:middle line:90%
That's the story.

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.157 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When "The
New York Times"

00:20:15.157 --> 00:20:17.280 align:middle line:84%
came out with its story
about the military chasing

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:19.710 align:middle line:90%
the Tic-Tac-looking UFO--

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:21.780 align:middle line:90%
Tic Tac being the little mint--

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:23.610 align:middle line:84%
let's take a look
at the CNN report

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:27.000 align:middle line:84%
about this incredible
Tic Tac UFO case.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Commander David Fravor still
can't explain what he says he

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.380 align:middle line:90%
saw that day.

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:33.030 align:middle line:10%
November 2004.

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:35.640 align:middle line:10%
The Navy fighter pilot was
on a training mission west

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.250 align:middle line:10%
of San Diego when he was
ordered to check out something

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:40.320 align:middle line:10%
in the water not far away.

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.810 align:middle line:84%
On a clear day,
over a smooth ocean,

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:45.540 align:middle line:84%
he saw the object,
waves breaking over it,

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:48.315 align:middle line:84%
and says he saw something
hovering above it.

00:20:48.315 --> 00:20:52.660 align:middle line:10%
>> It's randomly moving north,
south, east, west, just random.

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:55.320 align:middle line:10%
Just stopping, going
the other direction,

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.820 align:middle line:10%
like you could do
with a helicopter,

00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:59.560 align:middle line:10%
but a little bit more abrupt.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.710 align:middle line:10%
And it looked like a
40-foot-long Tic Tac

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:02.970 align:middle line:10%
with no wings.

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:05.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Fravor says he and
his four-man team tracked

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:08.700 align:middle line:84%
the object for several minutes
until it just disappeared.

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:10.800 align:middle line:84%
Tonight, CNN has
learned the Pentagon had

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:13.350 align:middle line:84%
a secretive program
to research UFOs,

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:16.230 align:middle line:90%
like the one Fravor spotted.

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:18.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you think that was?

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:20.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Well, it's a UFO.

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:22.740 align:middle line:84%
It's the kind of
UFO that we have

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:26.910 align:middle line:84%
records of going back to the
1940s, at the very least.

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:28.530 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting
here is you've

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:32.640 align:middle line:84%
got a witness, David Fravor,
who is of a very high caliber.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.470 align:middle line:84%
He's an experienced
Navy pilot, and he

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:37.500 align:middle line:84%
was willing to go on the
record about his experiences.

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And of course, since
then, since that came out,

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:43.110 align:middle line:84%
we've had a number of
additional witnesses, who

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:46.050 align:middle line:84%
were part of the Nimitz and
the Princeton group that

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:49.290 align:middle line:84%
was out into the ocean off
the coast of California who

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:51.450 align:middle line:84%
have provided additional
detail on this.

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:53.400 align:middle line:90%
So really, it's an amazing case.

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.010 align:middle line:84%
But this object,
described as a Tic Tac

00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:59.460 align:middle line:84%
roughly 40 feet in
diameter, they're

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:01.908 align:middle line:84%
vectored in because they
had been tracking this.

00:22:01.908 --> 00:22:04.200 align:middle line:84%
The battle group and been
tracking this for some time--

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.210 align:middle line:90%
days and weeks, in fact--

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:10.440 align:middle line:84%
doing incredible maneuvers
tracked on the radar,

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:15.360 align:middle line:84%
at one point dropping
28,000 feet in 0.78 seconds.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.020 align:middle line:90%
It was just extraordinary.

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:19.000 align:middle line:84%
That's over 20,000
miles per hour.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.210 align:middle line:84%
So they get it now, and they've
got two F/A-18 Super Hornets

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:26.330 align:middle line:84%
out there at the time,
and they're vectored in.

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:29.550 align:middle line:84%
So Fravor sees it, and as he's
described this many times,

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:32.190 align:middle line:84%
he's circling around
to go down to it,

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:37.770 align:middle line:84%
and it rises up from the ocean
surface and circles around him

00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:39.210 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And it comes up and then shoots
off at an unbelievable speed.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And he's always
said, visibility was

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:49.110 align:middle line:84%
perfect for 10 miles,
and general visibility

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:50.250 align:middle line:90%
for 50 miles.

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:52.380 align:middle line:84%
That thing was out of
sight in two seconds.

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:54.233 align:middle line:84%
So even if you do a
conservative estimate

00:22:54.233 --> 00:22:55.650 align:middle line:84%
of 10 miles in two
seconds, you're

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:59.010 align:middle line:84%
talking something like
9,000 miles per hour.

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:01.950 align:middle line:84%
We don't have anything
officially that can do that.

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:05.250 align:middle line:84%
And what strikes me in looking
at the history of this is,

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:07.860 align:middle line:84%
we have reports going
back to the late '40s

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:14.130 align:middle line:84%
where those exact speeds were
being reported back then.

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And they have always
been reported on and off

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:18.420 align:middle line:84%
over the years by
military personnel.

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:22.530 align:middle line:84%
So to me, when you ask what
that is, I say, that is a UFO.

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:25.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this UFO playing
cat and mouse with us?

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:29.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: What it seems to me
is that there's a long history

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:34.860 align:middle line:84%
of these objects snooping
or peeking at US military--

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:35.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Testing.

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yeah, or exercises.

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:38.520 align:middle line:90%
And they're there.

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:41.370 align:middle line:84%
So this is a battle group
maneuver in the ocean.

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:46.260 align:middle line:84%
They were doing important war
game exercises and so forth.

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And it seems like it
got someone's attention.

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:50.550 align:middle line:90%
That's what it looks like to me.

00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:52.290 align:middle line:84%
Again, this is an
old story, George.

00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:54.517 align:middle line:84%
This has been going on for
decades and generations.

00:23:54.517 --> 00:23:55.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:57.058 align:middle line:84%
It's just great it's
starting to come out

00:23:57.058 --> 00:24:00.150 align:middle line:84%
of the public limelight
with mainstream media.

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:01.470 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: That's the difference.

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:04.230 align:middle line:84%
It's not that this
is something new.

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:05.700 align:middle line:90%
It isn't something new.

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:10.290 align:middle line:84%
But what is new is, at
least in the modern era,

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:15.040 align:middle line:84%
the way that this has been
covered by the establishment

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:15.840 align:middle line:90%
media.

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:17.450 align:middle line:90%
That is the shocking change.

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:20.745 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you feel vindicated
when you see stories like this?

00:24:20.745 --> 00:24:22.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've
devoted your life,

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.150 align:middle line:90%
your career to the subject.

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:26.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: On one
level, I've never

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:28.170 align:middle line:84%
felt that I would
need vindication

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:31.320 align:middle line:84%
from an official source to
say oh, yeah, you've been

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:32.773 align:middle line:90%
on the right track all along.

00:24:32.773 --> 00:24:34.440 align:middle line:84%
I've been very confident
all these years

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:37.650 align:middle line:84%
that I've been on at least
a correct enough path

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:40.710 align:middle line:84%
to say that there is a
genuine phenomenon that

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:42.540 align:middle line:90%
has not been fully explained.

00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's important,
and we need to have

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:46.863 align:middle line:90%
a public discussion on it.

00:24:46.863 --> 00:24:48.780 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, there's the
vindication in the sense

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:52.200 align:middle line:84%
that we're now beginning to
have that public discussion.

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.640 align:middle line:90%
And I'm very glad about that.

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:55.350 align:middle line:90%
We have a long way to go.

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:57.600 align:middle line:90%
We're still taking baby steps.

00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.910 align:middle line:10%
There's many, many
questions that have not yet

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:04.870 align:middle line:10%
been asked publicly about
the nature of the cover-up.

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:07.710 align:middle line:84%
This is very important, and it's
a real thing that's going on.

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And we're not really
getting into that here.

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:15.690 align:middle line:84%
But when I really think about
the depths of the UFO secrecy

00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:19.530 align:middle line:84%
that has occurred for more
than 70-plus years now,

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:22.590 align:middle line:84%
it becomes obvious
to me that this

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:25.110 align:middle line:84%
is a really tough thing just
to snap your fingers and say,

00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:26.150 align:middle line:90%
it's all out.

00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:27.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's
going to work that way.

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:30.270 align:middle line:84%
10 years ago, I co-authored
a book on disclosure.

00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:32.280 align:middle line:90%
We called it "After Disclosure."

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:35.580 align:middle line:10%
And our supposition back then--
we were writing this in 2009,

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:36.690 align:middle line:10%
2010--

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:38.700 align:middle line:10%
was that a disclosure
event would

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:43.350 align:middle line:10%
be a sudden, earth-shattering
avalanche of something that

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:45.760 align:middle line:10%
would be unstoppable.

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think now that
I would modify that,

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:53.280 align:middle line:84%
and I would say
this, that there's

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:57.030 align:middle line:84%
a long ramp-up to
that full disclosure.

00:25:57.030 --> 00:26:00.270 align:middle line:84%
I think there is an avalanche
moment that will happen,

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:01.600 align:middle line:90%
but we're not there yet.

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And I think what we're
seeing in the meantime are

00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:07.770 align:middle line:84%
all of these little,
little steps that,

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:09.130 align:middle line:90%
for better or for worse--

00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:10.530 align:middle line:90%
and often for worse--

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:12.930 align:middle line:84%
that the establishment
mainstream media is

00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:15.000 align:middle line:90%
pushing out very, very slowly.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.150 align:middle line:84%
But they're doing it,
and it's very, very slow.

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:20.150 align:middle line:84%
But again, it's like
toothpaste out of the tube.

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:21.820 align:middle line:84%
Once it's out, it's
not going back in.

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:24.470 align:middle line:84%
So we're seeing more and more
of this information now coming

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:25.270 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And we're looking at clips
of the initial reporting,

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.910 align:middle line:84%
of course, of the Tic
Tac UFO and of AATIP,

00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:33.520 align:middle line:84%
but there's been more
and more information

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:37.720 align:middle line:84%
that has been coming out, some
of it in unofficial tweets

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:41.050 align:middle line:84%
by the TTSA folks, and some
in interviews that they're

00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:43.150 align:middle line:90%
given on various networks.

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And there's more and more
information coming out.

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:47.938 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How important it
is the To The Stars Academy?

00:26:47.938 --> 00:26:50.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well, I think they've
done something very important,

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:55.870 align:middle line:84%
something that frankly, no
one else has been able to do.

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:58.000 align:middle line:84%
They've been able to
take this subject,

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.650 align:middle line:84%
which has been relegated
to the fringe for so long,

00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:08.710 align:middle line:84%
and they've been able to move
it right here to a mainstream

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:12.250 align:middle line:84%
conversation where we're not
getting the "X-Files" music.

00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:13.990 align:middle line:84%
We're not getting
the giggle factor.

00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:15.610 align:middle line:84%
We're getting a
serious conversation.

00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:18.350 align:middle line:84%
That's something that no
one has been able to do,

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:19.450 align:middle line:90%
and they did it.

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:23.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, they've done it because
they are a series of government

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:25.570 align:middle line:84%
insiders, and they've
done it because they

00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:28.732 align:middle line:84%
have those connections that
many people on the outside

00:27:28.732 --> 00:27:30.940 align:middle line:84%
will look down on, and
despise, and say, well, you're

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:32.382 align:middle line:90%
just part of the establishment.

00:27:32.382 --> 00:27:34.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, be that as it
may, they've done it.

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:35.140 align:middle line:90%
So that's important.

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And we need to keep looking at
the motivations of those people

00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:42.520 align:middle line:84%
who are pushing this,
absolutely, but I just

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:45.640 align:middle line:84%
feel like we don't want to lose
sight of the accomplishment--

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:47.740 align:middle line:84%
and it is an
accomplishment-- by getting

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:53.110 align:middle line:84%
this fringe subject to a
place where we're actually

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:56.050 align:middle line:84%
able to have public
conversations about this.

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:58.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Rock star Tom DeLonge,
who put this organization

00:27:58.850 --> 00:27:59.650 align:middle line:90%
together--

00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:03.190 align:middle line:84%
I would see him at events
for years, Richard,

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:05.950 align:middle line:84%
and I'd always say, well,
he's a rock star who's

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:07.170 align:middle line:90%
just interested in UFOs.

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:08.170 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Right, exactly.

00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:09.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And all of
a sudden, one day,

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:12.010 align:middle line:90%
this organization popped up.

00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:13.570 align:middle line:90%
And I went, wow.

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:14.617 align:middle line:90%
He pulled it together.

00:28:14.617 --> 00:28:15.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Well, he ran into them.

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:16.780 align:middle line:90%
They ran into him.

00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:18.370 align:middle line:84%
I think you had a
lot of people who

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:21.730 align:middle line:90%
saw a mutual symbiosis here.

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:24.220 align:middle line:84%
And yes, it's been put
together in a way that

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:26.297 align:middle line:90%
is getting a lot of traction.

00:28:26.297 --> 00:28:27.880 align:middle line:84%
They made a couple
of gaffes, a couple

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:29.290 align:middle line:90%
of mistakes out of the gate.

00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:31.810 align:middle line:84%
Having a picture
of a mylar balloon

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:35.650 align:middle line:84%
as a UFO on their first
presentation to the public

00:28:35.650 --> 00:28:38.620 align:middle line:84%
was something that
should have been avoided.

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And there have been
other things, as well.

00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:45.700 align:middle line:84%
But I would say, yes, it's
been a fundamentally successful

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:46.870 align:middle line:90%
venture that they've had.

00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:50.350 align:middle line:84%
Richard, we've been talking
about these two F/A-18s that

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:52.440 align:middle line:90%
were chasing this Tic Tac.

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.530 align:middle line:90%
An amazing, amazing story.

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:59.070 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at it again, and
then we'll talk about it.

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:02.105 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, that is a
[BLEEP] drone, bro.

00:29:02.105 --> 00:29:03.480 align:middle line:10%
>> There's a whole
fleet of them.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.670 align:middle line:10%
Look on the ASA.

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:08.380 align:middle line:10%
>> My gosh.

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:10.080 align:middle line:10%
>> They're all going
against the wind.

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.163 align:middle line:10%
The wind's 120
knots to the west.

00:29:12.163 --> 00:29:13.330 align:middle line:10%
>> Look at that thing, dude.

00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:22.950 align:middle line:90%


00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:24.655 align:middle line:10%
>> That's not an
LNS though, it is?

00:29:24.655 --> 00:29:26.095 align:middle line:10%
>> That is an LNS, dude.

00:29:26.095 --> 00:29:26.970 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, if there's--

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:28.630 align:middle line:10%
>> Look at that thing.

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:29.430 align:middle line:10%
>> It's rotating.

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:33.810 align:middle line:90%


00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:36.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That can't be
Russian, can't be Chinese.

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:39.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Yeah, that's
the so-called gimbal UFO,

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:40.770 align:middle line:90%
and I agree with you.

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:42.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's
Russian or Chinese.

00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:46.998 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen a good argument
that would make that claim.

00:29:46.998 --> 00:29:49.290 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting is you
get these statements from the

00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:50.153 align:middle line:90%
To The Stars folks--

00:29:50.153 --> 00:29:51.570 align:middle line:84%
Elizondo, and
Christopher Mellon's

00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:53.510 align:middle line:84%
another one-- who
will say, well, we

00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:55.290 align:middle line:84%
don't know what
these things are,

00:29:55.290 --> 00:29:58.650 align:middle line:84%
and but let's just walk
ourselves through it.

00:29:58.650 --> 00:30:00.500 align:middle line:84%
No one has believed
that it's Russian.

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:03.000 align:middle line:84%
There's not been one credible
explanation that it's Russian,

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.580 align:middle line:90%
or Chinese, or any other nation.

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:07.260 align:middle line:84%
There's been some
speculation that this

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:09.960 align:middle line:84%
is some kind of
classified project

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:15.360 align:middle line:84%
that the Americans have, and
that's always a possibility.

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:18.905 align:middle line:84%
But there hasn't really
been any speculation

00:30:18.905 --> 00:30:20.280 align:middle line:84%
as to what that
could possibly be

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:21.943 align:middle line:90%
that would explain it, either.

00:30:21.943 --> 00:30:23.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's new
technology if it's

00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:25.462 align:middle line:90%
ours-- brand new technology.

00:30:25.462 --> 00:30:27.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Yeah, except
for the fact that, again,

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:31.320 align:middle line:84%
as I've been saying, this is
just like every good UFO report

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:33.990 align:middle line:84%
we've had for the
past 70-plus years.

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:36.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, the videos
themselves don't really

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:38.250 align:middle line:84%
prove that we're dealing
with genuine UFOs.

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:41.940 align:middle line:84%
So my view is, I take the
video along with the testimony.

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And when you look
at the testimony,

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:47.550 align:middle line:84%
by Fravor and all the
other pilots, and this

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:50.580 align:middle line:84%
includes off the Eastern
US coast in 2014, 2015,

00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:53.610 align:middle line:84%
the USS Roosevelt sightings,
which are also interesting.

00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:56.250 align:middle line:84%
All of these combined tell me
that there is a technology that

00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:59.430 align:middle line:90%
is not being explained.

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:02.147 align:middle line:84%
And we do not know how to
explain this stuff yet.

00:31:02.147 --> 00:31:02.947 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:31:02.947 --> 00:31:04.560 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about the
Roosevelt sightings.

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:04.710 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yeah.

00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:05.627 align:middle line:90%
It's very interesting.

00:31:05.627 --> 00:31:08.130 align:middle line:84%
So this came out in the second,
more recent "New York Times"

00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:10.470 align:middle line:90%
piece from 2019.

00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And this is a
series of interviews

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:13.650 align:middle line:90%
done with Navy personnel.

00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:17.190 align:middle line:84%
The USS Roosevelt was doing
Naval exercises off the US East

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:20.850 align:middle line:84%
Coast, the coast of Virginia,
even going down to Florida

00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:24.120 align:middle line:84%
at times, from 2014
to 2015 over, I think,

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.870 align:middle line:90%
a nine-month period.

00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And what we are told is
that practically every day

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:34.710 align:middle line:84%
during that period,
or most of those days,

00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:36.863 align:middle line:90%
they were dealing with UFOs.

00:31:36.863 --> 00:31:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And they were
dealing with objects

00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:41.130 align:middle line:84%
that were demonstrating
performance capabilities

00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:43.230 align:middle line:84%
that they did not
know how to explain.

00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And all of the classic
things that we see with UFO

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:48.480 align:middle line:84%
reports over the years,
they were dealing with.

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:49.800 align:middle line:90%
So this is an admission.

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:52.950 align:middle line:90%
Now, 2014, 2015 is quite recent.

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:57.510 align:middle line:84%
So there was one really
extraordinary event

00:31:57.510 --> 00:32:00.040 align:middle line:90%
they were describing.

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.300 align:middle line:90%
It's really quite shocking.

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:05.010 align:middle line:84%
On one occasion, you've got
these two F/A-18 Super Hornet

00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:08.740 align:middle line:84%
planes flying in tandem, I
believe about 100 feet apart.

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:10.060 align:middle line:90%
It's not that far.

00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:12.150 align:middle line:84%
They're doing their
maneuvers, and an object

00:32:12.150 --> 00:32:14.130 align:middle line:90%
flies between them.

00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:15.097 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:32:15.097 --> 00:32:15.930 align:middle line:90%
Just out of nowhere?

00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:18.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: I think at them
and between the aircraft.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:21.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it's whatever this was.

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And just one of the pilots
apparently saw it well enough

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:27.935 align:middle line:90%
to describe it as cube-shaped--

00:32:27.935 --> 00:32:29.220 align:middle line:90%
it's like, what does that--

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:32.460 align:middle line:84%
with a sphere of some
sort in the middle.

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:38.865 align:middle line:84%
And their attitude was, up
until now, we were thinking,

00:32:38.865 --> 00:32:41.490 align:middle line:84%
well, if this is some classified
thing that we're dealing with,

00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:42.100 align:middle line:90%
that's one thing.

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:43.740 align:middle line:84%
But when they're
flying between us,

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:47.130 align:middle line:84%
that's actually a
safety hazard, big time.

00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:50.220 align:middle line:84%
I read a military
piece that speculated

00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:52.410 align:middle line:84%
whether this might be
some kind of technology

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:53.670 align:middle line:90%
that we've created.

00:32:53.670 --> 00:32:56.580 align:middle line:84%
But frankly, I didn't
find that particular piece

00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:59.430 align:middle line:84%
very persuasive, and I haven't
found anyone else who does.

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:03.330 align:middle line:84%
There's really not a good
explanation for these sightings

00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:04.770 align:middle line:90%
off the US East Coast.

00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:06.840 align:middle line:84%
But yet, what we have
are some very, very,

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:09.630 align:middle line:84%
again, experienced
Naval pilots talking

00:33:09.630 --> 00:33:11.220 align:middle line:90%
about this in great detail.

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:12.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: If it's ours--

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:14.610 align:middle line:90%
if-- it's anti-gravity.

00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:15.710 align:middle line:90%
It's got to be.

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:16.510 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yeah.

00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:20.700 align:middle line:84%
It's a non-traditional
propulsion system.

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:22.560 align:middle line:84%
I would agree with
that, totally.

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:25.950 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that we're
being told by these reports

00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:29.220 align:middle line:84%
is that these objects are
not emitting a typical heat

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:30.490 align:middle line:90%
signature.

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:33.840 align:middle line:84%
So you get the heat signature
from the burning of a fuel,

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:35.160 align:middle line:90%
and it's very identifiable.

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:38.310 align:middle line:84%
We know how to identify all of
these different specific heat

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:39.160 align:middle line:90%
signatures.

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.820 align:middle line:84%
These objects that they're
tracking on the infrared

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:44.100 align:middle line:84%
are not giving off
the heat signal

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:47.670 align:middle line:84%
that you would get from the
burning of any kind of fuel.

00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:51.360 align:middle line:84%
So they're doing something
radical, revolutionary

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.983 align:middle line:84%
to be able to maneuver in
the air the way they do.

00:33:53.983 --> 00:33:54.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: If it's UFO--

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:58.170 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial--
what are they doing?

00:33:58.170 --> 00:33:59.170 align:middle line:90%
Why are they doing this?

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:02.130 align:middle line:84%
Why would they fly between
two aircraft, for example?

00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:03.940 align:middle line:84%
They're playing
games or something.

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:04.740 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yeah.

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:05.590 align:middle line:90%
No, it's a good question.

00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:06.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't have the answer
to that one, George.

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:07.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

I wish I did.

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:13.020 align:middle line:84%
Why have UFOs been doing what
they've been doing for the past

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:16.380 align:middle line:84%
however many years that we've
been reliably reporting them?

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:17.820 align:middle line:90%
This is really the question.

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:20.460 align:middle line:84%
Back in the '50s, when we
thought this was a new thing,

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:22.500 align:middle line:84%
the speculation
was, well, they're

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:25.530 align:middle line:84%
surveilling us in advance
for some other major thing.

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:26.940 align:middle line:90%
Well, it hasn't happened.

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:29.040 align:middle line:84%
What we have,
instead, are thousands

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:31.030 align:middle line:90%
of reports every year.

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:33.190 align:middle line:84%
If I were to look at
this for the first time

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:35.380 align:middle line:84%
and just ask myself,
what's happening?

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:38.380 align:middle line:84%
I would think there's this
other infrastructure that's

00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:42.099 align:middle line:84%
just doing their thing, and
they're on this planet living

00:34:42.099 --> 00:34:42.899 align:middle line:90%

>>DOLAN: Maybe, yes.

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:48.159 align:middle line:84%
But we're at a point
in our civilization

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:50.949 align:middle line:84%
where we're developing
better and better technology

00:34:50.949 --> 00:34:52.802 align:middle line:90%
to detect them.

00:34:52.802 --> 00:34:54.760 align:middle line:84%
A hundred years ago, we
didn't have the ability

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:56.350 align:middle line:84%
to detect almost
anything, really,

00:34:56.350 --> 00:34:57.650 align:middle line:90%
when you think about it.

00:34:57.650 --> 00:35:00.070 align:middle line:84%
We weren't even in the
air in a significant way,

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:01.620 align:middle line:84%
a little more than
a century ago.

00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:02.620 align:middle line:90%
So now we're in the air.

00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And now we've got electronic
means of detection.

00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:07.900 align:middle line:84%
We've got all the other kinds
of very sophisticated means

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:11.323 align:middle line:84%
of detection, and so now we
are detecting these things.

00:35:11.323 --> 00:35:13.240 align:middle line:84%
But what they're doing
is really the question.

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:14.847 align:middle line:90%
Are they from another planet?

00:35:14.847 --> 00:35:16.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've gone on that
assumption for the longest

00:35:16.930 --> 00:35:20.320 align:middle line:84%
time, but I have to remind
myself, I don't really know.

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:22.750 align:middle line:84%
Are they from another what
we would call a dimension

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:24.230 align:middle line:90%
and they come in and out?

00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:25.030 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:27.220 align:middle line:84%
I don't really think I've got
the science for us to say.

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:29.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It seems like it's
a physical craft, obviously,

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:29.380 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:30.190 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yes, absolutely.

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:31.190 align:middle line:90%
I would say so.

00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And there's physical effects
that these objects have left.

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And they've been recorded
for many, many years.

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:38.350 align:middle line:84%
So there's a
definite physicality,

00:35:38.350 --> 00:35:39.850 align:middle line:84%
and there's a
definite, I would say,

00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:42.782 align:middle line:90%
technological element to this.

00:35:42.782 --> 00:35:44.740 align:middle line:84%
But there's other things
that are very strange.

00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And we need to continue to open
this up in the public realm

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:56.740 align:middle line:84%
so that more and more smart
people can investigate this

00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:59.800 align:middle line:84%
and we can begin the process
really of working together.

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:02.350 align:middle line:84%
As it's been for all these
last number of years,

00:36:02.350 --> 00:36:05.980 align:middle line:84%
you've had a very few dedicated
researchers doing their best

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:08.500 align:middle line:84%
to figure it out, but
this is a tough problem,

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:10.217 align:middle line:90%
and we need a lot of folks.

00:36:10.217 --> 00:36:12.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The History Channel
has been doing a great job,

00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:14.020 align:middle line:84%
of course, with
"Ancient Aliens."

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:15.550 align:middle line:90%
You've been on that program.

00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:18.220 align:middle line:84%
Their new show, now,
called "Unidentified."

00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:22.550 align:middle line:84%
How important are these programs
to getting the message out?

00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:24.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well, they
are quite important.

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:27.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a whole
array of alternative media

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:29.330 align:middle line:84%
that's been on YouTube
and everywhere else

00:36:29.330 --> 00:36:32.050 align:middle line:84%
where you've got people putting
a lot of information out there.

00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:35.880 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, the
established media--

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:38.197 align:middle line:84%
the cable networks
and the like--

00:36:38.197 --> 00:36:39.280 align:middle line:90%
they have a lot of status.

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:40.550 align:middle line:90%
They have a lot of power.

00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:44.290 align:middle line:84%
So when shows get on
those cable networks,

00:36:44.290 --> 00:36:46.450 align:middle line:84%
like the History
Channel or others,

00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:49.840 align:middle line:84%
they're important because
they have an ability,

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:52.750 align:middle line:84%
in a way that YouTube
videos don't, of changing

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:54.850 align:middle line:90%
public discussion.

00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm of two
minds about how

00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:01.030 align:middle line:84%
I feel about this, because
there's a big part of me that

00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:02.890 align:middle line:84%
does not like the
fact that you've

00:37:02.890 --> 00:37:07.150 align:middle line:84%
got this very powerful
controlled establishment that

00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:11.110 align:middle line:84%
really owns all of these
networks, owns all the cable.

00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we
really need to have

00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:19.270 align:middle line:84%
a strong discussion about the
controlled, established media.

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:23.440 align:middle line:84%
Having said that, it's
overdue that that controlled,

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:27.250 align:middle line:84%
established media is changing
the discourse on UFOs.

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And particularly with
"Unidentified," I think,

00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:33.790 align:middle line:84%
they're presenting that
subject in such a way

00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:36.310 align:middle line:84%
that it's becoming harder
and harder for some

00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:39.340 align:middle line:84%
of these skeptics to
deny what's going on.

00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:41.380 align:middle line:84%
The kind of mental
gymnastics that they're

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:43.062 align:middle line:84%
going to continue
to do is to deny

00:37:43.062 --> 00:37:45.020 align:middle line:84%
this is just going to be
more and more extreme.

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:46.603 align:middle line:84%
And I think they're
going to be making

00:37:46.603 --> 00:37:48.040 align:middle line:90%
themselves look very foolish.

00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:50.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It makes you walk
away shaking your head going,

00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:51.880 align:middle line:90%
we knew this.

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:52.510 align:middle line:90%
We knew this.

00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:53.593 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:37:53.593 --> 00:37:54.670 align:middle line:90%
Totally agree.

00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:56.357 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's an exciting time.

00:37:56.357 --> 00:37:57.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: It is, but
they're coming out

00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:02.620 align:middle line:84%
with it in a way that is well
presented, and it's relevant.

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:04.165 align:middle line:84%
It's relevant
information, the cases

00:38:04.165 --> 00:38:05.290 align:middle line:90%
that they're talking about.

00:38:05.290 --> 00:38:07.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my goodness,
I was very surprised

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:11.090 align:middle line:84%
when on "Unidentified," one of
the episodes talked about how,

00:38:11.090 --> 00:38:13.930 align:middle line:84%
back in 2004, you had all
these unknown guys coming

00:38:13.930 --> 00:38:16.660 align:middle line:84%
onto the USS Princeton
to steal the radar

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:19.493 align:middle line:84%
data and all the electronic
data of the sighting.

00:38:19.493 --> 00:38:20.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Take it away.

00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:21.243 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Well, yeah.

00:38:21.243 --> 00:38:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
actually really important

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:27.760 align:middle line:84%
because that's before AATIP
program supposedly existed.

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:29.410 align:middle line:90%
So who are these guys?

00:38:29.410 --> 00:38:32.615 align:middle line:84%
Who's the organization that's
confiscating the UFO data back

00:38:32.615 --> 00:38:33.415 align:middle line:90%
in 2004?

00:38:33.415 --> 00:38:34.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's interesting.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, back to the
story about AATIP,

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.780 align:middle line:90%
of course, and that program.

00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:38.710 align:middle line:90%
$22 million.

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:45.100 align:middle line:84%
It was forced by the former
Senator Harry Reid from Nevada.

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And some people have said
because of his relationship

00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:51.310 align:middle line:84%
with Bob Bigelow, who,
of course, is into UFOs,

00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:53.470 align:middle line:84%
and space, and he's
got the floating pod

00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:56.320 align:middle line:84%
up there for hotels that
he'd like to establish,

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:58.510 align:middle line:84%
that he pushed it
and spearheaded it.

00:38:58.510 --> 00:38:59.900 align:middle line:90%
What do we know about that?

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:02.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well, I don't know
the whole, full backstory.

00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:03.800 align:middle line:90%
I'll start by saying that.

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:07.960 align:middle line:84%
But also, my own
assessment of Mr. Bigelow

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:12.760 align:middle line:84%
is that he is probably one
of the most knowledgeable

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:14.497 align:middle line:90%
individuals on UFOs alive.

00:39:14.497 --> 00:39:15.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:18.250 align:middle line:84%
And on "60 Minutes," when
confronted about UFOs,

00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:21.300 align:middle line:84%
he basically said, I don't
care what you people think.

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:22.300 align:middle line:90%
They're real.

00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:24.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: He was amazing
on it, and wouldn't

00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:27.460 align:middle line:84%
be cowed by the attempt to
shame him, either, which

00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:28.710 align:middle line:90%
I thought was very impressive.

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:29.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: But back to the
contract, yeah, right.

00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:33.370 align:middle line:84%
People said, oh, it
was a sweetheart deal.

00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:37.720 align:middle line:84%
Harry Reid's given this to his
buddy, a $22 million freebie.

00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:39.730 align:middle line:84%
A, it's $22 million
over five years.

00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:41.650 align:middle line:84%
Even in the world
of Robert Bigelow,

00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:43.150 align:middle line:84%
I guess it's nice
to have it, but I

00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:45.760 align:middle line:84%
don't know how much of a
profit that really is for him.

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And in defense money,
that's nothing whatsoever.

00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:52.000 align:middle line:84%
When you look at this study that
they ended up doing in AATIP,

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.540 align:middle line:84%
Bigelow was, in all
likelihood, their best choice.

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:57.762 align:middle line:84%
I actually believe
that this is so.

00:39:57.762 --> 00:39:59.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a lot
that the AATIP program

00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:00.772 align:middle line:90%
did that we still do not know.

00:40:00.772 --> 00:40:02.230 align:middle line:84%
But one thing we
know that they did

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:07.510 align:middle line:84%
is that Bigelow contracted with
Dr. Hal Puthoff, hired him.

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:10.552 align:middle line:84%
And Puthoff, from what
I have understood,

00:40:10.552 --> 00:40:12.010 align:middle line:84%
said, look, probably
the best thing

00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:17.200 align:middle line:84%
I can do for you is to
get a sense of the science

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:22.780 align:middle line:84%
of this phenomenon by asking for
white papers, research papers

00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:26.200 align:middle line:84%
from the leading experts
in a variety of fields

00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:31.722 align:middle line:84%
on where their field will be
in like 30-plus years from now.

00:40:31.722 --> 00:40:32.680 align:middle line:90%
And that's what he did.

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:36.040 align:middle line:84%
He actually put out a
request for these papers

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:38.260 align:middle line:84%
from a variety of
experts, and they

00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:42.250 align:middle line:84%
gave these futuristic studies
of various types of field.

00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:47.770 align:middle line:84%
From traversable
wormholes, to warp drive,

00:40:47.770 --> 00:40:50.770 align:middle line:84%
and everything else,
and was fascinating.

00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And Hal actually
said to me-- he said,

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:55.810 align:middle line:84%
the one thing I didn't
tell these scientists is

00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:58.270 align:middle line:84%
that it was for a UFO
project out of the Pentagon.

00:40:58.270 --> 00:40:59.920 align:middle line:84%
But he told them
everything else.

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually a
really intelligent study

00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:06.730 align:middle line:90%
to do, in my opinion.

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:09.225 align:middle line:84%
Those papers-- they're on
a defense server right now.

00:41:09.225 --> 00:41:10.600 align:middle line:84%
And my understanding
is that they

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:13.880 align:middle line:84%
are the most popular
papers of their type.

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:16.660 align:middle line:84%
But it's in the
Pentagon, and everyone

00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:17.860 align:middle line:90%
wants to read these papers.

00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:19.490 align:middle line:90%
They're very advanced science.

00:41:19.490 --> 00:41:21.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wasn't Hal
involved with the government

00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:23.900 align:middle line:84%
for a long time in remote
viewing programs and everything

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:24.700 align:middle line:90%
else?

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:25.742 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yes, absolutely.

00:41:25.742 --> 00:41:31.280 align:middle line:84%
So he was a civilian scientist
with NSA back in the '60s.

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And in the 1970s, worked, of
course, famously through SRI--

00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Stanford Research
Institute-- for the CIA

00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:41.320 align:middle line:84%
to develop remote viewing
protocols with Russell Targ.

00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:42.460 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And Ingo Swann.

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:44.200 align:middle line:10%
>>DOLAN: And then
brought in Ingo Swann,

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:45.908 align:middle line:10%
and they brought in
other remote viewers,

00:41:45.908 --> 00:41:47.980 align:middle line:10%
and developed that program.

00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:50.120 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of an
amazing accomplishment.

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:53.230 align:middle line:84%
So they did that with CIA for,
I think, three or four years,

00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:56.227 align:middle line:84%
and then CIA
supposedly left that,

00:41:56.227 --> 00:41:58.060 align:middle line:84%
and they ended up working
with the military.

00:41:58.060 --> 00:41:59.893 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have a
friend who has passed on,

00:41:59.893 --> 00:42:02.770 align:middle line:84%
the late Dr. Edgar Mitchell,
Apollo 14 astronaut,

00:42:02.770 --> 00:42:03.790 align:middle line:90%
walked on the moon.

00:42:03.790 --> 00:42:04.420 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yes, he did.

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:06.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's been
a controversy lately

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:08.345 align:middle line:90%
about some of his leaked papers.

00:42:08.345 --> 00:42:09.470 align:middle line:90%
What do we know about that?

00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:10.843 align:middle line:90%
And you are a part of this.

00:42:10.843 --> 00:42:11.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: I am, indeed.

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:18.580 align:middle line:84%
So back in 2006, I
was shown two pages

00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:23.440 align:middle line:84%
of a transcript
that ended up being

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:27.310 align:middle line:84%
2 of the 15 pages
of the documents

00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:31.180 align:middle line:84%
that I've often described
as the Admiral Wilson leak.

00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:32.950 align:middle line:84%
This is my very
strong understanding

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:36.010 align:middle line:84%
of the matter from the papers
of late Edgar Mitchell.

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:38.980 align:middle line:84%
As far as we're able to put
this together is the following.

00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:40.930 align:middle line:90%
Edgar Mitchell passes away.

00:42:40.930 --> 00:42:44.200 align:middle line:84%
Certain of his papers relating
to the National Institute

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:47.140 align:middle line:84%
of Discovery Science-- it's
NIDS with Robert Bigelow--

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:50.230 align:middle line:84%
some of his other
private activities,

00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:52.510 align:middle line:84%
maybe with the
Noetic Institute--

00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:59.530 align:middle line:84%
these were legally and in
an aboveboard manner allowed

00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:04.970 align:middle line:84%
to go into private hands of
someone who knew Dr. Mitchell.

00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:07.000 align:middle line:90%
That is my understanding.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And this individual
has had the papers,

00:43:09.850 --> 00:43:12.580 align:middle line:84%
and a few other people
have known about it.

00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:16.700 align:middle line:84%
Digital copies have been
made of an unknown number

00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:17.500 align:middle line:90%
of these documents.

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:19.130 align:middle line:90%
I do not know.

00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:22.930 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that
during 2018, they

00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:26.110 align:middle line:84%
were circulating very quietly
and privately among a very

00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:27.520 align:middle line:90%
few number of people.

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:28.490 align:middle line:90%
And at the end of 2018.

00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:29.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They did keep it quiet.

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:30.600 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: They did, indeed.

00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:33.070 align:middle line:84%
At the end of 2018, one
of these individuals

00:43:33.070 --> 00:43:34.720 align:middle line:84%
showed it to Grant
Cameron when they

00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:37.600 align:middle line:90%
were at a conference in Nevada.

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:40.300 align:middle line:90%
So Grant knew about it.

00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:44.230 align:middle line:84%
And then a few months later,
somebody-- and I, to this day,

00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:45.340 align:middle line:90%
do not know who--

00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:50.020 align:middle line:84%
leaked that document
to me in April of 2019.

00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:52.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And how did you get it?

00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:55.205 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: It was through
a ProtonMail account.

00:43:55.205 --> 00:43:56.580 align:middle line:84%
I've never been
able to trace who

00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:57.980 align:middle line:90%
it is or know who it is yet.

00:43:57.980 --> 00:43:58.305 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:43:58.305 --> 00:43:59.105 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yeah.

00:43:59.105 --> 00:44:01.983 align:middle line:84%
So they gave me a link to a
very, very quiet little site.

00:44:01.983 --> 00:44:03.150 align:middle line:90%
No one knew about this site.

00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:06.150 align:middle line:84%
It was a link, and
it was 15 full pages

00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:11.430 align:middle line:84%
of a conversation that clearly
came from the files of Edgar

00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:12.680 align:middle line:90%
Mitchell.

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:14.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, the conversation's
very important,

00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:18.930 align:middle line:84%
and I'll try concisely to
describe it here for viewers.

00:44:18.930 --> 00:44:22.390 align:middle line:84%
It describes an event that
happened back in 1997.

00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:26.880 align:middle line:84%
In 1997, Dr. Steven
Greer, Dr. Edgar Mitchell,

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:29.250 align:middle line:84%
and a few other people
were able to meet

00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:32.340 align:middle line:84%
at the Joint Chiefs of
Staff with the deputy head

00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:34.590 align:middle line:84%
of intelligence for the Joint
Chiefs who, at the time,

00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:37.102 align:middle line:84%
was an admiral named
Thomas R. Wilson.

00:44:37.102 --> 00:44:39.060 align:middle line:10%
Thomas Wilson later became
head of intelligence

00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:40.200 align:middle line:10%
for the Joint
Chiefs, and he later

00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:42.533 align:middle line:10%
became head of the Defense
Intelligence Agency, the DIA.

00:44:42.533 --> 00:44:44.010 align:middle line:90%
He was a very important guy.

00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:45.843 align:middle line:84%
And they were able to
get a meeting with him

00:44:45.843 --> 00:44:48.647 align:middle line:84%
and a few of his
colleagues all about UFOs.

00:44:48.647 --> 00:44:49.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which is unprecedented.

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:51.147 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: That's interesting.

00:44:51.147 --> 00:44:53.015 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely, very interesting.

00:44:53.015 --> 00:44:55.140 align:middle line:84%
From everything that we've
been able to understand,

00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:58.770 align:middle line:84%
Steven Greer gave a
presentation on this.

00:44:58.770 --> 00:45:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And the real
interesting stuff is

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:01.770 align:middle line:90%
what happened in the aftermath.

00:45:01.770 --> 00:45:03.902 align:middle line:84%
And that's what this
15-page document describes.

00:45:03.902 --> 00:45:04.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Backed up, OK.

00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:06.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: So Wilson
started off by having

00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:09.120 align:middle line:84%
a two-hour conversation with
one of the people who attended

00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:12.390 align:middle line:84%
with Steven Greer, and
this was a Navy commander

00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:14.210 align:middle line:90%
named Will Miller.

00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:16.620 align:middle line:84%
They're both Navy guys,
and they're talking,

00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:20.610 align:middle line:84%
and they're having a
discussion about UFOs.

00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:26.670 align:middle line:84%
Wilson decides to follow up
on the potential of what Greer

00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:31.110 align:middle line:84%
was suggesting, which was a
deeply secret, potentially

00:45:31.110 --> 00:45:35.880 align:middle line:84%
rogue UFO-related technology
program within the Pentagon.

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:38.730 align:middle line:84%
So that was the holy
grail he's looking for.

00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:41.530 align:middle line:90%
And according to these notes--

00:45:41.530 --> 00:45:43.920 align:middle line:84%
and I'll describe these
notes in a moment--

00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:46.470 align:middle line:84%
Wilson apparently
found this program

00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:48.810 align:middle line:84%
buried within a
special access program

00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:50.700 align:middle line:84%
within another special
access program--

00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:53.670 align:middle line:84%
very deeply hidden, run
by private contractors.

00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:57.210 align:middle line:84%
Finds the program manager of
this contracting organization.

00:45:57.210 --> 00:45:59.100 align:middle line:84%
Talks to them, gets
on a conference call

00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:01.260 align:middle line:84%
with the program manager,
and the security officer,

00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:03.690 align:middle line:90%
and the corporate attorney.

00:46:03.690 --> 00:46:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I need to be
regulating, or supervising,

00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:08.740 align:middle line:84%
or having some oversight
of your program.

00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:11.242 align:middle line:84%
They say, well, we'll
get back to you on that.

00:46:11.242 --> 00:46:13.200 align:middle line:84%
And they end up having
a face-to-face meeting--

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:14.550 align:middle line:90%
the four of them--

00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:18.360 align:middle line:84%
and Wilson finds
out that, yes, they

00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:22.200 align:middle line:84%
are attempting to do reverse
engineering of technology that

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:23.550 align:middle line:90%
is not from here.

00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:26.610 align:middle line:84%
It is not from this Earth,
not made by men, not

00:46:26.610 --> 00:46:27.750 align:middle line:90%
by human hands.

00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:30.630 align:middle line:84%
That's a quote that I remembered
reading in this document

00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:31.980 align:middle line:90%
back in 2006.

00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:33.960 align:middle line:84%
And this is in
these papers here.

00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:37.650 align:middle line:84%
But what ended up happening
is, in 2002, Dr. Eric

00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:41.520 align:middle line:84%
Davis of the National Institute
of Discovery Science, of NIDS,

00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:44.160 align:middle line:84%
under the employ
of Robert Bigelow,

00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:48.270 align:middle line:84%
a colleague of Hal Puthoff,
a friend of Edgar Mitchell--

00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:51.680 align:middle line:84%
so Davis is able to get a
meeting with Wilson in October

00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:54.730 align:middle line:84%
of '02, five years
after the fact,

00:46:54.730 --> 00:46:57.000 align:middle line:84%
and they sit in a car for
a little over an hour.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And Wilson apparently
unloaded all of this story

00:47:01.090 --> 00:47:05.080 align:middle line:84%
to Davis, who wrote detailed,
meticulous notes on that.

00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:07.350 align:middle line:10%
And those are the notes
partially that I read

00:47:07.350 --> 00:47:11.070 align:middle line:10%
in '06, and those are the
notes that have leaked in 2019.

00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:14.100 align:middle line:84%
So this is not an official
government document or anything

00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:20.160 align:middle line:84%
like that, but it is a
very detailed account

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:24.250 align:middle line:84%
of a very important conversation
about alien technology

00:47:24.250 --> 00:47:25.500 align:middle line:90%
deep within the US government.

00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And the upshot of what
Wilson's foray into all of this

00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:30.595 align:middle line:84%
was that he was denied
access to the program.

00:47:30.595 --> 00:47:32.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that explains
why Edgar Mitchell, over all

00:47:32.970 --> 00:47:36.750 align:middle line:84%
these years, has always
admitted that UFOs

00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:38.850 align:middle line:84%
exist because he
would always tell me,

00:47:38.850 --> 00:47:40.830 align:middle line:90%
George, I never saw one.

00:47:40.830 --> 00:47:42.720 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see
anything on the Moon.

00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:45.020 align:middle line:90%
I haven't seen one fly by me.

00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:46.167 align:middle line:90%
But I'm told they exist.

00:47:46.167 --> 00:47:48.000 align:middle line:84%
It must have been these
notes and documents.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: This is one
key element of it, yes.

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:53.670 align:middle line:84%
So I think Edgar Mitchell
had a number of sources,

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:55.600 align:middle line:84%
but this is one
important source.

00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:57.018 align:middle line:90%
There's no question in my mind.

00:47:57.018 --> 00:47:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where are we headed,
Richard, with this whole field,

00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:01.357 align:middle line:90%
now, of ufology?

00:48:01.357 --> 00:48:03.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well, like I've often
been feeling for a while,

00:48:03.690 --> 00:48:04.730 align:middle line:90%
history is speeding up.

00:48:04.730 --> 00:48:07.290 align:middle line:84%
I think that we're in
a phase of our history

00:48:07.290 --> 00:48:11.220 align:middle line:84%
where a lot of things are
converging and speeding up.

00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:13.350 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of it has
to do with our ability

00:48:13.350 --> 00:48:16.770 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with each other,
which the technology that

00:48:16.770 --> 00:48:19.020 align:middle line:84%
allows for the
transfer of information

00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:22.290 align:middle line:84%
is just exponentially, it
seems, going more and more

00:48:22.290 --> 00:48:23.860 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is why,
fundamentally, we're

00:48:27.690 --> 00:48:30.690 align:middle line:84%
seeing an increase in the
amount of information relating

00:48:30.690 --> 00:48:33.570 align:middle line:84%
to the UFO subject
that is now coming out.

00:48:33.570 --> 00:48:36.480 align:middle line:84%
Look, we're also now
moving into space

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:39.810 align:middle line:84%
in a way that goes way
beyond just the US government

00:48:39.810 --> 00:48:41.700 align:middle line:90%
and the old Soviet Union.

00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:43.290 align:middle line:84%
We now have a lot
of governments,

00:48:43.290 --> 00:48:45.330 align:middle line:84%
and we also have
private companies.

00:48:45.330 --> 00:48:47.190 align:middle line:84%
What we're seeing
is this expansion

00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:48.960 align:middle line:90%
of all of these groups.

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:52.560 align:middle line:84%
We're moving into a new phase
of human civilization, whatever

00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:54.330 align:middle line:90%
that is going to entail.

00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to me, anyway, that
hiding a secret as fundamental

00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:04.390 align:middle line:84%
and as powerful as the UFO
subject cannot last forever.

00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:07.800 align:middle line:84%
This is a secret that's
got an expiration date.

00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:11.880 align:middle line:84%
My feeling is that there are
folks who are aware of this.

00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:13.410 align:middle line:84%
They are probably
doing everything

00:49:13.410 --> 00:49:17.160 align:middle line:84%
possible to facilitate
the end of that secret

00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:19.360 align:middle line:84%
in a way that works
best for them,

00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:22.480 align:middle line:84%
so their controlled
release of information.

00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:24.180 align:middle line:10%
But here's the thing about UFOs.

00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:27.270 align:middle line:10%
I don't think this is a
subject that can be tamed.

00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:29.340 align:middle line:10%
I think the UFO
subject is inherently

00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:32.700 align:middle line:10%
a wild subject, so
good luck trying

00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:35.040 align:middle line:10%
to have a controlled
release of the information.

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:36.900 align:middle line:84%
I think what's going
to happen, instead,

00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:40.380 align:middle line:84%
is the more and more
information that comes out,

00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:43.830 align:middle line:84%
the more questions are going to
arise that will be inevitable.

00:49:43.830 --> 00:49:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And we are going, very
likely at some point--

00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:49.260 align:middle line:90%
I don't know when this will be--

00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:50.910 align:middle line:84%
to see a kind of
avalanche effect

00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:55.080 align:middle line:84%
occur where it's not a
controlled disclosure,

00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:56.820 align:middle line:90%
but an uncontrolled disclosure.

00:49:56.820 --> 00:49:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And when that
happens, buckle up.

00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:00.030 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be a bumpy ride.

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:02.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Richard, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:02.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Thank you, George.

00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:03.660 align:middle line:90%
It was a pleasure.

00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:05.285 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You can
thank your lucky stars

00:50:05.285 --> 00:50:08.280 align:middle line:10%
we have investigators like
Richard Dolan who investigate

00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:09.780 align:middle line:10%
the truth about UFOs.

00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:12.600 align:middle line:84%
And maybe one day, we'll
really understand the fact

00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:14.700 align:middle line:90%
that we are not alone.

00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:18.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:50:18.090 --> 00:50:21.440 align:middle line:90%
