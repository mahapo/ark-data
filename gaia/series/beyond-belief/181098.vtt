>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.440 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.398 align:middle line:10%
And we're going to talk
some real science today

00:00:29.398 --> 00:00:30.830 align:middle line:10%
with Dr. Paul Laviolette.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.110 align:middle line:84%
He's been the president of
the Starburst Foundation

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.200 align:middle line:84%
since, well, 1984, where
he has conducted research

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.080 align:middle line:84%
on physics, astronomy, geology,
climatology, and so much more.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.380 align:middle line:10%
And his book is called "Secrets
of Anti-Gravity Propulsion."

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.940 align:middle line:10%
Paul, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:47.915 align:middle line:10%
>>PAUL LAVIOLETTE: Glad
to be here, George.

00:00:47.915 --> 00:00:49.760 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's been a
long time since you

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.770 align:middle line:10%
and I have talked,
since the radio days.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Yes.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:52.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's good to see.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:53.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Yeah.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.055 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How is life?

00:00:54.055 --> 00:00:55.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Doing
OK, getting older.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, the clock ticks
for all of us, doesn't it?

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.250 align:middle line:84%
What would you say,
Paul, in your career,

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.400 align:middle line:84%
because we're going to talk
a lot about science today--

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.100 align:middle line:84%
but what has been, for you
personally, the highlight

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.360 align:middle line:90%
of what you've done?

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.020 align:middle line:10%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Sub-quantum
kinetics, the physics theory

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.975 align:middle line:10%
that I've been developing.

00:01:12.975 --> 00:01:15.950 align:middle line:10%
It came out of sort of an
inspiration from beyond

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.560 align:middle line:10%
and developed over the years.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.850 align:middle line:10%
And I think it's now considered
to be the leading theory

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.430 align:middle line:10%
to replace physics
in the future.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.239 align:middle line:90%
That's dramatic.

00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:29.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: I mean, I don't
know of any other theory that's

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.600 align:middle line:84%
made so many predictions and has
so much interest among people

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.640 align:middle line:84%
who are interested in
alternative theories.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Explain to
we non-physicists

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.150 align:middle line:90%
what sub-quantum kinetics is.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Well, meaning
below the quantum level.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.710 align:middle line:84%
It postulates an ether,
which is an ancient concept.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.710 align:middle line:84%
And they used to believe
in it 100 years ago

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.780 align:middle line:84%
till they went to
special relativity

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.600 align:middle line:84%
and claimed that
there was no ether.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.410 align:middle line:84%
But so many experiments
have proven there is.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.900 align:middle line:84%
At least 10 of them, I
think, I cite in my book.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.424 align:middle line:84%
And there was one recent,
the Grusenick experiment.

00:02:07.424 --> 00:02:08.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is that?

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.673 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: It's like the
Michelson-Morley experiment,

00:02:10.673 --> 00:02:12.450 align:middle line:84%
where they used
an interferometer

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.930 align:middle line:90%
to look for an ether wind.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.390 align:middle line:84%
It was a key experiment
they did 100 years ago

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.120 align:middle line:84%
to look for the ether,
if there was an ether.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.750 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't see any result.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:23.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: And that's why--

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.353 align:middle line:90%
they didn't find it.

00:02:25.353 --> 00:02:28.020 align:middle line:84%
So they figured, well,
there is no ether maybe.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.750 align:middle line:84%
But then Grusenick,
all he did was

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.980 align:middle line:84%
rotate the interferometer
90 degrees to the vertical.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And there he found
the ether wind.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.100 align:middle line:84%
It was coming down
into the earth.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is the ether wind?

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Well, according
to sub-quantum kinetics,

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.400 align:middle line:90%
it's geons.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.620 align:middle line:84%
I call them geons
going into Earth.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's what creates a
gravity field of the Earth,

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.740 align:middle line:84%
because they are being
consumed and transformed

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.510 align:middle line:84%
into other types of
sub-quantum particles.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.580 align:middle line:90%
Think of quarks.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.310 align:middle line:90%
This is below the quantum level.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.820 align:middle line:84%
So because there's
a deficit of geons,

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.410 align:middle line:90%
they're flowing into the Earth.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.580 align:middle line:84%
And it creates a gradient,
a field sort of sloping down

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.480 align:middle line:90%
towards the earth.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And that G gradient,
that ether gradient

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.360 align:middle line:84%
is what creates a
gravitational force.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And we've simulated this
with computer simulations.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.890 align:middle line:84%
The equations that sub-quantum
kinetics is proposing,

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.520 align:middle line:90%
we've simulated in the computer.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And we've shown particle-like
structures are affected

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.439 align:middle line:84%
by the field gradients
and actually move,

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:33.480 align:middle line:90%
just like we were saying.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Paul, without
gravity, if it didn't exist,

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.670 align:middle line:90%
what would happen, chaos?

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Well you
wouldn't get the stars forming

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.270 align:middle line:90%
or planets forming.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.740 align:middle line:84%
The things wouldn't
keep together.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:45.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We wouldn't
even be here.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.506 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: It'd
just be dust floating

00:03:47.506 --> 00:03:49.290 align:middle line:90%
in the air without gravity.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, the fact that
it exists tells you what?

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.860 align:middle line:84%
Because the model of the
universe seems to have so much

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.610 align:middle line:90%
order to it.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.230 align:middle line:84%
Everything seems to fit
like pieces of a puzzle.

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.480 align:middle line:90%
To me, that's remarkable.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.180 align:middle line:84%
One would say, there's
a creator behind this.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.420 align:middle line:84%
How do you explain how all of
it works and it works so well?

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.079 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Well, I
would differ on that.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.140 align:middle line:84%
What they do is they
ignore the difficulties

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.230 align:middle line:90%
where there's contradictions.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And they block any efforts to
disprove the existing theories.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.620 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult
to publish something

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.570 align:middle line:84%
that is new, that shows
that old theories are wrong.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:36.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure does.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: So
physics-- there's

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.970 align:middle line:84%
a whole lot of things
I would throw out.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.570 align:middle line:84%
And when I say throw it out,
I mean I found the errors.

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.390 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not just giving opinion.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:50.930 align:middle line:90%
I found the flaws.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And it should be thrown
out, like black hole

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.290 align:middle line:84%
theory, special relativity,
general relativity,

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:58.580 align:middle line:90%
quantum mechanics.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.492 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would Einstein
and Hawking go crazy?

00:05:00.492 --> 00:05:01.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Probably.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.190 align:middle line:90%


00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.900 align:middle line:84%
And so many other things,
the wave-particle dualism,

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.290 align:middle line:84%
a whole list of things I
would keep classical physics

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.065 align:middle line:84%
like Newton's theories of
electrostatics and gravitation,

00:05:16.065 --> 00:05:16.865 align:middle line:90%
Maxwell's theories.

00:05:16.865 --> 00:05:19.560 align:middle line:90%


00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:25.140 align:middle line:84%
But the more advanced physics,
modern physics is wrong.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And in my book, I
explain the problems.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Townsend Brown
is an aerospace engineer.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.750 align:middle line:84%
And he talks about the
tie-in between electricity

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:36.800 align:middle line:90%
and gravity.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.430 align:middle line:10%

States and while an infant

space program was
trying to catch up with

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.380 align:middle line:10%
the Russians' launch of
Sputnik, a man named T.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.490 align:middle line:84%
Townsend Brown was busy
on experiments that defied

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.000 align:middle line:84%
conventional understanding
of electricity, gravitation,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.170 align:middle line:90%
and propulsion.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Along with doctors Paul
Bifield and Agnew Bunsen,

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.365 align:middle line:84%
Brown took high voltage
to the next extreme.

00:06:03.365 --> 00:06:06.410 align:middle line:90%


00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.840 align:middle line:84%
In this rare home movie,
the earliest experiments

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.390 align:middle line:84%
in electrogravitics
are recorded.

00:06:30.158 --> 00:06:35.180 align:middle line:84%
By using high voltages, over
20,000 and up to 200,000 volts,

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.970 align:middle line:84%
Brown discovered that
highly charged capacitors

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.230 align:middle line:84%
would exhibit a noticeable
thrust in one direction.

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:46.190 align:middle line:90%


00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.040 align:middle line:84%
Although awarded a patent for
his electrokinetic generator,

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:55.520 align:middle line:84%
no one has ever reproduced
his experiment until recently.

Larry Davenport, shown
here demonstrating

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.165 align:middle line:84%
his replication of Brown's
electrokinetic apparatus

explains.

00:07:00.965 --> 00:07:03.311 align:middle line:90%


00:07:03.311 --> 00:07:05.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LARRY DAVENPORT: When I first
began to read Brown's stuff,

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:10.580 align:middle line:84%
I didn't quite understand the
difference between the ion wind

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:12.650 align:middle line:84%
devices, which there's a
lot of them out there--

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:15.410 align:middle line:84%
and some of them are very
efficient as far as producing

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.270 align:middle line:90%
ion wind--

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.290 align:middle line:90%
and his particular apparatus.

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:24.590 align:middle line:84%
I finally decided to do
Brown's work in 1994.

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.152 align:middle line:10%
I looked at his device.

00:07:26.152 --> 00:07:28.610 align:middle line:10%
I'd tried several different
things, and they hadn't worked.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
Brown is supposed

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:34.580 align:middle line:84%
to be the pioneer of this, or
the people that make the claims

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:38.420 align:middle line:84%
and that get the patents,
they always refer to his name.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:40.730 align:middle line:84%
So I thought I'd go back
and I'll try to do this.

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:43.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How far ahead of
time was Townsend Brown?

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.469 align:middle line:90%
Was he way ahead of his time?

00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:47.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: He was
further than Einstein.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:48.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:49.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Oh, yeah.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.580 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Einstein
and Brown, I believe,

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:57.880 align:middle line:84%
were working together, uh,
black project during the war

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.974 align:middle line:84%
called the Philadelphia
Experiment.

00:07:59.974 --> 00:08:02.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But there's much
more to that, isn't there?

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:05.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Where they made a
ship disappear, not only radar

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.920 align:middle line:84%
invisible but actually optical
invisible, it's claimed.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:14.330 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that Einstein
knew about Brown's work,

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:17.830 align:middle line:84%
because Brown had done his
work on electrogravitics.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:20.800 align:middle line:84%
Already in '20s he
knew about this.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.830 align:middle line:84%
And after that, we
remember Einstein

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:26.560 align:middle line:84%
trying to find a unification
between electricity

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.870 align:middle line:84%
and gravitation, which
Brown had already

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:32.140 align:middle line:84%
shown there was a
unification, that electricity

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:33.789 align:middle line:90%
is affecting gravity.

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's what electrogravitics
is, electricity effect

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:38.590 align:middle line:90%
affecting gravity.

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:39.965 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where
would you have put

00:08:39.965 --> 00:08:42.685 align:middle line:84%
Tesla in the middle of
this at the time Tesla?

00:08:42.685 --> 00:08:46.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Tesla, they say,
was part of the project also.

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:49.555 align:middle line:84%
I discuss the Philadelphia
project in my book,

00:08:49.555 --> 00:08:51.730 align:middle line:84%
in "Secrets of
Anti-Gravity Propulsion."

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:55.300 align:middle line:84%
Some of the work of Tesla
was applicable to this,

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.910 align:middle line:84%
because they were using
pulses, I believe,

00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:59.887 align:middle line:90%
to create this effect.

00:08:59.887 --> 00:09:02.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you bring up the
Philadelphia Experiment, Paul.

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And I have had guests
on "Coast to Coast"

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:10.450 align:middle line:84%
over the years, a fellow by
the name of Al Bielek, Duncan

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:14.500 align:middle line:84%
Cameron, who claimed that they
were part of the experiment.

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:15.700 align:middle line:90%
And this is what they say.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to get
your reaction to it.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.990 align:middle line:84%
They say that
something went awry

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:24.760 align:middle line:84%
with trying to cloak the ship
in the Philadelphia shipyard

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:29.830 align:middle line:84%
and that it literally made
the soldiers and the Navy

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:34.870 align:middle line:84%
people on the ship
disappear, or in some cases,

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:38.569 align:middle line:84%
half of their body was in our
plane, the other half was gone.

00:09:38.569 --> 00:09:39.610 align:middle line:90%
Do you think that's true?

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:40.540 align:middle line:90%
Was that real?

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.164 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Yes,
I believe, because--

00:09:42.164 --> 00:09:42.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My god!

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:44.386 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: I
can understand how

00:09:44.386 --> 00:09:47.590 align:middle line:84%
that happened in the context
of sub-quantum kinetics.

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:49.190 align:middle line:84%
In physics, it's
a total mystery,

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:51.010 align:middle line:90%
and nobody believes it.

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:52.720 align:middle line:84%
But in sub-quantum
kinetics, if you

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:59.540 align:middle line:84%
can change the gravity potential
by pulsing with electric pulses

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:05.180 align:middle line:84%
and raise the potential--
so we're in a gravity well.

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.000 align:middle line:84%
If you can create
a gravity hill,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.030 align:middle line:84%
things will disappear optically,
because what will happen

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:16.010 align:middle line:84%
is, the subatomic particle has
a wave pattern around it that

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:17.360 align:middle line:90%
stops light from going through.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.670 align:middle line:84%
That's why light doesn't
go through solid matter,

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.050 align:middle line:90%
except maybe glass.

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:24.600 align:middle line:84%
Those would disappear
first before the cores

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.400 align:middle line:90%
would disappear.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.990 align:middle line:84%
So the particles
would still be there.

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:29.270 align:middle line:84%
But now light could
actually go through.

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:31.220 align:middle line:84%
And it would look
like it's invisible.

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:34.840 align:middle line:84%
And also people
could blend with--

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.130 align:middle line:90%
put your arm through.

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:40.670 align:middle line:84%
But then you put the
gravity potential

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:43.820 align:middle line:84%
back down to create
normal gravity,

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:45.560 align:middle line:90%
and everything will come back.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And if you had your arm in
a wall, you're stuck there.

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:50.780 align:middle line:90%
You can't get out.

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:50.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.126 align:middle line:90%
So this might have happened.

00:10:52.126 --> 00:10:54.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: I believe it did.

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And I believe, because of
that, they kept it so secret.

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:02.620 align:middle line:84%
They even changed--
the Navy changed

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:05.410 align:middle line:84%
Brown's date of
departure from the Navy

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:08.590 align:middle line:84%
so it looked like he left before
the Philadelphia Experiment.

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:10.340 align:middle line:90%
They were trying to--

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:11.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mask it.

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:12.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Mask him, yeah.

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
Project Winterhaven?

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:18.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: That was a project
that Brown proposed to the Navy

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:22.690 align:middle line:84%
to develop a disk craft
that would have Mach 3

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:26.090 align:middle line:84%
capabilities, which was faster
than anything they had back

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:26.890 align:middle line:90%
then.

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:28.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like flying saucers?

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:29.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Yeah.

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:34.560 align:middle line:84%
Using his electrogravitics,
electrokinetics technology.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And in the report, it's an
interesting thing in there.

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:47.340 align:middle line:84%
Brown is saying that he had
been prevented from discussing

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:50.010 align:middle line:90%
his work in publications.

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:52.211 align:middle line:84%
So here's Einstein
publishing freely.

00:11:52.211 --> 00:11:53.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, like crazy, yeah.

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:56.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: And Brown
isn't allowed to publish.

00:11:56.490 --> 00:12:00.465 align:middle line:84%
In fact, after '59, the
whole field went dark.

00:12:00.465 --> 00:12:03.870 align:middle line:90%


00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:06.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, the aircraft
industry was not

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:09.240 align:middle line:84%
allowed to speak to
the media any longer

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.940 align:middle line:84%
about the research
they were doing.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.070 align:middle line:90%
And none of us knew about this.

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:17.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was known
back in the early '50s

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.230 align:middle line:84%
that there was electrogravitics
research going on.

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:22.110 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't secret.

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:26.880 align:middle line:84%
It was in magazines like
"Product Engineering."

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: "Popular Mechanics?"

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Things like that.

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And then people forgot
about it, because it

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:34.640 align:middle line:90%
wasn't discussed anymore.

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:35.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:36.950 align:middle line:90%
Out of sight, out of mind.

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:37.783 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Right.

00:12:37.783 --> 00:12:41.309 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think those
projects are continuing today?

00:12:41.309 --> 00:12:42.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Definitely.

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:45.870 align:middle line:84%
For example, Brown's
technology, this disk proposal,

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:50.065 align:middle line:84%
the Winterhaven proposal ended
up turning into the B2 bomber.

00:12:50.065 --> 00:12:51.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Since
you bring that up,

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.860 align:middle line:90%
let's look at the B2 bomber.

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:58.010 align:middle line:10%
>> In the history of aviation,
there has never been a plane

00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:02.900 align:middle line:10%
more groundbreaking than
the B2 stealth bomber.

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:06.380 align:middle line:84%
Capable of flying anywhere
in the world undetected,

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:08.880 align:middle line:84%
the B2 can arrive
over its target,

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.890 align:middle line:84%
release precision munitions,
and escape confident in the fact

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:15.200 align:middle line:84%
that the bombs will
hit their targets

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.560 align:middle line:84%
and that the plane will
return home safely.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:22.310 align:middle line:84%
Revolutionary in design
and capability, the B2

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:26.090 align:middle line:84%
represents the culmination of
many disciplines and sciences,

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:30.090 align:middle line:84%
from aeronautics to
stealth to bombing itself.

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:32.420 align:middle line:84%
It also has a
distinction unshared

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:34.700 align:middle line:90%
by any conventional aircraft.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:37.100 align:middle line:84%
For the entirety of
its service life,

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:42.320 align:middle line:84%
the B2 has never been
detected, targeted, or engaged.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that still
an action, the B2 bomber?

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:46.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Oh, yeah.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I bet they've
perfected it even more.

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:51.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: I
wouldn't be surprised.

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:53.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if they call
it the B2 any longer.

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:56.337 align:middle line:84%
The perfected version might
be named something else.

00:13:56.337 --> 00:13:57.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good point.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:58.470 align:middle line:10%
>>LAVIOLETTE: They
don't' talk about it.

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:00.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: God, the
technology that we

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:03.240 align:middle line:84%
possess, Paul, is beyond
what anybody would imagine,

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.040 align:middle line:90%
isn't that?

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:04.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Yeah.

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:05.480 align:middle line:90%
Here, we're using it.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.400 align:middle line:90%
We acknowledge the B2.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.840 align:middle line:84%
But the propulsion
system is secret.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.950 align:middle line:84%
And they even say
that the secret thing

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:14.810 align:middle line:90%
is the radar invisibility.

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:18.390 align:middle line:84%
But that's to get you away from
thinking about the propulsion

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:19.190 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:20.570 align:middle line:84%
It's really the
propulsion system

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:22.994 align:middle line:90%
that's so highly classified.

00:14:22.994 --> 00:14:25.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
the propulsion system is?

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:28.250 align:middle line:10%
>>LAVIOLETTE: It was leaked by
some black project scientists

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:31.580 align:middle line:10%
and published in "Aviation
Week" and "Space Technology"

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:36.230 align:middle line:10%
back around '92 that the
B2 charges the leading edge

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:38.810 align:middle line:10%
of its wing to high voltage.

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And the opposite charge
they dump in the exhaust.

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And so they're creating
this huge field gradient

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:46.070 align:middle line:90%
across the craft.

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:48.350 align:middle line:84%
So that was the main
thing they leaked.

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And based on that, and knowing
Brown's patents that he

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.510 align:middle line:90%
published back in the '50s--

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:54.860 align:middle line:90%
and he was proposing this.

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:58.010 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't suppressed at all.

00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:00.830 align:middle line:90%
It was exactly the idea.

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:03.260 align:middle line:10%
He showed charging the
leading edge of the craft

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.090 align:middle line:10%
and using a flame
jet generator-- that

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:07.700 align:middle line:10%
was the other thing that the
fellow mentioned, that they

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:11.000 align:middle line:10%
generate the high voltage
difference in the jet engine

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.920 align:middle line:10%
itself using a
flame jet generator.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.455 align:middle line:90%
Townsend Brown developed that.

00:15:15.455 --> 00:15:15.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:17.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: He was the
guy who developed that.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How far ahead are
we from the other countries,

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:22.820 align:middle line:84%
China, Russia, with
this kind of technology?

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:24.170 align:middle line:90%
Or have they caught up with us?

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:27.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: I think China has
bases in space, just like we do

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.120 align:middle line:90%
and the Russians do.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And they're developing
advanced propulsion.

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.854 align:middle line:84%
It's just, they're very
good at keeping secrets.

00:15:34.854 --> 00:15:36.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Better than we are?

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:37.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Right.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:41.090 align:middle line:84%
They have a law now that
if anybody falsifies

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:44.630 align:middle line:84%
scientific data, they have the
death sentence for that person.

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:46.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: God.

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And here, what would
happen in the United States

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:48.930 align:middle line:90%
for that, nothing?

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:50.150 align:middle line:90%
Probably a hand slap?

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:52.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Maybe
embarrassed by a publication.

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.640 align:middle line:90%
That's about it.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Paul, when
you talk about bases,

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:57.530 align:middle line:90%
where might they be?

00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:59.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Well, I
believe outside Earth orbit

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:02.675 align:middle line:90%
there are bases.

00:16:02.675 --> 00:16:05.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like space stations
or on the moon or something

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:05.810 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:12.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: It could be bases
on planets, like Mars, Ceres.

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:16.270 align:middle line:84%
We sent a probe out to
Ceres a few years ago.

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And they were shooting
back pictures.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And you saw what looked
like white areas that

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:25.520 align:middle line:84%
looked just like they could
have been cities down there.

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:26.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, reflected.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:29.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: And I published
about this on the internet.

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:32.650 align:middle line:84%
And I show pictures that we've
taken of Ceres from the air,

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:34.360 align:middle line:84%
from satellites, from
the space station

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.760 align:middle line:84%
and compare with what
they're seeing there.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And a very, very
close resemblance.

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:41.092 align:middle line:84%
Now, why is it that when
they got very close,

00:16:41.092 --> 00:16:42.550 align:middle line:84%
they didn't send
any more pictures?

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:43.466 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They stopped.

00:16:43.466 --> 00:16:44.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Right.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.460 align:middle line:84%
Right when we were hoping
we'd get close enough

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:47.260 align:middle line:90%
to see something.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And then they didn't
send anything more.

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:51.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Possibilities of this
then you think are very high?

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:52.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: From
what I know and a lot

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:56.050 align:middle line:84%
of things which we probably
won't have time to discuss,

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:57.430 align:middle line:90%
I am very certain.

00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:01.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
continuing to send astronauts

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:03.490 align:middle line:90%
and flying them into space?

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:07.810 align:middle line:84%
We think that since we stopped
the space shuttle program,

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:09.589 align:middle line:90%
we've stopped all of that.

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:11.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm not so sure we have.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:14.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: No We
continue to travel.

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:19.390 align:middle line:84%
There's regular
sightings near Area 51.

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:22.510 align:middle line:84%
Even out in the Los
Angeles area people

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:25.180 align:middle line:90%
have seen UFOs, secret bases.

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:28.960 align:middle line:84%
I heard a story from a friend
of mine that he was hang gliding

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.690 align:middle line:84%
or his friends
were hang gliding.

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And they had to come down
in a mountainous area

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:37.600 align:middle line:84%
between the shore and some
mountains right north of LA.

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:41.170 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't way out in nowhere.

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:43.180 align:middle line:84%
And there was a landing
strip they found.

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:44.650 align:middle line:84%
Because they were
losing altitude,

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:46.483 align:middle line:84%
they had to land somewhere
in the mountains.

00:17:46.483 --> 00:17:47.870 align:middle line:90%
And they found a landing strip.

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:48.670 align:middle line:90%
They get down.

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, they're surrounded
with people with guns.

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:52.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.225 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: At the
end of the landing

00:17:54.225 --> 00:17:59.830 align:middle line:84%
strip was a disk
hovering inside a tent.

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And they were told they're not
supposed to say this to anyone.

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:10.640 align:middle line:84%
So this is obviously one
of ours, it seems to me.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's not E.T.

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:13.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Yeah.

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:15.650 align:middle line:84%
A chance encounter,
and they see a disk.

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:16.800 align:middle line:90%
What's the chance of that?

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:17.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are the odds?

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.320 align:middle line:90%
What are the odds?

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.390 align:middle line:84%
They say it takes
us up to six months

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:23.534 align:middle line:84%
to travel from Earth to Mars
on any given time period.

00:18:23.534 --> 00:18:24.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: I
think nine months.

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:26.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or nine months as well.

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:28.820 align:middle line:84%
But through Townsend's
work, could we

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:30.360 align:middle line:90%
have gotten there quicker?

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Yes.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:34.370 align:middle line:84%
In my book, I talk about
going to Mars in five days.

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:35.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Five days?

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:36.926 align:middle line:10%
>>LAVIOLETTE: We
could go quicker.

00:18:36.926 --> 00:18:39.339 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to make it
sound too unbelievable.

00:18:39.339 --> 00:18:41.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Five days is
kind of unbelievable.

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Using
Townsend Brown's thrusters,

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:45.420 align:middle line:90%
his electrokinetic thrusters.

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:46.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa!

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:48.860 align:middle line:10%
>>LAVIOLETTE: His
umbrella-like device, it

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:52.310 align:middle line:10%
has a big positive electrode
and a small negative.

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:58.480 align:middle line:10%
And he's got a insulator in
between, like barium titanate.

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:04.930 align:middle line:10%
He's found that these produce
70,000 Newtons per kilowatt.

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:10.210 align:middle line:84%
That's 5,000 times more thrust
per energy input than a jet

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:14.350 align:middle line:84%
engine, about 300,000 times
more than a space shuttle

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:15.370 align:middle line:90%
main engine.

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:18.400 align:middle line:84%
So it means they're getting,
let's say, 300,000 times

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.710 align:middle line:84%
more thrust for the
amount of energy,

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:23.950 align:middle line:84%
whether it's chemical energy
or electrical or whatever,

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:26.515 align:middle line:84%
than we get with our
commercial versions.

00:19:26.515 --> 00:19:29.610 align:middle line:90%


00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:33.840 align:middle line:84%
So with this and an
array of thrusters,

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:36.550 align:middle line:84%
you can picture a ship,
about like the space shuttle,

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:41.280 align:middle line:84%
100-ton craft, with a
series of these thrusters,

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:44.130 align:middle line:84%
like an array of
thrusters stacked up maybe

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:46.590 align:middle line:90%
my five deep and five by five.

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:50.010 align:middle line:84%
You could go up to--
what was I saying?

00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:55.620 align:middle line:10%
20% G and get there in five
days-- you'd go half the way.

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:58.320 align:middle line:10%
You accelerate to
your top speed.

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:00.810 align:middle line:10%
And then you decelerate.

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:05.090 align:middle line:84%
Because we're going-- they're
talking about ion thrusters,

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:09.814 align:middle line:84%
plucking away at a
horse and buggy speed.

00:20:09.814 --> 00:20:12.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this all part of
the secret space program what

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:13.354 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about now?

00:20:13.354 --> 00:20:15.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: I don't
know if they use exactly

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:17.400 align:middle line:90%
this particular technology.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.200 align:middle line:90%
They could.

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.800 align:middle line:84%
They have probably
have things better.

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.216 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just giving
you an example

00:20:21.216 --> 00:20:25.290 align:middle line:84%
from what we know that I
reverse engineered my book.

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:26.340 align:middle line:90%
This is possible.

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:28.389 align:middle line:84%
Give me $50 million,
and I'll build you this.

00:20:28.389 --> 00:20:29.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You'll build it.

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:31.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Maybe it'll
probably cost a little more.

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:32.985 align:middle line:84%
But I'm confident
we could make this.

00:20:32.985 --> 00:20:35.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is
amazing technology

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:39.270 align:middle line:84%
to be able to get to Mars
in five days or less.

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:40.997 align:middle line:84%
What would the craft
have to look like?

00:20:40.997 --> 00:20:43.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: It would
look like the space shuttle

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:47.070 align:middle line:84%
with some gadget to hold
all these propulsion

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:48.960 align:middle line:90%
devices behind.

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And it could be powered on
an array of solar cells.

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:53.650 align:middle line:84%
So you'd be going
away from the sun.

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:58.170 align:middle line:84%
You'd have your solar cell
array, maybe 5 by 5 meters.

00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:01.440 align:middle line:90%
You only need, what was it?

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:04.470 align:middle line:84%
A few kilowatts of power,
3 kilowatts or something.

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:06.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could you use
that to launch as well?

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:07.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: No.

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:11.340 align:middle line:84%
This is for a craft that's
already assembled in space.

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:14.940 align:middle line:84%
To get up there, you need
to there probably use

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:17.820 align:middle line:84%
a different craft to get up
there than what you go to Mars.

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:20.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we wouldn't
need a Saturn V rocket.

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: No, you
wouldn't use rockets.

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:25.970 align:middle line:84%
You'd use these thrusters,
because you can get

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:28.820 align:middle line:90%
over a G of thrust very easily.

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:30.669 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it silent
or does it make noise?

00:21:30.669 --> 00:21:32.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: It would have
a hum to it, because you're

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.630 align:middle line:90%
pulsing at DC pulses.

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:38.340 align:middle line:84%
And the way this works, if I
could explain very easily--

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:39.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Please.

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.139 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: There's two
possible explanations.

00:21:41.139 --> 00:21:43.457 align:middle line:84%
One is this is a bigger
electrode on the top

00:21:43.457 --> 00:21:44.540 align:middle line:90%
and smaller on the bottom.

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:46.180 align:middle line:84%
So the charge is
very concentrated

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:47.180 align:middle line:90%
on the bottom electrode.

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:48.740 align:middle line:90%
They both have the same charge.

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:50.460 align:middle line:84%
But it's more concentrated
in the bottom.

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And this is giving off a
the positive charge up here

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.710 align:middle line:90%
and a negative down here.

00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:59.600 align:middle line:10%
And the negative ions
go away from the craft.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.672 align:middle line:84%
And they exert a force
on the negative pole.

00:22:02.672 --> 00:22:03.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which pushes you up.

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:06.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: But because
it's so concentrated,

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.330 align:middle line:84%
it's going to get
a lot of force,

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:11.680 align:middle line:84%
whereas up here, the positive
charges are exerting--

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:15.120 align:middle line:84%
it's very spread out, so
it's a very weak field,

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:16.270 align:middle line:90%
the total field.

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:18.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's an unbalanced
force, and it lifts.

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And Brown has shown
he's able to lift

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:24.760 align:middle line:84%
the whole weight of a saucer
with 10% extra weight.

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.605 align:middle line:84%
He was able to get
these things to go up.

00:22:26.605 --> 00:22:28.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
if we're being visited,

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.430 align:middle line:84%
Paul, by
extraterrestrials, they're

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:33.460 align:middle line:84%
using propulsion like
this to get here,

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:36.786 align:middle line:84%
or have they learned how
to bend space and time?

00:22:36.786 --> 00:22:39.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: First of all,
I wouldn't say space and time

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:40.060 align:middle line:90%
bending.

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:41.660 align:middle line:90%
That's an Einsteinian concept

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:42.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:44.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: There's
better concepts now.

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:46.510 align:middle line:90%
You have to accept the ether.

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:50.260 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about ether
gradients not warping of space

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:51.430 align:middle line:90%
to create forces.

00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:53.990 align:middle line:84%
They probably have a lot
of various technologies.

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:57.830 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of ways to
skin the cat in this field.

00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:00.250 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that
all of them are not

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:03.660 align:middle line:84%
believed by physicists, because
physics is a primitive science.

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:04.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:06.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: It doesn't
explain this stuff.

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:08.140 align:middle line:90%
Sub-quantum kinetics does.

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:12.040 align:middle line:84%
This is the one science that's
able to explain free energy

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:15.370 align:middle line:84%
machines and these advanced
propulsion technologies that

00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:17.020 align:middle line:90%
physics can't.

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:19.900 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that the first
place sub-quantum kinetics will

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:22.946 align:middle line:90%
be used is in aerospace.

00:23:22.946 --> 00:23:24.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I agree with that.

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:25.611 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: You
need a theory to be

00:23:25.611 --> 00:23:28.240 align:middle line:84%
able to know what's happening,
to interpret experiments,

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.120 align:middle line:90%
and design something that works.

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.500 align:middle line:90%
With physics you're at a loss.

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:35.490 align:middle line:90%
You're blindfolded.

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:37.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You
mentioned wormholes.

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:41.284 align:middle line:84%
And you had a change
in thought about that.

00:23:41.284 --> 00:23:42.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE:
Sub-quantum kinetics

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:44.710 align:middle line:90%
doesn't allow wormholes.

00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:46.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they don't
exist in your world?

00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:47.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Hmm?

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:49.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't
exist in your world?

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:52.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE:
Right, don't exist.

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:54.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
Hawking talking about?

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:56.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Blowing hot air.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:56.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: [GUFFAWS]

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:58.308 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Now,
originally, if you remember,

00:23:58.308 --> 00:24:00.130 align:middle line:84%
Hawking was saying
no light escapes.

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:01.231 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No light escapes.

00:24:01.231 --> 00:24:03.730 align:middle line:10%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Then he changed
his story just a few years ago

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:06.860 align:middle line:10%
and said, well, maybe
some light can get out.

00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:09.550 align:middle line:90%
So it's not a black hole.

00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:12.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've been saying for
years that those stars--

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:14.170 align:middle line:84%
they're stars, they're
not black holes.

00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:14.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:17.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: The reason
is they can't collapse.

00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:20.180 align:middle line:84%
Physicists think they collapse,
because the fuel burns out

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:23.450 align:middle line:84%
in the star and nothing to
support it, so it collapses.

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:26.480 align:middle line:84%
The truth is that there's
what's called genic energy.

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:31.070 align:middle line:84%
Every star is generating
energy in its interior.

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:33.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's not due
to nuclear energy.

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:34.335 align:middle line:90%
It's free energy.

00:24:34.335 --> 00:24:35.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Free energy.

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And what do you
mean by free energy?

00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:37.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Free energy, OK.

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:40.471 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To be free energy means
we don't have to pay for it?

00:24:40.471 --> 00:24:44.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: OK, so first of
all, in sub-quantum kinetics,

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:47.050 align:middle line:84%
the universe is not
a closed system.

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:49.740 align:middle line:84%
A closed system is like
everything is in a box.

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:51.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way it
physicists view it.

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Everything's in
the box, so energy

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:55.250 align:middle line:90%
has to be perfectly conserved.

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:59.750 align:middle line:84%
It means you can't increase or
decrease the amount of energy.

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:02.120 align:middle line:10%
In an open system,
you can actually

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:08.160 align:middle line:10%
create a whole universe
just by itself,

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.330 align:middle line:10%
because it's an open system.

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:13.050 align:middle line:84%
It's getting the energy
it needs from beyond,

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:14.760 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, from
another dimension

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:19.050 align:middle line:84%
you can think of it, in
this case, from the ether.

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:21.570 align:middle line:84%
I believe our sense of
time, the flow of time

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:25.740 align:middle line:84%
comes from the fact that ether
is continually transmuting.

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:28.250 align:middle line:84%
It's like we're in a
river, an etheric river.

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:30.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same
idea, the ancient idea.

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:34.350 align:middle line:10%
I have written about this in my
book "Genesis of the Cosmos."

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:36.960 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: The ancients had
this science thousands of years

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:40.730 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And they encoded it in certain
creation myths, symbolically.

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:54.960 align:middle line:84%
And the idea of the Qi, that's
an ether that transmutes.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:57.960 align:middle line:84%
The idea of yin
and yang, these are

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.300 align:middle line:90%
very close to these concepts.

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:01.110 align:middle line:90%
So they had this.

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:03.492 align:middle line:84%
I'm very sure they had
this science in the past.

00:26:03.492 --> 00:26:04.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some
people, Paul, believe

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:09.090 align:middle line:84%
that Nikola Tesla created
and invented free energy.

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:12.120 align:middle line:10%
>> In the 19th century, Tesla
hypothesized that electrical

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:14.610 align:middle line:10%
power could be generated
using the natural resources

00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:15.960 align:middle line:10%
of the Sun and Earth.

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.150 align:middle line:10%
Tesla understood that by
harnessing the planet's

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:20.970 align:middle line:10%
natural energy, it could be
provided to the whole world's

00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:22.560 align:middle line:10%
population for free.

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:24.750 align:middle line:10%
Tesla had already
demonstrated that power

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:27.630 align:middle line:10%
could be transferred wirelessly
to the American Institute

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:29.220 align:middle line:10%
of Electrical Engineers.

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:32.310 align:middle line:84%
Using two metal sheets and
his Tesla coil oscillator,

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:35.700 align:middle line:84%
he lit up two glass discharge
tubes without wires.

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:39.060 align:middle line:84%
Now he wanted to implement
the theory on a grand scale.

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:42.240 align:middle line:84%
In 1901, construction began
on the Wardenclyffe Tower

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.990 align:middle line:90%
in Shoreham, New York.

00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:47.460 align:middle line:84%
Atop the 57-meter tall
tower was a 55-ton dome

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:48.660 align:middle line:90%
of conductive metal.

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:52.110 align:middle line:10%
Beneath it, an iron root system
penetrated more than 300 feet

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:53.490 align:middle line:10%
into the Earth's crust.

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:56.370 align:middle line:84%
Tesla believed the tower would
harness the Earth's energy

00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:58.350 align:middle line:84%
and transmit it
into the atmosphere.

00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:01.860 align:middle line:84%
Tesla envisaged a global network
of these high-voltage towers

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:03.630 align:middle line:84%
which would provide
cost-free wireless

00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:05.370 align:middle line:90%
electricity to the masses.

00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:07.246 align:middle line:84%
Homes, businesses,
and even ships

00:27:07.246 --> 00:27:09.120 align:middle line:84%
could draw power from
the electrical currents

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.530 align:middle line:90%
the towers provided.

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:12.810 align:middle line:84%
The development of wireless
trans-Atlantic telegraphs

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:16.170 align:middle line:84%
in 1901 and successful
signal testing on the tower

00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:18.960 align:middle line:84%
was promising for the
development of free energy.

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:21.930 align:middle line:84%
The tower was funded
by J.P. Morgan.

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:27.830 align:middle line:84%
He gave Tesla $150,000 in return
for 51% control of the patents.

00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:30.510 align:middle line:84%
But to Tesla's shock,
construction on the tower

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:32.880 align:middle line:90%
was abandoned in 1905.

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.970 align:middle line:84%
J.P. Morgan had
withdrawn his support.

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:38.460 align:middle line:84%
Why would Morgan back
out just as Tesla

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:41.460 align:middle line:84%
appeared to be on the verge of
a technological breakthrough?

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:43.140 align:middle line:84%
By the turn of the
century, Morgan

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:44.910 align:middle line:84%
had become one of
the most powerful men

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:47.970 align:middle line:84%
in the world controlling the
US electrical and railroad

00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:52.950 align:middle line:84%
industries and with an estimated
net worth of $68.3 million.

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:55.650 align:middle line:84%
Morgan initially financed
Tesla's wireless tower,

00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:57.870 align:middle line:84%
believing it was designed
to send communications

00:27:57.870 --> 00:27:59.140 align:middle line:90%
across the Atlantic.

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:00.780 align:middle line:84%
But the tower's
true purpose would

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:03.270 align:middle line:84%
have threatened the very
industry in which Morgan had

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:06.840 align:middle line:90%
built his fortune, fossil fuel.

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:08.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tesla was onto
something, wasn't he?

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:09.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Yes.

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:11.700 align:middle line:84%
I believe he was
creating more energy

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:14.465 align:middle line:84%
than he was putting in through
those pulses he was creating.

00:28:14.465 --> 00:28:16.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I think someone
like J.P. Morgan Chase

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:19.810 align:middle line:84%
realized, I'm not going to make
any money off of this, right?

00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:21.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Yeah,
from his point of view.

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:24.940 align:middle line:84%
But it were completely
transformed our world.

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:27.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's pretty dramatic,
the things that have happened.

00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And we just seem
to have stopped it.

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:30.630 align:middle line:84%
But you think they're
still ongoing,

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:32.560 align:middle line:84%
don't you, Tesla's work,
all this other stuff?

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:33.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Yeah.

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:38.220 align:middle line:84%
This black project scientist
who talked about the B2,

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:40.360 align:middle line:90%
I had a conversation with him.

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:45.500 align:middle line:84%
I got his phone number
through the magazine.

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:50.800 align:middle line:84%
He said that declassified
work in black projects,

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:54.124 align:middle line:84%
they rely heavily on
Tesla's work and Brown's.

00:28:54.124 --> 00:28:55.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Both of them?

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:55.915 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Mm-hmm.

00:28:55.915 --> 00:28:58.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Brown must have
been a genius at his time?

00:28:58.660 --> 00:28:59.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Yes.

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:04.370 align:middle line:84%
Brown would have been
the big physics genius

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:06.411 align:middle line:84%
if he had been allowed
to publish his work

00:29:06.411 --> 00:29:07.660 align:middle line:90%
and if they'd talked about it.

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:08.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:09.890 align:middle line:84%
They were pushing
Einstein and not him.

00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:11.931 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Well, they
wanted to push Einstein,

00:29:11.931 --> 00:29:16.490 align:middle line:84%
because with Einstein's theory,
you think that all of this

00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:18.860 align:middle line:84%
is impossible, because
it's not possible.

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:23.600 align:middle line:84%
He is not able to bend
gravity with electricity.

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:26.570 align:middle line:84%
Only Brown could create
gravitational force

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:27.620 align:middle line:90%
with electricity.

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:30.380 align:middle line:84%
But his theory, he
claimed warping space.

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:32.297 align:middle line:84%
You can't do it
with electricity.

00:29:32.297 --> 00:29:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you had a chance to
talk to Townsend Brown, had he

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:37.850 align:middle line:84%
been here still, what
would you have asked him?

00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:40.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: I suppose
more details on his work.

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:42.850 align:middle line:90%


00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:46.000 align:middle line:84%
Like, there was one
photocopy of a paper

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.280 align:middle line:84%
from when he was working later
on in the '50s at a company

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:53.980 align:middle line:84%
that we got a lot of
interesting information

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:57.990 align:middle line:84%
about his experiments, lifting
devices off the ground.

00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And there must be so
much more that they don't

00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:04.190 align:middle line:90%
allow to go out that Brown did.

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:07.000 align:middle line:84%
But I would have asked
him more about his work.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could these
applications of propulsion,

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.270 align:middle line:90%
Paul, be used for airlines?

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:12.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Yes.

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:14.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we one day
be flying from Los Angeles

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:17.320 align:middle line:90%
to New York in 30 minutes?

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:19.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Right, you could.

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:23.710 align:middle line:84%
Not only would the B2
bomber propulsion systems,

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:28.270 align:middle line:84%
similar to the B2 bomber
create a driving force

00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:31.970 align:middle line:84%
that could go many times
the speed of sound,

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:35.586 align:middle line:84%
but it reduces the air
drag, because in the front,

00:30:35.586 --> 00:30:37.460 align:middle line:84%
you're charging the
leading edge of the wing.

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:40.060 align:middle line:84%
So it repels the
air from the craft.

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:42.910 align:middle line:84%
So the air sort of
slides around it.

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And it sort of slips
through the air

00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:46.877 align:middle line:90%
with very little resistance.

00:30:46.877 --> 00:30:48.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that
would be dramatic.

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:49.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Yeah.

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:50.470 align:middle line:90%
What a great flight.

00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:52.660 align:middle line:84%
You could cut,
dramatically, fuel bills.

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:58.260 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you ran
it on gasoline.

00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:02.200 align:middle line:84%
You could probably do it
on 10% of what you use now.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's a big
cost in air travel.

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:06.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How about cars?

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Yeah,
you could add this.

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:08.660 align:middle line:90%
I know one guy.

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:10.350 align:middle line:84%
He's thinking of
entering a race.

00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:11.867 align:middle line:90%
He put it on a car.

00:31:11.867 --> 00:31:13.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That would be exciting.

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: You could
really break the records.

00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:17.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Instantly.

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:19.470 align:middle line:84%
The salt flats would
look like nothing.

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:22.110 align:middle line:84%
Paul, tell us about
Eugene Podkletnov.

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:24.780 align:middle line:90%
He investigated gravity?

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:25.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Yeah.

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:27.750 align:middle line:90%
He had sort of like a laser.

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:31.620 align:middle line:10%
But he'd send a
pulse down through

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:36.750 align:middle line:10%
a superconducting
piece, a cylinder.

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And it would create a
wave, an electric charge

00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:44.416 align:middle line:84%
wave that would go down and
hit an electrode, an anode.

00:31:44.416 --> 00:31:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And then he found that even
though the electrons stopped,

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:49.480 align:middle line:90%
the gravity wave continued.

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:50.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:53.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: And it was
collimated just like a laser,

00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:55.970 align:middle line:84%
because he had
magnetic confinement.

00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:58.370 align:middle line:90%
So it sort of confined it.

00:31:58.370 --> 00:32:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And he actually would
knock over books

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:03.260 align:middle line:90%
at two miles away with this.

00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:04.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:04.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Yeah.

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:06.700 align:middle line:90%
And that was his low-power unit.

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:09.400 align:middle line:84%
Then he developed a
higher-power unit which is now

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:12.280 align:middle line:90%
in a secure facility in Moscow.

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And with that, they put a 4-inch
hole through a concrete block

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:19.070 align:middle line:84%
and was able to dent a
1-inch thick steel plate.

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:19.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dent it?

00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:20.786 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Dent it.

00:32:20.786 --> 00:32:21.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gosh.

00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:24.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: In my book, I
talk about with this technology,

00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:28.030 align:middle line:84%
you could go super-luminal
speeds to, let's say,

00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:29.770 align:middle line:90%
Alpha Centauri.

00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:34.090 align:middle line:84%
If you had thrusters, Podkletnov
thrusters pushing you.

00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:36.310 align:middle line:90%
And you could go to 200c.

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:38.862 align:middle line:84%
But you wouldn't feel
any inertial effects.

00:32:38.862 --> 00:32:40.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You wouldn't
have any G effects?

00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:43.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Yeah,
because it's gravity waves.

00:32:43.690 --> 00:32:46.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could we get up to
the speed of light with this?

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:47.286 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: You could go--

00:32:47.286 --> 00:32:50.740 align:middle line:84%
I was suggesting, for
the first few months,

00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:54.730 align:middle line:84%
you'd go up to 80% of speed of
light with Brown's thrusters

00:32:54.730 --> 00:32:57.890 align:middle line:90%
which are very efficient.

00:32:57.890 --> 00:32:59.990 align:middle line:84%
Then you'd turn on your
Podkletnov thrusters

00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:04.550 align:middle line:84%
to go lightspeed, so I
speak, to use some terms

00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:05.510 align:middle line:90%
from science fiction.

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:07.942 align:middle line:84%
You would end up
going up to 200c,

00:33:07.942 --> 00:33:11.600 align:middle line:84%
200 times the speed of light
when you're halfway there.

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:14.630 align:middle line:84%
Then you turn your craft around,
and you start decelerating back

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:16.710 align:middle line:90%
to normal speed.

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:19.160 align:middle line:84%
So the whole thing could
be done in a couple months.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.201 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's dramatic.

00:33:20.201 --> 00:33:24.050 align:middle line:84%
We've got some video of this
incredible Russian genius.

00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:28.370 align:middle line:10%
>>EUGENE PODKLETNOV: If we speak
about new propulsion systems,

00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:34.670 align:middle line:10%
definitely these gravity
effects can be used.

00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And even at present, the
knowledge that we have,

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:46.520 align:middle line:84%
if applied properly, can result
in very efficient propulsion

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:51.260 align:middle line:84%
systems close to
what we call UFOs.

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:57.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, in fact, I want to
believe that they exist.

00:33:57.530 --> 00:33:59.540 align:middle line:90%
And I have nothing against.

00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:03.410 align:middle line:84%
I have never seen
one in my life.

00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:06.380 align:middle line:84%
But from the experience
that we have,

00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:09.260 align:middle line:84%
it's possible to
make the objects that

00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:13.760 align:middle line:84%
will propagate in space using
modification of local gravity

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:17.070 align:middle line:84%
field, using
polarization of vacuum.

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:20.870 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of good
theoretical works in this field

00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:24.440 align:middle line:84%
and also a lot of
practical works.

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:27.830 align:middle line:84%
But somehow this is
a forbidden area,

00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:34.179 align:middle line:84%
maybe because there are
some traditions in physics,

00:34:34.179 --> 00:34:38.679 align:middle line:84%
maybe because there are
some contradictions.

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:45.460 align:middle line:84%
Also military organizations
are always interested in this.

00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:51.670 align:middle line:84%
And simply, if we speak
about anti-gravity platforms

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:55.239 align:middle line:84%
or lifters or
whatever it is, people

00:34:55.239 --> 00:34:57.820 align:middle line:84%
say there are some
contradictions

00:34:57.820 --> 00:34:59.680 align:middle line:90%
with physical laws.

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:01.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Paul, is
he still alive?

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:02.078 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Oh, yeah.

00:35:02.078 --> 00:35:03.560 align:middle line:84%
I spoke to him
about a month ago.

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:06.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is he still
doing dramatic things?

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:08.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: He's working
more on his device that

00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:11.410 align:middle line:84%
spins, a superconducting
spinning disk that reduces

00:35:11.410 --> 00:35:13.925 align:middle line:90%
gravity for a things above it.

00:35:13.925 --> 00:35:14.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where is he?

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:15.670 align:middle line:90%
Is he in Russia?

00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:17.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: In Finland,
he lives in Finland.

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:18.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:21.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: I was
interested to use his impulse

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:23.740 align:middle line:84%
beam to communicate,
send a message

00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:28.700 align:middle line:84%
to an extraterrestrial
communication beacon that is

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:32.030 align:middle line:90%
sending us a message currently.

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:34.060 align:middle line:84%
I discuss this in my
other book, "Decoding

00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:37.320 align:middle line:84%
the Message of the Pulsars,"
that we are being sent messages

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.120 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:39.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But we're not
decoding them, are we?

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:41.366 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: SETI
hasn't done anything,

00:35:41.366 --> 00:35:44.120 align:middle line:84%
because they've been looking
for frequencies, regular radio

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:44.920 align:middle line:90%
stations.

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:45.610 align:middle line:90%
And these aren't.

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:46.810 align:middle line:90%
They're pulses coming from--

00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:48.185 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
talked to SETI?

00:35:48.185 --> 00:35:50.440 align:middle line:84%
I know Seth Shostak would--
do they listen to you?

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:52.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: I
spoke with Shostak.

00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:53.450 align:middle line:90%
I had written my book.

00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:55.640 align:middle line:84%
I was willing to
send him a free copy.

00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:57.710 align:middle line:90%
And he didn't want to see it.

00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:58.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gosh.

00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:00.520 align:middle line:90%
He knows better than that.

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:03.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: He required
me to publish first

00:36:03.210 --> 00:36:04.710 align:middle line:90%
before he would even look.

00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:07.770 align:middle line:84%
I consider that
extremely arrogant.

00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:09.860 align:middle line:90%
I did publish finally.

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:13.670 align:middle line:84%
Two years ago, I did publish
on this in a technical journal.

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:16.190 align:middle line:90%
OK, so it's now published.

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:18.110 align:middle line:84%
I haven't been
contacted by SETI.

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:19.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's very
possible that if they

00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:22.820 align:middle line:84%
started listening
to you, we could be

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:24.404 align:middle line:90%
communicating with an ET race.

00:36:24.404 --> 00:36:25.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: It's
very important,

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:29.780 align:middle line:84%
because they're informing
us about a wave of particles

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:32.450 align:middle line:84%
that are coming towards
us this very minute.

00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And we're overdue
for the arrival.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.230 align:middle line:90%
It's called the superwave.

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:38.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what
happens when that hits?

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:40.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Biblical
Apocalypse, basically.

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:41.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:42.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Yes.

00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:43.995 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Paul,
are you telling me

00:36:43.995 --> 00:36:46.160 align:middle line:84%
that we're on the
verge of an apocalypse?

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:49.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: It's not
certain, because these waves

00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:52.190 align:middle line:90%
can have different intensities.

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:54.470 align:middle line:84%
I believe there was
one 700 years ago that

00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:55.790 align:middle line:90%
may have lasted a day.

00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And they see it in
the ice core record.

00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:02.900 align:middle line:84%
For example, it affected
the weather, crops.

00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:05.780 align:middle line:84%
But if it's a very intense
one, it can last 1,000 years.

00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:06.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my god.

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:08.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE:
Continually bombarding

00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:11.300 align:middle line:84%
the Earth and particles coming
into our magnetic field,

00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:14.690 align:middle line:84%
reducing the magnetic field of
the Earth, because when you get

00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:16.145 align:middle line:84%
particles in the
radiation belts,

00:37:16.145 --> 00:37:18.980 align:middle line:84%
they exert a magnetic
field opposed to the Earth.

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:20.900 align:middle line:84%
So the field is
going to decrease.

00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:22.400 align:middle line:84%
And it could reverse,
just like what

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.680 align:middle line:84%
happened during the
Neanderthal extinction.

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:26.255 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is anybody
listening to you?

00:37:26.255 --> 00:37:28.380 align:middle line:84%
When you talk about these
incredible things-- and I

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:31.550 align:middle line:84%
don't mean on a program like
this or "Coast to Coast."

00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:35.360 align:middle line:84%
But I mean are scientists
listening to you?

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:37.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: You get
very little feedback.

00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:42.350 align:middle line:84%
But I am continually
contacted by investigators.

00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:44.720 align:middle line:84%
But you're talking about
the traditional ones

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:45.580 align:middle line:90%
in the universities?

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:45.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY:

00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:46.340 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL LAVIOLETTE:
Yeah, who would say,

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:47.424 align:middle line:90%
this guy's onto something.

00:37:47.424 --> 00:37:48.798 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Some
of them, yeah.

00:37:48.798 --> 00:37:50.204 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in the
military, there's

00:37:50.204 --> 00:37:51.620 align:middle line:84%
people there that
are very excited

00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:54.084 align:middle line:84%
about sub-quantum
kinetics and my book,

00:37:54.084 --> 00:37:55.625 align:middle line:84%
"Secrets of Anti-Gravity
Propulsion."

00:37:55.625 --> 00:37:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And I hope this will
lead to something.

00:37:57.770 --> 00:38:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And universities, I've been
in contact with a few here.

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:06.020 align:middle line:84%
They're afraid, I think,
to investigate anything

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:07.070 align:middle line:90%
that deals with either.

00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:09.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, they don't want
to rock the apple cart either.

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:09.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Yeah.

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:11.690 align:middle line:84%
They're afraid they
might lose their--

00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:12.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Status?

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:15.226 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Their status as
a university or their whatever.

00:38:15.226 --> 00:38:17.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what you do
talk about is pretty dramatic.

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:22.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Yeah,
I've sort of cut my ties

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:24.720 align:middle line:90%
with the standard theories.

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:25.680 align:middle line:90%
And I've continued.

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:27.570 align:middle line:90%
And I'm in a different reality.

00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:29.820 align:middle line:90%
I view the world differently.

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:31.290 align:middle line:90%
And it's very beautiful.

00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:35.160 align:middle line:84%
I would like other people to
learn sub-quantum kinetics,

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:36.210 align:middle line:90%
at least read.

00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:38.610 align:middle line:10%
"Beyond the Big Bang" was
the first title in the book,

00:38:38.610 --> 00:38:40.560 align:middle line:10%
and then it change to
"Genesis of Cosmos"

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:42.810 align:middle line:10%
in the second printing.

00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:43.980 align:middle line:90%
But it's so beautiful.

00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:45.797 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
change the world.

00:38:45.797 --> 00:38:47.130 align:middle line:90%
We're going to have free energy.

00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:48.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Overnight.

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:49.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Yes.

00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:51.600 align:middle line:84%
This should be taught
in every school.

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:53.490 align:middle line:90%
And the concepts are not hard.

00:38:53.490 --> 00:38:55.032 align:middle line:84%
They're much simpler
than physics.

00:38:55.032 --> 00:38:56.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
the first thing

00:38:56.490 --> 00:39:00.000 align:middle line:84%
be if you had an opportunity
to have that audience who

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.040 align:middle line:90%
could create change?

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:03.440 align:middle line:90%
What would you tell them?

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:06.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: If it's
possible to wave a wand,

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:09.420 align:middle line:84%
have sub-quantum kinetics
taught in every university

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:11.670 align:middle line:84%
and general system
theory, because it's

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:14.710 align:middle line:84%
an application of general
systems theory to physics.

00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:15.916 align:middle line:90%
I was the first to do that.

00:39:15.916 --> 00:39:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's the
next evolution?

00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:17.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Yes.

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:20.190 align:middle line:84%
Systems theory had been applied
to business, for example.

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:22.950 align:middle line:84%
It completely changed
business organization theory

00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:24.190 align:middle line:90%
for the better.

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:28.990 align:middle line:84%
It's been applied to sociology,
psychiatry, you name it.

00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And nobody had
tried micro-physics.

00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And I just happened to
be the one to do that.

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:37.371 align:middle line:84%
And the result is sub-quantum
kinetics when you do that.

00:39:37.371 --> 00:39:39.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With these
engines for airplanes,

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:42.280 align:middle line:90%
for example, would they last?

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.700 align:middle line:84%
Would we have to worry
about a mechanical failure

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:46.380 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that?

00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:48.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: I think they
would be safer than regular,

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:55.775 align:middle line:84%
because you're not dealing with
birds flying into your engines.

00:39:55.775 --> 00:39:57.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That happened to
me yesterday, by the way.

00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:58.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Really?

00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.741 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: From Los
Angeles, the flight

00:39:59.741 --> 00:40:02.280 align:middle line:84%
was delayed, because
the incoming plane got

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:03.470 align:middle line:90%
hit by a bird.

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:03.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Yeah.

00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And there was a crash
recently they got hit

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:07.170 align:middle line:90%
by two birds in each engine.

00:40:07.170 --> 00:40:08.610 align:middle line:90%
And they had to land.

00:40:08.610 --> 00:40:09.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's scary.

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:12.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, that would be dramatic,
that kind of technology.

00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:15.662 align:middle line:84%
And do we have the capability
right now of developing these?

00:40:15.662 --> 00:40:16.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Oh, yeah.

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:17.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We could do it?

00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:18.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: We could
do this immediately.

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:19.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Make the engines?

00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:20.801 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: This
is old technology.

00:40:20.801 --> 00:40:22.930 align:middle line:84%
This was developed in
'50s, 50 years ago.

00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:24.513 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, why
aren't we using it?

00:40:24.513 --> 00:40:26.989 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Because
they're afraid to--

00:40:26.989 --> 00:40:28.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something's
holding us back.

00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:30.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: It's
the military view.

00:40:30.330 --> 00:40:34.290 align:middle line:84%
Technology should be licensed,
just like they license

00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:36.640 align:middle line:90%
driver's license and son.

00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And we can defend our
borders to such aerospace.

00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:46.690 align:middle line:84%
We've got radar if there's
any airplane coming in.

00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:49.210 align:middle line:84%
It could be controlled if
they're a little afraid

00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:51.110 align:middle line:90%
of it being misused.

00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:52.930 align:middle line:90%
But heck, we should use it.

00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:54.085 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think so too.

00:40:54.085 --> 00:40:55.600 align:middle line:90%
This is dramatic.

00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:58.340 align:middle line:90%
It's also exciting and real.

00:40:58.340 --> 00:40:59.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Yeah.

00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:00.181 align:middle line:90%
And I know another fella.

00:41:00.181 --> 00:41:03.710 align:middle line:84%
He's reverse engineered
Schauberger's turbine,

00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:04.510 align:middle line:90%
incredible.

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:07.270 align:middle line:84%
And the patent office is
sitting on this patent.

00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:09.040 align:middle line:90%
They won't issue the patent.

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.962 align:middle line:84%
The patent office,
according to law,

00:41:10.962 --> 00:41:13.420 align:middle line:84%
is supposed to issue a patent
if it's a new idea, if nobody

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:15.422 align:middle line:90%
else has done it, and it works.

00:41:15.422 --> 00:41:16.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're
sitting there?

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:18.838 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: They are
coming up with a new law

00:41:18.838 --> 00:41:20.680 align:middle line:90%
which Congress did not pass.

00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:23.140 align:middle line:84%
It says it must obey
the laws of physics,

00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:25.390 align:middle line:84%
otherwise we don't
give you the patent.

00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:26.230 align:middle line:90%
That's not in law.

00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:27.354 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who made them god?

00:41:27.354 --> 00:41:29.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: The laws
of physics are wrong.

00:41:29.590 --> 00:41:33.040 align:middle line:84%
What they're doing is they've
taken a corrupt theory

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:35.260 align:middle line:84%
paradigm, and
they're restricting

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:37.840 align:middle line:90%
the entire civilization with it.

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:39.490 align:middle line:84%
It's like something
around their neck.

00:41:39.490 --> 00:41:43.550 align:middle line:84%
It's like we're going to
drown with physics in the end.

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:45.960 align:middle line:84%
We've got big problems
in this world.

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:48.400 align:middle line:84%
We've got to go to
newer technology.

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:52.870 align:middle line:84%
If Trump wanted to do something
to improve the US's position,

00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:55.180 align:middle line:84%
he wouldn't put
up trade barriers.

00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:58.820 align:middle line:90%
He would get us on free energy.

00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:01.780 align:middle line:84%
We could be smelting
iron for 1/10

00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:04.150 align:middle line:90%
the cost they do it in China.

00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:05.210 align:middle line:90%
free energy.

00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:07.230 align:middle line:84%
Of course, China would
start doing it too later.

00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:08.030 align:middle line:90%
They'd catch on.

00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:09.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Everybody
would be doing it.

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:09.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Yeah.

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:11.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But so what, right?

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:15.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: I know
people in metal recycling

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:16.900 align:middle line:84%
that are actually
looking into this.

00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:18.190 align:middle line:90%
They would like to do this.

00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:22.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We could colonize Mars
with this kind of technology.

00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:24.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: And
Mars has water.

00:42:24.090 --> 00:42:26.631 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long would it take
to get to the moon from here?

00:42:26.631 --> 00:42:27.860 align:middle line:90%
Instead of three days--

00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:29.693 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: We're
talking about few hours.

00:42:29.693 --> 00:42:30.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A few hours.

00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:32.220 align:middle line:90%
Gosh.

00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:34.850 align:middle line:84%
I love the application
for travel.

00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:39.210 align:middle line:84%
It would make the Concord
look like an old bicycle

00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:40.860 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:43.860 align:middle line:84%
Paul, if you could wave that
wand again one more time, what

00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:45.909 align:middle line:90%
would you change right now?

00:42:45.909 --> 00:42:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: I would
really come down hard

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:49.980 align:middle line:84%
on the patent office, get
them to issue these patents.

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:52.230 align:middle line:84%
I would get them to make it
a top priority, because it

00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:53.030 align:middle line:90%
should be.

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:55.200 align:middle line:84%
If the patent is for
an energy purpose,

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:58.350 align:middle line:84%
it's supposed to be given
an accelerated track

00:42:58.350 --> 00:42:59.550 align:middle line:90%
through the patent office.

00:42:59.550 --> 00:43:01.810 align:middle line:90%
Instead, they stop it entirely.

00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:04.770 align:middle line:84%
So they should be fair and
allow free energy machines

00:43:04.770 --> 00:43:06.930 align:middle line:90%
to be patented if they work.

00:43:06.930 --> 00:43:09.280 align:middle line:84%
If they're not sure, well,
have a demonstration.

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:10.080 align:middle line:90%
See it.

00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:12.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there companies
doing these things now

00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:14.170 align:middle line:90%
that we just don't know about?

00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:14.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Yeah.

00:43:14.970 --> 00:43:17.780 align:middle line:84%
This fellow has backing
that I know about.

00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:18.780 align:middle line:90%
There's other companies.

00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:21.075 align:middle line:84%
There's a guy who developed
a car that runs on water.

00:43:21.075 --> 00:43:25.052 align:middle line:84%
The patent office is sitting
currently on his application.

00:43:25.052 --> 00:43:26.385 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I had heard about that.

00:43:26.385 --> 00:43:27.360 align:middle line:90%
It runs on water.

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:29.160 align:middle line:90%
And they've suppressed it.

00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Yeah,
not Stanley Myers.

00:43:30.810 --> 00:43:33.770 align:middle line:84%
But Stanley Myers did that, and
they killed him, as you know.

00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:36.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm concerned about
this apocalyptic event that

00:43:36.810 --> 00:43:38.060 align:middle line:90%
may or may not occur.

00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:41.400 align:middle line:84%
But if it does,
when would it be?

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:43.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Well, based on
the Fatima prophecy and stuff

00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:46.770 align:middle line:84%
like this, if you
take those as hints,

00:43:46.770 --> 00:43:50.130 align:middle line:84%
you can sort of predict from
what was been said maybe

00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:51.180 align:middle line:90%
in the next few years.

00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:54.000 align:middle line:84%
There might be a miracle or
something we should expect.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.000 align:middle line:84%
I think ETs play into
this, because they're here

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.560 align:middle line:84%
to shepherd us
through this event.

00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:00.768 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're a believer
in that, a physicist who's

00:44:00.768 --> 00:44:01.680 align:middle line:90%
a believer in that?

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:02.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Yes.

00:44:02.610 --> 00:44:05.670 align:middle line:84%
They know we can't
handle a superwave.

00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to be here
for a recovery operation

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:09.480 align:middle line:90%
if it gets too bad.

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:10.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Could they shield us?

00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:13.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: I think they think
of it more as something that we

00:44:13.830 --> 00:44:16.774 align:middle line:90%
have to go through, because--

00:44:16.774 --> 00:44:17.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everybody else has.

00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: What it does,
it reduces tremendously

00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:21.900 align:middle line:90%
the population.

00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And it sort of
resets civilization.

00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:26.340 align:middle line:84%
So it will allow
all these new things

00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:28.272 align:middle line:90%
to come out at that point.

00:44:28.272 --> 00:44:30.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what a
horrible moment for that.

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:30.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LAVIOLETTE: Right.

00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:32.820 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't necessarily
have to be really bad.

00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:35.880 align:middle line:84%
It could be one of these
small superwaves, hopefully.

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:38.520 align:middle line:84%
But if it's something
like the one it happened

00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:43.320 align:middle line:84%
41,000 years ago, it
killed off a whole race

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:46.590 align:middle line:84%
of human beings,
the Neanderthals.

00:44:46.590 --> 00:44:47.580 align:middle line:90%
And it's in our myths.

00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:51.784 align:middle line:84%
They talk about it
in the Hopi myths.

00:44:51.784 --> 00:44:52.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is in the myths?

00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:55.735 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVIOLETTE: They talk about
the race of the wooden man

00:44:55.735 --> 00:44:58.440 align:middle line:90%
and the stone man or something.

00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:02.690 align:middle line:84%
There are various races that
got killed off by catastrophes,

00:45:02.690 --> 00:45:04.380 align:middle line:90%
and a new civilization emerged.

00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:06.325 align:middle line:90%
And then that was killed off.

00:45:06.325 --> 00:45:08.200 align:middle line:84%
So they may have been
referring, for example,

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:09.820 align:middle line:90%
to the Neanderthals.

00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:12.040 align:middle line:84%
The Neanderthal
extinction is marked

00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:15.160 align:middle line:90%
in the Egyptian calendar.

00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:20.590 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian list
of kings of Turin,

00:45:20.590 --> 00:45:26.340 align:middle line:84%
it goes back 41,000
before the present.

00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:27.610 align:middle line:90%
And that's when this occurred.

00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:29.870 align:middle line:10%
It was the biggest
superwave event

00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:32.930 align:middle line:10%
in the Ice Age period
since last 100,000 years,

00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:36.810 align:middle line:10%
well, the last 60,000 at least.

00:45:36.810 --> 00:45:39.140 align:middle line:10%
And they considered
it so important--

00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:42.530 align:middle line:10%
well, heck, if a whole
race of human beings--

00:45:42.530 --> 00:45:44.089 align:middle line:10%
I would consider
them human in a way.

00:45:44.089 --> 00:45:45.630 align:middle line:84%
They were a little
different from us.

00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:48.940 align:middle line:84%
But disappeared-- that's
important to mark down.

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:52.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sure is Paul, thanks
for being on "Beyond Belief."

00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:55.020 align:middle line:84%
What amazing
technology, the ability

00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:57.510 align:middle line:84%
to have a propulsion
system that could get us

00:45:57.510 --> 00:46:01.170 align:middle line:84%
to Mars in five days, that
could get us from Los Angeles

00:46:01.170 --> 00:46:05.040 align:middle line:84%
to New York in a few
moments, I like it.

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:06.660 align:middle line:90%
And maybe one day it'll happen.

00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:07.500 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:09.166 align:middle line:10%
And thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
