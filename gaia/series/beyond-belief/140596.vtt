00:00:18.845 --> 00:00:20.970 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well, if
you watch Gaia Television,

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.345 align:middle line:10%
you're going to know this
fellow I'm about to introduce--

00:00:23.345 --> 00:00:26.640 align:middle line:10%
Ben Stewart, a world-renowned
musician, filmmaker,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.900 align:middle line:10%
speaker on spiritual ascension,
super-human potential,

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.430 align:middle line:10%
and self-discovery.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.680 align:middle line:84%
He's got some great
films and documentaries,

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.300 align:middle line:90%
which we'll get into as well.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.890 align:middle line:90%
Ben, welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:38.330 align:middle line:90%
>>BEN STEWART: Thank you.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.371 align:middle line:90%
It's an honor to be here.

00:00:39.371 --> 00:00:41.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is very
different for me.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Because you're a
musician by trade,

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.130 align:middle line:84%
spent years in the Air Force,
and now you're dealing with

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.720 align:middle line:90%
this-- what I would call--

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.450 align:middle line:84%
super-humanism and
transformation.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.065 align:middle line:84%
How did you make that
evolutionary turn.

00:00:55.065 --> 00:00:58.380 align:middle line:10%
>>STEWART: Really, the
evolution found me.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.070 align:middle line:10%
I've always been into working
out and exercise, and elevating

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.010 align:middle line:10%
the mind and cognition.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.488 align:middle line:84%
The military-- I wasn't able
to speak out about things,

00:01:06.488 --> 00:01:08.613 align:middle line:84%
as part of being in the
military service, you know.

00:01:08.613 --> 00:01:08.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, sir.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.840 align:middle line:90%
No, sir.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.640 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Mhm.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.540 align:middle line:10%
As soon as I got
out, I was in a band.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.460 align:middle line:10%
And I started speaking
out about everything

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.740 align:middle line:10%
I was seeing in the
world in the band.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.020 align:middle line:90%
And then I started--

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.480 align:middle line:90%
basically, I got really sick.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.760 align:middle line:90%
I lost a lot of weight.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.030 align:middle line:84%
And I had to rethink
what health was to me.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.280 align:middle line:84%
So the more I started looking
into different avenues

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.740 align:middle line:84%
of real health, it
was also getting

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.070 align:middle line:90%
into the health of the mind.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And when I started
piecing together

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.570 align:middle line:84%
over 20 different
disciplines, it

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.635 align:middle line:84%
started turning into what I now
call the super-human genesis.

00:01:37.635 --> 00:01:41.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you did
this a lot on your own.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:42.420 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.400 align:middle line:90%
Well, actually-- so I'm 34 now.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.950 align:middle line:84%
When I hit 33,
there was this point

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.439 align:middle line:84%
where I just decided to
learn as much as I could--

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.239 align:middle line:90%


00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:51.829 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're such
an old man, Ben.

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:52.629 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: I know.

00:01:52.629 --> 00:01:53.850 align:middle line:90%
It's getting to me.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.460 align:middle line:84%
But I started learning
everything I could--

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.260 align:middle line:84%
spinning fire-- spinning
poi; juggling; hacky sack;

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.880 align:middle line:84%
movement training; ice baths;
and breathing techniques;

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.910 align:middle line:84%
cognition; anything I could do
that was just learning about

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:09.900 align:middle line:90%
how--

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.095 align:middle line:84%
who I am and how I engage with
the environment around me.

00:02:13.095 --> 00:02:16.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you say that
most people just don't get it,

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.690 align:middle line:90%
in terms of their own health--

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.520 align:middle line:90%
mental and physical?

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.400 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: I say that we get to
a point where we're not sick,

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.450 align:middle line:90%
and we call that health.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.280 align:middle line:84%
And then nothing
calls us beyond.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I'm here, is
because I had nobody really

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.250 align:middle line:90%
calling me beyond.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.660 align:middle line:90%
I had to--

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.170 align:middle line:84%
I had to get sick for
me to start really

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.550 align:middle line:90%
asking myself, what is health.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.470 align:middle line:90%
So, I think, a lot of people--

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.330 align:middle line:90%
they get into a comfort zone.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's where they just
kind of stay and they flatline.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And I'm here to say, our
potential is way up here.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.659 align:middle line:84%
And we are operating
way down here.

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:53.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we're
human beings, Ben.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.680 align:middle line:84%
So we have these ups
and downs in life--

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.380 align:middle line:84%
both physical and
mental, as well.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.607 align:middle line:84%
How do you keep pushing yourself
to try to stay above that?

00:03:03.607 --> 00:03:05.790 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Really,
it's difficult to say,

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.290 align:middle line:84%
because there is
this inner calling.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And I do have
moments where I don't

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.280 align:middle line:90%
feel that I'm good enough.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.010 align:middle line:84%
But, I would say, the best
thing for me is family--

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.440 align:middle line:90%
family and friends.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.145 align:middle line:84%
I have a beautiful wife and
a beautiful one-year-old

00:03:18.145 --> 00:03:18.945 align:middle line:90%
daughter.

00:03:18.945 --> 00:03:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Beautiful.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.390 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: And I can't fail.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.320 align:middle line:90%
So that's what it is.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.130 align:middle line:84%
I don't have the option
to stay where I'm at.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.720 align:middle line:84%
I need to keep
developing, because I'm

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.765 align:middle line:84%
setting an example for a little
girl coming into this world.

00:03:30.765 --> 00:03:34.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you have someone
that you could tap into who

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.850 align:middle line:90%
helped teach you these things?

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.625 align:middle line:84%
Or did you have to do
this all on your own?

00:03:38.625 --> 00:03:40.770 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: I would
say everything

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.790 align:middle line:84%
that I've done has to do
with finding individuals

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.950 align:middle line:84%
in different
disciplines, all over.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And, as I would find them,
they would speak something--

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.280 align:middle line:84%
some form of my
language that I would--

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.810 align:middle line:84%
not fully understand
it, but I would

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.332 align:middle line:84%
know that this is what I
needed to dive into and learn.

00:03:58.332 --> 00:03:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And then, as I
started learning all

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.290 align:middle line:84%
these different
disciplines, I began

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.150 align:middle line:84%
to realize that my
place in all of it

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.790 align:middle line:84%
is not to become the
expert in any one field,

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.360 align:middle line:84%
but to homogenize it, and bring
it into one discipline that

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.992 align:middle line:90%
is super-human ascension.

00:04:10.992 --> 00:04:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ben, in
one of your films,

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.340 align:middle line:84%
called "Kymatica,"
you kind of take

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.519 align:middle line:84%
a look at the
separation, the divorce,

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.095 align:middle line:90%
between nature and human beings.

00:04:21.095 --> 00:04:23.220 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: An explanation
of our conscious universe

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.450 align:middle line:84%
has been attempted by religion,
science, and philosophy.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.330 align:middle line:84%
The neglect of biological
nature from any organism

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.585 align:middle line:90%
causes illness.

00:04:32.585 --> 00:04:35.800 align:middle line:84%
A divorce from nature,
exile from Eden,

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.510 align:middle line:90%
confounding of tongues--

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.680 align:middle line:84%
they are all symptoms-- not
of a biblical god, or deity,

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.960 align:middle line:90%
but the true self.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.630 align:middle line:84%
The greatest and only
threat to ourselves

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.280 align:middle line:84%
is a loss of self, the
death of our divinity.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nice job.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.962 align:middle line:90%
Now what does kymatica mean?

00:04:53.962 --> 00:04:55.420 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Kymatica
is a Greek term

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.960 align:middle line:84%
for cymatics, which is basically
just the science of sound

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.340 align:middle line:84%
and matter and the
interplay between them.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.460 align:middle line:84%
So that's-- as a musician,
I love that term.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.600 align:middle line:84%
But that, to me, is
the entire universe.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.860 align:middle line:84%
It's all the interplay
between vibration and matter.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when we
separate from nature,

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.187 align:middle line:84%
when we divorce from
nature, what is that?

00:05:12.187 --> 00:05:14.770 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Basically, that means
that we're lost as a species,

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.280 align:middle line:90%
as far as nature is concerned.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.900 align:middle line:84%
We don't eat natural diets
like our ancestors did.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.050 align:middle line:84%
We move through flattened
architectural design, not

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.170 align:middle line:84%
the lush and dynamic
nature that we used to.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And we're also mixing together
social groups quicker,

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.540 align:middle line:90%
with different value groups--

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.520 align:middle line:84%
value systems-- quicker
than we ever have.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.040 align:middle line:84%
So, basically, put
all that together

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.460 align:middle line:84%
and we have a brand new set of
stressors for the human body

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.680 align:middle line:84%
and the mind to deal
with, that evolution never

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.520 align:middle line:90%
prepared us for.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.916 align:middle line:84%
So that's the real separation of
nature and where we are today.

00:05:46.916 --> 00:05:49.360 align:middle line:84%
Ben, Ben, do you think most
people are simply out of touch

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.700 align:middle line:90%
with nature?

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:51.700 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: I believe so.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think that culture
and our economic climate

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.940 align:middle line:84%
really makes a lot of things
fascinating that aren't

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.030 align:middle line:90%
a part of nature anymore.

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.110 align:middle line:84%
We're marveling in
our own creations,

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.950 align:middle line:84%
and forgetting about the
rich dynamics of nature--

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.660 align:middle line:90%
which isn't negative per se.

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.080 align:middle line:84%
But when we get lost in that
marveling of our own creations,

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.255 align:middle line:84%
we forget about
the natural world.

00:06:13.255 --> 00:06:14.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: When you got sick--

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.870 align:middle line:84%
and if you don't want
to talk about it,

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:20.282 align:middle line:84%
specifically, let me know--
but what happened to you?

00:06:20.282 --> 00:06:21.970 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Oh, man.

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:26.710 align:middle line:84%
Basically, this was exactly
when I met my fiancee.

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And I was actually doing
a tour through Europe.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.090 align:middle line:90%
And that was how I met her.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think I just wore
my body down a lot.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.160 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't taking care of myself.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.660 align:middle line:90%
I was living at the extremes.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.310 align:middle line:90%
I was partying a lot.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.820 align:middle line:84%
And I lost about 25
pounds in seven days.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.070 align:middle line:90%
I was bedridden in Europe.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And so that's how things kind
of broke down in my life.

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.270 align:middle line:90%
But I also thought that--

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.640 align:middle line:84%
I had crazy ideas of
what I was actually

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.610 align:middle line:84%
dealing with at the time,
like what my illness was.

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And that was at
the point where I

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.920 align:middle line:84%
realized that I hadn't been
treating myself correctly.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.440 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't been actually
loving this thing.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.840 align:middle line:84%
I'd been using it as a
tool for gratification.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.396 align:middle line:84%
So that was my
divorce from nature.

00:07:10.396 --> 00:07:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And that was,
really, the impetus

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.500 align:middle line:84%
that started leading
me into the health

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.210 align:middle line:90%
that I'm getting into now.

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Had you
continued on that course,

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.036 align:middle line:90%
would you have died?

00:07:20.036 --> 00:07:21.160 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: I'm pretty sure.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.326 align:middle line:90%
Either that, or I'd be--

00:07:23.326 --> 00:07:24.950 align:middle line:84%
I love Charlie Sheen--
but I'd probably

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:28.570 align:middle line:84%
be like looking a lot older
and just a lot more beat

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:31.540 align:middle line:84%
up by life, in the way
that you see Charlie

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:33.040 align:middle line:90%
Sheen in the past five years.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.520 align:middle line:90%
His face has changed.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.146 align:middle line:84%
And I think I would have
probably gone down that road.

00:07:38.146 --> 00:07:40.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you had that
chance to talk to Charlie,

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:42.460 align:middle line:90%
what would you tell him?

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:44.245 align:middle line:90%
Smack him in the head?

00:07:44.245 --> 00:07:45.310 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: No.

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:48.280 align:middle line:84%
Mainly, I would ask him
the right questions--

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.810 align:middle line:90%
you know, what do you value?

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:51.250 align:middle line:84%
What is it that
you really value?

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.041 align:middle line:84%
And what are you trying
to get out of life?

00:07:53.041 --> 00:07:54.790 align:middle line:84%
Because maybe he's
on the exact path

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:56.980 align:middle line:90%
that he needs or wants to be.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:00.910 align:middle line:84%
But I had to come to the
understanding that that path--

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:02.660 align:middle line:90%
you know, I was in a rock band.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:06.300 align:middle line:84%
So although being at
a party late night--

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:09.639 align:middle line:84%
all the drugs and the sex and
the alcohol that are around.

00:08:09.639 --> 00:08:11.305 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You abused
yourself, basically.

00:08:11.305 --> 00:08:11.650 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: I did.

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:12.760 align:middle line:90%
I really abused myself.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:16.002 align:middle line:84%
And I needed to divorce
myself from what I was doing.

00:08:16.002 --> 00:08:18.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you find that there
are individuals in our life

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:21.910 align:middle line:84%
that can help us or
prevent us from reaching

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:25.434 align:middle line:90%
these goals that we're after?

00:08:25.434 --> 00:08:26.350 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Absolutely.

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:29.280 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think that
you can look out--

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.730 align:middle line:90%
you don't need to find a guru.

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:33.720 align:middle line:84%
Your next-door neighbor probably
has the same amount of wisdom.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.030 align:middle line:90%
They've lived their life.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And, yes, there are
forces that keep us down.

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:40.790 align:middle line:84%
There are the economic elite,
and the hidden priesthoods

00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:41.590 align:middle line:90%
above them.

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:44.290 align:middle line:90%
And I get into them in my films.

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:46.630 align:middle line:84%
But I started to
realize that none of us

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:48.390 align:middle line:84%
really know these
economic elites.

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:49.746 align:middle line:90%
We read books about them.

00:08:49.746 --> 00:08:51.370 align:middle line:84%
We may have met them
a couple of times.

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:53.750 align:middle line:90%
But we play in different groups.

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:56.560 align:middle line:84%
So I was into conspiracy,
and I was pointing my fingers

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:57.490 align:middle line:90%
at them a lot.

00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:59.080 align:middle line:84%
Until I started
realizing that there

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.020 align:middle line:84%
was three fingers
pointing right back at me.

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:04.132 align:middle line:84%
We need to start looking
at our own potential

00:09:04.132 --> 00:09:05.590 align:middle line:84%
and what we can
bring to the table,

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:09.025 align:middle line:84%
rather than saying they need
to change their behavior.

00:09:09.025 --> 00:09:12.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When we talk about
the terms super-humans,

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:14.410 align:middle line:90%
what does that mean to you?

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Basically,
that means--

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:18.880 align:middle line:84%
it's nothing above
and beyond science.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.620 align:middle line:84%
You know, it can seem
very comic booky.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.078 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of like
that, because it

00:09:22.078 --> 00:09:24.070 align:middle line:84%
allows us to go beyond
what we allow ourselves

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:26.140 align:middle line:90%
to believe about our potential.

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.720 align:middle line:84%
But it's nothing
that's beyond science.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.200 align:middle line:84%
It's just a highly optimized
and elevated human being

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.080 align:middle line:90%
in all levels.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:36.370 align:middle line:84%
So that means in our diet,
in our movement habits,

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:38.830 align:middle line:84%
and in the ways that
we focus our mind.

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And then putting
them all together

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.722 align:middle line:84%
in support of an
intention that we have

00:09:42.722 --> 00:09:43.930 align:middle line:90%
to carry forth with our life.

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:44.355 align:middle line:90%


00:09:44.355 --> 00:09:46.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ever since I've
been doing "Beyond Belief"

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.020 align:middle line:90%
here on Gaia--

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.930 align:middle line:84%
kicked my personal
life into high gear

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:53.840 align:middle line:84%
as well, in terms of trying
to take care of yourself.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.530 align:middle line:84%
We're only on this
planet for a short term.

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And you might as well make
it the most effective,

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:00.280 align:middle line:90%
the best way you can.

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And I started doing
all kinds of things--

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:08.260 align:middle line:84%
some meditation; yoga-type
practices within myself;

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.630 align:middle line:84%
supplements; watching
what you eat.

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:12.130 align:middle line:90%
I'll slip once in a while.

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:14.710 align:middle line:84%
I'll order a pizza
like the next person.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:18.520 align:middle line:84%
But I really have
downplayed things like that.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's made a
great difference.

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:24.880 align:middle line:84%
Plus I'm trying to surround
myself around positive people,

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.050 align:middle line:90%
not negativity.

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:28.850 align:middle line:84%
Did you find that negative
people in your life

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:29.650 align:middle line:90%
pulled you down?

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:30.224 align:middle line:90%


00:10:30.224 --> 00:10:31.390 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah, absolutely.

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's, partly,
because I didn't

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.680 align:middle line:90%
have my sovereignty, in a way.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.440 align:middle line:84%
Because, you know, I think
if we were truly sovereign

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.780 align:middle line:84%
and in our
super-human potential,

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:42.820 align:middle line:84%
we'd be able to see the
people who are suffering

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:47.170 align:middle line:84%
and their negativity, and be
able to disassociate ourselves

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:49.150 align:middle line:84%
from it, but still
be able to help out.

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:53.230 align:middle line:84%
But, yes, I was in a band, so
I was constantly around that.

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:55.780 align:middle line:84%
So I was, in a sense, a
victim of that environment.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until I removed
myself from it that I started

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:01.420 align:middle line:84%
realizing that everyone
who's in bands--

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:04.810 align:middle line:84%
they eat gas station food;
they're sitting in a van

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:05.674 align:middle line:90%
for 10--

00:11:05.674 --> 00:11:05.968 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No exercise.

00:11:05.968 --> 00:11:07.180 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: --11 Hours a days.

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:08.050 align:middle line:90%
No exercise.

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And sedentary is
the new smoking.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.160 align:middle line:90%
Sitting is the new smoking.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.580 align:middle line:84%
So it's very nice to hear that
you've been doing all that,

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:18.680 align:middle line:84%
because, really,
slipping up is great.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:19.480 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.420 align:middle line:84%
Because it gives us those
reference points of where

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:25.030 align:middle line:90%
we've-- how far we've come--

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:26.920 align:middle line:84%
as long as we keep
the trajectory

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:30.370 align:middle line:84%
going towards elevating
our human potential.

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:32.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's interesting,
too, is when you slip up,

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:35.950 align:middle line:84%
whether it's not working
out when you're supposed to;

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:38.590 align:middle line:84%
or not taking the right
intake of supplements;

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:41.740 align:middle line:84%
or not eating the
right foods; you really

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.830 align:middle line:84%
feel guilty about it, like
you're cheating yourself,

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:47.320 align:middle line:84%
that you've done
something wrong.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.360 align:middle line:90%
And I kind of like that feeling.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.490 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: It makes us
value what it is that we're

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:52.600 align:middle line:90%
doing throughout the day.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.160 align:middle line:84%
I always go back
to our ancestors,

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.080 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't look
at anything as working out.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:00.340 align:middle line:84%
They moved 10 to 15
miles a day just to eat.

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:01.950 align:middle line:90%
So even in their diet--

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:04.960 align:middle line:84%
diet wasn't just the food
that you fit in your mouth.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.430 align:middle line:84%
It was connected to every
other activity going on

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:08.230 align:middle line:90%
throughout the day.

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:12.310 align:middle line:84%
They would squat, foraging
for plants for 12 hours a day.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:14.860 align:middle line:84%
You can hardly find somebody
who can squat for two

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:16.495 align:middle line:90%
to five minutes nowadays.

00:12:16.495 --> 00:12:17.295 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:12:17.295 --> 00:12:18.515 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And get up.

00:12:18.515 --> 00:12:19.820 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah, exactly.

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And there was also
this great reverence.

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:24.790 align:middle line:84%
They would have to bring all
this food back to their camp

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:26.860 align:middle line:84%
and everyone would
celebrate the food.

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:31.240 align:middle line:84%
So diet meant more than just
going to the grocery store--

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.450 align:middle line:84%
no problem solving up here,
no problem solving down there.

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:36.220 align:middle line:84%
But they used to have
to utilize the body

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:37.660 align:middle line:90%
and mind in order to eat.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And they understood
that this food was

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.050 align:middle line:90%
part of the great web of life.

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:43.660 align:middle line:84%
What I've gotten into
is the connectivity

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:47.920 align:middle line:84%
of our movement and our eating
and how to focus the mind.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.280 align:middle line:84%
And, really, the more we use
the body, the less our mind

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.582 align:middle line:90%
really needs to take over.

00:12:52.582 --> 00:12:54.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who would
you say might be

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:57.970 align:middle line:84%
some of the super humans
on this planet today?

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:01.990 align:middle line:84%
My example would be someone
like Sylvester Stallone, who

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.935 align:middle line:90%
looks great for his age.

00:13:03.935 --> 00:13:05.110 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah, absolutely.

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:06.568 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think
these people that

00:13:06.568 --> 00:13:10.970 align:middle line:84%
have the seed of the
super-humanism in there.

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:15.130 align:middle line:84%
Because, mainly, my definition
of the super-human--

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:18.790 align:middle line:84%
it goes beyond just the ambition
to work out and look good

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:20.330 align:middle line:90%
and optimize your health.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:22.852 align:middle line:84%
It has to go into what are
we doing for the planet.

00:13:22.852 --> 00:13:24.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe
that I was put here

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:28.520 align:middle line:84%
on this planet just to look
good and to gratify myself.

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:32.050 align:middle line:84%
So when I look at what
do I have to offer,

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:33.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm optimizing myself--

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:36.220 align:middle line:84%
not for myself,
but for my daughter

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:38.512 align:middle line:84%
and for future
generations to come.

00:13:38.512 --> 00:13:39.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ben, in
one of your films,

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:43.780 align:middle line:84%
"Waking Infinity," you talk
about the incredible piercing

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:46.285 align:middle line:90%
of the four-minute mile.

00:13:46.285 --> 00:13:49.810 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Prior to 1954,
people overwhelmingly agreed

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:52.540 align:middle line:84%
that the human body was
not capable of running

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:54.200 align:middle line:90%
a four-minute mile.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:57.310 align:middle line:84%
Our bone structure is not
built for it, they said.

00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:00.430 align:middle line:84%
Our lungs cannot handle
it, they claimed.

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:03.490 align:middle line:84%
However, on May 6 of that
year, Roger Bannister

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:07.180 align:middle line:84%
ran a mile in 0.6 seconds
under four minutes.

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:10.450 align:middle line:84%
John Landry's best
attempt, prior to 1954,

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:12.804 align:middle line:84%
was a four-minute
and two-second mile.

00:14:12.804 --> 00:14:14.470 align:middle line:84%
He made a statement
that the four minute

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:18.100 align:middle line:84%
mile was a brick wall that
can not be penetrated.

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:20.350 align:middle line:84%
He claimed he would never
attempt to beat it again.

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:24.130 align:middle line:84%
56 days after Bannister
broke through that wall,

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:27.160 align:middle line:84%
Landry was inspired
to try again.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.650 align:middle line:84%
His very next attempt
broke Bannister's record

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:31.656 align:middle line:90%
by 1 and 1/2 seconds.

00:14:31.656 --> 00:14:36.830 align:middle line:84%
The following year, 37 runners
broke the four-minute mile.

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:41.840 align:middle line:84%
The year after that, 300
runners broke through that wall.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:45.110 align:middle line:84%
The wall was not made of
brick, as Landry said.

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:47.375 align:middle line:90%
It was made of belief.

00:14:47.375 --> 00:14:49.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What an
amazing segment.

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:51.860 align:middle line:84%
Why was the
chronology like that?

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:54.890 align:middle line:84%
We go years without
a four-minute mile.

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:56.660 align:middle line:90%
Then one person does it.

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.520 align:middle line:90%
Then another person does it.

00:14:58.520 --> 00:14:59.780 align:middle line:90%
Then 30 people do it.

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:01.730 align:middle line:90%
Then 300 people do it.

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:04.400 align:middle line:84%
What made that chronology
happen the way it did?

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.190 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: It's
belief, honestly.

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:10.130 align:middle line:84%
Belief and hard work, but
it all starts with belief.

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:12.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I love the
title of this show, "Beyond

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:15.860 align:middle line:84%
Belief," because going
beyond the belief

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.480 align:middle line:84%
limits that we set
for ourselves--

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.830 align:middle line:90%
you see what happens.

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:22.250 align:middle line:84%
Doctors, scientists, everybody
was saying, it's impossible.

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:23.150 align:middle line:90%
The body--

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:23.691 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can't do it.

00:15:23.691 --> 00:15:25.566 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: --its technology
just can't do it.

00:15:25.566 --> 00:15:28.810 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as one person did
it, people started training.

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:31.790 align:middle line:90%
And within two years, over 300--

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:33.440 align:middle line:90%
maybe close to 400 people--

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.160 align:middle line:90%
had done it at that point.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And so that really just
shows us that the peak

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:41.900 align:middle line:84%
of human potential
does not end here.

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.400 align:middle line:90%
And it, possibly, doesn't end.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.745 align:middle line:84%
It just is governed by the
amount of belief we have.

00:15:46.745 --> 00:15:48.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how strong
can that belief be?

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:53.580 align:middle line:84%
Can it be as big and as
broad as you can make it?

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:54.580 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: I believe so.

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:57.470 align:middle line:84%
But I also believe that we're
not meant for one person

00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:00.020 align:middle line:90%
to just skyrocket into that.

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:02.530 align:middle line:84%
Because we'd be mowed down
like the tallest poppy,

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:05.150 align:middle line:84%
due to the powers
that be on the planet.

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:08.450 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that we
also help each other,

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:10.800 align:middle line:84%
we lift each other
up in these ways.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.760 align:middle line:84%
So, again, I mean,
it could possibly--

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.110 align:middle line:90%
I believe it can go on forever.

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:19.287 align:middle line:84%
But I don't really have any
evidence to back that up.

00:16:19.287 --> 00:16:20.870 align:middle line:84%
So I'll just stay
with what I do know.

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:22.970 align:middle line:90%
I know that we consistently--

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:25.100 align:middle line:84%
throughout the
lifeline of humanity--

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:29.180 align:middle line:84%
we consistently break
these imaginary boundaries

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:29.980 align:middle line:90%
that we have.

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's because,
as soon as we break

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.510 align:middle line:84%
beyond that belief,
our mind starts

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:39.545 align:middle line:84%
to tell the body how to adapt
to what our intention is.

00:16:39.545 --> 00:16:40.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We know,
as people, Ben,

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:45.210 align:middle line:84%
that when we're in the groove
we can't get out of it,

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:48.830 align:middle line:84%
that everything seems
to be working for us.

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:50.840 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel that way,
too, sometimes-- you just

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.470 align:middle line:90%
know you're in the groove?

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:53.270 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:55.640 align:middle line:84%
Actually, there is
great terminology

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.310 align:middle line:84%
that's being thrown on that--
that's called the flow state.

00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:00.710 align:middle line:90%
And I'm really into flow arts--

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:02.880 align:middle line:84%
a lot of spinning
and things like that.

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:06.980 align:middle line:84%
But the flow state, for the most
part, really has to do with--

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:10.550 align:middle line:84%
whether it's extreme sports or
whether it's public speaking

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:12.319 align:middle line:84%
or-- doesn't matter
what you're doing.

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:13.289 align:middle line:90%
It really means--

00:17:13.289 --> 00:17:14.089 align:middle line:90%
I move in nature.

00:17:14.089 --> 00:17:14.983 align:middle line:90%
I climb trees and I--

00:17:14.983 --> 00:17:15.783 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It clicks.

00:17:15.783 --> 00:17:16.980 align:middle line:90%
You know it's clicking.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:17.780 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:23.569 align:middle line:84%
So, basically, when the brain
down-regulates and you're not

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:25.910 align:middle line:84%
over-thinking, you still
have an intelligence

00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:29.299 align:middle line:84%
of the body that can solve
problems really immediately.

00:17:29.299 --> 00:17:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you start
learning-- people doing

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:32.952 align:middle line:90%
Parkour and these fancy tricks.

00:17:32.952 --> 00:17:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And they're jumping over
things, and they don't

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:36.159 align:middle line:90%
know what's on the other side.

00:17:36.159 --> 00:17:39.050 align:middle line:84%
So they immediately have to
adapt to the environment.

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:40.730 align:middle line:84%
That, to me, is the
ultimate readiness

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:43.451 align:middle line:84%
that we should be in in
this state of affairs

00:17:43.451 --> 00:17:44.825 align:middle line:84%
that we have on
the planet today.

00:17:44.825 --> 00:17:47.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What importance
would you put in diet

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.385 align:middle line:90%
in the scheme of things?

00:17:49.385 --> 00:17:50.635 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: One of the biggest.

00:17:50.635 --> 00:17:52.820 align:middle line:84%
I would say it's one
of the three biggest

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:54.170 align:middle line:90%
important factors.

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Because the external environment
dictates gene expression.

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.755 align:middle line:84%
So the way our genes
express themselves--

00:18:01.755 --> 00:18:03.380 align:middle line:84%
if an asteroid hit
the planet tomorrow,

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:05.982 align:middle line:84%
turned it into a desert, our
genes would start expressing

00:18:05.982 --> 00:18:06.940 align:middle line:90%
themselves differently.

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:10.320 align:middle line:84%
But it's the same with
what we put in our body.

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.920 align:middle line:84%
And that produces different
hormones in our body.

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:14.561 align:middle line:90%
It changes our biochemistry.

00:18:14.561 --> 00:18:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And that changes the
internal environment,

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:20.880 align:middle line:84%
which also affects how our
genetics express themselves.

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:25.160 align:middle line:84%
So making very clever
choices and, really, being

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.860 align:middle line:84%
sensitive to what the food's
doing inside of our body

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:29.240 align:middle line:90%
after we've eaten it--

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.700 align:middle line:84%
this will help us
understand, is this actually

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.650 align:middle line:90%
serving my highest goal?

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And, a lot of times,
we're so disconnected--

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:40.260 align:middle line:84%
food is that thing that
interrupts the rest of the day.

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:44.240 align:middle line:84%
And if we had the sensitivity
to see the flow of it,

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.520 align:middle line:84%
and how it connects
to all of life,

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.950 align:middle line:84%
we would understand that
the food is putting us

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:49.850 align:middle line:90%
into mental states.

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:52.160 align:middle line:84%
It's putting us into
hormonal states.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is really dictating how
we are to the people around us,

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.217 align:middle line:84%
and how much capacity
we have to break

00:18:57.217 --> 00:18:58.425 align:middle line:90%
through boundaries like that.

00:18:58.425 --> 00:19:01.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I've found, too,
that moderation is incredible

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:04.100 align:middle line:84%
and so important to
just about everything

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:08.240 align:middle line:84%
we do-- whether it's
food, drink, emotion.

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:11.270 align:middle line:84%
If you do it in some
form of moderation,

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:12.982 align:middle line:84%
it's going to pay
off better for you.

00:19:12.982 --> 00:19:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Yeah, I think that's
the intelligence of nature.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.830 align:middle line:84%
Because the intelligence of
nature is a balancing force.

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:21.200 align:middle line:84%
So if you break your
arm or cut your hand,

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:23.390 align:middle line:84%
some intelligence brings
you back into form.

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, when
you've overworked yourself

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:27.650 align:middle line:84%
and you're tired,
something brings you down

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:29.300 align:middle line:90%
into a state of sleep.

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:31.160 align:middle line:90%
If you don't have kids, that is.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.032 align:middle line:84%
But it's this form
of intelligence--

00:19:33.032 --> 00:19:33.795 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We've all had kids.

00:19:33.795 --> 00:19:34.600 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.210 align:middle line:84%
It's this form of
intelligence that

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:37.740 align:middle line:90%
nourishes the balance of life.

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:41.130 align:middle line:84%
So that word-- balance
and moderation--

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:42.750 align:middle line:90%
we need to come to it.

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:45.120 align:middle line:84%
We need to meet it
halfway, and not

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.860 align:middle line:84%
expect that these things
will just be obvious to us.

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:49.890 align:middle line:84%
So this is us
engaging with life.

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:53.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ben, we're on a planet
and we're constantly bombarded

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:56.350 align:middle line:84%
by toxic elements, no
matter what we do--

00:19:56.350 --> 00:20:00.530 align:middle line:84%
whether it's in the air, the
food, the water, it's there--

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:01.680 align:middle line:90%
fluoride--

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:04.580 align:middle line:84%
I think they should
take that out of water.

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:05.730 align:middle line:90%
How do we combat that?

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:07.742 align:middle line:90%
How do we fight that?

00:20:07.742 --> 00:20:09.200 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well,
the first thing is

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.460 align:middle line:90%
the education of where it is.

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:13.610 align:middle line:84%
Because most of the
time we don't realize,

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:15.479 align:middle line:84%
it's in the technology--
the smartphones

00:20:15.479 --> 00:20:16.770 align:middle line:90%
that we're constantly touching.

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:18.060 align:middle line:90%
It's in plastic bags.

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:19.470 align:middle line:90%
It's in cash.

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:21.840 align:middle line:90%
It's in cash-register receipts.

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.000 align:middle line:84%
It's, basically,
everywhere around us.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And these things also act
as endocrine disruptors,

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:31.630 align:middle line:84%
which, basically, it causes more
hormonal imbalance in the body.

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:33.570 align:middle line:90%
So how do we combat it?

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:35.250 align:middle line:90%
First, we educate ourselves.

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And, secondly, we really need to
move more and breathe properly.

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.980 align:middle line:84%
Because, with proper
posture, proper movement,

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:43.440 align:middle line:84%
and proper breathing, this
is our elimination process,

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:45.900 align:middle line:84%
so we can get rid
of all these toxins.

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:49.365 align:middle line:84%
And that's when our body is
actually acting optimally.

00:20:49.365 --> 00:20:52.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I never really
understood, years ago,

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:55.980 align:middle line:84%
what proper meditation
meant to the human body.

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:57.810 align:middle line:90%
I just didn't get it.

00:20:57.810 --> 00:21:00.660 align:middle line:84%
You know, growing up in the
era of the '50s and the '60s,

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:04.200 align:middle line:84%
for me, you would see the
hippie movement of the '60s.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.230 align:middle line:84%
And they would sit
and chant and ohm--

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:08.400 align:middle line:90%
I didn't get it.

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.800 align:middle line:84%
Now I realize that
it's harmonious.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.930 align:middle line:90%
It's putting resonance together.

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:15.210 align:middle line:90%
It's tuning up your body.

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:18.490 align:middle line:84%
It's tapping into something
out there that works.

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:20.625 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
important now, isn't it?

00:21:20.625 --> 00:21:21.425 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:21:21.425 --> 00:21:23.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, the body and the
mind are constantly

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:24.924 align:middle line:90%
trying to harmonize themselves.

00:21:24.924 --> 00:21:26.340 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing
about meditation

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.130 align:middle line:84%
is that's one of
your direct links

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:31.110 align:middle line:84%
into your central
nervous system.

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And when our central
nervous system is haywire--

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:36.350 align:middle line:84%
not just from our diet, but
from scattered thoughts--

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:38.130 align:middle line:84%
if we're constantly
fragmented and there's

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:40.200 align:middle line:84%
no connectivity between
all the different things

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:43.200 align:middle line:84%
we think we need to do
throughout the day, that

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.850 align:middle line:84%
wreaks havoc on our
central nervous system.

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:47.880 align:middle line:84%
So meditation is
really, actually-- it's

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.580 align:middle line:84%
like detoxing the
brain, in the same way

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:52.080 align:middle line:90%
that we detox the body.

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.860 align:middle line:90%
And that's really important.

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And it goes hand-in-hand
with proper diet

00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:56.820 align:middle line:90%
and proper movement.

00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:59.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We are in
an electric universe.

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:04.020 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies are loaded
with magnetic abilities.

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:06.360 align:middle line:84%
Let's take another
look at "Kymatica,"

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:09.042 align:middle line:84%
and how important that
is to the human body.

00:22:09.042 --> 00:22:10.500 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: We are,
quite literally,

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:15.460 align:middle line:84%
an electromagnetic expression of
our highest cognitive function.

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.400 align:middle line:84%
The behavior of
electromagnetism is

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:20.850 align:middle line:84%
evident throughout
the world as dualism.

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:24.190 align:middle line:84%
All matter contains a
negative and positive charge,

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:28.730 align:middle line:84%
which means organisms are
built upon this foundation.

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:31.670 align:middle line:84%
The natural homeostasis
of any organism

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:35.150 align:middle line:90%
is a balance of both polarities.

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:37.780 align:middle line:10%
Furthermore, research
on emotional energetics

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:39.710 align:middle line:10%
shows that the heart's
field is a carrier

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:42.380 align:middle line:10%
of emotional information
and a mediator

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:44.780 align:middle line:10%
of bioelectromagnetic
communication,

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:47.330 align:middle line:10%
within and outside the body.

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:49.580 align:middle line:10%
Research shows our
heart's field changes

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:52.800 align:middle line:10%
distinctly as we experience
different emotions.

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:55.140 align:middle line:10%
It is registered in
people's brains around us

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:58.410 align:middle line:10%
and apparently is capable
of affecting cells, water,

00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:02.090 align:middle line:10%
and DNA studied in vitro.

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:04.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So, Ben, how do we
stay in this state of balance,

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:07.654 align:middle line:84%
with this kind of balance
of electromagnetics.

00:23:07.654 --> 00:23:10.070 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well, we really
just need the proper education.

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And we'll know that it's the
proper education because it

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:16.370 align:middle line:84%
allows inspiration to
come forth to apply

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:18.170 align:middle line:90%
that education into our lives.

00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:20.932 align:middle line:90%
And we're going to need that.

00:23:20.932 --> 00:23:23.390 align:middle line:84%
It's going to take a lot of
hard work to correct our diets,

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:26.420 align:middle line:84%
our movement patterns, and
to be able to focus the mind.

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:29.390 align:middle line:84%
So, really, that's how we come
into this state of balance

00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:30.980 align:middle line:90%
is we just try.

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:33.080 align:middle line:90%
We start walking that path.

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.554 align:middle line:84%
And we don't let the rocks
in the road, and the bumps,

00:23:36.554 --> 00:23:38.720 align:middle line:84%
and all the creatures that
come out to greet us-- we

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.760 align:middle line:84%
don't let that scare
us off the path.

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.052 align:middle line:84%
We keep doing what we know
in our hearts we need to do.

00:23:43.052 --> 00:23:44.759 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why don't
schools teach us this?

00:23:44.759 --> 00:23:45.800 align:middle line:90%
They didn't teach you.

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.210 align:middle line:90%
They didn't teach me.

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:50.430 align:middle line:84%
We learned the hard
way-- trial and error.

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:52.220 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Yeah, I
have my own beliefs

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:55.310 align:middle line:84%
about why we don't teach, you
know, the general education

00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:57.320 align:middle line:84%
board-- why it's
not taught this way.

00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.820 align:middle line:90%
But I also think it's--

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:00.960 align:middle line:84%
without getting into the
conspiracy side of it--

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:01.890 align:middle line:90%
I also think that--

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:03.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, go ahead.

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:05.820 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: I definitely think
the general education board--

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:09.250 align:middle line:84%
there's this top-down approach
of governing everything

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:12.080 align:middle line:90%
that the masses do.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:16.190 align:middle line:84%
I think the main reason is
because it's only recently that

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:20.090 align:middle line:84%
we're understanding
what sitting all day--

00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:21.770 align:middle line:84%
like what the kids
are doing in school--

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:24.200 align:middle line:84%
is actually doing, not just
to our bodies and causing

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.270 align:middle line:90%
deficiency--

00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:27.500 align:middle line:90%
ADHD and all these other things.

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:29.810 align:middle line:84%
But, also, it's
limiting our ability

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:32.570 align:middle line:90%
to optimize our intelligence.

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:35.505 align:middle line:84%
So not using the body is
limiting our intelligence

00:24:35.505 --> 00:24:36.305 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:24:36.305 --> 00:24:40.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it possible that the
curriculum just doesn't get it,

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:43.370 align:middle line:84%
that the teachers that have
passed this down to us,

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:44.830 align:middle line:90%
they don't understand it?

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:46.080 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: It's very possible.

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think modern society is
a testament that we're all just

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:51.260 align:middle line:84%
operating under the
level of education

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:53.970 align:middle line:84%
and understanding
that we've been given.

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:57.020 align:middle line:84%
So it takes those rare few--
and these are the rare few

00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:59.150 align:middle line:84%
that I'm talking about
when I say super-humans--

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:02.060 align:middle line:84%
to seek truth, and to
seek what that really is.

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:04.400 align:middle line:84%
Because we need to
read between the lines.

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:07.880 align:middle line:84%
If we're just given all that
education that we're force-fed,

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:10.010 align:middle line:84%
we can operate
functionally in society.

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:11.630 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't
mean we're healthy.

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:15.230 align:middle line:84%
So when I say super-human,
when I say a truth-seeker,

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:17.060 align:middle line:84%
that's looking
between the lines.

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:18.830 align:middle line:90%
Because we know something's off.

00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:20.360 align:middle line:90%
We know that there's more.

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And we are here to find
it, so we can bring it out,

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:25.322 align:middle line:84%
not just for ourselves, but
the next seven generations.

00:25:25.322 --> 00:25:26.821 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would
have loved a course

00:25:26.821 --> 00:25:28.904 align:middle line:84%
at school that would have
taught me all the stuff

00:25:28.904 --> 00:25:30.320 align:middle line:84%
that you're talking
about tonight.

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.319 align:middle line:90%
I would have loved that.

00:25:31.319 --> 00:25:33.360 align:middle line:84%
It would have made things
so much easier for me.

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:34.160 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of the
kids today would also

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.370 align:middle line:90%
really appreciate it.

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's why one of
my biggest intentions--

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:41.624 align:middle line:84%
what I want to do
in this world--

00:25:41.624 --> 00:25:43.760 align:middle line:84%
is bring a school
into this world.

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:47.120 align:middle line:84%
It will start small, so it won't
be widespread brick and mortar.

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.370 align:middle line:84%
But it can start
online and, at least,

00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:52.850 align:middle line:84%
educate the parents to know
how we as parents limit

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:54.530 align:middle line:84%
our children without
even realizing.

00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:57.690 align:middle line:84%
We put them into sports and
say that's enough movement

00:25:57.690 --> 00:25:58.490 align:middle line:90%
for them.

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:00.115 align:middle line:84%
But there's still an
adult telling them

00:26:00.115 --> 00:26:02.540 align:middle line:84%
what to do, how to
do it, when to do it.

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And what I believe we
should really be doing

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:08.690 align:middle line:84%
is the intelligence of
nature is in the children.

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And it hasn't been conditioned
out, like the adults have it.

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:15.590 align:middle line:84%
So we should be more observant
of what the children naturally

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:16.430 align:middle line:90%
want to do.

00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's never sitting in a
chair, staring at a chalkboard

00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:20.900 align:middle line:90%
and listening to somebody talk.

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:22.400 align:middle line:84%
They want to get
up and move around.

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:24.110 align:middle line:90%
And I say, they need that.

00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:25.490 align:middle line:90%
It's not just a preference.

00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:27.585 align:middle line:84%
Movement actually makes
you more intelligent.

00:26:27.585 --> 00:26:31.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A study just came
out that said that meditation

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:35.780 align:middle line:84%
is better medicine than
all the psychotropic drugs

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:37.340 align:middle line:90%
that they give people.

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:38.910 align:middle line:90%
That's an amazing story.

00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:43.160 align:middle line:84%
It tells us exactly
that what you're saying

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.410 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely the truth.

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:47.840 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: I think it also
tells us what a human being is.

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:50.420 align:middle line:84%
Because, I think, we're
put here on this planet

00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:51.860 align:middle line:90%
as students of life.

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:52.790 align:middle line:90%
We're here to learn.

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:54.230 align:middle line:90%
Our body wants to learn.

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:55.760 align:middle line:90%
Our mind wants to learn.

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:58.130 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we're never
meant to do the same thing

00:26:58.130 --> 00:26:59.810 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over again.

00:26:59.810 --> 00:27:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing
about the narcotics

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:03.260 align:middle line:84%
that we're taking
to correct all the

00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:06.320 align:middle line:84%
hormonal issues or
the wandering mind--

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:09.320 align:middle line:84%
it's taking-- it's robbing
the children of the ability

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:12.050 align:middle line:84%
to be able to step into
that power on their own.

00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And meditation is
the exact opposite.

00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Meditation is
allowing that child

00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:20.810 align:middle line:84%
to calm themselves down and
find a self-soothing routine.

00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:24.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In terms of
exercise, what do you do?

00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And is it different from
what people generally do?

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.040 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:31.550 align:middle line:84%
Because exercise is typified
by repetitious movement,

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:34.010 align:middle line:84%
like going on a treadmill,
doing the same thing.

00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:36.550 align:middle line:90%
Or overworking vanity muscles--

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:37.490 align:middle line:90%
monkey see, monkey do.

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:39.650 align:middle line:84%
We see other people,
you know, bench pressing

00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:40.790 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:42.380 align:middle line:84%
But that's overworking
some muscles

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:45.230 align:middle line:84%
and forgetting about the
core stabilizer muscles.

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
definition of imbalance.

00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:49.460 align:middle line:90%
So what I mean is not--

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:53.630 align:middle line:84%
it's not a method to look better
or to lose weight or detox.

00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:57.290 align:middle line:84%
Really, what it's meant to do is
to get you to move differently,

00:27:57.290 --> 00:27:59.870 align:middle line:84%
explore different loads
that you put on the body.

00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:02.480 align:middle line:84%
Because this is how your
body opens itself up

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:06.200 align:middle line:84%
to intelligence from the
environment, to embody itself.

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:07.540 align:middle line:90%
And then we can access it.

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
intelligence-- that's

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:11.330 align:middle line:84%
how we embody it and
it turns into wisdom,

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:14.450 align:middle line:84%
is when we've embodied the
knowledge that we have.

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:18.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And is it an
unusual series of exercises?

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:19.654 align:middle line:90%
Is it hard to learn?

00:28:19.654 --> 00:28:20.570 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Not really.

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:24.140 align:middle line:84%
It's actually much more
primal than you would imagine.

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:26.000 align:middle line:90%
You know, I mean, for one--

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.350 align:middle line:90%
go out and climb a tree.

00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:29.810 align:middle line:84%
There's so much
dynamics and rich,

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:33.440 align:middle line:84%
you know, dynamics in a tree,
that you won't find in a gym.

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.600 align:middle line:10%
And you know that
a pull-up bar is

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.730 align:middle line:10%
going to hold you, because
some person made sure

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:38.896 align:middle line:10%
that it's going to hold you.

00:28:38.896 --> 00:28:40.190 align:middle line:90%
But a branch-- you don't know.

00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:42.470 align:middle line:84%
So there's all this
problem-solving.

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:44.360 align:middle line:84%
Climbing a tree,
going rock climbing,

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.400 align:middle line:84%
swimming through
natural water outside,

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:48.320 align:middle line:84%
which is typically a lot
colder than the water

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:49.850 align:middle line:90%
that we like to be in.

00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:52.940 align:middle line:84%
Moving through nature
is, more or less,

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:53.900 align:middle line:90%
what I'm talking about.

00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:57.510 align:middle line:84%
Because working out in a gym
is not a learning environment

00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:58.310 align:middle line:90%
for the brain.

00:28:58.310 --> 00:29:00.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the location
of where you do this--

00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:01.610 align:middle line:90%
is it important?

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:03.080 align:middle line:84%
Because I know,
for example, when

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:05.330 align:middle line:84%
you do some of these
exercises, you're

00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:06.916 align:middle line:90%
out in the woods somewhere.

00:29:06.916 --> 00:29:10.110 align:middle line:90%


00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:11.296 align:middle line:90%
So what are you doing here?

00:29:11.296 --> 00:29:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well, this
is actually Ben Medder.

00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:15.810 align:middle line:84%
He's a natural movement
coach in the UK.

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:18.600 align:middle line:84%
Soon we'll see me getting
into different exercises.

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:21.975 align:middle line:84%
But here, this is just exploring
how the body has to move around

00:29:21.975 --> 00:29:23.100 align:middle line:90%
differently through nature.

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:24.660 align:middle line:90%
This is me and my daughter.

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:26.220 align:middle line:90%
And, you know, these--

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:27.575 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's the exercise?

00:29:27.575 --> 00:29:28.980 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: These are
some of the exercises.

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And, basically-- and
this is the ice bath.

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:33.000 align:middle line:84%
It's not the most
fun thing to do.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.030 align:middle line:84%
But it really engages
the body in the same way

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:37.290 align:middle line:90%
that our ancestors had to.

00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:39.570 align:middle line:84%
Because they had
to-- in the winter--

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:42.000 align:middle line:84%
wade through water to
go catch their fish.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And they had to
climb through trees

00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:46.495 align:middle line:84%
to survey the landscape, to see
where predator or prey might

00:29:46.495 --> 00:29:47.295 align:middle line:90%
be.

00:29:47.295 --> 00:29:49.335 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How often are
you doing that, every day?

00:29:49.335 --> 00:29:50.010 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Every day.

00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:50.810 align:middle line:90%
Every day.

00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:52.942 align:middle line:84%
And I don't suggest
that everyone

00:29:52.942 --> 00:29:54.150 align:middle line:90%
should be doing it every day.

00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:57.390 align:middle line:84%
I say, we should start
introducing it into our lives

00:29:57.390 --> 00:30:01.106 align:middle line:84%
and discovering the inspiration
that it'll give you.

00:30:01.106 --> 00:30:03.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm not telling people, you
need to do five hours of this

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:04.385 align:middle line:90%
a week.

00:30:04.385 --> 00:30:06.510 align:middle line:84%
It should tell you how much
you should be doing it.

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:08.700 align:middle line:84%
But we should definitely
be moving our bodies a lot

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:09.825 align:middle line:90%
more than we are now.

00:30:09.825 --> 00:30:11.825 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So that's what
you're basically doing--

00:30:11.825 --> 00:30:14.602 align:middle line:84%
you're moving your body
with those exercises--

00:30:14.602 --> 00:30:16.560 align:middle line:84%
because rolling-- throwing
the ball in the air,

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:18.965 align:middle line:84%
moving around like that,
and stuff like that.

00:30:18.965 --> 00:30:21.000 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah, because--

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.820 align:middle line:84%
I won't get into the ultra
minutiae of the science of it.

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:27.127 align:middle line:84%
But everything that
you saw up there is--

00:30:27.127 --> 00:30:29.460 align:middle line:84%
they're different loads that
you're placing on the body.

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:31.590 align:middle line:84%
They're different
manipulations of the body.

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And what that does is that sends
new information to the cells.

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And if the cells aren't
getting new information,

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:39.249 align:middle line:84%
then they're not in
their optimal form.

00:30:39.249 --> 00:30:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I'm
talking about-- getting

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.970 align:middle line:84%
into our optimal
form-- so opening up

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:44.330 align:middle line:90%
to the information of nature.

00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:46.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I know some
people who will go to work;

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:51.870 align:middle line:84%
come home and have dinner; get
on the couch; grab the clicker;

00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:53.760 align:middle line:90%
start watching television.

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Then they go to bed, if
they haven't passed out

00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:57.510 align:middle line:90%
on the couch.

00:30:57.510 --> 00:30:59.445 align:middle line:84%
What kind of a
lifestyle is that?

00:30:59.445 --> 00:31:02.370 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well, that
shows you that movement,

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:04.290 align:middle line:84%
to people like
that, is just a way

00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:06.120 align:middle line:84%
to get from one
sitting position--

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:08.760 align:middle line:84%
or one relaxed
position-- to another.

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:11.310 align:middle line:84%
And this is completely
the opposite from what

00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:12.170 align:middle line:90%
our ancestors--

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:13.650 align:middle line:90%
they hardly ever sat down.

00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And when they did,
they were squatting.

00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:20.130 align:middle line:84%
So, nowadays, really, we
have so much furniture

00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:22.400 align:middle line:84%
that tells us, that
beckons us, come lay down.

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:24.840 align:middle line:84%
Get as comfy as
you possibly can.

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:26.910 align:middle line:84%
But we don't really
set our houses up

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:29.362 align:middle line:90%
to move in many different ways.

00:31:29.362 --> 00:31:31.320 align:middle line:84%
We have the steps to help
us get up the stairs.

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:32.825 align:middle line:90%
But that's about it.

00:31:32.825 --> 00:31:34.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk about
it in terms of age, Ben.

00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:36.090 align:middle line:90%
If you're in your 20s--

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:38.670 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to elevate
up to 60 or 70 here--

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:41.000 align:middle line:84%
but when you're in your
20s, what should you

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.427 align:middle line:90%
be doing lifestyle-wise?

00:31:42.427 --> 00:31:44.760 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well, because you
can bounce back so quickly,

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:47.880 align:middle line:84%
I would say, really experiment
with the three major things

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:49.980 align:middle line:84%
that I tell people to do--
is focus on your diet,

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:52.080 align:middle line:84%
focus on your movement
and your posture,

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:56.400 align:middle line:84%
and also focus on the
celebration and the fun aspect

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:57.480 align:middle line:90%
that you bring into it.

00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:59.880 align:middle line:84%
So, for people in
their 20s, I would say,

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:01.680 align:middle line:90%
move through nature a lot more.

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:04.830 align:middle line:84%
Try some ice baths, some things
that really challenge you.

00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And the point that this
is not, again, to get

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:09.590 align:middle line:90%
all buff and good looking.

00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:12.960 align:middle line:84%
It's to teach your body how to
deal with stressful situations.

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:15.140 align:middle line:84%
Because there's an
intrinsic reward--

00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:17.020 align:middle line:84%
dopamine and different
things like that.

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:19.560 align:middle line:84%
But there's also the
intelligent reward in that.

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And, also, if you fast or if you
try dieting every now and then,

00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:25.320 align:middle line:84%
your body is going
to deal with hunger.

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:27.360 align:middle line:84%
And we typically freak
out when we're hungry,

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:30.110 align:middle line:84%
but ancestors-- they used
to go days without eating.

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And it wouldn't freak them
out, because they understood

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:36.330 align:middle line:84%
that this is just a signal from
the body telling us something.

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:37.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 30s to 40s.

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:38.850 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: From
that point, you want

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:41.520 align:middle line:84%
to start taking a look at
how you're bouncing back

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:42.390 align:middle line:90%
from injuries.

00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And you want to be more
intelligent about biomechanics.

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:46.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just
about moving more,

00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:48.267 align:middle line:90%
it's moving more intelligently.

00:32:48.267 --> 00:32:50.100 align:middle line:84%
You want to learn how
to bend over properly.

00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:52.800 align:middle line:84%
You want to learn how
to kneel down and squat.

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:55.770 align:middle line:84%
Posture-- learning posture is
probably the number one thing

00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:58.680 align:middle line:84%
we should be doing
throughout our life,

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:01.980 align:middle line:84%
is learning how to
stand and sit correctly,

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:05.290 align:middle line:84%
so all of our tissues
are un-inhibiting--

00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:07.215 align:middle line:90%
or not inhibiting blood flow.

00:33:07.215 --> 00:33:09.045 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 40s to 60.

00:33:09.045 --> 00:33:10.350 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: 40s to 60s--

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:11.306 align:middle line:90%
it's the same thing.

00:33:11.306 --> 00:33:13.680 align:middle line:84%
We're just now getting up into
the point where you really

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:16.562 align:middle line:84%
need to start making sure
you're not overdoing it.

00:33:16.562 --> 00:33:17.520 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people think--

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:18.795 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So maybe
not as intense.

00:33:18.795 --> 00:33:19.878 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Not as intense.

00:33:19.878 --> 00:33:21.972 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of the
times people ran marathons

00:33:21.972 --> 00:33:23.430 align:middle line:84%
five years ago and
they still think

00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:25.763 align:middle line:84%
they're in that kind of shape,
but they haven't done it.

00:33:25.763 --> 00:33:28.710 align:middle line:84%
So, really, just pay more
attention to your body.

00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And this is-- honestly, when
you're getting up there in age,

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:34.410 align:middle line:84%
it's a great opportunity to
start listening to your body

00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:35.370 align:middle line:90%
more.

00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:37.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you're out
in public and someone

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:40.320 align:middle line:84%
might come up to you and say,
god, you look good today.

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:42.690 align:middle line:90%
You look refreshed.

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And they see something,
obviously, right?

00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:46.950 align:middle line:90%
Or they wouldn't have said that.

00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:48.960 align:middle line:90%
Does that mean it's working--

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.535 align:middle line:84%
whatever you're
doing, it's working?

00:33:50.535 --> 00:33:51.660 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: I believe it is.

00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And even that,
specifically, that's

00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:58.050 align:middle line:84%
also a testament that
we are optimistic,

00:33:58.050 --> 00:33:59.640 align:middle line:90%
and optimism, and celebration.

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:02.790 align:middle line:84%
I, very much so, get into the
shamanic aspect of this, which

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:04.860 align:middle line:90%
is adding ceremony into it.

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:06.270 align:middle line:90%
So it's not just moving out--

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:08.400 align:middle line:84%
moving for the sake
of moving and dieting

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:11.570 align:middle line:84%
for the sake of dieting, but
it's putting them all together

00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:14.570 align:middle line:84%
and holding it and focusing
it on an intention.

00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:17.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's why people will
say, you look good today,

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:19.250 align:middle line:90%
because you're open to nature.

00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:21.679 align:middle line:84%
You're not inhibiting the
intelligence of nature

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:24.050 align:middle line:84%
to come in, and you're
attuning with nature.

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:26.401 align:middle line:84%
And that will give you all
the energy that you need.

00:34:26.401 --> 00:34:30.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: While human beings are
adaptable; they're intelligent;

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.920 align:middle line:84%
they're geniuses when it
comes to certain things.

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:38.600 align:middle line:84%
In your film, "Ungrip," you
take a look at human ingenuity.

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:39.779 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:34:39.779 --> 00:34:42.679 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Human ingenuity
can surmount any obstacle.

00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:46.340 align:middle line:84%
The only requirement is
the desire to surmount.

00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:49.219 align:middle line:84%
If we are willing to complain
or rebel against the system that

00:34:49.219 --> 00:34:53.929 align:middle line:84%
governs our actions, we should
know how and why it does so.

00:34:53.929 --> 00:34:57.530 align:middle line:84%
In doing this, it is important
to understand who we are,

00:34:57.530 --> 00:35:00.305 align:middle line:84%
where we are, and
what options we have.

00:35:00.305 --> 00:35:02.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I remember some
of those clips, Ben.

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:05.070 align:middle line:84%
I remember those days,
in the news business,

00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:08.450 align:middle line:84%
or as a younger person,
seeing Mao Tse-tung and Lyndon

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:09.440 align:middle line:90%
Johnson.

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:12.335 align:middle line:84%
Those were difficult
times for a lot of people.

00:35:12.335 --> 00:35:13.460 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah, they were.

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And, honestly, those
difficult times

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:18.770 align:middle line:90%
lead us to where we are today.

00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:20.810 align:middle line:84%
But it also-- this
is where we draw

00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:24.320 align:middle line:90%
on a lot of our inspiration.

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:27.050 align:middle line:84%
You know, if we
could survive times

00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:29.450 align:middle line:84%
like that, through the Great
Depression and through war,

00:35:29.450 --> 00:35:31.580 align:middle line:84%
we can survive what
we're dealing with today.

00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:33.800 align:middle line:84%
But, like I said in
that clip, we really

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:36.830 align:middle line:84%
need to have the desire to
overcome these obstacles.

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:38.550 align:middle line:84%
And I believe the
biggest obstacle

00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:41.040 align:middle line:84%
is, we don't see the
obstacle in front of us.

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:43.296 align:middle line:84%
We just call it modern
society and living.

00:35:43.296 --> 00:35:45.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With your little
girl, what will you

00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:50.225 align:middle line:84%
do to her to train her so she's
ready when she's an adult?

00:35:50.225 --> 00:35:52.890 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Really, exactly
what I said before.

00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:54.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to step
out of the way

00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:57.350 align:middle line:84%
and see where her intelligence
naturally takes her.

00:35:57.350 --> 00:36:00.970 align:middle line:84%
But in her path I'm going to
start putting instruments.

00:36:00.970 --> 00:36:02.600 align:middle line:90%
I want her to learn music.

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:05.870 align:middle line:84%
I want her to use her
voice and sing a lot more.

00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:07.526 align:middle line:84%
Any type of movement
she wants to do.

00:36:07.526 --> 00:36:08.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get
her swimming out

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:10.940 align:middle line:84%
in nature and in
colder bodies of water,

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:12.350 align:middle line:90%
climbing through trees.

00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:14.210 align:middle line:84%
And I will be there
to protect her,

00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:16.280 align:middle line:84%
but I will not be
there to limit any

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:17.930 align:middle line:84%
of where her natural
intelligence is

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:18.763 align:middle line:90%
trying to bring her.

00:36:18.763 --> 00:36:20.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when
she's 18 and wants

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:25.580 align:middle line:84%
to be a teacher or
a rock star, are you

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:27.260 align:middle line:90%
going to get in the way of that?

00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:29.630 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Absolutely not,
because it doesn't matter

00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:32.150 align:middle line:84%
what profession
you're in or what

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:33.950 align:middle line:90%
you want to do with your life.

00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:36.180 align:middle line:84%
As long as she's
coming from the heart,

00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:38.780 align:middle line:84%
and as long as she wants to
help the people around her,

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:40.737 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be behind her 100%.

00:36:40.737 --> 00:36:42.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What motivates
you here, Ben?

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:43.624 align:middle line:90%
What pushes you?

00:36:43.624 --> 00:36:45.290 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Knowing
that the world is not

00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:49.280 align:middle line:84%
going to get any better by 7
billion people just sitting

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:51.890 align:middle line:84%
around waiting for somebody
else to be the super here.

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:54.050 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not saying
I'm super-human,

00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:55.550 align:middle line:90%
but I'm definitely on that path.

00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'm also here to show
other people the way.

00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:01.940 align:middle line:84%
You know, I can only say
as much as I've learned.

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:04.070 align:middle line:84%
But as much as I've
learned I'm going to say.

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:06.200 align:middle line:90%
And I want to set up a school.

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:08.690 align:middle line:84%
I want to educate
people with the two best

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:12.050 align:middle line:84%
forms of nourishment we could be
giving the planet and people--

00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:14.030 align:middle line:90%
and that's love and truth.

00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:16.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've seen a lot of
the physical that you've done.

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:19.460 align:middle line:84%
But, as you well know,
and as you've practiced,

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:22.790 align:middle line:90%
the mind is just as important.

00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:24.590 align:middle line:90%
How do you segue-way the two?

00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:26.480 align:middle line:90%
How does that transition occur--

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:28.880 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness of the
mind, and the physical,

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:32.240 align:middle line:90%
built of training and exercise?

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:34.940 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Again, it's
perspective and belief

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:36.860 align:middle line:84%
that these two
things are separated.

00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:38.660 align:middle line:84%
It's the way that
we decode reality,

00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:40.820 align:middle line:84%
that we believe our
mind and our bodies

00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:42.690 align:middle line:90%
are in two different categories.

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:45.950 align:middle line:84%
So, to me, it's really
about not over-thinking

00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:49.220 align:middle line:84%
it-- definitely studying,
but using the body more.

00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:52.720 align:middle line:84%
Because that allows the mind
to calm down a little bit.

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have to hold
on to every passing thought

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:55.840 align:middle line:90%
that we have.

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's a part of
meditation as well.

00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:00.110 align:middle line:84%
So I say meditation and
movement of the body

00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:03.140 align:middle line:84%
are two great ways to harmonize
the body and the mind.

00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:06.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can this affect
emotion one way or another,

00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:09.890 align:middle line:84%
that if you do this, you're
generally a happier person,

00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:12.590 align:middle line:84%
and that means you'll
reflect that in your living

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:13.624 align:middle line:90%
with other people?

00:38:13.624 --> 00:38:14.540 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Absolutely.

00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:17.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for one,
exercise in and of itself

00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:20.480 align:middle line:84%
creates a better
hormonal balance.

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
hormonal side of it.

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:26.180 align:middle line:84%
But the deep inner
fulfillment that, I believe,

00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:29.810 align:middle line:90%
happiness really, really needs--

00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:31.460 align:middle line:84%
that deep, inner
fulfillment comes

00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:34.520 align:middle line:84%
from knowing that we're not just
doing something good for us,

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:36.530 align:middle line:84%
but we're doing something
good for the planet.

00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And we're also
looking down the line

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:40.340 align:middle line:84%
at the next few generations
that are coming.

00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:42.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now everybody
is an individual

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:45.120 align:middle line:84%
and they have their own
particular likes and dislikes.

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:47.990 align:middle line:84%
But, in your particular
case, when you meditate,

00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:49.520 align:middle line:90%
what do you do?

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:53.600 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Only recently have I
done it in the seated position.

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And, really, what I do the
most is I focus on posture.

00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:58.205 align:middle line:84%
And I focus on
everything that's--

00:38:58.205 --> 00:38:59.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you comfortable--

00:38:59.150 --> 00:38:59.650 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: --preparatory.

00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:00.765 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --when you do it?

00:39:00.765 --> 00:39:01.640 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Sometimes.

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:03.999 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes my
body will tell me

00:39:03.999 --> 00:39:05.540 align:middle line:84%
something different
from day to day--

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:07.790 align:middle line:84%
like there'll be a
twinge in my back.

00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I'm meditating
on for the next 20 minutes,

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:12.560 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that my
back isn't comfortable.

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:15.590 align:middle line:84%
But if I allow myself to
relax, and if I understand

00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:19.700 align:middle line:84%
that correct posture is what
I'm aiming at, then, eventually,

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:22.610 align:middle line:84%
when I arrive at correct
posture and then that's easy,

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:23.810 align:middle line:90%
the mind will settle down.

00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:25.910 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of the times,
our mind is so chaotic

00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:28.522 align:middle line:84%
because our body is
receiving so much stimulus

00:39:28.522 --> 00:39:29.480 align:middle line:90%
and we can't sit still.

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:30.620 align:middle line:90%
We're always fidgeting.

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:32.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
still doing music

00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:33.530 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yes, very much so.

00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:36.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you have been
doing these programs for Gaia

00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:41.330 align:middle line:84%
now for several years,
have you seen, personally,

00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:44.540 align:middle line:84%
an evolution with yourself
in terms of things

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:47.154 align:middle line:90%
you're learning and changing?

00:39:47.154 --> 00:39:48.070 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Absolutely.

00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And Gaia has actually been
a great wealth of knowledge

00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:51.770 align:middle line:90%
for me.

00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:54.217 align:middle line:84%
I go through, and every
free moment I have I

00:39:54.217 --> 00:39:55.550 align:middle line:90%
look through that whole catalog.

00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:57.830 align:middle line:84%
But, yes, through
the past decade

00:39:57.830 --> 00:39:59.450 align:middle line:84%
that I've been
making these films

00:39:59.450 --> 00:40:01.280 align:middle line:84%
and really getting
the word out, I

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:04.160 align:middle line:84%
would say the best
improvements that I've

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:06.050 align:middle line:84%
noticed have come
from people who

00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:09.050 align:middle line:84%
send me emails, either
challenging things that I say

00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:11.240 align:middle line:84%
or bringing up just
different ideas.

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:13.790 align:middle line:84%
So, really, I put
myself out there.

00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:16.640 align:middle line:84%
And people may look at me
as a teacher or a leader.

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:20.060 align:middle line:84%
But, really, I find myself to
be the student of all the people

00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:22.550 align:middle line:84%
that are sending me
emails, telling me how

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:23.870 align:middle line:90%
my work has changed their life.

00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:26.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how do people
e-mail you, by the way?

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:28.580 align:middle line:10%
>>STEWART:
Talismanicidols@gmail.com.

00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:30.990 align:middle line:10%
And the web site is
talismanicidols.net.

00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:33.650 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And "Kymatica" you
can watch on gaia.com, right?

00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:35.233 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: You can
watch that on Gaia.

00:40:35.233 --> 00:40:38.180 align:middle line:84%
You can watch everything
that I've done on Gaia now.

00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:39.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If there
was one message--

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:41.690 align:middle line:84%
one message-- that
you would like

00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:44.750 align:middle line:84%
to impart to everybody
watching you today on "Beyond

00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:46.550 align:middle line:90%
Belief," what would that be?

00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:47.840 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Authenticity.

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:51.350 align:middle line:84%
The more you step and stand
in your own authenticity,

00:40:51.350 --> 00:40:53.450 align:middle line:84%
and be you, no matter
what other people say,

00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:57.170 align:middle line:84%
no matter what kind of box other
people try and fit you into;

00:40:57.170 --> 00:41:01.400 align:middle line:84%
if you carry on in your path
as authentically as possible,

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:03.710 align:middle line:90%
you are a super-human.

00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:09.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we survive, as
a species, by doing this,

00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:13.490 align:middle line:84%
in spite of what's
happening on this planet?

00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:16.310 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Everything that
I've said about the toxins

00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:19.730 align:middle line:84%
in our diets, the problems
of the way we move,

00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:21.530 align:middle line:90%
and the scattered mind--

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:25.010 align:middle line:84%
if we're not flat out on
the floor because of that,

00:41:25.010 --> 00:41:26.450 align:middle line:84%
we're still up
and moving around,

00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:28.610 align:middle line:84%
building our society
at an astonishing rate.

00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:29.850 align:middle line:90%
So we have a lot of energy.

00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:33.290 align:middle line:84%
What we really need is
just the proper education,

00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:35.120 align:middle line:84%
to focus it on a
better path that's

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:38.160 align:middle line:84%
actually beneficial for the
planet, not just an elite few

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:38.960 align:middle line:90%
at the top.

00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:42.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you saw
someone who was unhealthy,

00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:45.140 align:middle line:90%
emotionally and physically--

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:48.230 align:middle line:84%
probably caused by
their own actions--

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:50.459 align:middle line:90%
how would you turn them around?

00:41:50.459 --> 00:41:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: First, I would start
with just a bunch of questions.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.980 align:middle line:84%
I would see where
their values are-- what

00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:56.810 align:middle line:90%
it is that they actually value.

00:41:56.810 --> 00:42:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And then I would show them
that the answer is just

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:00.920 align:middle line:90%
the riddle of life.

00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:04.250 align:middle line:84%
Our confusion and when
we're downtrodden--

00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:05.360 align:middle line:90%
that's a riddle.

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is
inherent within it.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.580 align:middle line:84%
So asking them questions
and getting them

00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:12.950 align:middle line:84%
in their own intelligence
to figure out

00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:14.450 align:middle line:84%
the solution to
their own problem,

00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:15.650 align:middle line:90%
because I don't have it.

00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:16.880 align:middle line:90%
You know, I'm no guru.

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:19.980 align:middle line:10%
I'm not here to give my message
that other people should

00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:20.780 align:middle line:10%
follow.

00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:24.170 align:middle line:10%
I'm here giving methods to
unleash our own intelligence.

00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:26.557 align:middle line:10%
And that's the way to get out
of any rut that you're in.

00:42:26.557 --> 00:42:28.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ben, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

an honor, George.

00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:32.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I look forward
to your shows on Gaia.com.

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:32.660 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Thank you.

00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:33.320 align:middle line:90%
Me too.

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:35.690 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: So take the techniques
that Ben has taught us.

00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:38.720 align:middle line:10%
Because we are subject to
the frailties of life-- ups

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:39.990 align:middle line:10%
and downs.

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:42.110 align:middle line:84%
But if you learn some
of these techniques,

00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:46.880 align:middle line:84%
physically and emotionally--
what you eat, how you exercise,

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:49.160 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be
better prepared to combat

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:50.800 align:middle line:90%
these problems of life.

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:53.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
