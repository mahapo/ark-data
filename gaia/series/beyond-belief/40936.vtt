today don't know what

00:00:02.636 --> 00:00:03.603 align:middle line:90%
to believe anymore.

00:00:03.603 --> 00:00:04.671 align:middle line:84%
>> People are basically...
need to keep

00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:07.307 align:middle line:84%
on... help uncover
what really happened.

00:00:07.307 --> 00:00:10.577 align:middle line:84%
>> I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:10.577 --> 00:00:12.646 align:middle line:84%
>> We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:12.646 --> 00:00:15.448 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told the entire
story.

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:23.823 align:middle line:84%
>>George Noory: And
welcome to  Beyond Belief .

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:26.026 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory
with another edition

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:27.661 align:middle line:90%
of a fascinating program.

00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:29.663 align:middle line:84%
You know, ever since
I was a little boy

00:00:29.663 --> 00:00:32.265 align:middle line:84%
and my mother brought me home a
book called  We Are Not Alone

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:35.402 align:middle line:84%
by Walter Sullivan who was
then the  New York Times

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:36.670 align:middle line:90%
science writer,

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.207 align:middle line:84%
I was hooked with the
possibility of life out there,

00:00:40.207 --> 00:00:44.444 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial life somewhere
on other planetary systems.

00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:47.914 align:middle line:84%
With us today, James Fox,
documentary film producer,

00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:51.117 align:middle line:84%
who has that same
obsession I had as a boy.

00:00:51.117 --> 00:00:52.485 align:middle line:90%
Don't you?

00:00:52.485 --> 00:00:53.753 align:middle line:90%
>>James Fox: Well, I'm a Taurus.

00:00:53.753 --> 00:00:54.588 align:middle line:90%
So, you know.

00:00:54.588 --> 00:00:55.322 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: You never give up.

00:00:55.322 --> 00:00:56.656 align:middle line:90%
You're a bull.

00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:58.391 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: That's the only --
that's the best characteristic.

00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:00.594 align:middle line:84%
There are people out there that
are so much better qualified

00:01:00.594 --> 00:01:02.929 align:middle line:90%
than me, but I will not give up.

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:04.164 align:middle line:90%
So it's a...

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:05.966 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: James, in one
of our earlier editions,

00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:08.435 align:middle line:84%
when we were talking to you
about the New Mexico case

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:12.539 align:middle line:84%
where the police officer
saw this egg shaped object

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:17.210 align:middle line:84%
and two little occupants
outside and then it took off,

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.813 align:middle line:84%
there was some hard
evidence there, right?

00:01:19.813 --> 00:01:23.483 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: Incredibly hard evidence
and I wanted to tell you

00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:28.989 align:middle line:84%
on the last show that the first
military officer on the scene,

00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:31.257 align:middle line:84%
Richard T. Holder -- there
were other police officers

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:32.626 align:middle line:84%
on the scene, but
Richard T. Holder,

00:01:32.626 --> 00:01:35.996 align:middle line:84%
and he was with an FBI guy --
Burns, I think his name was.

00:01:35.996 --> 00:01:37.697 align:middle line:84%
But any case, he
gets on the scene,

00:01:37.697 --> 00:01:39.866 align:middle line:84%
within about an hour
and a half, okay?

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:43.203 align:middle line:84%
There are burnt bush,
there's vitrified soil,

00:01:43.203 --> 00:01:44.670 align:middle line:84%
there are four imprints
in the ground --

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.271 align:middle line:84%
they determined it
was an object...

00:01:46.271 --> 00:01:47.374 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Dramatic.

00:01:47.374 --> 00:01:48.642 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: ...incredibly
heavy, you'd have to --

00:01:48.642 --> 00:01:51.845 align:middle line:84%
no footprints around to indicate
a truck or a boom hoist.

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:54.848 align:middle line:84%
Something made these imprints
in the sand that was very heavy

00:01:54.848 --> 00:01:56.116 align:middle line:84%
and they determined
now how heavy it was,

00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:58.184 align:middle line:90%
it was thousands of pounds.

00:01:58.184 --> 00:02:02.656 align:middle line:84%
So, Richard T. Holder comes
on board and not only this,

00:02:02.656 --> 00:02:06.393 align:middle line:84%
but they find footprints
of the alleged creatures...

00:02:06.393 --> 00:02:07.527 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Whoa!

00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:09.029 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: ...exactly where
Lonnie said they were.

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And Lonnie could
determine their height

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.098 align:middle line:90%
because he saw these bushes

00:02:12.098 --> 00:02:13.667 align:middle line:84%
that they were standing
right in front of.

00:02:13.667 --> 00:02:15.335 align:middle line:84%
So Lonnie said they
were over by the bush,

00:02:15.335 --> 00:02:17.537 align:middle line:84%
and they found corresponding
footprints.

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:19.472 align:middle line:84%
They called them like,
little pad marks,

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:22.242 align:middle line:84%
almost like someone small,
they were very lightweight...

00:02:22.242 --> 00:02:23.543 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: Were they
wearing shoes?

00:02:23.543 --> 00:02:25.178 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: ...where they were
wearing moccasin type shoes

00:02:25.178 --> 00:02:27.147 align:middle line:84%
that made this little
imprint the sand.

00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:28.448 align:middle line:90%
They weren't that big.

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:32.652 align:middle line:84%
So, he takes -- Richard
Holder takes plaster casts

00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:34.788 align:middle line:84%
of not only the landing
site imprints,

00:02:34.788 --> 00:02:36.323 align:middle line:90%
but the alien footprints.

00:02:36.323 --> 00:02:37.090 align:middle line:90%
Okay?

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.224 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: So we have casts

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:40.927 align:middle line:84%
of what could be
extraterrestrials

00:02:40.927 --> 00:02:41.494 align:middle line:90%
on this planet?

00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:41.995 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: Yes.

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:42.662 align:middle line:90%
So now...

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:43.863 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Somewhere.

00:02:43.863 --> 00:02:45.231 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: ...so now, the air
force -- now we know --

00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:46.966 align:middle line:84%
everything I'm telling you we
know for a fact because I'm

00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:48.134 align:middle line:90%
in touch with his kids --

00:02:48.134 --> 00:02:50.570 align:middle line:84%
Richard Holder Jr.
and Richard's brother.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:51.938 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: Is he no
longer with us?

00:02:51.938 --> 00:02:53.440 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: Richard unfortunately
died.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.841 align:middle line:84%
Richard T. Holder
died, but we went --

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:57.577 align:middle line:84%
we have a little on-camera
interview that he did back

00:02:57.577 --> 00:02:59.979 align:middle line:84%
in 1994, which I could talk
a little bit about that,

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:03.683 align:middle line:84%
but anyway, Richard
was contacted

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:05.185 align:middle line:90%
because of Tracy Torme --

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:06.953 align:middle line:84%
he was one of my partners
in this project...

00:03:06.953 --> 00:03:08.855 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: Son of the
later singer, right...

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:09.556 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: ...Mel Torme, yes.

00:03:09.556 --> 00:03:10.389 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: That's right.

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:11.591 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: And he was responsible

00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:12.792 align:middle line:84%
for finding this guy. We
worked on contact...

00:03:12.792 --> 00:03:14.094 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Okay.

00:03:14.094 --> 00:03:15.328 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: ...yeah, I am -- he's
on a whole slew of...

00:03:15.328 --> 00:03:16.162 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: He's in the loop.

00:03:16.162 --> 00:03:17.364 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: ...yeah, he's everywhere.

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:20.533 align:middle line:84%
So, Richard T. Holder was
about to spill the beans

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:23.269 align:middle line:84%
on a show called
Unsolved Mysteries .

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.508 align:middle line:84%
And it was 1994 and according to
his two sons, who I'm in touch

00:03:28.508 --> 00:03:29.809 align:middle line:84%
with now, were going
to go on the record

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:31.144 align:middle line:90%
for the first time ever --

00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:33.046 align:middle line:90%
Richard Holder was going

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:34.881 align:middle line:84%
to really spill the
beans about this case...

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:35.514 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Wow!

00:03:35.514 --> 00:03:36.750 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: ...in 1994.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.453 align:middle line:84%
And he got a phone call from
somebody in the military

00:03:40.453 --> 00:03:42.021 align:middle line:84%
that scared the bejesus
out of him.

00:03:42.021 --> 00:03:43.189 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Threatened him?

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:44.591 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: Scared the
bejesus out of him --

00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:46.025 align:middle line:84%
that's what the kid's said, and
I wasn't on the phone with him,

00:03:46.025 --> 00:03:48.795 align:middle line:84%
but he said he received a
phone call and that was it.

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:51.431 align:middle line:84%
He sanitized the story
for  Unsolved Mysteries

00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:54.200 align:middle line:84%
and he got rid of all the
evidence -- the plaster cast,

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.201 align:middle line:90%
all the documents,

00:03:55.201 --> 00:03:56.703 align:middle line:84%
the photographic evidence
because he...

00:03:56.703 --> 00:03:57.771 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: But somebody has them?

00:03:57.771 --> 00:03:58.738 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: ...because he
said he didn't want

00:03:58.738 --> 00:04:00.707 align:middle line:90%
to burden his kids with it.

00:04:00.707 --> 00:04:03.443 align:middle line:84%
So his kids brought up -- now
this is really interesting

00:04:03.443 --> 00:04:07.981 align:middle line:84%
because I -- we are also
covering a very well known case

00:04:07.981 --> 00:04:09.616 align:middle line:84%
that has been covered
to death, I know,

00:04:09.616 --> 00:04:11.918 align:middle line:84%
but the Kenneth Arnold
sighting in 1947 in June...

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:13.118 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: Which was
one of the first...

00:04:13.118 --> 00:04:14.120 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: ...one of the first.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.088 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: ...in modern
day sightings.

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:16.089 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: And it's one
of the sightings

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:17.357 align:middle line:84%
that coined the phrase
"Flying Saucer."

00:04:17.357 --> 00:04:18.358 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: That's right.

00:04:18.358 --> 00:04:20.460 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: So, we contact
Kim Arnold --

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:24.330 align:middle line:84%
Kim's so funny, she was not
an easy person to deal with.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.666 align:middle line:90%
I like her, but whoo!

00:04:26.666 --> 00:04:31.604 align:middle line:84%
Wow! She said, "James, Paul
Harris took two years to get me

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:34.674 align:middle line:84%
to go on a radio thing
and I didn't want

00:04:34.674 --> 00:04:36.109 align:middle line:90%
to do it, you know, two years.

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:38.243 align:middle line:84%
You got me to go on
camera within two weeks."

00:04:38.243 --> 00:04:39.945 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Yeah, and
it almost killed me."

00:04:39.945 --> 00:04:40.647 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: I love that.

00:04:40.647 --> 00:04:41.915 align:middle line:90%
She's that tough, huh?

00:04:41.915 --> 00:04:44.017 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: [Laughing]
You have no idea.

00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:45.285 align:middle line:90%
Oh my gosh!

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:47.153 align:middle line:84%
Kim Arnold, I love you, if
you're listening to this.

00:04:47.153 --> 00:04:49.422 align:middle line:84%
She basically kept all of
her father's memorabilia

00:04:49.422 --> 00:04:51.591 align:middle line:84%
from the incident
in 1947 in June.

00:04:51.591 --> 00:04:53.726 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: He was a pilot, right?

00:04:53.726 --> 00:04:54.661 align:middle line:90%
Private plane.

00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:55.728 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: Private pilot.

00:04:55.728 --> 00:04:58.398 align:middle line:84%
He ran for lieutenant
governor of Idaho.

00:04:58.398 --> 00:05:02.602 align:middle line:84%
He had an ongoing
relationship after his sighting

00:05:02.602 --> 00:05:04.604 align:middle line:84%
with the United States Air
Force, which I didn't know about

00:05:04.604 --> 00:05:07.140 align:middle line:84%
and I don't think very many
people did know about it.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.077 align:middle line:84%
And which all this stuff,
there's photographic evidence,

00:05:11.077 --> 00:05:12.912 align:middle line:84%
there's written evidence,
there's the --

00:05:12.912 --> 00:05:16.015 align:middle line:84%
there's the very
famous airbrush painting

00:05:16.015 --> 00:05:17.016 align:middle line:90%
that he had commissioned...

00:05:17.016 --> 00:05:18.151 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: I've seen that.

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:19.485 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: ...right after
the sighting happened.

00:05:19.485 --> 00:05:21.821 align:middle line:84%
There's a radio interview right
after he had the sighting.

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:24.924 align:middle line:84%
There's correspondence from
the Air Force with him.

00:05:24.924 --> 00:05:27.894 align:middle line:84%
There's invitations to
military installations

00:05:27.894 --> 00:05:29.896 align:middle line:90%
and then, here's the kicker.

00:05:29.896 --> 00:05:31.130 align:middle line:90%
So he was going to go on tour.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.733 align:middle line:84%
So Kenneth Arnold puts
together a whole --

00:05:33.733 --> 00:05:35.335 align:middle line:84%
Kenneth Arnold got
more publicity

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:36.569 align:middle line:90%
than the end of World War II.

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:37.403 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was unbelievable.

00:05:37.403 --> 00:05:38.070 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: It was huge.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.739 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: Huge story...

00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:40.440 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Yeah.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.574 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: ...back in 1947.

00:05:41.574 --> 00:05:42.675 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: And this was
before Roswell, right?

00:05:42.675 --> 00:05:45.178 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: This is before
Roswell, yes it is.

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:48.948 align:middle line:84%
And like I said to your audience
already, he said, "Well, it flew

00:05:48.948 --> 00:05:51.684 align:middle line:84%
they flew like a saucer being
skipped across the water,"

00:05:51.684 --> 00:05:53.620 align:middle line:84%
hence the term flying
saucer was coined.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.088 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: Somebody
picked that up.

00:05:55.088 --> 00:05:57.924 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: So Kenneth Arnold got all
this attention from the media.

00:05:57.924 --> 00:06:01.294 align:middle line:84%
I mean, colossal, he thought,
you know, people need to know

00:06:01.294 --> 00:06:03.630 align:middle line:84%
about this and he put
together this whole book

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:04.764 align:middle line:90%
and presentation.

00:06:04.764 --> 00:06:05.899 align:middle line:90%
He was going to go on tour.

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:08.735 align:middle line:84%
Well, he got a little
visit by the Air Force.

00:06:08.735 --> 00:06:12.171 align:middle line:84%
Basically, and his daughter
Kim Arnold revealed to us

00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:13.506 align:middle line:90%
for the first time,

00:06:13.506 --> 00:06:15.308 align:middle line:84%
that basically his life was
threatened in so many words

00:06:15.308 --> 00:06:16.709 align:middle line:90%
they can say things to you.

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: I believe
they did that.

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:18.845 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: That's what she said.

00:06:18.845 --> 00:06:20.046 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: They could get away
with anything in those days.

00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:22.715 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: Very, very credible
-- very, very credible,

00:06:22.715 --> 00:06:25.785 align:middle line:84%
but it's interesting that
the Air Force actually had

00:06:25.785 --> 00:06:28.154 align:middle line:84%
photographic evidence of
something very similar

00:06:28.154 --> 00:06:29.856 align:middle line:90%
to what he saw and they said,

00:06:29.856 --> 00:06:32.058 align:middle line:84%
"We believe these
photographs to be authentic."

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:34.227 align:middle line:84%
They gave him copies
-- 10 by 11's.

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:36.796 align:middle line:84%
It's very big black and white,
really nice photographs.

00:06:36.796 --> 00:06:37.764 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Same thing.

00:06:37.764 --> 00:06:38.932 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: Yeah, and
Kenneth Arnold wrote

00:06:38.932 --> 00:06:40.500 align:middle line:84%
on the back all the
descriptions,

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.135 align:middle line:84%
who it was at the
military installation,

00:06:42.135 --> 00:06:43.569 align:middle line:84%
where the military
installation was,

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:45.872 align:middle line:90%
where they invited him in 1949.

00:06:45.872 --> 00:06:48.474 align:middle line:84%
In writing said this what you
saw. We believe these to be

00:06:48.474 --> 00:06:50.209 align:middle line:84%
real. Yes, this is very
similar to what I saw.

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:53.413 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be
revealing all that stuff...

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:56.983 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: And then sometime
in that same year, '47,

00:06:56.983 --> 00:06:58.318 align:middle line:90%
we get the Roswell crash.

00:06:58.318 --> 00:06:59.619 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: We do, and a month later.

00:06:59.619 --> 00:07:01.421 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: I don't
believe in coincidences,

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:02.889 align:middle line:90%
so what do you figure?

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:05.158 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: I -- well, you know,
people often ask me what I think

00:07:05.158 --> 00:07:08.027 align:middle line:84%
about Roswell and I say
that I'm going to have to go

00:07:08.027 --> 00:07:11.130 align:middle line:84%
with the military's initial
explanation of a flying saucer.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:15.635 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: [Laughter] Which
is exactly what they said.

00:07:15.635 --> 00:07:16.970 align:middle line:90%
It was in the newspaper.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.272 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: I believe their initial
-- yeah, because you know,

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:20.907 align:middle line:84%
you got a lot of the
people that were involved

00:07:20.907 --> 00:07:23.509 align:middle line:90%
with that initial statement.

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:25.411 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: Was it a lieutenant
who came out with that?

00:07:25.411 --> 00:07:26.346 align:middle line:90%
The Lieutenant Walter...

00:07:26.346 --> 00:07:27.513 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: Well there's Walter Haut

00:07:27.513 --> 00:07:28.748 align:middle line:84%
who wrote the --
who wrote the...

00:07:28.748 --> 00:07:30.450 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: He did the --
the news release, right?

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:31.384 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: Exactly.

00:07:31.384 --> 00:07:32.518 align:middle line:84%
And I think, correct
me if wrong.

00:07:32.518 --> 00:07:34.020 align:middle line:90%
Was it Ramey was involved?

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:34.954 align:middle line:90%
Or that was probably...

00:07:34.954 --> 00:07:36.322 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Ramey was involved...

00:07:36.322 --> 00:07:37.323 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Yeah that was...

00:07:37.323 --> 00:07:38.591 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: ...and Marcel
was involved...

00:07:38.591 --> 00:07:39.759 align:middle line:90%
And, as you know,

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:42.528 align:middle line:84%
we just
lost Jesse Marcel Junior.

00:07:42.528 --> 00:07:43.096 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: Yeah we did.

00:07:43.096 --> 00:07:44.464 align:middle line:90%
Bless his heart.

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:47.533 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: Who claims that his
father showed him some pieces

00:07:47.533 --> 00:07:50.770 align:middle line:84%
of the wreckage and they
looked like little hieroglyphs

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:51.804 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:07:51.804 --> 00:07:53.272 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: Isn't it interesting,
you know,

00:07:53.272 --> 00:07:56.242 align:middle line:84%
we just did an interview --
this is really fascinating,

00:07:56.242 --> 00:07:58.011 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to take too
much of a tangent here.

00:07:58.011 --> 00:07:59.412 align:middle line:84%
But we just did an
interview with one

00:07:59.412 --> 00:08:02.281 align:middle line:84%
of the highest-ranking military
generals ever to come forward.

00:08:02.281 --> 00:08:04.617 align:middle line:84%
We were very lucky to
get this guy on camera.

00:08:04.617 --> 00:08:07.887 align:middle line:84%
But because of his
reputation and everything else,

00:08:07.887 --> 00:08:09.088 align:middle line:90%
we talked hypotheticals.

00:08:09.088 --> 00:08:10.823 align:middle line:90%
General McPeak...

00:08:10.823 --> 00:08:12.225 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Retired.

00:08:12.225 --> 00:08:14.093 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: Yes, he was head of the
entire United States Air Force.

00:08:14.093 --> 00:08:15.962 align:middle line:84%
It's really funny, actually,
because at the beginning

00:08:15.962 --> 00:08:17.397 align:middle line:84%
of each interview I
say, "Please, you know,

00:08:17.397 --> 00:08:19.999 align:middle line:84%
state your name and
spelling and your position."

00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:23.069 align:middle line:84%
He's like, "Well,
General McPeak,

00:08:23.069 --> 00:08:26.572 align:middle line:84%
I was head of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff,

00:08:26.572 --> 00:08:27.873 align:middle line:90%
United States Air Force..."

00:08:27.873 --> 00:08:29.108 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: Can't get
much bigger than that.

00:08:29.108 --> 00:08:30.510 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: ...I said, "Well,
what did your job involve?"

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.712 align:middle line:84%
He's like, "Well, I had a
million people working for me.

00:08:32.712 --> 00:08:34.781 align:middle line:84%
A budget of one point
two trillion to get a..."

00:08:34.781 --> 00:08:35.547 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Yeah, that's true.

00:08:35.547 --> 00:08:36.482 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: I thought, "Wow!"

00:08:36.482 --> 00:08:37.784 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Now, is he a believer?

00:08:37.784 --> 00:08:38.618 align:middle line:90%
What did he say?

00:08:38.618 --> 00:08:39.852 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: Well, here's -- I said...

00:08:39.852 --> 00:08:42.922 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: And this is in
the documentary 701, right?

00:08:42.922 --> 00:08:46.059 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: ...yes, this is going to
be in the documentary 701.

00:08:46.059 --> 00:08:49.295 align:middle line:84%
Now I said -- before the
interview I said, "General,

00:08:49.295 --> 00:08:52.532 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to talk
hypotheticals with you.

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:54.567 align:middle line:84%
I know it's sensitive and what
his official position is --

00:08:54.567 --> 00:08:56.402 align:middle line:84%
some people, their
opinion may differ.

00:08:56.402 --> 00:08:59.872 align:middle line:84%
But I said, we're going
to talk hypotheticals.

00:08:59.872 --> 00:09:03.142 align:middle line:84%
If the accounts were to be
believed over the last 65,

00:09:03.142 --> 00:09:04.410 align:middle line:84%
70 years of these
sightings, you know,

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:05.978 align:middle line:84%
objects with no airplane
-- with sorry, no wings,

00:09:05.978 --> 00:09:08.881 align:middle line:84%
no visible means of propulsion,
no sound, no exhaust vents,

00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:11.117 align:middle line:84%
able to go from a standstill
to out of sight in a blink

00:09:11.117 --> 00:09:13.586 align:middle line:84%
of an eye, 90 degree
angle turns at high speed.

00:09:13.586 --> 00:09:16.422 align:middle line:84%
Are -- is there anything in the
United States Air Force arsenal

00:09:16.422 --> 00:09:19.158 align:middle line:84%
that could be responsible
for these reports?

00:09:19.158 --> 00:09:19.959 align:middle line:90%
"No."

00:09:19.959 --> 00:09:21.160 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: No, of course not.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.696 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: That was the first
thing I got him to say,

00:09:23.696 --> 00:09:25.665 align:middle line:84%
which believe it or not,
think about it for a minute...

00:09:25.665 --> 00:09:26.799 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: You needed
him to go on record.

00:09:26.799 --> 00:09:28.167 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: ...really need
people to go on record

00:09:28.167 --> 00:09:29.902 align:middle line:84%
because I can't tell you the
amount of skeptics that'd say,

00:09:29.902 --> 00:09:30.937 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: I agree.

00:09:30.937 --> 00:09:32.472 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: "Do you have
any idea how many..."

00:09:32.472 --> 00:09:33.873 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: What we have!

00:09:33.873 --> 00:09:36.075 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: ...yeah, how many secret
-- most sightings are secret.

00:09:36.075 --> 00:09:38.144 align:middle line:84%
We don't even know about
it until 25 years later.

00:09:38.144 --> 00:09:39.846 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have it from
the guy at the top.

00:09:39.846 --> 00:09:41.714 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely not, okay.

00:09:41.714 --> 00:09:43.182 align:middle line:90%
So that was one thing we got.

00:09:43.182 --> 00:09:46.486 align:middle line:84%
The second thing we got, which I
think is really cool is I said,

00:09:46.486 --> 00:09:48.654 align:middle line:90%
"Well, is it safe to say

00:09:48.654 --> 00:09:51.090 align:middle line:84%
that the Air Force is
responsible for," and I thought

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:52.425 align:middle line:84%
about these questions
for a month, believe me.

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:54.594 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted him
to say to the --

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:58.397 align:middle line:84%
"Is it safe to say that the
Air Force is responsible for,

00:09:58.397 --> 00:10:00.800 align:middle line:84%
you know, our air
space and the safety

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.201 align:middle line:90%
and security of our air space?"

00:10:02.201 --> 00:10:04.103 align:middle line:90%
"Absolutely, that's our job."

00:10:04.103 --> 00:10:06.139 align:middle line:84%
"So if there's something
in the air space,

00:10:06.139 --> 00:10:08.908 align:middle line:84%
perhaps it's not
identifying itself.

00:10:08.908 --> 00:10:11.511 align:middle line:84%
Is there a certain protocol
or something that we do?"

00:10:11.511 --> 00:10:14.280 align:middle line:84%
"Oh, absolutely yeah, we
scramble jets to intercept."

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.216 align:middle line:90%
"Okay, so if you're unable

00:10:17.216 --> 00:10:21.654 align:middle line:84%
to identify this
so-called aircraft,

00:10:21.654 --> 00:10:24.223 align:middle line:90%
you know, what happens then?"

00:10:24.223 --> 00:10:26.926 align:middle line:84%
He's like, "Well, that would
be a National Security issue."

00:10:26.926 --> 00:10:30.263 align:middle line:90%
Okay. "Well, then what?"

00:10:30.263 --> 00:10:34.467 align:middle line:84%
"Well, that would
be classified."

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:36.602 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: I loe that. You got
answers without the answers.

00:10:36.602 --> 00:10:38.171 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: Yes, that's all I wanted.

00:10:38.171 --> 00:10:40.106 align:middle line:84%
I said, "You know what,"
I remember in the middle

00:10:40.106 --> 00:10:42.708 align:middle line:84%
of the interview I was like,
"I'm done here, this is good."

00:10:42.708 --> 00:10:45.278 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: Well, the Arnold
case was always fascinating

00:10:45.278 --> 00:10:49.015 align:middle line:84%
and the fact that the media at
that time picked up on this...

00:10:49.015 --> 00:10:49.815 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: Yes.

00:10:49.815 --> 00:10:50.850 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: ...and then we had

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:52.585 align:middle line:84%
so many offshoots,
James, from that.

00:10:52.585 --> 00:10:55.788 align:middle line:84%
I used to remember my father
watching  Science Fiction

00:10:55.788 --> 00:10:59.892 align:middle line:84%
Theater  and they would
do stories of UFOs

00:10:59.892 --> 00:11:02.461 align:middle line:90%
on radar and things like that.

00:11:02.461 --> 00:11:05.531 align:middle line:84%
We really -- we really were
into that at that time.

00:11:05.531 --> 00:11:08.401 align:middle line:84%
And then we kind of drifted
away and now we're coming back

00:11:08.401 --> 00:11:11.337 align:middle line:90%
to that again as a society.

00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:13.973 align:middle line:84%
Something's happening,
we -- this --

00:11:13.973 --> 00:11:16.876 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you how excited
I am about the 701 project.

00:11:16.876 --> 00:11:18.444 align:middle line:84%
I mean, things are really
-- you know when there's...

00:11:18.444 --> 00:11:20.112 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: And how do people
see that, by the way?

00:11:20.112 --> 00:11:21.781 align:middle line:84%
Where are they going to get
a chance to look at that?

00:11:21.781 --> 00:11:24.584 align:middle line:84%
Is it on DVD or are they
going to go to the movies?

00:11:24.584 --> 00:11:25.885 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: You guys got
to give us the time.

00:11:25.885 --> 00:11:28.788 align:middle line:84%
Our intention has never
changed from day one.

00:11:28.788 --> 00:11:33.059 align:middle line:84%
I got approached from Tracy
Torme about a year ago.

00:11:33.059 --> 00:11:35.595 align:middle line:84%
He said, "I'm not interested in
doing any more television stuff.

00:11:35.595 --> 00:11:36.862 align:middle line:84%
I've seen your film,
I know what I saw

00:11:36.862 --> 00:11:38.664 align:middle line:84%
on the History Channel,
I loved it."

00:11:38.664 --> 00:11:41.434 align:middle line:84%
He goes, "How would you
like to team up with me

00:11:41.434 --> 00:11:46.239 align:middle line:84%
and do the definitive seminal
UFO documentary feature film?"

00:11:46.239 --> 00:11:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Tracy,
it's been my dream..."

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.242 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: Is this for cinema?

00:11:49.242 --> 00:11:50.176 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: ...oh, absolutely.

00:11:50.176 --> 00:11:50.810 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: Okay.

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:51.644 align:middle line:90%
Big theaters then?

00:11:51.644 --> 00:11:52.612 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Oh, yeah.

00:11:52.612 --> 00:11:54.614 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: In fact, this
is different.

00:11:54.614 --> 00:11:55.915 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Way different.

00:11:55.915 --> 00:11:58.184 align:middle line:84%
So you know, the production
qualities, I mean it's --

00:11:58.184 --> 00:12:01.654 align:middle line:84%
it couldn't be -- we
have a great budget,

00:12:01.654 --> 00:12:03.055 align:middle line:90%
we have a great team.

00:12:03.055 --> 00:12:03.823 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: Fantastic.

00:12:03.823 --> 00:12:04.890 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: You can check it

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:05.891 align:middle line:84%
out at 701themovie.com, and
we're going

00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:06.592 align:middle line:90%
to upgrade our...

00:12:06.592 --> 00:12:08.160 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: 701themovie.com?

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.062 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: ...yeah, we're
going to update our website.

00:12:10.062 --> 00:12:13.899 align:middle line:84%
But also extracting new
information on old cases

00:12:13.899 --> 00:12:15.901 align:middle line:84%
and really, really
credible information.

00:12:15.901 --> 00:12:17.670 align:middle line:90%
You know, and close encounter --

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:19.005 align:middle line:84%
we're pushing the envelope
a little bit --

00:12:19.005 --> 00:12:21.140 align:middle line:84%
we're going with close
encounters of the third kind.

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:23.909 align:middle line:84%
Very credible close
encounters of the third kind.

00:12:23.909 --> 00:12:29.015 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: Have you investigated
cases where people have pilots?

00:12:29.015 --> 00:12:33.419 align:middle line:84%
Say I see an object coming my
way and then the pilots gone,

00:12:33.419 --> 00:12:35.755 align:middle line:84%
the planes gone,
they've disappeared.

00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:37.790 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: You know, that's
interesting you brought that up

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:39.058 align:middle line:84%
because there was
something that happened

00:12:39.058 --> 00:12:41.794 align:middle line:84%
and I wish I knew exact date,
but it was in Australia.

00:12:41.794 --> 00:12:43.195 align:middle line:84%
And, where this young
pilot had...

00:12:43.195 --> 00:12:44.530 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: It was in a Cessna,
or something like that.

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:45.965 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: ...okay, yeah a young
pilot reported something.

00:12:45.965 --> 00:12:48.367 align:middle line:84%
And we have talked
about possibly featuring

00:12:48.367 --> 00:12:52.305 align:middle line:90%
that case, but is there malice?

00:12:52.305 --> 00:12:54.507 align:middle line:90%
I mean, was it a malicious act?

00:12:54.507 --> 00:12:57.410 align:middle line:90%
Was it the fact that maybe he...

00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:58.878 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: Or they took him.

00:12:58.878 --> 00:13:00.513 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: ...yeah, or
maybe he crashed the plane

00:13:00.513 --> 00:13:02.081 align:middle line:84%
in the water -- I don't know,
I'd hate to think that the...

00:13:02.081 --> 00:13:03.182 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: Maybe.

00:13:03.182 --> 00:13:03.949 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: ...guy was just
completely abducted.

00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:05.151 align:middle line:90%
Maybe he was.

00:13:05.151 --> 00:13:05.985 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: I don't know, but...

00:13:05.985 --> 00:13:07.353 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: Well, you know,
he was --

00:13:07.353 --> 00:13:09.889 align:middle line:84%
the last I had heard was that
he had a radio transmission

00:13:09.889 --> 00:13:13.459 align:middle line:84%
and he was describing this
massive size object...

00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:14.527 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: True.

00:13:14.527 --> 00:13:15.094 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: ...which
was coming his way...

00:13:15.094 --> 00:13:16.028 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: Yes.

00:13:16.028 --> 00:13:17.830 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: ...and then
he was gone.

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:18.964 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: Yes, I know, it does...

00:13:18.964 --> 00:13:20.266 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: I mean, did
they vaporize him?

00:13:20.266 --> 00:13:22.101 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: ...it's a little scary.

00:13:22.101 --> 00:13:22.902 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Who knows?

00:13:22.902 --> 00:13:23.602 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: It's a little scary.

00:13:23.602 --> 00:13:24.937 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Unbelievable.

00:13:24.937 --> 00:13:25.638 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: Maybe they took --
maybe they took one of us home

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:26.739 align:middle line:90%
with them or something.

00:13:26.739 --> 00:13:29.008 align:middle line:84%
No, but we're not --
there's a couple things

00:13:29.008 --> 00:13:31.377 align:middle line:84%
that we're trying not to
do in this production.

00:13:31.377 --> 00:13:34.447 align:middle line:84%
One of which is to portray
these people, these beings,

00:13:34.447 --> 00:13:35.648 align:middle line:90%
these entities in a bad way.

00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:38.417 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: As evil, as
David Jacobs would say.

00:13:38.417 --> 00:13:40.720 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: We're not trying --
we're not trying to do that

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.121 align:middle line:90%
and we're not trying --

00:13:42.121 --> 00:13:44.490 align:middle line:84%
not to say that all of them have
the same agenda, I don't know.

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:47.560 align:middle line:84%
Okay? I'm trying to maintain a
fairly neutral position on this

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.795 align:middle line:84%
and only go with what
we can back up with

00:13:49.795 --> 00:13:51.597 align:middle line:84%
as much hard evidence
as possible.

00:13:51.597 --> 00:13:54.734 align:middle line:84%
But to -- and also, and
people are going to hate me

00:13:54.734 --> 00:13:56.635 align:middle line:84%
for saying this, I know
there's a lot of UFO researchers

00:13:56.635 --> 00:13:57.803 align:middle line:90%
out there that are going to,

00:13:57.803 --> 00:13:59.939 align:middle line:84%
but not to put the
government necessarily --

00:13:59.939 --> 00:14:02.475 align:middle line:84%
point too many fingers
in a really bad light.

00:14:02.475 --> 00:14:05.511 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: Oh, they're jumping on
you right now for saying that.

00:14:05.511 --> 00:14:07.179 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: Because I know
there's a cover up,

00:14:07.179 --> 00:14:08.848 align:middle line:84%
believe me I know
there's a cover up,

00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:11.117 align:middle line:84%
but because we want
their cooperation.

00:14:11.117 --> 00:14:12.618 align:middle line:90%
We want them to say...

00:14:12.618 --> 00:14:14.520 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: Do you actually
think you're going to get it?

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.655 align:middle line:84%
We haven't gotten
it for 60 years.

00:14:16.655 --> 00:14:17.857 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: Well, I -- you
know, I really think

00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:19.792 align:middle line:84%
that if it's ever going to
happen, now is the time.

00:14:19.792 --> 00:14:22.695 align:middle line:84%
And I think that it -- the
best possibilities for us

00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:25.164 align:middle line:84%
to take this position
to say, "You know what,

00:14:25.164 --> 00:14:28.534 align:middle line:84%
secrecy perhaps was
justified back then,

00:14:28.534 --> 00:14:30.035 align:middle line:90%
but it's not justified now.

00:14:30.035 --> 00:14:31.637 align:middle line:84%
It's time to come
out with the truth.

00:14:31.637 --> 00:14:33.773 align:middle line:84%
We're going to provide you
with a platform to do that.

00:14:33.773 --> 00:14:36.609 align:middle line:84%
Come participate with us,
come cooperate with us

00:14:36.609 --> 00:14:38.411 align:middle line:84%
and let's tell the world
what's really going on."

00:14:38.411 --> 00:14:39.812 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: Aren't they
still living

00:14:39.812 --> 00:14:44.517 align:middle line:84%
on the Brooking's Institute's
Research Project from the '60's

00:14:44.517 --> 00:14:48.754 align:middle line:84%
that basically said,
"Don't tell people anything.

00:14:48.754 --> 00:14:50.389 align:middle line:90%
They can't handle it."

00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:52.758 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: Well, you know, I take
it even earlier than that.

00:14:52.758 --> 00:14:57.063 align:middle line:84%
You remember in 1953 there
was the Robertson panel?

00:14:57.063 --> 00:14:57.997 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Uh huh.

00:14:57.997 --> 00:14:58.764 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: And the Air
Force apparently

00:14:58.764 --> 00:15:00.032 align:middle line:90%
at that time, was divided.

00:15:00.032 --> 00:15:01.700 align:middle line:84%
Some of them wanted to
disclose the information

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.803 align:middle line:84%
of what was going on,
they had just had the

00:15:03.803 --> 00:15:04.437 align:middle line:90%
estimate of the situation.

00:15:04.437 --> 00:15:05.004 align:middle line:90%
Remember that?

00:15:05.004 --> 00:15:06.305 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Right.

00:15:06.305 --> 00:15:07.573 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: Project Sign and then
it went to Project Grudge.

00:15:07.573 --> 00:15:11.577 align:middle line:84%
And I remember listening
to interviews

00:15:11.577 --> 00:15:14.580 align:middle line:84%
with Dr. J. Allen Hynik who
was there at the time in 1953

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:15.548 align:middle line:90%
and it was right after...

00:15:15.548 --> 00:15:16.615 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: Who was
not a believer then.

00:15:16.615 --> 00:15:18.117 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: ...not a believer then.

00:15:18.117 --> 00:15:19.185 align:middle line:84%
More inclined than
the other people,

00:15:19.185 --> 00:15:21.120 align:middle line:84%
but the Robertson
Panel basically said --

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.389 align:middle line:84%
I mean, remember this is
right after the 1952 sightings

00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:24.590 align:middle line:90%
over the capital building.

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.091 align:middle line:90%
Two consecutive weekends...

00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:27.092 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: Which were
in the newspaper.

00:15:27.092 --> 00:15:27.893 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: Jets...

00:15:27.893 --> 00:15:28.561 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: ...pictures, yeah.

00:15:28.561 --> 00:15:29.962 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: ...scrambled.

00:15:29.962 --> 00:15:32.031 align:middle line:84%
One of the -- one of the pilots
was surrounded by these things.

00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:34.733 align:middle line:84%
They picked them up on radar,
they had visual confirmation,

00:15:34.733 --> 00:15:36.769 align:middle line:90%
radar confirmation, you know.

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:38.037 align:middle line:84%
God knows if they took
photographs or not.

00:15:38.037 --> 00:15:39.371 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:15:39.371 --> 00:15:40.439 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: And there was nothing
we could of done about it.

00:15:40.439 --> 00:15:41.507 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: Nothing we
could've done about it,

00:15:41.507 --> 00:15:43.342 align:middle line:84%
so in 1953 they put
this panel together.

00:15:43.342 --> 00:15:45.778 align:middle line:84%
You know, I -- I talked
to people that were there

00:15:45.778 --> 00:15:47.780 align:middle line:84%
and they said, "Look, the
Air Force was divided.

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.082 align:middle line:84%
Some of them wanted to release
it, some of them said we can't.

00:15:50.082 --> 00:15:51.550 align:middle line:84%
We should find out
what's going on."

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:52.885 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Right.

00:15:52.885 --> 00:15:54.320 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: So the Robertson Panel
basically said, "You know,

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.021 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to
deny these things --

00:15:56.021 --> 00:15:57.723 align:middle line:84%
they exist, we'll
just ridicule those

00:15:57.723 --> 00:15:58.824 align:middle line:90%
who claim to have seen them.

00:15:58.824 --> 00:16:00.659 align:middle line:84%
And that's when that
policy shift happened.

00:16:00.659 --> 00:16:02.695 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: And visit them and
scare the heck out of them.

00:16:02.695 --> 00:16:03.929 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: Well, they're
just like, "You know,

00:16:03.929 --> 00:16:05.331 align:middle line:84%
let's just like,
think about it."

00:16:05.331 --> 00:16:08.934 align:middle line:84%
Where do -- what's funny about
a pilot saying he saw something

00:16:08.934 --> 00:16:10.369 align:middle line:84%
or a pilots saying
they saw something

00:16:10.369 --> 00:16:12.037 align:middle line:84%
or radar operator
saying they saw something

00:16:12.037 --> 00:16:13.839 align:middle line:84%
that defies physics
as we know it or...

00:16:13.839 --> 00:16:14.507 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Exactly.

00:16:14.507 --> 00:16:15.641 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: ...defies...

00:16:15.641 --> 00:16:16.876 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: Or people see
it outside of the plane.

00:16:16.876 --> 00:16:19.712 align:middle line:84%
Right? Alongside the plane,
looking out the window.

00:16:19.712 --> 00:16:20.779 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: Yeah, what's
funny about it?

00:16:20.779 --> 00:16:21.614 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: And they see
this large object.

00:16:21.614 --> 00:16:22.815 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: What's funny about that?

00:16:22.815 --> 00:16:23.582 align:middle line:90%
Seriously.

00:16:23.582 --> 00:16:24.250 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Nothing, nothing.

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:25.584 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: Right, yeah.

00:16:25.584 --> 00:16:26.886 align:middle line:84%
So you're wondering where
this whole knee jerk ridicule

00:16:26.886 --> 00:16:29.722 align:middle line:84%
response came from and I'm
you know, it came from 1953.

00:16:29.722 --> 00:16:32.124 align:middle line:84%
So that was -- that
was a policy that stuck

00:16:32.124 --> 00:16:32.925 align:middle line:90%
and it stuck beautifully.

00:16:32.925 --> 00:16:34.927 align:middle line:90%
It was very effective.

00:16:34.927 --> 00:16:39.565 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I really
believe this with all my heart

00:16:39.565 --> 00:16:42.001 align:middle line:90%
that 701 is going to really --

00:16:42.001 --> 00:16:45.838 align:middle line:84%
is really going to
let the audience know

00:16:45.838 --> 00:16:47.840 align:middle line:84%
on a very wide scale, it's
going to be entertaining.

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:52.011 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be informative,
it's going to be 110% accurate.

00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:55.047 align:middle line:84%
Every detail and I'm making
sure that I'm involved

00:16:55.047 --> 00:16:59.018 align:middle line:84%
with the process from start
to completion to ensure

00:16:59.018 --> 00:17:01.687 align:middle line:84%
that it's 110% accurate
when told.

00:17:01.687 --> 00:17:02.520 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Good for you.

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:03.188 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's the way you are.

00:17:03.188 --> 00:17:04.323 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: Oh, yeah.

00:17:04.323 --> 00:17:05.423 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: Do you think
disclosure could come

00:17:05.423 --> 00:17:07.125 align:middle line:90%
after this has been shown?

00:17:07.125 --> 00:17:08.394 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: See, I -- I'm one

00:17:08.394 --> 00:17:11.063 align:middle line:84%
of these people that's always
been somewhat skeptical

00:17:11.063 --> 00:17:13.399 align:middle line:84%
from disclosure because I don't
think the president knows much

00:17:13.399 --> 00:17:14.033 align:middle line:90%
more than Joe...

00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:14.633 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: I agree.

00:17:14.633 --> 00:17:15.334 align:middle line:90%
Yeah I agree.

00:17:15.334 --> 00:17:16.535 align:middle line:90%
He's left in the dark.

00:17:16.535 --> 00:17:18.336 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: So disclosure is
going to have to come

00:17:18.336 --> 00:17:20.038 align:middle line:90%
from the people letting --

00:17:20.038 --> 00:17:21.774 align:middle line:84%
getting the information
out to the people.

00:17:21.774 --> 00:17:24.543 align:middle line:84%
Once the people know
what's going on and a film

00:17:24.543 --> 00:17:28.781 align:middle line:84%
like this could really
tip that scale, I think.

00:17:28.781 --> 00:17:30.449 align:middle line:84%
Then we can push for
congressional hearings.

00:17:30.449 --> 00:17:33.118 align:middle line:84%
Then we can push our
representatives for answers

00:17:33.118 --> 00:17:35.487 align:middle line:84%
because until then -- and
I've been on the hill --

00:17:35.487 --> 00:17:37.323 align:middle line:84%
I've handed out copies of
Out of the Blue  to each

00:17:37.323 --> 00:17:40.793 align:middle line:84%
and every member of the
house, 435 with a private --

00:17:40.793 --> 00:17:43.062 align:middle line:84%
with a letter to
the Chief of Staff.

00:17:43.062 --> 00:17:44.897 align:middle line:84%
And I talked to a lot
of these congressman,

00:17:44.897 --> 00:17:46.031 align:middle line:84%
some of them knew a
little bit about it.

00:17:46.031 --> 00:17:47.199 align:middle line:84%
Some of them knew
nothing about it.

00:17:47.199 --> 00:17:48.500 align:middle line:90%
Some of them knew more about it.

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.803 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "There's no way
in hell there's ever going

00:17:50.803 --> 00:17:53.138 align:middle line:84%
to be disclosure or
congressional hearings

00:17:53.138 --> 00:17:56.108 align:middle line:84%
without our constituents
rattling our cages. Period."

00:17:56.108 --> 00:17:57.276 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: I agree.

00:17:57.276 --> 00:17:59.745 align:middle line:84%
We had one great
congressman, who's dead now.

00:17:59.745 --> 00:18:00.446 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: Stephen Schiff.

00:18:00.446 --> 00:18:01.647 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Stephen Schiff,

00:18:01.647 --> 00:18:03.449 align:middle line:84%
who would've been a
champion for you right now.

00:18:03.449 --> 00:18:04.249 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: I know.

00:18:04.249 --> 00:18:04.817 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Had he been alive.

00:18:04.817 --> 00:18:06.151 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: I know.

00:18:06.151 --> 00:18:07.419 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: Tell me about the
Brazilian case you're work --

00:18:07.419 --> 00:18:08.821 align:middle line:90%
you're looking at.

00:18:08.821 --> 00:18:14.727 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: Okay, so I've had to
kind of convince my co-producers

00:18:14.727 --> 00:18:17.129 align:middle line:84%
with each -- with each
and every case, you know.

00:18:17.129 --> 00:18:20.165 align:middle line:84%
And I've been kind of going
for the close encounters

00:18:20.165 --> 00:18:22.501 align:middle line:84%
of the third kind, so I'm
pushing the envelope for me...

00:18:22.501 --> 00:18:23.469 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Yeah.

00:18:23.469 --> 00:18:24.470 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: ...with this
film, you know,

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:25.738 align:middle line:84%
because we've got
this Socorro case,

00:18:25.738 --> 00:18:28.507 align:middle line:84%
we've got the Rua
case -- unbelievable case.

00:18:28.507 --> 00:18:30.376 align:middle line:84%
And then we've got
the Virginia case.

00:18:30.376 --> 00:18:32.511 align:middle line:84%
And I remember a couple
of years ago I was invited

00:18:32.511 --> 00:18:35.614 align:middle line:84%
by a guy named A. J. Javard
-- J. Avard, no A. J. --

00:18:35.614 --> 00:18:38.651 align:middle line:84%
he invites me to do a speaking
engagement in South America

00:18:38.651 --> 00:18:41.620 align:middle line:84%
in a place called
-- I'll think of it

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:43.422 align:middle line:90%
in a second, but it's really...

00:18:43.422 --> 00:18:45.691 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: And they're fascinated
with UFO cases down there.

00:18:45.691 --> 00:18:47.092 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: ...yes, absolutely.

00:18:47.092 --> 00:18:49.862 align:middle line:84%
We flew into -- we flew into Sap
Paulo and then I took a drive --

00:18:49.862 --> 00:18:51.130 align:middle line:84%
there was like a three
hour drive south --

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:52.698 align:middle line:84%
and the name will come to
me and I'll tell you what.

00:18:52.698 --> 00:18:55.134 align:middle line:84%
But any case, so I'm about
to go on this trip and I talk

00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:56.368 align:middle line:84%
to a friend of mine, Jeff
Sigansky,

00:18:56.368 --> 00:18:58.337 align:middle line:84%
he was former head
of Tri-Star Pictures.

00:18:58.337 --> 00:18:59.972 align:middle line:90%
And he's always been a really...

00:18:59.972 --> 00:19:00.839 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: He's into this?

00:19:00.839 --> 00:19:01.874 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: ...he's totally into it

00:19:01.874 --> 00:19:03.475 align:middle line:84%
and he's helped me
distribute my films.

00:19:03.475 --> 00:19:05.644 align:middle line:84%
People have often asked,
"How have you done it,

00:19:05.644 --> 00:19:08.080 align:middle line:84%
independent productions and
not had one frame change

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.282 align:middle line:84%
for History channel,
for the Sci-fi channel,

00:19:10.282 --> 00:19:11.550 align:middle line:90%
for Discovery channel?"

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:12.918 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Well,
I've been really lucky,

00:19:12.918 --> 00:19:15.354 align:middle line:84%
but I've also had this guy Jeff
Sigansky, he was really high

00:19:15.354 --> 00:19:17.856 align:middle line:84%
up on the food chain in
the entertainment industry

00:19:17.856 --> 00:19:19.892 align:middle line:84%
and he's been a real
big fan of mine

00:19:19.892 --> 00:19:23.162 align:middle line:84%
and he's been very influential
in getting these execs

00:19:23.162 --> 00:19:25.431 align:middle line:84%
to put my stuff on
television untouched.

00:19:25.431 --> 00:19:27.032 align:middle line:90%
So I've been very fortunate."

00:19:27.032 --> 00:19:28.334 align:middle line:84%
Thank you Jeff, if
you're listening.

00:19:28.334 --> 00:19:31.170 align:middle line:84%
But Jeff said, "You know,
you really need to look

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:32.771 align:middle line:90%
into this Virginia UFO incident.

00:19:32.771 --> 00:19:33.739 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: He brought that up?

00:19:33.739 --> 00:19:35.007 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: He did.

00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:36.642 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "You know, I
heard a little bit about that.

00:19:36.642 --> 00:19:38.610 align:middle line:84%
Tell me some more
about that case, Jeff."

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:42.147 align:middle line:84%
Jeff's a very level headed,
very bright man, Harvard grad,

00:19:42.147 --> 00:19:44.283 align:middle line:84%
business school,
very successful,

00:19:44.283 --> 00:19:45.417 align:middle line:84%
former head of Tri-Star
Pictures.

00:19:45.417 --> 00:19:46.785 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: But you
wouldn't think...

00:19:46.785 --> 00:19:48.353 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: You wouldn't
he'd be into this.

00:19:48.353 --> 00:19:52.458 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Well, what's
that case where you had the --

00:19:52.458 --> 00:19:54.126 align:middle line:90%
you had a crash of a UFO

00:19:54.126 --> 00:19:55.227 align:middle line:84%
and then you had the
occupants wandering

00:19:55.227 --> 00:19:56.061 align:middle line:90%
around town in broad daylight?"

00:19:56.061 --> 00:19:58.397 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "Come on.

00:19:58.397 --> 00:19:59.965 align:middle line:84%
Jeff, this is really
farfetched."

00:19:59.965 --> 00:20:00.933 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: That's right.

00:20:00.933 --> 00:20:02.067 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: He goes, "No,
I'm telling you.

00:20:02.067 --> 00:20:03.202 align:middle line:84%
I really think there's
something to this case."

00:20:03.202 --> 00:20:05.671 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Jeff, really,
don't waste my time."

00:20:05.671 --> 00:20:07.806 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Please,
just please look

00:20:07.806 --> 00:20:08.607 align:middle line:90%
into it while you're there.

00:20:08.607 --> 00:20:09.808 align:middle line:90%
I just really want to know."

00:20:09.808 --> 00:20:11.343 align:middle line:90%
So I said, "All right..."

00:20:11.343 --> 00:20:12.611 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Favor to him, right.

00:20:12.611 --> 00:20:13.812 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: ...I said, "As a favor
to you, I'll look into it,

00:20:13.812 --> 00:20:16.715 align:middle line:84%
but Jesus this is going to
be an utter waste of time.

00:20:16.715 --> 00:20:19.952 align:middle line:84%
Clearly there wasn't a UFO
crash and live aliens wandering

00:20:19.952 --> 00:20:21.653 align:middle line:90%
through this town in Virginia."

00:20:21.653 --> 00:20:22.988 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: Looking
for the local bar.

00:20:22.988 --> 00:20:24.356 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox:. I was convinced,

00:20:24.356 --> 00:20:27.593 align:middle line:84%
I just thought the whole thing
was just way out -- no way.

00:20:27.593 --> 00:20:31.029 align:middle line:84%
Well, I went to South
America and I met with some

00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:33.766 align:middle line:84%
of the witnesses and I met
with people who knew some

00:20:33.766 --> 00:20:35.501 align:middle line:90%
of the witnesses and I must say,

00:20:35.501 --> 00:20:39.505 align:middle line:84%
I came back from that
initial report going, "Hmm,

00:20:39.505 --> 00:20:41.607 align:middle line:90%
maybe this really did happen."

00:20:41.607 --> 00:20:46.044 align:middle line:84%
I was really -- and actually
my girlfriend at the time

00:20:46.044 --> 00:20:47.746 align:middle line:90%
and who's now my fiance...

00:20:47.746 --> 00:20:48.781 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Congratulations.

00:20:48.781 --> 00:20:50.115 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: Thank you.

00:20:50.115 --> 00:20:52.451 align:middle line:84%
Rebecca, she's not really
into the UFO phenomena at all,

00:20:52.451 --> 00:20:55.954 align:middle line:84%
but she was very, very --
and I knew if she was very,

00:20:55.954 --> 00:20:57.856 align:middle line:90%
very interested -- she thought,

00:20:57.856 --> 00:20:59.358 align:middle line:84%
wow maybe this really
did happen.

00:20:59.358 --> 00:21:02.027 align:middle line:84%
Then I went back a second time
with  National Geographic

00:21:02.027 --> 00:21:05.097 align:middle line:84%
and we got access to some
of the primary witnesses,

00:21:05.097 --> 00:21:08.033 align:middle line:84%
the first hand witnesses that
saw the creatures and looking

00:21:08.033 --> 00:21:11.270 align:middle line:84%
into these women's eyes
and going to location

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:13.605 align:middle line:84%
where it happened and
seeing their reaction

00:21:13.605 --> 00:21:16.375 align:middle line:84%
and seeing their reluctance to
come forward and talk about it

00:21:16.375 --> 00:21:18.377 align:middle line:84%
and hearing their mother
say that the Air Force came

00:21:18.377 --> 00:21:20.279 align:middle line:84%
to the house or the
military came to the house

00:21:20.279 --> 00:21:21.647 align:middle line:84%
and told them not
to talk about it.

00:21:21.647 --> 00:21:23.582 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, but offered
them a large sum of money

00:21:23.582 --> 00:21:24.716 align:middle line:90%
to recant their story...

00:21:24.716 --> 00:21:25.417 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: They did.

00:21:25.417 --> 00:21:26.652 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: Yes, they did.

00:21:26.652 --> 00:21:29.655 align:middle line:84%
And they never said E.T.
These girls thought they saw

00:21:29.655 --> 00:21:30.289 align:middle line:90%
the devil.

00:21:30.289 --> 00:21:30.989 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know.

00:21:30.989 --> 00:21:32.057 align:middle line:90%
They didn't see it...

00:21:32.057 --> 00:21:33.425 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: They didn't
know what they were.

00:21:33.425 --> 00:21:34.459 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: ...they didn't see a
craft crash and aliens get out.

00:21:34.459 --> 00:21:35.861 align:middle line:90%
Fine, there were other --

00:21:35.861 --> 00:21:38.697 align:middle line:84%
there was evidence surrounding
the area, surrounding the case

00:21:38.697 --> 00:21:40.499 align:middle line:84%
and if you listen to any
one particular testimony,

00:21:40.499 --> 00:21:42.201 align:middle line:90%
you might think kind of patchy,

00:21:42.201 --> 00:21:43.469 align:middle line:84%
but when you put
it all together --

00:21:43.469 --> 00:21:47.573 align:middle line:84%
a UFO crashed and there were
occupants that survived.

00:21:47.573 --> 00:21:48.607 align:middle line:90%
And those occupants walked

00:21:48.607 --> 00:21:50.309 align:middle line:84%
through the town
and got captured.

00:21:50.309 --> 00:21:51.677 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Where are they now?

00:21:51.677 --> 00:21:53.912 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: Well, apparently -- I
went to one of the hospitals

00:21:53.912 --> 00:21:55.681 align:middle line:84%
where they were taken
and then --

00:21:55.681 --> 00:21:57.282 align:middle line:90%
and there was also another one,

00:21:57.282 --> 00:21:59.718 align:middle line:90%
Officer Sharizy who military --

00:21:59.718 --> 00:22:03.956 align:middle line:84%
he was a military police
officer -- Carlos --

00:22:03.956 --> 00:22:05.891 align:middle line:84%
Marcos Sharizy, I
think his name was.

00:22:05.891 --> 00:22:07.426 align:middle line:84%
And he apparently handled
one of these creatures.

00:22:07.426 --> 00:22:11.763 align:middle line:84%
Now he didn't know E.T. His
orders were something got loose

00:22:11.763 --> 00:22:12.698 align:middle line:90%
or something's out there...

00:22:12.698 --> 00:22:13.899 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: Like an
animal, whatever.

00:22:13.899 --> 00:22:15.734 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: ...something really
strange, if you see it,

00:22:15.734 --> 00:22:17.135 align:middle line:84%
capture it, bring it
back to -- you know.

00:22:17.135 --> 00:22:19.371 align:middle line:84%
And he did capture it
with his bare hands

00:22:19.371 --> 00:22:21.306 align:middle line:84%
and he got an infection
and died.

00:22:21.306 --> 00:22:22.641 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Really?

00:22:22.641 --> 00:22:23.909 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: So, we're in touch with
his sister, we're in touch

00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:25.911 align:middle line:84%
with other family members
and friends of his family.

00:22:25.911 --> 00:22:29.214 align:middle line:84%
We're in touch with the primary
witnesses that saw the creature.

00:22:29.214 --> 00:22:30.949 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: What did these
creatures look like?

00:22:30.949 --> 00:22:33.719 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: Spindly arms
and legs, big head...

00:22:33.719 --> 00:22:35.254 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Like lizardy?

00:22:35.254 --> 00:22:39.124 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: ...oily skin like that
of -- they said like an organ,

00:22:39.124 --> 00:22:40.726 align:middle line:90%
like a liver, or a kidney --

00:22:40.726 --> 00:22:42.661 align:middle line:84%
that kind of oily and that
kind of material...

00:22:42.661 --> 00:22:44.096 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: So a different
kind of race?

00:22:44.096 --> 00:22:47.699 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: ...no hair, very
large eyes, slits for mouths.

00:22:47.699 --> 00:22:49.434 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: Well, maybe
the grays type.

00:22:49.434 --> 00:22:53.538 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: Yeah, but oily
skin and big red eyes

00:22:53.538 --> 00:22:55.274 align:middle line:90%
and ridges on the forehead.

00:22:55.274 --> 00:22:56.642 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know why...

00:22:56.642 --> 00:22:58.577 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: Oh, and that's why they
thought they were the devil.

00:22:58.577 --> 00:22:59.578 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: That's why they
thought they were the devil

00:22:59.578 --> 00:23:00.512 align:middle line:84%
and then I don't
know what kind of...

00:23:00.512 --> 00:23:01.847 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: Sounds like a
reptilian.

00:23:01.847 --> 00:23:04.917 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: ...they were feeble,
they were non-threatening,

00:23:04.917 --> 00:23:06.285 align:middle line:84%
they were barely
keeping it together.

00:23:06.285 --> 00:23:08.053 align:middle line:84%
I mean, apparently they
were kind of slouched over

00:23:08.053 --> 00:23:09.988 align:middle line:84%
and they did get eye
contact with these girls.

00:23:09.988 --> 00:23:11.323 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Okay.

00:23:11.323 --> 00:23:12.457 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: And they were -- and
when the girls were running,

00:23:12.457 --> 00:23:14.126 align:middle line:84%
they told me this, from
their mouths to my ears,

00:23:14.126 --> 00:23:15.894 align:middle line:84%
when they were running
away screaming,

00:23:15.894 --> 00:23:17.696 align:middle line:84%
there were some construction
workers on the building

00:23:17.696 --> 00:23:19.731 align:middle line:84%
and the construction
workers yelled out,

00:23:19.731 --> 00:23:22.334 align:middle line:84%
"They must of seen the same
creatures we just saw."

00:23:22.334 --> 00:23:23.936 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so there were a
lot of people in the town

00:23:23.936 --> 00:23:26.471 align:middle line:84%
and then I went to
the town center.

00:23:26.471 --> 00:23:27.472 align:middle line:90%
You know like the town center,

00:23:27.472 --> 00:23:28.607 align:middle line:84%
the little area where
everybody goes?

00:23:28.607 --> 00:23:29.841 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Yeah.

00:23:29.841 --> 00:23:31.043 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: Has coffee, hangs
out, plays cards, dominoes,

00:23:31.043 --> 00:23:31.910 align:middle line:90%
whatever they're doing.

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:33.245 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: People remember this?

00:23:33.245 --> 00:23:34.579 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: It was 1996.

00:23:34.579 --> 00:23:36.448 align:middle line:84%
So I went around and I just
started asking random people

00:23:36.448 --> 00:23:40.152 align:middle line:84%
and just about everyone in that
town had a friend or a neighbor

00:23:40.152 --> 00:23:42.854 align:middle line:84%
or a cousin or somebody that
was involved with the case.

00:23:42.854 --> 00:23:44.957 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: So, where are the
bodies to these beings?

00:23:44.957 --> 00:23:46.825 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: Well, I understand
that one of them went --

00:23:46.825 --> 00:23:48.327 align:middle line:90%
was kept in Brazil and I --

00:23:48.327 --> 00:23:49.861 align:middle line:84%
from what I understand
and what I've been told

00:23:49.861 --> 00:23:52.064 align:middle line:84%
and I don't have complete
100% confirmation --

00:23:52.064 --> 00:23:54.333 align:middle line:90%
the Americans got one, too.

00:23:54.333 --> 00:23:55.467 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Wow!

00:23:55.467 --> 00:23:56.668 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: Yeah, I know.

00:23:56.668 --> 00:23:58.603 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: This was a
crashed craft that they saw?

00:23:58.603 --> 00:23:59.371 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: A crashed craft, yeah.

00:23:59.371 --> 00:24:00.305 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: So where's that?

00:24:00.305 --> 00:24:01.139 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: We're going
to interview...

00:24:01.139 --> 00:24:02.474 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Somebody's got that.

00:24:02.474 --> 00:24:04.042 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: ...well, you know, I
haven't been to the crash --

00:24:04.042 --> 00:24:07.112 align:middle line:84%
I haven't been to the exact
crash site, but I'm going

00:24:07.112 --> 00:24:10.615 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know when this
is going to be broadcast,

00:24:10.615 --> 00:24:15.620 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going in the end of
November 2013, early December

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:16.755 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to be
going to the town

00:24:16.755 --> 00:24:19.291 align:middle line:84%
with a very low profile
camera crew.

00:24:19.291 --> 00:24:22.661 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go meet with the
farmers who saw this thing crash

00:24:22.661 --> 00:24:25.397 align:middle line:84%
or saw it wobbly and
looking in distress.

00:24:25.397 --> 00:24:26.098 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Wobbly.

00:24:26.098 --> 00:24:27.099 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: And going down.

00:24:27.099 --> 00:24:28.500 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: And the occupants.

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:29.901 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: And then we're meeting
the people -- the occupants --

00:24:29.901 --> 00:24:32.637 align:middle line:84%
we're meeting with members of
the military officer who died

00:24:32.637 --> 00:24:34.373 align:middle line:84%
after handling one
of these creatures

00:24:34.373 --> 00:24:35.641 align:middle line:90%
and who knows what else we're...

00:24:35.641 --> 00:24:36.341 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: How soon did he die?

00:24:36.341 --> 00:24:37.075 align:middle line:90%
Pretty quickly?

00:24:37.075 --> 00:24:38.677 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: A couple weeks.

00:24:38.677 --> 00:24:39.878 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, he got some
-- he had immune...

00:24:39.878 --> 00:24:40.879 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Just like that.

00:24:40.879 --> 00:24:41.947 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: ...immune
deficiency breakdown,

00:24:41.947 --> 00:24:43.782 align:middle line:84%
he had this oily stuff
all over his skin.

00:24:43.782 --> 00:24:46.351 align:middle line:84%
He kept putting rubbing
alcohol on his skin, saying...

00:24:46.351 --> 00:24:47.753 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Wow!

00:24:47.753 --> 00:24:49.921 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: ...I got this stuff all
over me and -- yeah, he died.

00:24:49.921 --> 00:24:51.356 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: And that's documented?

00:24:51.356 --> 00:24:52.224 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: Oh, absolutely.

00:24:52.224 --> 00:24:53.291 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Everything?

00:24:53.291 --> 00:24:53.792 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: Oh, we have
the death certificate.

00:24:53.792 --> 00:24:54.893 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:24:54.893 --> 00:24:56.061 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: And how he
died, some kind of...

00:24:56.061 --> 00:24:57.329 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: He died of
immune deficiency --

00:24:57.329 --> 00:24:59.164 align:middle line:84%
basically his immune
system shut down.

00:24:59.164 --> 00:25:03.035 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: This is
a bizarre story.

00:25:03.035 --> 00:25:04.903 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: It's a very
bizarre story and you know,

00:25:04.903 --> 00:25:06.872 align:middle line:84%
the military surrounded
the entire town

00:25:06.872 --> 00:25:08.273 align:middle line:84%
because these creatures
were on the loose.

00:25:08.273 --> 00:25:09.941 align:middle line:90%
So everyone was there, saw that.

00:25:09.941 --> 00:25:11.376 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: What would
possess the creatures

00:25:11.376 --> 00:25:14.413 align:middle line:90%
to go wandering into the town?

00:25:14.413 --> 00:25:15.414 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: Your guess...

00:25:15.414 --> 00:25:16.481 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: What were
they looking for?

00:25:16.481 --> 00:25:17.182 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: ...your guess
is as good as mine.

00:25:17.182 --> 00:25:18.250 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I don't know.

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:20.252 align:middle line:84%
What would you do if
you crashed on a --

00:25:20.252 --> 00:25:23.021 align:middle line:84%
on a planet somewhere
far, far away.

00:25:23.021 --> 00:25:24.089 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: I don't
know what I'd do.

00:25:24.089 --> 00:25:25.223 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: I don't know
what I'd do either.

00:25:25.223 --> 00:25:26.591 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: I'm not sure
I'd walk into the city.

00:25:26.591 --> 00:25:27.292 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: Yeah, that's...

00:25:27.292 --> 00:25:28.527 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Hi folks.

00:25:28.527 --> 00:25:30.562 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: Well, they were
hiding in an adjacent field.

00:25:30.562 --> 00:25:33.131 align:middle line:84%
But you know, I don't
know -- they were feeble,

00:25:33.131 --> 00:25:34.566 align:middle line:90%
they were easy to capture.

00:25:34.566 --> 00:25:36.635 align:middle line:84%
The girls said they
were non-threatening,

00:25:36.635 --> 00:25:38.103 align:middle line:84%
that one of them was
kind of slumped over

00:25:38.103 --> 00:25:40.305 align:middle line:84%
and looked them right in the
eyes and one of the women --

00:25:40.305 --> 00:25:42.074 align:middle line:84%
these women were traumatized
by this whole thing.

00:25:42.074 --> 00:25:43.408 align:middle line:84%
And like I said,
they never said E.T.,

00:25:43.408 --> 00:25:44.743 align:middle line:84%
but when you put the
pieces together --

00:25:44.743 --> 00:25:46.144 align:middle line:84%
the pieces of the
puzzle together,

00:25:46.144 --> 00:25:49.648 align:middle line:84%
you see that a crash happened
and that the bodies...

00:25:49.648 --> 00:25:52.451 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: Well, and also
the pieces of the puzzle

00:25:52.451 --> 00:25:54.519 align:middle line:84%
as I've picked up from
you in just talking

00:25:54.519 --> 00:25:56.855 align:middle line:90%
about 701 the documentary.

00:25:56.855 --> 00:25:58.223 align:middle line:90%
Something's going on.

00:25:58.223 --> 00:26:02.561 align:middle line:84%
There's no doubt at all that
people are seeing these things,

00:26:02.561 --> 00:26:05.297 align:middle line:90%
E.T.'s, something's happening.

00:26:05.297 --> 00:26:08.834 align:middle line:84%
Steven Spielberg has done
a couple of great movies

00:26:08.834 --> 00:26:12.437 align:middle line:84%
about extraterrestrials off a
Hynix book,  Close Encounters

00:26:12.437 --> 00:26:16.374 align:middle line:84%
of The Third Kind  and then
E.T. The Extraterrestrial .

00:26:16.374 --> 00:26:19.478 align:middle line:84%
Ever have a chance to talk to
him or get his views on this?

00:26:19.478 --> 00:26:21.680 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: Well, funny you
should say that actually,

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.448 align:middle line:84%
because I've been
trying to contact --

00:26:23.448 --> 00:26:27.219 align:middle line:84%
okay, I've contacted presidents.
I've gotten Jimmy Carter

00:26:27.219 --> 00:26:28.687 align:middle line:84%
on camera briefly
at a book signing...

00:26:28.687 --> 00:26:29.621 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: He saw something.

00:26:29.621 --> 00:26:30.489 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: ...yeah, he did.

00:26:30.489 --> 00:26:32.057 align:middle line:90%
I managed to get a phone --

00:26:32.057 --> 00:26:34.159 align:middle line:84%
a brief phone interview
with President Ford.

00:26:34.159 --> 00:26:36.595 align:middle line:84%
I got a statement from
President Clinton's office,

00:26:36.595 --> 00:26:38.196 align:middle line:84%
actually when I --
during 1999...

00:26:38.196 --> 00:26:39.531 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: Reagan was
interested in this?

00:26:39.531 --> 00:26:40.799 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: ...Reagan was interested,
but I didn't have access.

00:26:40.799 --> 00:26:42.734 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't get a hold
of Steven Spielberg

00:26:42.734 --> 00:26:43.768 align:middle line:90%
if my life depended on it.

00:26:43.768 --> 00:26:45.904 align:middle line:90%
I tried for 20, nearly 20 years.

00:26:45.904 --> 00:26:51.042 align:middle line:84%
Finally, at the end of  I
Know What I Saw  production,

00:26:51.042 --> 00:26:56.281 align:middle line:84%
Larry King said, "Why don't I
take your film and hand it off

00:26:56.281 --> 00:26:58.817 align:middle line:84%
to Spielberg and see
if he responds to me?"

00:26:58.817 --> 00:27:01.186 align:middle line:90%
So I said, "Great."

00:27:01.186 --> 00:27:03.054 align:middle line:84%
You know, talk about having
friends in high places.

00:27:03.054 --> 00:27:03.688 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Because he knew him.

00:27:03.688 --> 00:27:04.723 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: Yes he did.

00:27:04.723 --> 00:27:05.624 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: He even got
a letter from him.

00:27:05.624 --> 00:27:06.858 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: From his office.

00:27:06.858 --> 00:27:09.528 align:middle line:84%
So Larry took my film, which
wasn't totally complete

00:27:09.528 --> 00:27:12.164 align:middle line:84%
at the time,  I Know What
I Saw , he sent it off

00:27:12.164 --> 00:27:14.566 align:middle line:84%
to Steven Spielberg and
said, "Hey, check this out.

00:27:14.566 --> 00:27:16.101 align:middle line:84%
This is the real life
Close Encounters."

00:27:16.101 --> 00:27:16.935 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Yeah.

00:27:16.935 --> 00:27:18.136 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: So Spielberg watched it

00:27:18.136 --> 00:27:19.471 align:middle line:84%
and I get a phone call,
it's really funny.

00:27:19.471 --> 00:27:22.174 align:middle line:84%
At about 10 o'clock in the
morning, I get a phone call

00:27:22.174 --> 00:27:24.075 align:middle line:90%
from CAA, which is their...

00:27:24.075 --> 00:27:26.144 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: A great agency,
they represent me.

00:27:26.144 --> 00:27:26.978 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: ...exactly.

00:27:26.978 --> 00:27:28.880 align:middle line:90%
CAA calls, they said, "Mr. Fox?"

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.148 align:middle line:90%
I said, "Yeah."

00:27:30.148 --> 00:27:32.551 align:middle line:84%
"Steven Spielberg is watching
your movie right now."

00:27:32.551 --> 00:27:33.919 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Really,
how do you know?"

00:27:33.919 --> 00:27:35.954 align:middle line:84%
"Because he took it and he
went into a room by himself

00:27:35.954 --> 00:27:36.755 align:middle line:90%
and he's watching it."

00:27:36.755 --> 00:27:37.556 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: That's impressive.

00:27:37.556 --> 00:27:38.390 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: Yeah, I said, "Wow."

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:39.391 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: That doesn't happen.

00:27:39.391 --> 00:27:41.293 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: So the next
hour and a half --

00:27:41.293 --> 00:27:42.694 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you the
feeling I had.

00:27:42.694 --> 00:27:46.464 align:middle line:84%
I was like, "Steven Spielberg's
watching my movie right now."

00:27:46.464 --> 00:27:49.634 align:middle line:84%
So an hour now, I called
my dad, I was so excited,

00:27:49.634 --> 00:27:50.969 align:middle line:90%
everyone was so excited.

00:27:50.969 --> 00:27:56.074 align:middle line:84%
About an hour and a half later,
I get another phone call.

00:27:56.074 --> 00:27:57.709 align:middle line:90%
And same woman, CAA.

00:27:57.709 --> 00:28:00.612 align:middle line:84%
And she said, "Well, Steven
Spielberg watched your movie."

00:28:00.612 --> 00:28:01.880 align:middle line:90%
I said, "Yeah, and what?"

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:03.348 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: This is unprecedented
that they would call you

00:28:03.348 --> 00:28:04.049 align:middle line:90%
and even tell you that.

00:28:04.049 --> 00:28:05.317 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: Oh yeah, yeah.

00:28:05.317 --> 00:28:06.484 align:middle line:84%
I promise you, everything
I'm telling you is exactly

00:28:06.484 --> 00:28:07.519 align:middle line:90%
as it happened.

00:28:07.519 --> 00:28:09.087 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Okay,
well what happened?"

00:28:09.087 --> 00:28:11.156 align:middle line:84%
She said, "Well I don't
know, he went into his office

00:28:11.156 --> 00:28:13.892 align:middle line:84%
and he wrote a letter to
Larry and sent it to Larry."

00:28:13.892 --> 00:28:14.693 align:middle line:90%
I said...

00:28:14.693 --> 00:28:15.227 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: There's the letter.

00:28:15.227 --> 00:28:16.261 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: Yeah.

00:28:16.261 --> 00:28:17.495 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: We got it
on the screen here.

00:28:17.495 --> 00:28:19.264 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: So you know, I'm
champing at the bit to find

00:28:19.264 --> 00:28:20.398 align:middle line:90%
out what happened, you know.

00:28:20.398 --> 00:28:22.267 align:middle line:84%
So Larry finally gets in
touch with me and says,

00:28:22.267 --> 00:28:23.668 align:middle line:90%
"Hey I got the letter.

00:28:23.668 --> 00:28:25.637 align:middle line:84%
I'll send it to you Fed
Ex from our office."

00:28:25.637 --> 00:28:30.108 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, I live
in a small town.

00:28:30.108 --> 00:28:32.911 align:middle line:84%
The Fed Ex guy knows me and
he's kind of into UFO's.

00:28:32.911 --> 00:28:33.578 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Yeah.

00:28:33.578 --> 00:28:34.646 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: And I live...

00:28:34.646 --> 00:28:35.080 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: And they
all know what you do.

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.181 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:28:36.181 --> 00:28:37.515 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: Yeah, they kind
of, yeah, you know.

00:28:37.515 --> 00:28:40.452 align:middle line:84%
So, the Fed Ex guy knocks on
my door and he goes, "James,

00:28:40.452 --> 00:28:41.786 align:middle line:84%
you're not going
to believe this.

00:28:41.786 --> 00:28:44.456 align:middle line:84%
You got a -- you got a Fed
Ex from Larry King, from CNN,

00:28:44.456 --> 00:28:45.857 align:middle line:90%
from Larry King Live."

00:28:45.857 --> 00:28:49.160 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Yeah, and it's a letter
from Steven Spielberg inside."

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:50.762 align:middle line:84%
And he goes,
"Can you open it now?

00:28:50.762 --> 00:28:51.596 align:middle line:90%
Can I see it?"

00:28:51.596 --> 00:28:52.597 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: He wanted to see it?

00:28:52.597 --> 00:28:53.431 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: Totally.

00:28:53.431 --> 00:28:54.366 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: I love it.

00:28:54.366 --> 00:28:55.333 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: So we sat
there on the side

00:28:55.333 --> 00:28:56.601 align:middle line:84%
of the road ripping
this thing open.

00:28:56.601 --> 00:28:58.069 align:middle line:90%
It was really funny.

00:28:58.069 --> 00:29:01.439 align:middle line:84%
And I read it, so the first
person to of had access

00:29:01.439 --> 00:29:03.942 align:middle line:84%
to that letter outside
of, you know, Larry King

00:29:03.942 --> 00:29:06.244 align:middle line:84%
and Spielberg was myself
and the Fed Ex guy.

00:29:06.244 --> 00:29:07.445 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: That's great.

00:29:07.445 --> 00:29:08.747 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: And he was bubbling
over with excitement.

00:29:08.747 --> 00:29:10.382 align:middle line:90%
So anyway, so I got this letter

00:29:10.382 --> 00:29:14.419 align:middle line:84%
and this was right before
the film was to be released

00:29:14.419 --> 00:29:18.523 align:middle line:84%
and distribution companies, as
well as A&E were like, "Wow,

00:29:18.523 --> 00:29:20.792 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't it be amazing to have
an endorsement like this..."

00:29:20.792 --> 00:29:21.760 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Huge.

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:22.961 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: ...from Steven
Spielberg."

00:29:22.961 --> 00:29:25.130 align:middle line:84%
Just his name and what he
said, compelling right?

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:25.697 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: I love it.

00:29:25.697 --> 00:29:26.264 align:middle line:90%
I looked at it.

00:29:26.264 --> 00:29:27.399 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:29:27.399 --> 00:29:28.767 align:middle line:84%
>>Fox: And you have to
read it very carefully,

00:29:28.767 --> 00:29:30.869 align:middle line:84%
read it very carefully to see
there's actually a statement

00:29:30.869 --> 00:29:34.139 align:middle line:84%
in there that's very, very
interesting, very interesting.

00:29:34.139 --> 00:29:39.444 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, so I contact his --
his office because I, you know,

00:29:39.444 --> 00:29:41.513 align:middle line:84%
I like to -- I don't want
to just release something

00:29:41.513 --> 00:29:44.416 align:middle line:84%
without -- I contact
his office in 2009

00:29:44.416 --> 00:29:48.553 align:middle line:90%
and I said, "Hey Marvin Leavy."

00:29:48.553 --> 00:29:50.055 align:middle line:90%
I said, "This is James Fox.

00:29:50.055 --> 00:29:53.558 align:middle line:84%
I've got a letter from Steven
Spielberg about my movie and I'd

00:29:53.558 --> 00:29:56.795 align:middle line:84%
like to extract a quote from it
and use it to promote my movie"

00:29:56.795 --> 00:30:00.598 align:middle line:84%
"Ooh," he goes, "Oh,
you have a letter.

00:30:00.598 --> 00:30:03.401 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't usually watch
people's... endorse,

00:30:03.401 --> 00:30:04.703 align:middle line:90%
he got kind of nervous, right.

00:30:04.703 --> 00:30:07.272 align:middle line:90%
And my father, the whole time --

00:30:07.272 --> 00:30:09.140 align:middle line:84%
bless his heart,
he died last year.

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:12.477 align:middle line:84%
My father was going, "Well, you
got the quote, just use it."

00:30:12.477 --> 00:30:14.212 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "No, I really got
to get permission, you know."

00:30:14.212 --> 00:30:15.113 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: You could've used it.

00:30:15.113 --> 00:30:16.514 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: I could've, yeah.

00:30:16.514 --> 00:30:19.718 align:middle line:84%
Technically I could've, but I --
so Marvin Leavy said, "You know,

00:30:19.718 --> 00:30:21.252 align:middle line:84%
Steven Spielberg
would really prefer it

00:30:21.252 --> 00:30:22.554 align:middle line:90%
if you didn't use that quote."

00:30:22.554 --> 00:30:23.188 align:middle line:90%
>>Noory: Really?

00:30:23.188 --> 00:30:24.189 align:middle line:90%
>>Fox: Yes.

00:30:24.189 --> 00:30:25.223 align:middle line:84%
>>Noory: James, I
want to thank you

00:30:25.223 --> 00:30:26.358 align:middle line:90%
for being on  Beyond Belief .

00:30:26.358 --> 00:30:28.893 align:middle line:84%
