>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.550 align:middle line:10%
And you know one of the
wonders of this program

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.980 align:middle line:10%
happens to be the
incredible guests that we

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:31.950 align:middle line:10%
bring on this show.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.160 align:middle line:84%
And we've got that
with Jason Louv.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.970 align:middle line:84%
He is the best selling author of
eight books, and that's a lot.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.310 align:middle line:10%
His latest is the
widely acclaimed "John

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.200 align:middle line:10%
Dee and the Empire
of Angels," which

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.960 align:middle line:10%
is a massive chronicle
of how the occult has

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.700 align:middle line:10%
shaped Western civilization.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.965 align:middle line:90%
Jason, welcome to the program.

00:00:47.965 --> 00:00:49.140 align:middle line:90%
>>JASON LOUV: Thank you, George.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.680 align:middle line:90%
It's a big honor to be here.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
get involved in this,

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.280 align:middle line:84%
dabbling in the occult
and writing about it?

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Yes!

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.120 align:middle line:10%
Well, I grew up in the
90s, and it was kind of

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.170 align:middle line:10%
in the air at the time.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.050 align:middle line:10%
But you know, I grew
up like most people,

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.080 align:middle line:10%
being confronted with the
world that we're presented with

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.340 align:middle line:10%
and questioning, is
this the whole story?

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And there must be something
going on behind the scenes.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And of course I think,
like most people

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.510 align:middle line:84%
particularly now,
feeling somewhat

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.060 align:middle line:84%
powerless in the
world, being confronted

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.700 align:middle line:84%
with headlines we
don't fully understand

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.800 align:middle line:84%
and a giant world
situation that is just

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.123 align:middle line:90%
completely overwhelming.

00:01:26.123 --> 00:01:28.040 align:middle line:84%
I think at some point
we all ask in our lives,

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.300 align:middle line:84%
how can I get the
steering wheel, at least

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.450 align:middle line:90%
for my own life?

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.570 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
I was interested in.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.760 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to see what was it
that made some people not just

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.220 align:middle line:84%
special, but somehow
totally break

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.060 align:middle line:84%
the mold of what people think
is possible for human life.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.000 align:middle line:84%
And for that reason,
I started studying

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.170 align:middle line:90%
the occult, first skeptically.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm still skeptical.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.830 align:middle line:84%
But there are certain
people throughout history

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.350 align:middle line:84%
who have just had this
certain something.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.410 align:middle line:84%
They seem more alive
or have had an ability

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.630 align:middle line:90%
to shape reality around them.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And that early interest in
my late teens at the time

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:17.090 align:middle line:84%
was just my way to get out of
my boring high school existence.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.030 align:middle line:84%
That became a lifelong
passion of 20 years

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.370 align:middle line:84%
of going all over
the world, learning

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.450 align:middle line:84%
about every type of
spirituality and esotericism

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.770 align:middle line:90%
and magic that I could.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.480 align:middle line:84%
I went to Nepal
to become trained

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.690 align:middle line:90%
as a shaman in the Himalayas.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:31.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You did?

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Yes.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
pretty interesting.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: It was a trip.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.700 align:middle line:90%


00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.520 align:middle line:84%
I learned Sufism-- I studied
with Sufis, masons, tantra,

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.220 align:middle line:84%
Buddhism, the Western
esoteric tradition.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.250 align:middle line:84%
I tried to study all of
these things in very, very

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.150 align:middle line:90%
quick succession.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.310 align:middle line:84%
And then, I started writing
about it right away.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's become my passion,
my quest for my whole life

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:53.510 align:middle line:90%
in a way.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.980 align:middle line:90%
I almost can't get away from it.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's
everywhere for you.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And the word occult, Jason,
to some people sounds evil.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:00.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Mm-hmm.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.345 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's not, is it?

00:03:02.345 --> 00:03:04.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: Well, occult
just means hidden.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.098 align:middle line:84%
And anything that people
feel is hidden from them--

00:03:09.098 --> 00:03:11.390 align:middle line:84%
it's like when the lights
are off and the room is dark,

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.100 align:middle line:84%
you assume something
is there that's not.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.440 align:middle line:90%
It could be scary.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.130 align:middle line:84%
But really, the goal
of my career but also

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.140 align:middle line:84%
what we've seen certainly
with the internet

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.480 align:middle line:84%
is none of this is
occult anymore, in terms

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.860 align:middle line:90%
of esotericism or spirituality.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:26.910 align:middle line:90%
It's all out in the open.

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.570 align:middle line:84%
You can find all of it online
or in Barnes and Noble.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.110 align:middle line:84%
So I like the word magick,
because it calls attention

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.680 align:middle line:84%
to maybe there's some type
of practice or technique

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.135 align:middle line:84%
which seems to be
magick, or seems to allow

00:03:40.135 --> 00:03:41.260 align:middle line:90%
people to have this effect.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Magick with a "k."

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.360 align:middle line:84%
There's a difference,
isn't there?

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Yes.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's simply
to distinguish magick

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.990 align:middle line:90%
from stage magic.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.130 align:middle line:84%
I always say that stage
magic, my definition,

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.410 align:middle line:84%
is somebody who
produces illusions.

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.950 align:middle line:84%
But a real magician is someone
who takes illusions away,

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.680 align:middle line:84%
who removes illusions
from your eyes

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.460 align:middle line:84%
so that you can see the writing
on the walls of eternity,

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.720 align:middle line:84%
or you can see what's really
going on in the world.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.270 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I strive to do.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the
history of magick, Jason?

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:19.160 align:middle line:10%
>>LOUV: Well, it goes back to
the beginnings of humanity.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.070 align:middle line:90%
It's always been with us.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.783 align:middle line:84%
If you look at any
culture in the world, now

00:04:24.783 --> 00:04:26.450 align:middle line:84%
or at any other time
in history, there's

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.010 align:middle line:84%
always been a component
where they have struggled

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.590 align:middle line:84%
to understand not just
the visible material

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.450 align:middle line:90%
world, but the invisible.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:36.720 align:middle line:90%
Why do things happen?

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.520 align:middle line:90%
Is it karma?

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.320 align:middle line:90%
Is it fate?

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.490 align:middle line:90%
Can it be influenced?

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.040 align:middle line:84%
If we propitiate certain gods,
if we make the gods happy,

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.800 align:middle line:90%
will things go well for us?

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.020 align:middle line:84%
That's been basically the
primary occupation of humanity

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.820 align:middle line:90%
for all of its history.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And we have this
idea now that we

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.280 align:middle line:84%
live in a rational, scientific,
materialist world, which

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.660 align:middle line:90%
is really a Victorian idea.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.270 align:middle line:90%


00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.550 align:middle line:84%
You and I both know
it's like nobody really

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.220 align:middle line:90%
feels that way fully anymore.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.150 align:middle line:84%
We live in a world that is
quickly becoming re-enchanted,

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.510 align:middle line:90%
at least by technology.

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.640 align:middle line:84%
We live in a world where even
the phones in our pockets

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.675 align:middle line:84%
telepathically connect us to
everyone in the world 24/7.

00:05:19.675 --> 00:05:20.475 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Instantly.

00:05:20.475 --> 00:05:21.105 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Instantly.

00:05:21.105 --> 00:05:22.022 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's amazing.

00:05:22.022 --> 00:05:24.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: Or you can touch
it, and the Amazon genie

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:25.860 align:middle line:90%
will deliver whatever you want.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you imagine sending
a picture from me to you?

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.440 align:middle line:90%
You could be 1,000 miles away.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.610 align:middle line:84%
But in an instant, you will get
that picture I just sent you.

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just
tremendous technology.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.500 align:middle line:90%
You could call that magick.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:40.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: And you can.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.930 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting
that if you go back

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.220 align:middle line:84%
and you read these theosophical
books, or grimoires,

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.470 align:middle line:84%
or magickal books
from 100 years ago,

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.380 align:middle line:84%
what they're talking about
sounds like modern technology

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.090 align:middle line:84%
and is dwarfed, in fact,
by modern technology.

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.310 align:middle line:84%
So I think that whether
one believes in "magick"

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.520 align:middle line:84%
or not, it's actually turns out
to be a really good metaphor

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.070 align:middle line:84%
for understanding the world
that we're living in right now--

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.190 align:middle line:84%
where anyone can cast
their will into the world

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:10.350 align:middle line:84%
by creating their
online platform,

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.230 align:middle line:84%
where we're all connected
telepathically, where we live

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:17.430 align:middle line:84%
in a world that is not dominated
by the forces of material

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.310 align:middle line:84%
production in the physical world
but by thought patterns that

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.190 align:middle line:84%
are cast out into
the online world.

>>NOORY: In modern history,
Jason, who would you say

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.850 align:middle line:84%
may have been the most
influential person

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.030 align:middle line:90%

most influential

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:37.955 align:middle line:90%
has to be Aleister Crowley.

00:06:37.955 --> 00:06:39.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't know whether
he is the best

about Aleister Crowley.

simple words represent the path

to enlightenment.

the wickedest man in the world,
and the man we'd like to hang.

00:07:15.312 --> 00:07:20.020 align:middle line:10%
>>: Alister Crowley
as an amazing figure,

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:24.110 align:middle line:10%
and the things that he's
done are interesting.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:28.330 align:middle line:10%
They're scary,
they're controversial.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.630 align:middle line:10%
You don't need to rely on the
exaggerations of the tabloids

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:33.010 align:middle line:10%
to tell an interesting story.

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:36.550 align:middle line:10%
>>: And he wanted to experiment
also with things that were

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:41.251 align:middle line:10%
considered as
illegitimate or forbidden.

00:07:41.251 --> 00:07:43.750 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: His admirers
saw him as the prophet

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:49.240 align:middle line:10%
of a new age, master of the
mystic arts, poet of liberty.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:54.300 align:middle line:10%
>>: The gods had chosen
Crowley to be the prophet.

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And Crowley was just
the guy who had an ego

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:01.005 align:middle line:90%
to say I can handle that.

00:08:01.005 --> 00:08:05.957 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: By any standards,
Aleister Crowley is an enigma.

00:08:05.957 --> 00:08:07.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jason, why was
he so controversial?

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:09.528 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: It's
because he did this.

00:08:09.528 --> 00:08:11.820 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you ever do this
people kind of freak out.

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's like a
devil horn, isn't it?

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:14.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Yeah.

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:14.940 align:middle line:90%
I always do this.

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:16.963 align:middle line:84%
I'm the great cuddly
beast, not the great beast.

00:08:16.963 --> 00:08:18.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But he
was controversial.

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:20.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people hated
the guy, generally.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: He was
pretty controversial.

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:23.380 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.700 align:middle line:84%
I think that people probably
have a much better context

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:26.500 align:middle line:90%
for that now.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.960 align:middle line:84%
Crowley was, by anyone's
standards, I think a genius--

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.600 align:middle line:84%
extremely intelligent,
extremely well educated,

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.760 align:middle line:84%
representative of the
British upper middle class.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:35.785 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was he bizarre?

00:08:35.785 --> 00:08:37.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: You could
say that, yeah.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:38.090 align:middle line:90%
He was extremely odd.

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:44.960 align:middle line:84%
But he's probably
the most exhaustive

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.510 align:middle line:84%
and the best writer on at
least the Western magickal

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:48.980 align:middle line:90%
tradition ever.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.770 align:middle line:84%
He's also the person that,
at least for the public,

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:55.730 align:middle line:84%
began to merge eastern
techniques like yoga and tantra

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:58.400 align:middle line:84%
with Western techniques like
Kabbalah, which is a huge deal

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.010 align:middle line:90%
and can't be underestimated.

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:02.750 align:middle line:84%
But he was very,
very good at playing

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:04.400 align:middle line:90%
the press for attention.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.855 align:middle line:90%
He knew how to--

00:09:06.855 --> 00:09:08.105 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Manipulate the media?

00:09:08.105 --> 00:09:08.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Exactly.

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:11.550 align:middle line:84%
He was very ahead
of his time in that.

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.047 align:middle line:84%
And he was very
ahead of his time,

00:09:13.047 --> 00:09:14.630 align:middle line:84%
and he lived a life
that was very much

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:19.700 align:middle line:84%
like 1960s or 70s rock
hedonists, but in the 20s.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:20.750 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And like them, he was good at
creating a larger than life

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:24.890 align:middle line:90%
image.

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:26.932 align:middle line:84%
And I think he realized
that if he turned himself

00:09:26.932 --> 00:09:29.750 align:middle line:84%
into this figure
of the devil, which

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:31.665 align:middle line:84%
he did by manipulating
the press,

00:09:31.665 --> 00:09:33.290 align:middle line:84%
that people would
pay attention to him.

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:34.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So he
enjoyed doing that?

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Oh, absolutely.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:35.615 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: By design.

00:09:35.615 --> 00:09:37.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: And I think
it was successful,

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:43.550 align:middle line:84%
although it leaves the
not very particularly

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:46.190 align:middle line:84%
constructive, long term
association of magick

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:48.570 align:middle line:90%
with sinister forces.

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:51.200 align:middle line:90%
But he was a great PR guy.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:56.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was he not as well
liked as that little clip just

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.120 align:middle line:90%
depicted?

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: At the time?

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:00.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.550 align:middle line:90%
Was he hated?

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:04.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: Certainly prior to World
War I and then World War II.

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.550 align:middle line:84%
He was like a guy that the
English tabloid press loved

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:09.230 align:middle line:90%
to pick on as the boogey man.

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:11.690 align:middle line:90%
And he was not well liked.

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:15.360 align:middle line:84%
He was also acting against a
repressive Christian society

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.160 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.590 align:middle line:84%
He'd been brought up as a
fundamentalist Christian.

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:20.450 align:middle line:84%
So he was kind of
acting out in that way

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:23.780 align:middle line:90%
throughout his adult life.

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:26.780 align:middle line:84%
I think among the
intelligentsia,

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:31.610 align:middle line:84%
he had quite a few admirers,
although he was the personality

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:32.805 align:middle line:90%
that wouldn't last too long.

00:10:32.805 --> 00:10:35.180 align:middle line:84%
I think after a few years,
people would get tired of him.

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:36.845 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But he did
have a following.

00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:37.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: A small one.

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:41.100 align:middle line:84%
But his following
now dwarfs anything

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.350 align:middle line:90%
that happened in his lifetime.

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:46.290 align:middle line:84%
He maybe had a dozen people
around him at any given time.

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:50.600 align:middle line:84%
So he's become a symbol,
which is actually

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.990 align:middle line:84%
not only a testament to his
PR, but it's fascinating

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:56.000 align:middle line:84%
because people see
the symbol first.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And they see him as a
symbol of rebellion.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.380 align:middle line:84%
But then they sit down and
actually read his work,

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:05.270 align:middle line:84%
and what you find is this
tremendously encyclopedic,

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:11.150 align:middle line:84%
almost rigidly disciplinarian
structure for doing magick,

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:13.790 align:middle line:84%
and yoga, and meditation,
and seeking enlightenment

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:18.270 align:middle line:84%
that I think is the best
structured curriculum

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:25.550 align:middle line:84%
and the most deeply
comprehensive take

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:27.660 align:middle line:84%
on that subject that's
probably ever existed.

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:29.420 align:middle line:84%
It's got lots of
baggage with it as well.

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could you call
him a genius, Jason?

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:33.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: You could, you know?

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:33.560 align:middle line:90%
You could.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:34.400 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.150 align:middle line:90%
Now, was he an evil genius?

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:37.150 align:middle line:90%
That's another question.

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:39.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you have
liked to have met him?

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: I don't know.

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:41.420 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:47.090 align:middle line:84%
I think that he didn't treat
the people around him very well.

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:48.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:49.370 align:middle line:90%
No respect for others?

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:52.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: He liked to borrow
money and not pay it back.

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:55.730 align:middle line:84%
He lived off the
largesse of his followers

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:57.942 align:middle line:90%
towards the end of his life.

00:11:57.942 --> 00:11:59.900 align:middle line:84%
I would have liked to
meet him, but I certainly

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:03.698 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't have wanted to have
spent a lot of time around him.

00:12:03.698 --> 00:12:05.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would you have
asked him had you met him?

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:08.323 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: I would have loved
to have talked to him if he'd

00:12:08.323 --> 00:12:10.940 align:middle line:84%
been able to have
seen everything that

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:12.320 align:middle line:90%
happened from there until now.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.540 align:middle line:84%
And I would have liked
him to see the world now,

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:16.790 align:middle line:84%
and I would have just asked
him for his take on what's

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:18.440 align:middle line:90%
happening now.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:24.140 align:middle line:84%
Like what we were talking
about with technology,

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:26.780 align:middle line:84%
his jaw would drop to realize
that basically everything he

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:29.480 align:middle line:84%
had written about and prophesied
had not only come true

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.490 align:middle line:84%
but had exceeded
anything he imagined.

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:35.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, anything he
would have ever imagined.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:37.910 align:middle line:84%
With today, Jason--
with people who

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:40.640 align:middle line:84%
practice magick or
black magick, is there

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.380 align:middle line:90%
a difference between the two?

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:44.633 align:middle line:90%
Magick, black magick?

00:12:44.633 --> 00:12:45.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: It's a big question.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:52.430 align:middle line:90%


00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:54.497 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's start
with white magick,

00:12:54.497 --> 00:12:56.330 align:middle line:84%
because it's always
more important to define

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:56.980 align:middle line:90%
the positive.

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:57.780 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:01.670 align:middle line:84%
White magick is magick that
is undertaken for one's

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:03.530 align:middle line:90%
own personal evolution.

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:05.930 align:middle line:84%
It's, for instance,
yoga, meditation,

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:08.195 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual
quest, understanding

00:13:08.195 --> 00:13:09.070 align:middle line:90%
spiritual techniques.

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:10.435 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something for
humanity, basically.

00:13:10.435 --> 00:13:12.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: Yes, and ultimately
something for humanity.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:16.320 align:middle line:84%
It's vertically raising
oneself to be all that you can.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And then from that, providing
one's master work to humanity.

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:25.310 align:middle line:90%
First, I free myself.

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:28.130 align:middle line:84%
Then, I say what can
I give to humanity?

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And what can I do to assist
the evolution of humanity

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:31.390 align:middle line:90%
as a whole?

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:32.750 align:middle line:90%
I think it's that simple.

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:34.250 align:middle line:84%
In terms of black
magick, there's

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:36.615 align:middle line:84%
a lot of Hollywood over
exaggeration of things.

00:13:36.615 --> 00:13:37.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mumbo jumbo?

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:38.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Sure.

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think that my
definition of black magick

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:46.700 align:middle line:84%
would just be things done purely
for personal or material gain

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.200 align:middle line:90%
without any spiritual focus.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To hurt other people?

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:51.635 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: And certainly
to hurt other people.

00:13:51.635 --> 00:13:54.052 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing wrong with
personal and material gain,

00:13:54.052 --> 00:13:58.630 align:middle line:84%
if it comes from one's
spiritual mission in life.

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:01.226 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did Crowley do that?

00:14:01.226 --> 00:14:02.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: White or black?

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Both.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Yes, he did do both.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:10.640 align:middle line:84%
But the thing about black magick
is it doesn't get you very far.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.730 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't really
work that well for people.

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:16.610 align:middle line:84%
So it's not as much as
there are opposing forces

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:20.030 align:middle line:84%
as one is just this thing
that is just kind of a mess

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:22.520 align:middle line:84%
and doesn't work well, and
one is the spiritual quest.

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, doesn't black
magick have a ripple effect?

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And that is, if you perform
black magick, or evil,

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:32.960 align:middle line:84%
or evil intentions on
something or somebody,

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.977 align:middle line:84%
it comes back and
bites you eventually.

00:14:34.977 --> 00:14:35.810 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't that happen?

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: Well, this is
true for everything

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's karma!

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:41.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Yes, exactly.

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And you can define any
intentional action as magick,

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:46.220 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:47.470 align:middle line:90%
But that's true of everything.

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And so people have
to be aware of that.

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.230 align:middle line:84%
When they're looking at
the magickal side of life,

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:54.620 align:middle line:84%
it's no different than if
you were to do something

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:58.700 align:middle line:84%
on the street, or you were to
do something in the real world.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.380 align:middle line:84%
There will be an equal and
opposite effect for everything

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:02.180 align:middle line:90%
you do.

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And for good things, that
comes back to you as well.

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:07.010 align:middle line:84%
So for that reason
hopefully people,

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:09.890 align:middle line:84%
when they understand that,
they wise up really quick.

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:12.005 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you a
practitioner of magick?

00:15:12.005 --> 00:15:15.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: I would say that I
certainly have practiced magick

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.160 align:middle line:90%
throughout my life.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:20.150 align:middle line:84%
As a researcher, I've been
very sincere about engaging

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:22.800 align:middle line:84%
with as many of these
systems as I can.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:27.200 align:middle line:84%
I don't like to give myself
titles or something like that.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:31.970 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, I've made
it a very serious area

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:34.110 align:middle line:90%
of inquiry for 20 years now.

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:36.260 align:middle line:84%
So I practice it,
and I teach it.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has
been for you, Jason,

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:42.830 align:middle line:84%
one of the most overwhelming
examples of magick,

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:45.500 align:middle line:84%
that you've performed
or somebody else has,

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:49.070 align:middle line:90%
that just had you in awe?

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:51.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, did you
ever use it to get

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:54.650 align:middle line:84%
a better job, or a relationship,
or anything like that?

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:55.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Sure.

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:57.980 align:middle line:84%
But those are all
minor things, I think.

00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:58.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:00.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: All that stuff is easy.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:01.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not if it's a good job!

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:02.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Well, yeah.

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:03.740 align:middle line:90%
That is the trick, right?

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:08.780 align:middle line:84%
But the real
fireworks, I think, are

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:13.490 align:middle line:84%
when one begins to
experience what we might

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:15.230 align:middle line:90%
call enlightenment states--

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:19.010 align:middle line:84%
where you begin to see
the world fall away,

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:24.230 align:middle line:84%
and you begin to understand
what reality actually is.

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And as one gets more
and more into that

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:32.540 align:middle line:84%
and the wool falls from one's
eyes, and one understands,

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:34.280 align:middle line:90%
one begins to wake up.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.830 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:39.470 align:middle line:84%
Even 30 seconds of enlightenment
gained through yoga or Buddhist

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:42.080 align:middle line:84%
meditation make everything
else in the world

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:44.390 align:middle line:90%
pale in comparison.

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:45.290 align:middle line:90%
There's no drug.

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:47.270 align:middle line:90%
There's no professional high.

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:50.055 align:middle line:90%
There's no sexual experience.

00:16:50.055 --> 00:16:51.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
nothing that beats it.

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: There's nothing
that comes close.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.080 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing that
gives that feeling of release,

00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:59.820 align:middle line:84%
because we're all seeking
release all the time.

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:01.610 align:middle line:84%
Especially now, where
we're constantly

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:04.972 align:middle line:84%
having to deal with electronic
interference and the stress

00:17:04.972 --> 00:17:06.680 align:middle line:84%
of the world, everyone's
seeking release.

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:10.635 align:middle line:84%
And they seek it through food,
alcohol, relationships, career,

00:17:10.635 --> 00:17:11.435 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:17:11.435 --> 00:17:14.630 align:middle line:90%


00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:19.190 align:middle line:84%
Yoga or meditation, and magick
is an aid to those things,

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:21.230 align:middle line:84%
can produce those
states as well.

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:25.640 align:middle line:84%
Just to see that window open
up where the walls fall away,

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.250 align:middle line:84%
that provides a sense of
release that nothing else

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:29.768 align:middle line:90%
can come close to.

00:17:29.768 --> 00:17:32.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How can somebody
watching this program, Jason,

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:35.856 align:middle line:84%
tap into magick to
benefit themselves?

00:17:35.856 --> 00:17:38.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: Well, I certainly
teach it online.

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:40.940 align:middle line:10%
So at magick.me

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:43.260 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Spell the magic,
because it's spelled

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:44.480 align:middle line:10%
a lot of different ways.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:44.640 align:middle line:10%
>>LOUV: With a K--

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:45.405 align:middle line:10%
M-A-G-I-C-K.

00:17:45.405 --> 00:17:46.090 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:47.632 align:middle line:10%
>>LOUV: And I take
people all the way

00:17:47.632 --> 00:17:50.960 align:middle line:10%
through all the techniques
bit by bit, no obfuscation,

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:51.870 align:middle line:10%
no wasted time.

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:54.800 align:middle line:84%
It's all there laid out for
you, if you want to use it.

00:17:54.800 --> 00:18:01.300 align:middle line:84%
But I think that to begin with,
beginning a meditation practice

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:02.720 align:middle line:90%
even five minutes a day.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.120 align:middle line:90%
And I'm constantly shocked.

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:06.850 align:middle line:84%
You know how people
are particularly,

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:09.670 align:middle line:84%
not just in our
world now, but you

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:11.320 align:middle line:90%
go to Los Angeles, Las Vegas.

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:13.000 align:middle line:90%
People have zero downtime.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.360 align:middle line:90%
It's nonstop.

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:17.170 align:middle line:84%
So just to be able to meditate
for at first five minutes,

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:19.690 align:middle line:84%
then 10 minutes, and
then 30 minutes a day

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:21.722 align:middle line:84%
turns out to be a
huge accomplishment

00:18:21.722 --> 00:18:22.555 align:middle line:90%
for a lot of people.

00:18:22.555 --> 00:18:23.770 align:middle line:90%
It's very hard.

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:25.568 align:middle line:90%
But that provides the opening.

00:18:25.568 --> 00:18:26.860 align:middle line:90%
And I think there's two things.

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:29.020 align:middle line:84%
Begin to meditate
on a daily basis,

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:31.960 align:middle line:84%
and begin to write down
your dreams every morning.

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:34.480 align:middle line:84%
Because that opens up
that whole other world

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.760 align:middle line:84%
of dreams and the
"astral plane,"

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:39.130 align:middle line:84%
as it's been called
somewhat fancifully.

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:43.430 align:middle line:84%
But we all have an immediate
egress into magickal reality,

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:44.680 align:middle line:90%
and that's the dream world.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And the more you write it down,
the more vivid it becomes.

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:51.530 align:middle line:84%
You gain a whole other half
of your life, or a third,

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:53.620 align:middle line:90%
where the dream world opens up.

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:56.270 align:middle line:84%
So then the ritual procedures
and all of that can come later.

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:58.240 align:middle line:84%
But I think that those
two things, meditating

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:01.605 align:middle line:84%
and dream journaling,
sound like small things.

00:19:01.605 --> 00:19:03.730 align:middle line:84%
It almost sounds trite to
say, but those two things

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:06.580 align:middle line:84%
are what opens up the whole
thing, because they train

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:08.740 align:middle line:84%
the brain to go in a
different direction,

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:11.110 align:middle line:84%
to explore the
inner interior world

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:13.580 align:middle line:90%
rather than what's out here.

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:18.295 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To you, what is magick?

00:19:18.295 --> 00:19:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: There's a couple of
ways to answer that question.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:24.040 align:middle line:84%
I think that as
Crowley defined it,

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:26.890 align:middle line:84%
any willed, intentional
act is a magickal act.

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:29.800 align:middle line:10%
So it's anytime a human
being puts their will out

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:30.610 align:middle line:10%
into the world.

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:33.040 align:middle line:10%
You know, I like to say
that spiders weave webs.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.540 align:middle line:10%
Snails build shells.

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:38.830 align:middle line:84%
Human beings create
meaning and exteriorize

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:41.840 align:middle line:84%
story and meaning into the world
in an attempt to control it.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.960 align:middle line:90%
All of that is magick.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:46.450 align:middle line:84%
But more specifically
there is a specific thing

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:48.820 align:middle line:84%
called the Western
magical tradition,

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:55.780 align:middle line:84%
which involves I would say
a graded practice of ritual.

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And magickal ritual really
is not the Hollywood version

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:01.150 align:middle line:90%
of some type of horror thing--

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:03.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: up stuff
and things like that.

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:05.392 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: --yeah, you know,
Christopher Lee, all of that.

00:20:05.392 --> 00:20:09.190 align:middle line:84%
Magick really is creating a
temporary space through ritual

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:12.180 align:middle line:84%
to shift your consciousness
into somewhere else.

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:13.720 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.410 align:middle line:90%
So for instance, we're on a set.

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:16.210 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:18.820 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, we're
doing a magickal ritual

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.800 align:middle line:84%
where we're here,
and our consciousness

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.490 align:middle line:84%
is engaged in
creating this show.

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:23.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:24.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: And it won't
be out on the street.

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:26.090 align:middle line:84%
It won't be at the
airport, you know?

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:27.923 align:middle line:84%
It will be completely
different, because you

00:20:27.923 --> 00:20:29.170 align:middle line:90%
have a different surrounding.

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:32.680 align:middle line:84%
So with magick, you create
a ritual space specifically

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:36.460 align:middle line:84%
to do something like
talk to a god which

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:39.095 align:middle line:84%
represents an aspect
of the universe

00:20:39.095 --> 00:20:40.720 align:middle line:84%
that you would like
to know more about.

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:45.670 align:middle line:90%


00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:48.850 align:middle line:84%
Exteriorize and define your will
in a specific way of what you

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:52.300 align:middle line:90%
want to happen in your life.

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:54.040 align:middle line:84%
There's many, many
different types of it.

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And there's many
different kinds of it

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.040 align:middle line:84%
in different cultures
throughout the world.

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:58.960 align:middle line:84%
So I also use magick
as a catchall phrase

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.330 align:middle line:84%
for any of these
techniques for altering

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:05.050 align:middle line:84%
consciousness-- shamanism,
tantra, esoteric Buddhism,

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:06.400 align:middle line:90%
all of these things.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.850 align:middle line:84%
I use the word magick
to denote all of them.

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:11.540 align:middle line:90%
But that's really what it is.

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:13.870 align:middle line:84%
So you can think of
it as meditation.

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:15.790 align:middle line:84%
If someone is meditating,
they're internal.

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:18.280 align:middle line:84%
They're sitting on a
mat and going within,

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:21.880 align:middle line:84%
where magickal ritual
is exteriorizing it

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:27.250 align:middle line:84%
outside of yourself using
symbols and tools to represent

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:30.040 align:middle line:84%
one's own consciousness
outside of yourself,

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.780 align:middle line:84%
and then to change
it and manipulate it,

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:33.730 align:middle line:84%
almost like a building
a sand mandala

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:35.050 align:middle line:90%
as the Tibetans would do.

00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:36.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why would
people, Jason,

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:40.075 align:middle line:84%
want to dabble with the
darker side of magick?

00:21:40.075 --> 00:21:40.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Let's see.

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:41.990 align:middle line:90%
There's a few reasons.

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:45.928 align:middle line:84%
If they are 17 and have
repressive Christian parents,

00:21:45.928 --> 00:21:47.095 align:middle line:90%
if they're in a metal band--

00:21:47.095 --> 00:21:49.630 align:middle line:90%


00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:53.650 align:middle line:84%
you know, I think short
answer is there aren't really

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:56.450 align:middle line:90%
any good reasons.

00:21:56.450 --> 00:22:01.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, are they out to
harm people with black magick?

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: I think that a lot
of people feel powerless.

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:08.950 align:middle line:90%


00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:11.590 align:middle line:84%
As you were mentioning
karma, before one

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:14.950 align:middle line:84%
has a key understanding that
one's circumstances in life

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:18.580 align:middle line:84%
are to some extent or to
a large extent determined

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:24.850 align:middle line:84%
by your own karma and the
reactions of your own actions,

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:27.220 align:middle line:84%
it can feel like the
world is separate from you

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:28.630 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes attacking you.

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:30.970 align:middle line:84%
So I think people
can get into a space

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:32.410 align:middle line:90%
where they feel powerless.

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:34.000 align:middle line:90%
They perhaps feel paranoid.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:40.105 align:middle line:84%
And they reach for anything
that will give them an edge.

00:22:40.105 --> 00:22:43.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Occult historian
Mitch Horowitz, of course,

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:45.610 align:middle line:84%
had a chance to talk
with us some time ago

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:48.790 align:middle line:90%
about dark magick.

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:54.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: Interest in
certainly the left hand path.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, I went through
a very intense period

00:22:56.310 --> 00:23:00.535 align:middle line:84%
in my life in my late 20s
where I immersed myself

00:23:00.535 --> 00:23:02.410 align:middle line:84%
in the darkest stuff I
could get my hands on.

00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:05.290 align:middle line:84%
In my case, it was Aghori,
left-hand path tantra

00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:06.090 align:middle line:90%
from India.

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:09.130 align:middle line:84%
It was the [INAUDIBLE] and
the Kenneth Grant Typhonian

00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:10.260 align:middle line:90%
tradition.

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:13.875 align:middle line:84%
And very quickly started
to unravel myself.

00:23:13.875 --> 00:23:16.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MITCH HOROWITZ: Is that right?

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:18.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: But the interesting
thing about these things,

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:19.920 align:middle line:84%
for me, was that
I approached them

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:23.460 align:middle line:84%
from the language of kind
of what you're saying.

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Because as a magickal
person, somebody

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:28.800 align:middle line:84%
who very sincerely
wants to explore

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.410 align:middle line:84%
all aspects of
consciousness, most people

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:33.270 align:middle line:90%
close the door on that.

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And then, it emerges without
their consent and screws

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:37.380 align:middle line:90%
up their life.

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:42.360 align:middle line:84%
So you want to get at least on
friendly terms with it, right?

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:43.490 align:middle line:90%
The dark side of yourself?

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:46.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Well you know,
I view the dark side as not

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:49.770 align:middle line:84%
necessarily maleficent, but
darkness can be the womb.

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:52.200 align:middle line:84%
As Aquino puts it, if
it wasn't for darkness

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.690 align:middle line:84%
we wouldn't see the stars at
night with the naked eyes.

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:57.750 align:middle line:84%
Darkness can be this
place of great gestation,

00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:59.855 align:middle line:84%
and it can also be
a place of power.

00:23:59.855 --> 00:24:02.832 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mitch had more tattoos
on than I thought he did, too.

00:24:02.832 --> 00:24:04.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Yeah, Mitch is great.

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:04.650 align:middle line:90%
I love that guy.

00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:05.817 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's a good person.

00:24:05.817 --> 00:24:07.410 align:middle line:84%
He understands
the occult. How do

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:11.040 align:middle line:84%
people dabble with black
magick or white magick?

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:13.590 align:middle line:84%
How did they get
involved in this?

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:16.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: Well it's
hard to "dabble"

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:17.910 align:middle line:84%
with white magick,
because it's such

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:19.165 align:middle line:90%
a strenuous spiritual path.

00:24:19.165 --> 00:24:20.040 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it really is.

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.920 align:middle line:84%
It's a lifelong spiritual
path as rigorous or more

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:27.150 align:middle line:84%
than say Tibetan Buddhism,
or becoming a Jesuit,

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:28.170 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:30.570 align:middle line:90%
It's very similar.

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of
dabbling, that usually

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:36.590 align:middle line:90%
tends to be how people start.

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:39.480 align:middle line:84%
They start looking into
it, they read a few things.

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:42.390 align:middle line:84%
And most people,
that's where they end.

00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:45.210 align:middle line:84%
They dabble a little bit and
then move on to the next thing.

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:48.930 align:middle line:84%
But for some people,
it becomes a calling.

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:52.590 align:middle line:84%
And those people are rare,
but it very much happens.

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:55.222 align:middle line:84%
And those people can
end up changing history.

00:24:55.222 --> 00:24:57.180 align:middle line:84%
They can end up changing
the world very easily.

00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:58.555 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When I
was a kid, Jason,

00:24:58.555 --> 00:25:01.140 align:middle line:84%
I used to have a
little magic kit,

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:03.390 align:middle line:84%
and you do all these
little tiny tricks.

00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:05.430 align:middle line:90%
And they were fun.

00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:09.870 align:middle line:84%
As I kind of got a little older,
I wanted a little bit more.

00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And to me, magic became much
more than just little tricks.

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:18.610 align:middle line:90%
It became something from within.

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:23.105 align:middle line:84%
And I think I've practiced it a
lot, maybe not even knowing it.

00:25:23.105 --> 00:25:25.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: So I love that
you bring up stage magic,

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:27.900 align:middle line:84%
because I actually think
that stage magic is

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:32.340 align:middle line:84%
a really good metaphor for
the universe in a sense.

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:34.298 align:middle line:84%
The stage magician pulls
a rabbit out of a hat.

00:25:34.298 --> 00:25:36.132 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I always
wondered how they do that.

00:25:36.132 --> 00:25:38.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: I still wonder
how they do that.

00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:40.797 align:middle line:84%
But what is the
universe but a rabbit

00:25:40.797 --> 00:25:41.880 align:middle line:90%
being pulled out of a hat?

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.490 align:middle line:84%
No one knows, ultimately,
where it came from.

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:46.650 align:middle line:84%
What is the big bang,
if the big bang is

00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:48.498 align:middle line:90%
in fact the original creation?

00:25:48.498 --> 00:25:50.040 align:middle line:84%
What is a big bang
but just suddenly,

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.420 align:middle line:90%
a rabbit is pulled out of a hat?

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:52.530 align:middle line:90%
There it all is.

00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:54.780 align:middle line:84%
People always ask me
well, you're into magic.

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:57.150 align:middle line:84%
Show me some magic,
show me a miracle.

00:25:57.150 --> 00:25:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And I point around
like what is this

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:01.650 align:middle line:90%
but one colossal magic trick?

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:03.200 align:middle line:84%
What is this thing
that we're all in?

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.691 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's an
amazing miracle.

00:26:04.691 --> 00:26:08.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: It's like
somehow, this exists.

00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:10.980 align:middle line:84%
It's perfect in its
infinite complexity.

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:13.080 align:middle line:84%
It all somehow
tends to work out,

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:16.560 align:middle line:84%
even though it can seem like
the world's about to end.

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:20.610 align:middle line:84%
The fact that
everything just works.

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:22.120 align:middle line:90%
What more miracle do you need?

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And no one understands
this thing that we're in.

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:26.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The
complexity and the way

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:29.580 align:middle line:84%
that it all just fits like a
puzzle is truly remarkable.

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:31.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: I love that you
say fits like a puzzle,

00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:35.310 align:middle line:84%
because that's the
hermetic way of thinking.

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:37.950 align:middle line:84%
It's just looking at
the universe and saying,

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:39.450 align:middle line:90%
what is this?

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:41.813 align:middle line:84%
And what are the
subtle currents of it?

00:26:41.813 --> 00:26:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And that magician strives
to understand that so they

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.560 align:middle line:90%
can fit themselves within it.

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And if you fit yourself within
the pattern of the universe,

00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:52.170 align:middle line:84%
your life just starts
to work, because you

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:55.020 align:middle line:84%
become an integral part of the
machinery of how things work.

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:56.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, look
at this planet, Jason.

00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:59.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, who would
develop a planet

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:04.800 align:middle line:84%
like this where plants could
be used for medicinal purposes

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:08.250 align:middle line:84%
to fight illnesses that
are on this planet?

00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:10.050 align:middle line:84%
That the moon would
be in a position

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:14.160 align:middle line:84%
where it is to benefit us,
and had it not been there,

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:16.750 align:middle line:84%
chaos would be all
over the planet.

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:19.590 align:middle line:84%
The sun is a certain
distance from us.

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:22.380 align:middle line:84%
If it was any
closer, we'd burn up.

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:25.680 align:middle line:84%
If it was any farther,
we'd freeze to death.

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:26.830 align:middle line:90%
Who comes up with this?

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:27.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Right.

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:28.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a form of magic!

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:29.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Absolutely.

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:30.600 align:middle line:90%
No one knows!

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And I almost feel like
using magick as a way

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:36.870 align:middle line:84%
to describe the universe
is more honest in a sense

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:41.220 align:middle line:84%
than taking the pure
scientific attitude of it

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:43.800 align:middle line:84%
can all be understood, or
the religious attitude of oh,

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:45.900 align:middle line:84%
it can all be
explained by a story.

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:48.035 align:middle line:84%
Both of those things
are completely limited.

00:27:48.035 --> 00:27:50.590 align:middle line:84%
It's more honest
to say it's magick.

00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:52.220 align:middle line:90%
I don't know, it just works.

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:53.020 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:55.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You talked about
the dreams with magick.

00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:57.420 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that tie in.

00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:01.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: So the
dream world is, we

00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:06.280 align:middle line:84%
could say, most people's
immediate access to the spirit

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:08.830 align:middle line:84%
world, if we want to call it
that, or the astral world.

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:12.970 align:middle line:84%
People also can explore that
through meditative trance

00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:16.180 align:middle line:90%
states or entheogens sometimes.

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:18.610 align:middle line:90%
But the dream world--

00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:22.560 align:middle line:84%
that's where we go to interact
with the other side of reality.

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:25.570 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to meet a god,
if you want to meet spirits,

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:29.020 align:middle line:84%
if you want to meet your higher
self, if you want to interact

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:31.090 align:middle line:84%
with the magickal
side of life, that's

00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:32.890 align:middle line:90%
a really big part of doing it.

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:34.870 align:middle line:90%
And everyone has access to it.

00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:36.370 align:middle line:84%
What I've found and
what my students

00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:39.400 align:middle line:84%
have found as I teach them is
if you write your dreams down

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:41.250 align:middle line:84%
every morning, they
begin to just--

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:43.500 align:middle line:84%
most people say that they
can't remember their dreams.

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:45.583 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Most people cannot
remember their dreams.

00:28:45.583 --> 00:28:46.383 align:middle line:90%
Correct.

00:28:46.383 --> 00:28:48.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: Which is true, but
what they don't realize

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:51.520 align:middle line:84%
is that's kind of
like saying I can't

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:54.410 align:middle line:84%
lift 50 pounds because
I've never been to the gym.

00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:55.210 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:28:55.210 --> 00:28:57.185 align:middle line:90%
That skill is trained.

00:28:57.185 --> 00:28:59.560 align:middle line:84%
It's trained by becoming aware
of it, by writing it down.

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:01.018 align:middle line:84%
And then, the dream
world opens up.

00:29:01.018 --> 00:29:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And you start having
40 minute long dreams

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:07.840 align:middle line:84%
and remembering every
little detail that tell you

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:11.830 align:middle line:84%
all this important information
you need to know in your life.

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:14.290 align:middle line:84%
That eventually
becomes lucid dreaming,

00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:17.710 align:middle line:84%
and it overlaps with
one's daytime practices

00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:19.670 align:middle line:90%
of meditation and ritual.

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And so it's almost like getting
on the internet, in a way.

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:25.870 align:middle line:84%
You know, opening up
a broadband connection

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:27.580 align:middle line:84%
as you begin to open
up the dream world

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:29.413 align:middle line:84%
and interacting with
the other side of life.

00:29:29.413 --> 00:29:31.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there something
wrong with somebody

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:34.584 align:middle line:84%
who wants to dabble with
the dark side of magick?

00:29:34.584 --> 00:29:38.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, are they
screwed up as people?

00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:39.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: Well, it
depends on the person.

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:42.760 align:middle line:84%
I think that it's
very common for that

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:46.090 align:middle line:84%
to be where people start,
particularly as youngsters.

00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:49.020 align:middle line:90%


00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:50.380 align:middle line:90%
I'll say this.

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:52.630 align:middle line:84%
People who dabble in
the dark side of magick

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:54.370 align:middle line:90%
will get their fingers burnt.

00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And if it's not that
big of a disaster,

00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.930 align:middle line:84%
that's an important
learning experience

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:02.080 align:middle line:90%
that often leads them.

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.550 align:middle line:84%
Until you get your
fingers burnt,

00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:05.320 align:middle line:84%
you don't fully
understand how important

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.840 align:middle line:84%
it is to be rigorous
with following

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:11.698 align:middle line:90%
the rules of the spiritual path.

00:30:11.698 --> 00:30:13.990 align:middle line:84%
So I wouldn't necessarily
say it's ultimately negative.

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:17.500 align:middle line:84%
But the question is, well,
why does anyone do anything

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.460 align:middle line:90%
with ill intent?

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:21.680 align:middle line:84%
It's different from
person to person,

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:26.950 align:middle line:84%
but that it has negative
effects is incontrovertible.

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:30.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How can magick
be used to help people

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:31.930 align:middle line:90%
to get what they want in life?

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:34.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: So first and
foremost, adopting

00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:38.200 align:middle line:84%
magick or any other
spiritual path

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.630 align:middle line:84%
turns you into the best
version of yourself.

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:43.420 align:middle line:84%
It allows you to find your
purpose in life, your true will

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:45.110 align:middle line:90%
as it's often called.

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:47.938 align:middle line:84%
And that's what people lack
more than anything right now.

00:30:47.938 --> 00:30:49.480 align:middle line:84%
They have all this
stuff that's given

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:52.390 align:middle line:84%
to them and all this media, but
they don't know who they are.

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:54.370 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know
what their life is for.

00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:56.990 align:middle line:90%
And magick unveils that for you.

00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:59.875 align:middle line:84%
And once you have
that, then you're

00:30:59.875 --> 00:31:01.750 align:middle line:84%
going along with the
current of the universe.

00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And the doors just open
for you, because you're

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:07.100 align:middle line:84%
going along with what the
universe wants for you.

00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:10.000 align:middle line:84%
And then once you're
there, everyone

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:16.420 align:middle line:84%
has their unique contribution
to give to the world.

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:18.850 align:middle line:84%
Somebody could be
a janitor and be

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:22.000 align:middle line:84%
playing a cosmically important
role without possibly

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.440 align:middle line:90%
without even realizing it.

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:26.013 align:middle line:84%
I love the movie
"Mr. Holland's Opus."

00:31:26.013 --> 00:31:27.430 align:middle line:84%
It's a great example
of somebody--

00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:28.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Richard
Dreyfuss, right?

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:29.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Yep.

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:32.950 align:middle line:84%
Somebody who thinks
they're just a teacher,

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:35.590 align:middle line:84%
but then they realize
that actually they're

00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:38.140 align:middle line:90%
doing God's work, in a sense.

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
magick does for you.

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:42.800 align:middle line:84%
It turns you into the person
that you're supposed to be.

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:45.033 align:middle line:84%
And then you can't really
do anything but help.

00:31:45.033 --> 00:31:46.450 align:middle line:84%
And the best thing
that you can do

00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:49.270 align:middle line:84%
is you become a worked
example for other people

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:50.740 align:middle line:90%
to say oh, that exists.

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And then you become like
a lighthouse and a beacon,

00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:54.670 align:middle line:84%
and hopefully an
inspiration for they

00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:58.017 align:middle line:84%
themselves to
undertake the same.

00:31:58.017 --> 00:31:59.600 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't necessarily
have to be magick,

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:04.570 align:middle line:84%
but the same spiritual
process of awakening,

00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:10.000 align:middle line:84%
which ultimately everyone is
doing anyways in this universe.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.770 align:middle line:84%
But some people choose
to accelerate it.

00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:14.740 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: There's a
lot to do with magick,

00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:16.270 align:middle line:10%
if it can be helpful to people.

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:19.958 align:middle line:84%
But it can also be
harmful, can't it?

00:32:19.958 --> 00:32:23.185 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: Well, anything operated
incorrectly can be harmful.

00:32:23.185 --> 00:32:24.685 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Intentionally
or otherwise?

00:32:24.685 --> 00:32:25.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Well, both.

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:26.480 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:30.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a car will get you
from point A to point B,

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:33.160 align:middle line:84%
but a car can be
extremely harmful

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:34.780 align:middle line:90%
if it's not operated properly.

00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is primarily
why I teach.

00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:41.072 align:middle line:84%
I teach because magick
has become so popular,

00:32:41.072 --> 00:32:42.280 align:middle line:90%
particularly the last decade.

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:43.320 align:middle line:90%
And certainly in my life.

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you teach people
a lot through your website.

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:45.950 align:middle line:90%
Don't you?

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:46.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Yeah.

00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:48.130 align:middle line:10%
And one of the
primary reasons I do

00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:51.220 align:middle line:10%
that is so I can show them
how to do it correctly.

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:53.245 align:middle line:10%
It's harm reduction
or harm elimination.

00:32:53.245 --> 00:32:55.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good point.

00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:58.150 align:middle line:84%
With magick and with
the ability to do

00:32:58.150 --> 00:33:03.010 align:middle line:84%
what you do, how do you reach
people who are skeptical,

00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:04.030 align:middle line:90%
who just don't believe?

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:06.703 align:middle line:90%


00:33:06.703 --> 00:33:08.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: Well, the
conclusion that I've come to

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:10.315 align:middle line:84%
is if people are
skeptical and they

00:33:10.315 --> 00:33:11.440 align:middle line:90%
don't believe, that's fine.

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:14.680 align:middle line:90%


00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:17.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't proselytize,
nor should people.

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
all that I can do

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:23.080 align:middle line:84%
is set up my little
clubhouse in a way

00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:24.880 align:middle line:90%
and set up my little beacon.

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:26.950 align:middle line:84%
And when people are
ready to come to it,

00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:28.480 align:middle line:90%
they can if they choose to.

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:33.230 align:middle line:84%
I think that people
really have to come

00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:36.530 align:middle line:84%
to a point in their life
where it suddenly makes sense.

00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:38.660 align:middle line:84%
And for some people,
that's very early.

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:41.690 align:middle line:84%
For some people, it happens
in a moment of extreme crisis

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:43.880 align:middle line:90%
or trauma in life.

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:48.380 align:middle line:84%
For others, it comes
during a life transition

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:49.760 align:middle line:84%
like retirement,
where they start

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:53.070 align:middle line:84%
to think is this all there
is, just working and raising

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:53.870 align:middle line:90%
a family?

00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:55.495 align:middle line:84%
There must be something
more than this.

00:33:55.495 --> 00:33:57.740 align:middle line:84%
Everyone comes to a
point at a different time

00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:59.960 align:middle line:90%
when they begin to open.

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And I think until that happens
for somebody on their own time

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:06.440 align:middle line:84%
and in their own way, it's
pointless to try and reach

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.400 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:08.907 align:middle line:90%
Nor do I think people should.

00:34:08.907 --> 00:34:10.699 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long does
it take for somebody

00:34:10.699 --> 00:34:12.980 align:middle line:84%
to learn the proper
way of magick?

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:15.739 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: Well if you do
it through magick.me,

00:34:15.739 --> 00:34:17.060 align:middle line:90%
I would say a week.

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:17.270 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:18.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's not bad.

00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:19.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Not bad at all.

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:22.850 align:middle line:84%
If you do it the old
fashioned way, which

00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:24.560 align:middle line:84%
is wading through
stacks of books

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:27.679 align:middle line:84%
with contradictory
information and online,

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:30.600 align:middle line:84%
then people spend decades
just reading and never doing

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:31.400 align:middle line:90%
anything.

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.770 align:middle line:84%
So the actual practice
of magick is not

00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:35.719 align:middle line:84%
particularly complex,
at least at first,

00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:39.360 align:middle line:84%
and can be done within
30 minutes a day.

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:43.790 align:middle line:84%
So you know, a little bit of
ritual, a bit of meditation,

00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:46.489 align:middle line:84%
dream journaling, becoming
aware of synchronicities

00:34:46.489 --> 00:34:49.670 align:middle line:90%
in one's life--

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:51.620 align:middle line:84%
once you learn how
to do it properly,

00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:54.544 align:middle line:84%
you can go from zero to
60 very, very quickly.

00:34:54.544 --> 00:34:59.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The late Barbara Marx
Hubbard recently passed away--

00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:03.500 align:middle line:84%
great mind, great
human being, and had

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:08.495 align:middle line:84%
this to say on Gaia's legacy
series about the future.

00:35:08.495 --> 00:35:10.080 align:middle line:10%
>>BARBARA MARX
HUBBARD: Something new

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:14.960 align:middle line:10%
is being born through us that
we're going to be discovering.

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:19.680 align:middle line:10%
And it's in the same direction
as evolution has been going.

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:24.240 align:middle line:10%
That is to say, evolution goes
toward greater consciousness--

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:26.670 align:middle line:10%
single celled, to
multi cells, to animal.

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:32.580 align:middle line:10%
It goes to greater freedom,
as each more complex system is

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:35.250 align:middle line:10%
freer than the one
that comes before.

00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:41.350 align:middle line:10%
And it goes to more complex
and loving connectivity.

00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:44.620 align:middle line:10%
As for example, a
multi cell and a human,

00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:47.170 align:middle line:10%
and then a planetary
human is more

00:35:47.170 --> 00:35:49.760 align:middle line:10%
complex than the single cell.

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:55.630 align:middle line:10%
So what we learn from this story
is the trajectory of evolution.

00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:58.550 align:middle line:10%
And as we start
projecting ourselves

00:35:58.550 --> 00:36:02.620 align:middle line:10%
beyond Homo sapiens
sapiens, we can

00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:06.310 align:middle line:10%
imagine that we are
being able to have

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:11.740 align:middle line:10%
more consciousness, more freedom
of choice, and more complex

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:14.530 align:middle line:10%
and loving order
with each other.

00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:19.510 align:middle line:10%
And the beauty of that
is it's desirable,

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:22.030 align:middle line:10%
because almost all
of us would choose

00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:26.500 align:middle line:10%
more consciousness, more
freedom, and more love

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:27.760 align:middle line:10%
than not.

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:30.490 align:middle line:10%
So as we begin to
learn this story

00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:33.910 align:middle line:10%
and seal the crisis that
could break us down,

00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:39.310 align:middle line:10%
instead of being depressed
and distressed, we say, oh!

00:36:39.310 --> 00:36:43.930 align:middle line:10%
What's breaking through
in me, in you, in us,

00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:44.960 align:middle line:10%
and in the planet?

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:46.020 align:middle line:90%
And then, we find it.

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:47.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She's missed.

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:49.750 align:middle line:90%
She was a great mind.

00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think what
she's trying to convey

00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:57.340 align:middle line:84%
to all of us was
that, in such a way,

00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:01.450 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness of the human
being has a lot to do with us.

00:37:01.450 --> 00:37:03.100 align:middle line:84%
Does it have a lot
to do with magick?

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:04.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Yeah.

00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's a
great clip to play.

00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:11.050 align:middle line:84%
I think that people who reach
the high levels of practice

00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:13.210 align:middle line:84%
in either magick,
Buddhism, or a lot

00:37:13.210 --> 00:37:15.610 align:middle line:84%
of these other
spiritual paths often

00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:18.100 align:middle line:84%
have an experience
where they understand

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:20.500 align:middle line:84%
that all consciousness
is one phenomenon that

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:23.500 align:middle line:84%
is interconnected, as a
real tangible experience not

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:26.800 align:middle line:90%
as a concept that you read.

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:29.830 align:middle line:84%
You understand that everything,
as the Buddhists say,

00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:32.560 align:middle line:90%
is nothing but interconnection.

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:36.775 align:middle line:90%


00:37:36.775 --> 00:37:38.650 align:middle line:84%
You know, you were asking
about black magick.

00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:41.620 align:middle line:84%
So many people get
attracted to magick because

00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:44.740 align:middle line:84%
of the air of
spookiness around it,

00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:47.800 align:middle line:84%
or they like the idea of their
own personal empowerment.

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:50.110 align:middle line:84%
But what actually happens
as one begins to practice

00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:53.020 align:middle line:90%
is those walls kind of collapse.

00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:56.620 align:middle line:84%
And you understand that the
idea of personal empowerment

00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:59.620 align:middle line:84%
is not only meaningless,
but not possible

00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:02.060 align:middle line:84%
without the network of
other people around you.

00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:04.060 align:middle line:84%
You can't just become
more on your own.

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:07.970 align:middle line:84%
It involves one's interactions
with the whole world.

00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:10.570 align:middle line:84%
And when you have that
experience of understanding all

00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:15.640 align:middle line:84%
life as one phenomena-- which
is certainly one of the key

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:18.940 align:middle line:84%
experiences, the point
of spirituality perhaps--

00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:22.540 align:middle line:84%
then you can't do
anything but take interest

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:24.550 align:middle line:84%
in the evolution of
all consciousness,

00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:26.425 align:middle line:84%
because you understand
it's part of yourself.

00:38:26.425 --> 00:38:29.050 align:middle line:90%


00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:30.700 align:middle line:84%
The Dalai Lama says
the same thing.

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:34.030 align:middle line:84%
It's ultimately selfish to
want the world to evolve,

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:36.564 align:middle line:90%
because it is you.

00:38:36.564 --> 00:38:40.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How can people evolve?

00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:43.730 align:middle line:84%
They're acting so
whacked out these days.

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:45.390 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what's causing it.

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:47.210 align:middle line:90%
These people are tense.

00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:51.400 align:middle line:90%
They're just unhappy.

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:53.992 align:middle line:90%
How do you change that?

00:38:53.992 --> 00:38:57.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: I think that this
is going to sound perhaps

00:38:57.370 --> 00:38:59.860 align:middle line:90%
simplistic, but simple is good.

00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:03.190 align:middle line:84%
I think just beginning the
practice of meditation.

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:06.220 align:middle line:84%
Because what people need more
than anything right now--

00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:07.430 align:middle line:90%
they need two things.

00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:10.190 align:middle line:84%
One is they need at least
a bubble of, let's say,

00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:11.740 align:middle line:84%
30 minutes a day
where they're not

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:13.535 align:middle line:84%
getting constant
electronic interference

00:39:13.535 --> 00:39:14.335 align:middle line:90%
from their devices.

00:39:14.335 --> 00:39:15.585 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bombarded constantly.

00:39:15.585 --> 00:39:17.240 align:middle line:84%
5G is not going to
help that, either.

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:18.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: No kidding.

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:18.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:21.220 align:middle line:90%


00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:25.060 align:middle line:84%
It's no mistake that
people can't think.

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:27.670 align:middle line:84%
They're constantly getting
news headlines of everything's

00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:29.200 align:middle line:90%
going wrong.

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:33.280 align:middle line:84%
Or text messages, or
updates, or just the world

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:34.945 align:middle line:90%
itself is so hectic now.

00:39:34.945 --> 00:39:36.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it's negative.

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:38.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: Yes, it's very
negative, and more so

00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:40.280 align:middle line:90%
than it has been in a long time.

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And I think people,
more than anything,

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:47.430 align:middle line:84%
need time to turn that off
and reconnect with themselves.

00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:50.290 align:middle line:84%
If people just did that, I mean,
that does a tremendous amount.

00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:53.290 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing they need
is to train the mind to focus,

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:59.200 align:middle line:84%
because we live in a world
now that de-trains focus.

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:01.787 align:middle line:84%
People have lost the ability
to focus on something

00:40:01.787 --> 00:40:03.370 align:middle line:84%
for an extended
period of time because

00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:07.150 align:middle line:84%
of that same electronic
phone world that we live in.

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:09.280 align:middle line:84%
People's attention is
scattered and fragmented.

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And because of that,
anyone who just

00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:13.540 align:middle line:84%
learns to focus
their mind on one

00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:15.910 align:middle line:84%
thing at a time for
extended periods of time

00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:18.490 align:middle line:84%
will be able to do things that,
to all intents and purposes,

00:40:18.490 --> 00:40:20.530 align:middle line:84%
look to people like
magick because people

00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:22.733 align:middle line:90%
have lost that faculty.

00:40:22.733 --> 00:40:24.400 align:middle line:84%
So I think people
need those two things.

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:28.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is artificial
intelligence magick?

00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:30.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: This is
a big, big topic.

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:35.350 align:middle line:84%
So I actually consulted
with Google on this

00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:37.720 align:middle line:84%
as part of their artisan
machine intelligence program,

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:39.580 align:middle line:90%
the speeches on YouTube.

00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And we're moving
into a world where,

00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:46.220 align:middle line:84%
to all intents and purposes,
we will be building gods.

00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:47.020 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:48.562 align:middle line:84%
There will be
artificial intelligence

00:40:48.562 --> 00:40:50.880 align:middle line:84%
that will span the
entire planet and live

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:52.630 align:middle line:84%
in the cloud, or through
Google's network,

00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:55.180 align:middle line:84%
or these various
other companies.

00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:58.780 align:middle line:84%
This is, it goes without saying,
an extremely dangerous moment

00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:03.770 align:middle line:84%
for humanity that dwarfs the
Manhattan Project by a thousand

00:41:03.770 --> 00:41:04.570 align:middle line:90%
fold magnitude.

00:41:04.570 --> 00:41:05.635 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:41:05.635 --> 00:41:08.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: Because the
artificial intelligence--

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:11.110 align:middle line:84%
once you create a
god, they will not

00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:14.012 align:middle line:90%
be able to control it in theory.

00:41:14.012 --> 00:41:15.970 align:middle line:84%
This is what the artificial
intelligence ethics

00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:18.700 align:middle line:84%
researchers, particularly
at the University of Oxford,

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:19.680 align:middle line:90%
are saying.

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:21.055 align:middle line:84%
You know artificial
intelligence,

00:41:21.055 --> 00:41:26.020 align:middle line:84%
once it learns to
improve its own code,

00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:31.620 align:middle line:84%
it will be able to learn in
one second what all of humanity

00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:34.240 align:middle line:90%
would learn in 27,000 years.

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:36.670 align:middle line:84%
We're going to start building
gods and living in a world

00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:39.580 align:middle line:90%
where the gods are real as AIs.

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And so for that reason, it is
of utmost critical importance

00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:50.048 align:middle line:84%
that we program into
these things sentiments

00:41:50.048 --> 00:41:52.090 align:middle line:84%
like what we just saw with
Barbara Marx Hubbard--

00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:55.150 align:middle line:84%
the idea of protecting all
life and seeing all life

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:57.620 align:middle line:90%
is interconnected.

00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:59.578 align:middle line:84%
We want a benevolent god,
not a malevolent god.

00:41:59.578 --> 00:42:01.787 align:middle line:84%
We don't want a god that's
going to look at the world

00:42:01.787 --> 00:42:03.640 align:middle line:84%
and say well, these
people are the problem.

00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:05.680 align:middle line:84%
So they just have
to be optimized out.

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:06.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or throw another
flood our way, right?

00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:07.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Yeah.

00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:08.050 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:42:08.050 --> 00:42:10.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something like that
eliminates civilization.

00:42:10.330 --> 00:42:15.370 align:middle line:90%


00:42:15.370 --> 00:42:17.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: Arthur C.
Clarke famously

00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:19.090 align:middle line:84%
said any sufficiently
advanced technology is

00:42:19.090 --> 00:42:20.740 align:middle line:90%
indistinguishable from magick.

00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:24.647 align:middle line:84%
Well now, all the technology
is so advanced now.

00:42:24.647 --> 00:42:26.980 align:middle line:84%
Not in the future, in a science
fiction future, but now.

00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:28.880 align:middle line:84%
It's already
indistinguishable from magick.

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:32.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the
technology truly magick?

00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:36.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: It's all an
extrusion of human will.

00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:37.570 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:43.420 align:middle line:90%


00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:47.590 align:middle line:84%
All the world around us is
being constantly changed,

00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:51.580 align:middle line:84%
and shifted, and mutated into
something completely bizarre

00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:52.750 align:middle line:90%
by technology all the time.

00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:55.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look at how
much Uber or Facebook

00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:57.190 align:middle line:90%
have changed the world.

00:42:57.190 --> 00:43:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's just at the
beginning of it taking off.

00:43:01.570 --> 00:43:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And once we live in a
world of augmented reality,

00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:08.170 align:middle line:84%
of virtual reality, of
artificial intelligence,

00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:10.450 align:middle line:84%
of the internet of thoughts
as they're calling it--

00:43:10.450 --> 00:43:13.030 align:middle line:90%


00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:15.767 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how, but
people can control computers

00:43:15.767 --> 00:43:16.600 align:middle line:90%
with their thoughts.

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:18.808 align:middle line:84%
And they'll be able to have
an internet where they're

00:43:18.808 --> 00:43:20.140 align:middle line:90%
sending thoughts to each other.

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:22.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's scary, isn't it?

00:43:22.690 --> 00:43:24.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: How do we
even deal with that?

00:43:24.610 --> 00:43:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And what I found is, at least
in my life, oddly enough

00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:34.000 align:middle line:84%
the idea of magick in all
these old books and traditions

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.240 align:middle line:90%
for dealing--

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:38.290 align:middle line:84%
they all tend to work
really well for that world.

00:43:38.290 --> 00:43:42.910 align:middle line:84%
Because we live in a
sorceress enchanted world now,

00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:43.760 align:middle line:90%
for better or worse.

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:46.010 align:middle line:90%
I sometimes wish we didn't.

00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:48.820 align:middle line:84%
I wish things were much more
prosaic and boring again,

00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:49.737 align:middle line:90%
as we probably all do.

00:43:49.737 --> 00:43:51.778 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where do we go
10 years from now, Jason?

00:43:51.778 --> 00:43:53.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: 10 years from now.

00:43:53.090 --> 00:43:55.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first
thing is going to be

00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:58.460 align:middle line:84%
structural unemployment
from artificial intelligence

00:43:58.460 --> 00:43:59.260 align:middle line:90%
and automation.

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:00.970 align:middle line:84%
All the truck drivers are
going to be out of work.

00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:02.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's hope
not, but you're right.

00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:03.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Let's hope not.

00:44:03.610 --> 00:44:06.295 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't want to be next
to a driverless truck, do you?

00:44:06.295 --> 00:44:07.962 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: Well, it turns
out they actually

00:44:07.962 --> 00:44:09.940 align:middle line:90%
crash way less than people.

00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:12.950 align:middle line:90%


00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:14.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My jury's out on that.

00:44:14.890 --> 00:44:16.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LOUV: But it's not
just going to be cars.

00:44:16.690 --> 00:44:18.760 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be white
collar professions.

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:21.390 align:middle line:10%
They're already having
AI journalists, you know?

00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:26.140 align:middle line:10%
And so we're looking
at a world where

00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:28.660 align:middle line:10%
work as we understand
it will be different

00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:30.940 align:middle line:10%
and will not exist
for many people.

00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that the best
case scenario for the next 10

00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:38.230 align:middle line:84%
years is that as work begins
to vanish to technology,

00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:40.460 align:middle line:84%
we get something like
universal basic income,

00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:43.283 align:middle line:90%
which I'm a big believer in.

00:44:43.283 --> 00:44:44.200 align:middle line:90%
But that's not enough.

00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:46.703 align:middle line:90%
People won't need to work.

00:44:46.703 --> 00:44:47.870 align:middle line:90%
They will have basic income.

00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:49.620 align:middle line:84%
But then, what do they
do with their time?

00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think that this
provides an incredible opening

00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:55.930 align:middle line:84%
and opportunity for people to
really adopt spiritual practice

00:44:55.930 --> 00:44:59.020 align:middle line:84%
without the disruption of
having to make a living.

00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's hope one day
they don't have artificial hosts

00:45:02.350 --> 00:45:03.670 align:middle line:90%
and guests.

00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:04.470 align:middle line:90%
You never know.

00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:05.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Exactly, right?

00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:06.370 align:middle line:90%
Well, they can do it already.

00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:07.570 align:middle line:90%
With AI, they can create.

00:45:07.570 --> 00:45:11.795 align:middle line:84%
There was somebody made an AI of
Joe Rogan that sounded exactly

00:45:11.795 --> 00:45:12.595 align:middle line:90%
like him.

00:45:12.595 --> 00:45:14.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They morphed him
right in there, didn't they?

00:45:14.410 --> 00:45:15.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: It's crazy!

00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:16.780 align:middle line:90%
So it's already here, in a way.

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:18.488 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
get a hold of you?

00:45:18.488 --> 00:45:21.400 align:middle line:10%
>>LOUV: So if you're interested
in the magick classes,

00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:24.402 align:middle line:10%
it's magick.me
M-A-G-I-C-K dot M-E.

00:45:24.402 --> 00:45:26.860 align:middle line:10%
And there's actually a free
course that you can start with.

00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:30.280 align:middle line:84%
It's an eight day
course and free e-book.

00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:37.050 align:middle line:10%
You can get that at
free.magick.me/offer And

00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:37.850 align:middle line:10%
that's all there.

00:45:37.850 --> 00:45:40.930 align:middle line:10%
You can track me
at JasonLouv.com

00:45:40.930 --> 00:45:43.878 align:middle line:10%
That's got all my books and also
the link to the magick classes.

00:45:43.878 --> 00:45:46.420 align:middle line:10%
Everything I've done is there,
and social media is all there.

00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:48.595 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jason, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:45:48.595 --> 00:45:49.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LOUV: Thanks, George.

00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:50.220 align:middle line:90%
It's a big honor.

00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:53.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is fascinating--
black magick, white magick,

00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:55.420 align:middle line:90%
and how it affects humankind.

00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:59.120 align:middle line:84%
What will the next 10
or 15 years be like?

00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:00.440 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:04.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:46:04.210 --> 00:46:09.878 align:middle line:90%
