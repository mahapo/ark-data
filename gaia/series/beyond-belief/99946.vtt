00:00:05.697 --> 00:00:07.530 align:middle line:84%
>>TY BOLLINGER: Hello,
this is Ty Bollinger,

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.990 align:middle line:84%
and on this episode of "Beyond
Belief" with George Noory,

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to help you to
decipher what are the truths

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.380 align:middle line:84%
and what are the myths
concerning this oftentimes

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.560 align:middle line:90%
deadly disease of cancer.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.012 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And I
think many people today don't

00:00:19.012 --> 00:00:20.220 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going keep on

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.830 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.820 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.590 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:37.072 align:middle line:90%


00:00:37.072 --> 00:00:39.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And
welcome to "Beyond Belief,"

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.940 align:middle line:10%
You know, in my earlier
edition with Ty Bollinger,

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.650 align:middle line:10%
we talked about
cancer and how people

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.060 align:middle line:10%
can build their
immune system to help

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.450 align:middle line:10%
fight this incredible,
horrible disease.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.590 align:middle line:84%
"Cancer: Step Outside
the Box" is a bestseller

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.610 align:middle line:84%
by Ty Bollinger who has
taken it upon himself almost

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.220 align:middle line:84%
like a personal mission
to let the world know

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.209 align:middle line:90%
about the dangers of cancer.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:08.776 align:middle line:84%
Something, of course,
Ty, you just won't stop.

00:01:08.776 --> 00:01:10.400 align:middle line:10%
>>BOLLINGER: Well,
I won't because it's

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.775 align:middle line:10%
a passion of mine
to help people,

00:01:11.775 --> 00:01:14.710 align:middle line:10%
and it's a passion of mine
to help people to prevent

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.250 align:middle line:10%
this dreaded diseases that
according to the World Health

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.927 align:middle line:10%
Organization, 41% of people
alive today will face cancer.

00:01:20.927 --> 00:01:21.885 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's a huge.

00:01:21.885 --> 00:01:23.595 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: I want to help--
it's huge, it's a pandemic.

00:01:23.595 --> 00:01:24.710 align:middle line:90%
Because it's worldwide.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:25.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Four out of ten people.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.181 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: Yeah.

00:01:26.181 --> 00:01:27.471 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so I want to help people.

00:01:27.471 --> 00:01:28.960 align:middle line:84%
I want them to
have the knowledge

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.960 align:middle line:84%
to where if they have
that diagnosis, if they're

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.330 align:middle line:84%
part of that 41% of
people, that they'll

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.980 align:middle line:84%
have the wisdom
and the knowledge

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.260 align:middle line:90%
to make a good decision.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's what it's all about
to me is just helping people

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.726 align:middle line:90%
to be healthy.

00:01:39.726 --> 00:01:41.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ty, we see
episodes around the world

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.770 align:middle line:90%
like this Ebola situation.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.440 align:middle line:84%
Does that take away from trying
to do serious cancer research?

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.241 align:middle line:84%
Does that divert funds,
and people, and personnel?

00:01:53.241 --> 00:01:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: You know,
I think it probably

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.480 align:middle line:84%
does but it probably divert--
if we're talking about diverting

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.489 align:middle line:84%
them from conventional research,
I think that's not a big deal.

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:02.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Because the
conventional research

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.711 align:middle line:84%
is not really
producing much in terms

00:02:04.711 --> 00:02:06.830 align:middle line:90%
of treating cancer effectively.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.120 align:middle line:84%
Does it divert the funds away
from alternative treatments?

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.120 align:middle line:84%
Probably not, because
it's a different crowd.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.040 align:middle line:84%
What it does is, it
gets people's focus

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.290 align:middle line:84%
on something else,
and so maybe they're

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.998 align:middle line:84%
not as concerned about
cancer for a while

00:02:16.998 --> 00:02:19.635 align:middle line:84%
if they're afraid of
catching Ebola and dying

00:02:19.635 --> 00:02:20.980 align:middle line:90%
a horrible death.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.170 align:middle line:84%
But as far as the research,
I don't think as far

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.780 align:middle line:84%
as real research that
that's a big issue.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.190 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Now Ty, of course,
is a different animal.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.510 align:middle line:90%
He is not a doctor.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.110 align:middle line:84%
He is not a medical
practitioner.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.780 align:middle line:90%
He's a CPA.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.470 align:middle line:84%
He's a guy who's obsessed
with battling cancer.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.890 align:middle line:90%
Let's review a little bit, Ty.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.641 align:middle line:84%
We talked about this
in our first program.

00:02:42.641 --> 00:02:43.390 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: Yeah.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What got
you involved in this?

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: The
death of my father.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.400 align:middle line:90%
Died in 25 days from diagnosis.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.160 align:middle line:84%
Subsequent to that,
over a 7 year period,

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.690 align:middle line:84%
lost everyone in my
family-- both granddads,

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.640 align:middle line:84%
grandmom, cousin,
uncle, and mother.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And during that
whole period of time

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.764 align:middle line:84%
I was researching, learning
about the natural cancer

00:03:00.764 --> 00:03:02.180 align:middle line:84%
treatments, learning
about the way

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.385 align:middle line:84%
that the FDA persecutes
doctors that are using

00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:07.235 align:middle line:90%
the herbs to treat cancer.

00:03:07.235 --> 00:03:08.860 align:middle line:84%
Learned about the
way that some doctors

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.715 align:middle line:84%
have been thrown out of the
country or even thrown in jail.

00:03:10.715 --> 00:03:11.298 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:03:11.298 --> 00:03:12.640 align:middle line:90%
Clinics shut down.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.200 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: Clinics shut down.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.332 align:middle line:10%
Patients at gunpoint
with IVs of vitamin C

00:03:18.332 --> 00:03:19.290 align:middle line:10%
yanked from their arms.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
this is just wrong.

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:21.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is crazy

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.773 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: And so that's
what really got me into this.

00:03:23.773 --> 00:03:26.770 align:middle line:84%
I really never
dreamed that in 2006

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.100 align:middle line:84%
when I published my book
that it would've gotten

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.370 align:middle line:90%
the exposure that it did.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.310 align:middle line:90%
I remember that my--

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I knew it would.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: You knew it
would the first episode.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: You said it would.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.098 align:middle line:84%
And I appreciate that, and
I thanked you off the air,

00:03:37.098 --> 00:03:39.230 align:middle line:84%
you know, without the
exposure that you gave me,

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.062 align:middle line:84%
you took a chance on
me five years ago,

00:03:41.062 --> 00:03:43.020 align:middle line:84%
the book would not be
doing what it does today.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.940 align:middle line:84%
So I really
appreciate the chance

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.650 align:middle line:84%
that you took on putting a
no-name author on your show.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, people are
striving to be healthy,

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.600 align:middle line:84%
and I want to talk
about toxicity-- what's

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.670 align:middle line:84%
out there in the environment,
which I'm convinced

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.980 align:middle line:84%
contributes to this high rate of
cancer that we have worldwide.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:01.880 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: Yeah.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think if
you were to eliminate

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.490 align:middle line:84%
all those toxic events and
elements that are out there,

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.140 align:middle line:84%
cancer would still
be high, but it would

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.990 align:middle line:90%
be as widespread as it is now.

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.680 align:middle line:90%
Would you agree?

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: I would
agree with you,

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.940 align:middle line:84%
and so does the WHO, the
World Health Organization.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.788 align:middle line:84%
So does the American
Cancer Society.

00:04:18.788 --> 00:04:20.829 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, a
document that I referenced

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.860 align:middle line:84%
on the last show called,
Cancer Facts and Figures 2013,

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.890 align:middle line:84%
on the American Cancer Society
website as we sit here,

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.900 align:middle line:84%
it talks about the fact that
upwards of 85% of cancers

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.560 align:middle line:84%
are caused by
environmental toxins.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow, wow.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.069 align:middle line:84%
So that means 100 years
ago, that we had cancers--

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:37.110 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: Lower rates.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was at
a much lower rate.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Well,
that's why, because look

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.434 align:middle line:84%
at the difference between
100 years ago today, George.

00:04:41.434 --> 00:04:42.850 align:middle line:84%
Let's examine the
different things

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.130 align:middle line:90%
that we intake into our bodies.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.810 align:middle line:90%
Start with the air.

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.268 align:middle line:84%
A hundred years
ago, we didn't have

00:04:46.268 --> 00:04:48.974 align:middle line:84%
planes that were emitting
chemicals in their exhaust

00:04:48.974 --> 00:04:49.640 align:middle line:90%
that we breathe.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:50.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: A
hundred years ago,

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.624 align:middle line:84%
we did not have
pesticides on our food,

00:04:52.624 --> 00:04:54.040 align:middle line:84%
the farmers grew
things naturally.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Cars the
way we have today.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:55.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: A
hundred years ago wee

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.335 align:middle line:84%
didn't have exhaust from
cars, a hundred years ago

00:04:57.335 --> 00:04:59.180 align:middle line:84%
we didn't have electromagnetic
frequencies from all

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.250 align:middle line:90%
these electrical devices.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.140 align:middle line:84%
A hundred years ago,
we didn't have--

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Cellphones.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Cellphones,
genetically modified foods,

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.100 align:middle line:90%
the list goes on and on.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.990 align:middle line:84%
And if we look at the
cumulative effect--

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pesticides.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.688 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Pesticides,
fluoride in the water,

00:05:08.688 --> 00:05:11.190 align:middle line:84%
chlorine in water, I mean,
we could talk all half hour.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're killing us.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: They're killing us.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, it may not be intentional,
but the effect is the same.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.955 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, it
may be intentional.

00:05:16.955 --> 00:05:17.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: It
may be intentional.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It may be
intentional, and I'll

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.900 align:middle line:90%
tell you my definition of that.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:21.870 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: OK.

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.924 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They willingly know
that it's harming people.

00:05:24.924 --> 00:05:25.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: Oh.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To me,
that's intentional.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: There's no
doubt about that, George.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.318 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're probably
not out there saying,

00:05:30.318 --> 00:05:31.190 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.940 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
develop a pesticide

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.430 align:middle line:84%
to kill not only the weeds,
but all these people.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:38.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they
do it like that.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:39.460 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: No.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.168 align:middle line:90%
I agree, though--

00:05:40.168 --> 00:05:42.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they know
that if it leaks out,

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.050 align:middle line:90%
it's going to hurt people.

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: And they
know it's going to happen.

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:45.329 align:middle line:90%
So I would agree with you.

00:05:45.329 --> 00:05:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know if you
wanted to open up that bottle,

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.550 align:middle line:84%
or that can of worms, but
I would agree with you.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.120 align:middle line:84%
If it's knowing--
they know that it's

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.840 align:middle line:84%
going to hurt people or kill
them and they still do it,

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:53.890 align:middle line:90%
that is intentional.

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.807 align:middle line:84%
And here's some thing
that's very interesting.

00:05:55.807 --> 00:05:57.473 align:middle line:84%
I've got a lot of
contacts on the inside

00:05:57.473 --> 00:05:58.901 align:middle line:90%
of the pharmaceutical companies.

00:05:58.901 --> 00:06:01.150 align:middle line:84%
When they're doing their
strategic planning and their,

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.120 align:middle line:84%
let's say are they're taking
Zyloprex to market, just

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.910 align:middle line:90%
a fictional name.

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.010 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Right, Estimating how
much they're going to sell.

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:08.885 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: They know
that Zyloprex is going

00:06:08.885 --> 00:06:11.140 align:middle line:90%
to sell $10 billion worth.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.270 align:middle line:84%
They also know that
Zyloprex is going to,

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.090 align:middle line:84%
again, this is a
fictional drug, it's

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.745 align:middle line:90%
going to cause XYZ symptoms.

00:06:17.745 --> 00:06:18.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:18.870 align:middle line:90%
And deaths.

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:20.786 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: And they
know it's going to cause

00:06:20.786 --> 00:06:21.989 align:middle line:90%
an X percentage of deaths.

00:06:21.989 --> 00:06:23.905 align:middle line:84%
They already factored
in the legal settlements

00:06:23.905 --> 00:06:26.140 align:middle line:84%
that they're going to pay
to the people they kill,

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.360 align:middle line:84%
and they already have
the drugs in the works

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.610 align:middle line:84%
to treat these new three
diseases that they've created

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:31.700 align:middle line:90%
with the first drug, Zyloprex.

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:32.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.555 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: That's all part
of their strategic planning.

00:06:34.555 --> 00:06:35.200 align:middle line:90%
This is a fact.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's market share.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: It's market
share, it's money,

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:38.380 align:middle line:90%
it's the bottom line.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.920 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at the FDA,
they admit on their own website

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.100 align:middle line:84%
that each year in United
States alone, 100,000 people

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.620 align:middle line:84%
are killed by properly
prescribed prescription drugs.

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.810 align:middle line:90%
Not improperly prescribed.

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:56.407 align:middle line:84%
100,000 die from drugs that are
legal that are used properly.

00:06:56.407 --> 00:06:57.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutley.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.531 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: Something's wrong.

00:06:58.531 --> 00:07:01.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Born in Detroit, stayed
in St. Louis for so many years,

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:05.160 align:middle line:84%
watched a great beer
company, Anheuser-Busch,

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.330 align:middle line:90%
develop a marketing strategy.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And that was, well all
right, we've got Bud Light,

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.680 align:middle line:84%
and we've got Budweiser,
and we've got Michelob,

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.990 align:middle line:84%
but we need more brands in
order to increase market share,

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:22.020 align:middle line:84%
because we've sold these
brands at the highest

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.730 align:middle line:90%
percent we're going to sell.

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:27.470 align:middle line:84%
But in order to nip into that
and all these competitors,

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:31.710 align:middle line:84%
we need to come up with Bud
Light Lime, and this and that.

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:35.170 align:middle line:84%
Aren't pharmaceutical companies
doing that the same way?

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:39.405 align:middle line:84%
They need new pharmaceutical
drugs to increase market share.

00:07:39.405 --> 00:07:40.280 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: They do.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.719 align:middle line:84%
They've run out
of-- well, and one

00:07:41.719 --> 00:07:43.510 align:middle line:84%
of the other things
that we can talk about,

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:45.190 align:middle line:90%
too, is off label use.

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:48.180 align:middle line:10%
So there's-- some drug has
been developed for chemotherapy

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.970 align:middle line:10%
agents, for cancer, but these,
the patents have expired,

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.220 align:middle line:10%
they got a bunch of--

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:53.190 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's now
available at a--

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:55.040 align:middle line:10%
>>BOLLINGER: It's now
available to treat arthritis.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.250 align:middle line:10%
They're using chemotherapy
now to treat arthritis.

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:57.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.556 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: So you have
these off label uses,

00:07:59.556 --> 00:08:03.210 align:middle line:84%
but yeah, you have the newest
and latest disease that they're

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:05.560 align:middle line:84%
treating with the latest
and greatest drug, right,

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.784 align:middle line:84%
but it's just another
flavor of the same poison.

00:08:08.784 --> 00:08:09.950 align:middle line:90%
It's going to-- it's a drug.

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:12.230 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies are not sick,
George, because they

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:15.119 align:middle line:84%
are deficient in
Zyloprex or another drug.

00:08:15.119 --> 00:08:16.910 align:middle line:84%
We're not sick because
we're deficient-- we

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:19.201 align:middle line:84%
don't have cancer because
we're chemotherapy deficient.

00:08:19.201 --> 00:08:21.520 align:middle line:84%
We don't have cancer because
we're radiation deficient.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:25.100 align:middle line:84%
So by definition, you can't fix
these diseases by adding these.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.690 align:middle line:84%
You can temporarily put a
Band-Aid on the disease,

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:28.857 align:middle line:90%
but you got to fix the body.

00:08:28.857 --> 00:08:30.856 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we talked
about in the last show

00:08:30.856 --> 00:08:31.870 align:middle line:90%
was fixing the body.

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:33.940 align:middle line:84%
Interesting though that
you mention Busch beer.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.919 align:middle line:84%
I was in a grocery store
down in San Antonio

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:39.427 align:middle line:84%
going grocery shopping
about six months ago or so.

00:08:39.427 --> 00:08:41.510 align:middle line:84%
I was talking to this
little lady, little old lady

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:42.130 align:middle line:90%
from Pasadena, maybe.

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:43.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Little old
lady from Pasadena.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Yeah, and I can
just hear the Beach Boys.

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And talking about
GMOs in the yogurts.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:51.076 align:middle line:84%
Her husband is standing
over to the side,

00:08:51.076 --> 00:08:52.450 align:middle line:84%
and I'm talking
about the dangers

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:54.930 align:middle line:84%
of genetically modified foods,
whether they do cause cancer.

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:56.815 align:middle line:84%
He's shaking his head,
and he walks over to me

00:08:56.815 --> 00:08:58.140 align:middle line:84%
and he says, "Son,
you're right."

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.100 align:middle line:84%
He says, I was an executive
for a beer company.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.076 align:middle line:84%
I won't name them, but it's last
name of one of the presidents--

00:09:03.076 --> 00:09:04.450 align:middle line:84%
couple of the
presidents-- but it

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:07.250 align:middle line:84%
could be one of two companies,
so I'm going to leave it there.

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And he says, "We had two
different batches of beers.

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.760 align:middle line:84%
We had a batch that went
to the United States that

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.270 align:middle line:84%
had genetically
modified organisms,

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:16.120 align:middle line:84%
and we had the batch
that went to Mexico

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:16.940 align:middle line:90%
and the rest of the world--

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:17.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That did not.

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:20.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: That was clean of
genetically modified organisms.

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:22.130 align:middle line:84%
He said, "We are
shipping all the GMO

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:23.670 align:middle line:90%
beers to the United States."

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "And the
research that we've done

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.420 align:middle line:90%
show that it does cause cancer."

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.190 align:middle line:84%
So they know, but
they're doing it anyway.

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:29.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's scary.

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:30.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: It is.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:31.658 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is scary.

00:09:31.658 --> 00:09:35.310 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about things
in our environment.

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:36.480 align:middle line:90%
The water.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.140 align:middle line:84%
What are they
doing to the water?

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:41.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Well, about 70
years ago, maybe a little more,

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:44.380 align:middle line:84%
the water began
to be fluoridated.

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:47.295 align:middle line:84%
This was a scheme of Alcoa, the
aluminum giant in Pittsburgh.

00:09:47.295 --> 00:09:49.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To do something
with that chemical, right?

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:51.003 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: They
had a chemical waste

00:09:51.003 --> 00:09:52.550 align:middle line:90%
that was being manufactured.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:55.080 align:middle line:84%
They were producing aluminum,
one of the byproducts

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.750 align:middle line:90%
was toxic waste.

00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:00.660 align:middle line:84%
They were having to pay
a landfill to dump it.

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.459 align:middle line:84%
They hired Edwin Bernays,
the father of spin,

00:10:03.459 --> 00:10:04.250 align:middle line:90%
wrote a book, the--

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:06.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The great public
relations executive.

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:06.986 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: The best.

00:10:06.986 --> 00:10:09.860 align:middle line:84%
His book, "Propaganda," 70 years
later, still a best seller.

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He started
it, of course.

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.085 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: He
started the propaganda.

00:10:12.085 --> 00:10:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And they hired him
to spin it to where

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.080 align:middle line:84%
the American public and even
American Dental Association

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:17.580 align:middle line:90%
believed--

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:18.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Would fall for it.

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:19.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: --that fluoride
at one part per million

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.870 align:middle line:84%
was good for your teeth
to prevent cancer--

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:23.899 align:middle line:84%
or prevents
cavities, not cancer.

00:10:23.899 --> 00:10:25.440 align:middle line:10%
And that over the
course of a decade,

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.510 align:middle line:10%
he successfully executed
this propaganda campaign

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:31.190 align:middle line:10%
whereas even the ADA
in the early 1940s

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:33.130 align:middle line:10%
was adamantly
opposed to fluoride,

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:35.880 align:middle line:10%
because it causes brittle
bones, causes cavities,

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.370 align:middle line:10%
causes osteo sarcoma--
bone cancer--

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:40.330 align:middle line:10%
every toxicologist knows this.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: God, I remember
when I was a kid in school,

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:46.530 align:middle line:84%
my parents had signed me
up for fluoride treatments.

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:50.860 align:middle line:84%
They would come to the school
and we kids would be lined up.

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And I never wanted to do
it, but they insisted.

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:56.025 align:middle line:84%
And they would spray
you with fluoride.

00:10:56.025 --> 00:10:56.775 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: Yeah.

00:10:56.775 --> 00:10:58.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I mean, ugh.

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:00.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Yeah
and all the studies

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.670 align:middle line:84%
show that it causes
brittle teeth,

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:03.860 align:middle line:90%
it causes bones to brittle.

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And it-- the study, I think
2007, 2008 out of Harvard,

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:11.632 align:middle line:84%
causes osteo sarcoma in
boys and men especially,

00:11:11.632 --> 00:11:13.340 align:middle line:84%
and the reason is
because of their higher

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:16.950 align:middle line:84%
levels of testosterone,
they basically exacerbate

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:18.190 align:middle line:90%
the effects of the fluoride.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:21.950 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I had a
dentist who insisted

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:25.380 align:middle line:10%
that he take the mercury
fillings out of my teeth

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:26.630 align:middle line:10%
and replace them with ceramic.

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:27.713 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: Good for him.

00:11:27.713 --> 00:11:30.490 align:middle line:84%
Because mercury is one of
the most toxic heavy metals

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:34.950 align:middle line:84%
that we know, and we put
it in fillings six inches

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:37.375 align:middle line:84%
from your brain and it off
gases continually all day long.

00:11:37.375 --> 00:11:38.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Crazy.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:38.270 align:middle line:90%
Crazy.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:38.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: So that's
something as well.

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:39.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad you mentioned that.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.718 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he was smart
enough to take it out

00:11:41.718 --> 00:11:42.597 align:middle line:90%
as he was drilling.

00:11:42.597 --> 00:11:43.930 align:middle line:90%
He didn't want me to swallow it.

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:45.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Well, sure, yeah,
he probably put a dam in there.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:46.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:47.675 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: He
had a suction, he

00:11:47.675 --> 00:11:49.340 align:middle line:84%
had-- you have to
do it properly,

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:50.960 align:middle line:84%
because if you
get those mercury,

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.960 align:middle line:84%
we call them silver
fillings, but they're really

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.417 align:middle line:84%
50% mercury, if you get
those taken out improperly

00:11:55.417 --> 00:11:57.250 align:middle line:84%
it can be more damage
done to your body than

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:59.700 align:middle line:84%
before because you just spilled
it all into your system.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:03.025 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you have filters
that take fluoride out?

00:12:03.025 --> 00:12:03.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: You can.

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:04.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.190 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
if you're wealthy,

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:08.950 align:middle line:84%
you can get a reverse osmosis
system for the whole house.

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:09.950 align:middle line:90%
Most people don't have--

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:11.625 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's just attached
right down there, right?

00:12:11.625 --> 00:12:12.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Yeah,
most people don't

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.130 align:middle line:84%
have seven grand sitting
around, or 10 grand

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:16.490 align:middle line:84%
to do a whole house filter,
so the next best thing

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:20.490 align:middle line:84%
is what we use, it's called a
Big Berkey, or a Berkey Light.

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:23.600 align:middle line:84%
They have fluoride filters, and
chlorine, and lead, arsenic,

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.930 align:middle line:90%
it's all built into one.

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:26.000 align:middle line:84%
You can get all of
that out of there,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.370 align:middle line:90%
and it's just a gravity filter.

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:28.828 align:middle line:84%
So you put on your
counter, pour it

00:12:28.828 --> 00:12:30.250 align:middle line:84%
in the top, filters
to the bottom,

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:31.320 align:middle line:90%
you have clean water that way.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And you can get that for
a couple hundred bucks.

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:34.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you recommend
every house do something?

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:36.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: I would recommend
every house do something,

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:38.279 align:middle line:84%
because most of the water,
especially if you're living

00:12:38.279 --> 00:12:40.540 align:middle line:84%
in a big city, you're
getting exposed to a lot of--

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:40.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my gosh.

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:41.990 align:middle line:10%
>>BOLLINGER: --lead,
arsenic, chlorine,

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:44.540 align:middle line:10%
fluoride in your water,
compromising your immune system

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:45.670 align:middle line:10%
and even causing cancer.

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:46.720 align:middle line:10%
That's a number one.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:50.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Used to have a
horse farm in Illinois,

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:52.640 align:middle line:84%
and the nearby farmers
would come up to me

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:55.930 align:middle line:84%
and say, take a cup
of bleach and just

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:58.230 align:middle line:90%
dump it down your well hole.

00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it was
like poison, right?

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:01.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm saying, what?

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:05.410 align:middle line:84%
But they say don't worry about
it, you've got a lot of water

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:06.190 align:middle line:90%
down there.

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:09.790 align:middle line:84%
Take a cup of bleach, it
kills organisms down there.

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:10.830 align:middle line:90%
So I would do that.

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:13.500 align:middle line:84%
I would never have that
taste, but in the beginning

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:14.860 align:middle line:90%
it scared the heck out of me.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:16.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Well you know
the thing is with bleach,

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:18.935 align:middle line:84%
with chlorine, it kills a
lot of the bad pathogens.

00:13:18.935 --> 00:13:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying that that's
a bad thing in the water supply,

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:23.980 align:middle line:84%
because that gives
us clean water

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:26.110 align:middle line:84%
and it stops a lot
of the bad bacteria

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:27.600 align:middle line:90%
that we would be drinking.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.600 align:middle line:84%
The problem with it is that
it also kills good bacteria.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:31.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:33.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: And so if you're
drinking chlorinated water,

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:36.870 align:middle line:84%
which is sometimes a necessary
evil in certain places,

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:39.854 align:middle line:84%
then you need to be replenishing
your body with probiotics,

00:13:39.854 --> 00:13:42.020 align:middle line:84%
which replenish the good
flora, or the good bacteria

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:42.520 align:middle line:90%
in your gut.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.830 align:middle line:84%
Because 70% of
your immune system,

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:46.670 align:middle line:84%
which is your main
defense against cancer

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:49.054 align:middle line:84%
and other diseases, is in
your intestinal lining,

00:13:49.054 --> 00:13:50.470 align:middle line:84%
the epithelial
lining in your gut.

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:50.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: So you have
to replenish that flora

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:54.660 align:middle line:84%
so your immune system
is functioning properly

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:55.900 align:middle line:84%
and you can defend
off against disease.

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:57.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and that's one
of the things you mention here

00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.670 align:middle line:84%
in "Cancer, Step
Outside the Box."

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:03.525 align:middle line:84%
You are telling us how to build
natural things in your body.

00:14:03.525 --> 00:14:04.400 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: Exactly.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.025 align:middle line:84%
And as I mentioned
in the last episode,

00:14:06.025 --> 00:14:09.300 align:middle line:84%
I don't go over-- nothing
in this book cures cancer.

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.440 align:middle line:84%
Nothing that I talk
about cures cancer.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.150 align:middle line:84%
What these treatments,
these supplements,

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:16.890 align:middle line:84%
these natural protocols do
is, they supply your body

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:18.415 align:middle line:84%
with the food,
with the nutrients,

00:14:18.415 --> 00:14:19.290 align:middle line:90%
with the ammunition--

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:19.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To help fight it.

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:22.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: --that it needs
to where it does the work.

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:25.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you look at a
cancer cell on a microscope,

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.790 align:middle line:84%
under a microscope,
what would it look like?

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Well,
they're clearly different,

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:34.595 align:middle line:84%
as far as the size, the
shape from normal cells.

00:14:34.595 --> 00:14:35.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:36.250 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Kind
of hard to describe

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:37.330 align:middle line:90%
without showing you a slide.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:38.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they like,
ugly-looking, or what?

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:40.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: They're,
whereas a normal cell will

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:43.630 align:middle line:84%
have a-- kind of a uniform
shape, a lot of times,

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:46.480 align:middle line:84%
cancer cells have a kind of
a more of a blob-like shape.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.440 align:middle line:10%
So they're a different
shape, they--

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:51.790 align:middle line:10%
the mitochondria lot of times
is noticeably a different shape,

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:52.960 align:middle line:10%
a different size.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.710 align:middle line:10%
And so they're very
distinguishable from--

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:56.090 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And they
replicate themselves

00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:56.964 align:middle line:10%
to stay alive, right?

00:14:56.964 --> 00:14:58.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: They
replicate very fast,

00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:59.850 align:middle line:90%
and they don't want to die.

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:01.850 align:middle line:10%
That's one of the main
things about cancer cells

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:05.740 align:middle line:10%
is that the P53 gene in your
body, which is the gene that

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:08.570 align:middle line:10%
turns on programmed cell death,
because you see, as we're

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:11.280 align:middle line:10%
sitting here, millions of
cells are dying and are

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.040 align:middle line:10%
being replaced.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:12.820 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They're coming back.

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:13.930 align:middle line:10%
>>BOLLINGER: All the time.

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:17.460 align:middle line:10%
Cancer cells, that natural
mechanism to turn off and die

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:18.820 align:middle line:10%
has been eliminated.

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:20.380 align:middle line:84%
So they live forever,
in other words.

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:20.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: So they keep
growing, they keep multiplying.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So there's just
more, and more, and more.

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:26.460 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: So some of these
treatments that are in my book,

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:28.554 align:middle line:84%
and even some of them
that aren't in my book,

00:15:28.554 --> 00:15:29.970 align:middle line:84%
the way that they
treat cancer is,

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:32.750 align:middle line:84%
they turn back on the
body's natural mechanism

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:36.260 align:middle line:84%
in those cancer cells to
kill, to die, to die off,

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:37.730 align:middle line:90%
apoptosis is what's it's called.

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:37.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:39.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER:
Programmed cell death.

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And so that's one of the ways
that they attack the cancer

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:44.010 align:middle line:84%
cells, is they turn back on that
communication and the cancer

00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:47.180 align:middle line:84%
says hey, I'm supposed
to die, and it dies.

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:49.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isn't it
true that this planet

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:53.160 align:middle line:84%
possesses everything
we need to fight

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.225 align:middle line:90%
diseases in a very natural way?

00:15:55.225 --> 00:15:56.100 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: It does.

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:57.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We just
need to find them.

00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:59.585 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: This planet
possesses everything

00:15:59.585 --> 00:16:02.810 align:middle line:84%
that we need to fight
disease, including weed, OK?

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:05.270 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the treatments
that's in my book, hemp.

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:07.019 align:middle line:84%
It's a very, very
effective treatment.

00:16:07.019 --> 00:16:07.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's huge.

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:08.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: Against cancer.

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:09.253 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hemp oil is good.

00:16:09.253 --> 00:16:10.280 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: Hemp oil.

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.720 align:middle line:84%
The first study that I'm aware
of that was done on hemp,

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:17.900 align:middle line:84%
and I call it hemp or
cannabis, not marijuana.

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:19.900 align:middle line:84%
Because marijuana was a
term that was developed,

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:22.890 align:middle line:84%
it was coined by the DEA
in the 1930s when they were

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:24.499 align:middle line:90%
trying to demonize a plant.

00:16:24.499 --> 00:16:25.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:25.400 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: OK?

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And then they want us to believe
that if you smoke marijuana,

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:32.830 align:middle line:84%
that the Mexicans and the blacks
are going to rape white women.

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:34.970 align:middle line:84%
That was-- it was a
very racist campaign.

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:36.470 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
I've got quotes

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:38.340 align:middle line:84%
from on the floor
of the US Senate

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:40.970 align:middle line:84%
that says that
marijuana is a bad thing

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:43.450 align:middle line:84%
because if black men smoke
it, they think that they're

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:44.479 align:middle line:90%
equal to white men.

00:16:44.479 --> 00:16:46.270 align:middle line:84%
Now can you think of
a more racist comment?

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:46.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unbeleviable.

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:49.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: This was said by
senators of the United States.

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:50.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Times have changed.

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:51.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: They
have changed, but--

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:52.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To a point.

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:53.950 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: Yeah, to a point.

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:56.500 align:middle line:84%
But this was made illegal in
the '30s, and until the '30s,

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:59.202 align:middle line:84%
hemp oil was in every
pharmacy in the United States.

00:16:59.202 --> 00:17:01.660 align:middle line:84%
Big pharmaceutical companies,
along with the paper industry

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:02.995 align:middle line:90%
and the news-- the paper--

00:17:02.995 --> 00:17:03.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hearst.

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:05.166 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Hearst--
Randolph Seymour Hearst.

00:17:05.166 --> 00:17:08.060 align:middle line:84%
They joined forces and
they banned this plant.

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:10.050 align:middle line:84%
So I called him it hemp,
I call it cannabis.

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:13.339 align:middle line:84%
The first study on cannabis that
I'm aware of, it was done 1973,

00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:15.140 align:middle line:84%
University of Virginia
Medical School.

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:18.930 align:middle line:84%
This was right after tricky Dick
declared war on cancer, the war

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:19.670 align:middle line:90%
on drugs.

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:22.430 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to show
that hemp causes cancer.

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:24.950 align:middle line:84%
The study showed that it
cured or mitigated three

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:26.319 align:middle line:90%
different kinds of cancer.

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:28.652 align:middle line:84%
They buried the study for 20
years, it was not released.

00:17:28.652 --> 00:17:31.321 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is easy for them
to manipulate the public.

00:17:31.321 --> 00:17:32.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: Yeah.

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:33.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Weapons of
mass destruction.

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:33.950 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: Yeah.

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:35.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You name it.

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:36.160 align:middle line:90%
The Gulf of Tonkin.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:36.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: Yeah.

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:40.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just to be able to
change the mindset by simply

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:41.654 align:middle line:90%
an outright lying.

00:17:41.654 --> 00:17:43.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: And that's
what they did with cannabis,

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:45.111 align:middle line:90%
that's what they did with hemp.

00:17:45.111 --> 00:17:48.420 align:middle line:84%
Because every study since
1973 that I'm aware of--

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:53.029 align:middle line:84%
I'm not aware of one study that
shows that hemp causes cancer.

00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:55.070 align:middle line:84%
But you always hear, you
don't want to smoke pot,

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:55.980 align:middle line:90%
because you'll get lung cancer.

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.715 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the incidence of
lung cancer in smokers of hemp

00:17:58.715 --> 00:18:01.780 align:middle line:84%
is not greater than
those that don't smoke it

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:03.570 align:middle line:84%
because the medicinal
effects of the THC.

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And I see there's two different
kinds of cannabinoids in hemp,

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:07.470 align:middle line:90%
in cannabis.

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:10.480 align:middle line:84%
Cannabinoids are the chemicals
in it that are medicinal.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.560 align:middle line:84%
There's THC, which is
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol,

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.224 align:middle line:84%
that's the
psychoactive component.

00:18:15.224 --> 00:18:17.140 align:middle line:84%
So if you smoke a big
joint with a lot of TCH,

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:18.580 align:middle line:90%
it'll get you high.

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:21.902 align:middle line:84%
But CBD, cannabidiol, is
another chemical constituent,

00:18:21.902 --> 00:18:25.560 align:middle line:84%
it's a medicine, a medicinal
effect of the hemp plant.

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.207 align:middle line:90%
Has no psychoactive component.

00:18:27.207 --> 00:18:29.123 align:middle line:10%
So you can smoke that
until the cows come home

00:18:29.123 --> 00:18:30.206 align:middle line:10%
and you'll never get high.

00:18:30.206 --> 00:18:32.375 align:middle line:10%
Many of the hemp oils
today just have high CBD.

00:18:32.375 --> 00:18:34.250 align:middle line:10%
They don't have the THC
because you-- or only

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:37.700 align:middle line:10%
in certain states, Colorado,
California, Montana, Washington

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:38.200 align:middle line:10%
State.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:38.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Washington State now.

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.216 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Handful
of states you

00:18:40.216 --> 00:18:41.850 align:middle line:90%
can get medicinal marijuana.

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:43.280 align:middle line:90%
Other than that, you can't.

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:44.180 align:middle line:90%
But high CB--

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:44.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That will change.

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.056 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: And it will change,
and the tide is changing.

00:18:47.056 --> 00:18:48.745 align:middle line:84%
But you get oil
that's high in CBD,

00:18:48.745 --> 00:18:51.370 align:middle line:84%
you can buy it in all 50 states,
get it delivered to your door.

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And the high CBD hemp
oil, the cannabidiol oil--

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
do, just drop in water?

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:58.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Well, you know,
you put it on your tongue,

00:18:58.330 --> 00:18:59.310 align:middle line:90%
sublingual.

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:00.815 align:middle line:84%
It's like a big,
thick, black paste

00:19:00.815 --> 00:19:02.250 align:middle line:84%
that you put one drop
under your tongue,

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:03.520 align:middle line:84%
you let it dissolve
in your blood,

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.450 align:middle line:84%
you know, you have a big blood
supply under your tongue,

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:06.460 align:middle line:90%
goes into your body.

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:11.040 align:middle line:84%
Very effective at cancer,
epilepsy, MS, amazing.

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:12.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A booster.

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:14.142 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: It just-- it causes
your body to function the way

00:19:14.142 --> 00:19:14.640 align:middle line:90%
it's supposed to.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.200 align:middle line:84%
It fills up the
cannabinoid, it's

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.000 align:middle line:84%
called the
endocannabinoid system,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.930 align:middle line:84%
these cannabinoid receptors that
are on every cell of your body.

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:23.110 align:middle line:84%
It causes your body
to work properly.

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And there was a story
of a little girl

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.210 align:middle line:84%
that was having
something like 300

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:28.540 align:middle line:90%
epileptic seizures every day.

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:29.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 300?

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:29.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: 300.

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:31.000 align:middle line:84%
She was in constant
seizure all day long.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:31.833 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my God.

00:19:31.833 --> 00:19:34.574 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: They tried
every big medicine treatment

00:19:34.574 --> 00:19:35.240 align:middle line:90%
that they could.

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing worked?

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:36.646 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: Nothing worked.

00:19:36.646 --> 00:19:38.704 align:middle line:84%
They put her on hemp
oil, high CBD hemp oil.

00:19:38.704 --> 00:19:39.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like you just said?

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:42.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Just the
cannabidiol, not THC.

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:42.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, under the tongue.

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:44.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: No
psychoactive effect.

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:46.847 align:middle line:84%
And within a few months, she
was down to one seizure day.

00:19:46.847 --> 00:19:47.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Miraculous.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:48.846 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: Really amazing.

00:19:48.846 --> 00:19:51.122 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're big
believer in detoxifying?

00:19:51.122 --> 00:19:51.830 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: Yes.

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:53.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Explain that.

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:55.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Well, we've
talked about the impact

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:56.889 align:middle line:90%
that environmental toxins have.

00:19:56.889 --> 00:19:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Even the American
Cancer Society says

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:00.560 align:middle line:84%
we're getting cancer
because we're toxic.

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:01.944 align:middle line:84%
So in order to
get that body back

00:20:01.944 --> 00:20:03.610 align:middle line:84%
to functioning the
way it's supposed to,

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:05.240 align:middle line:84%
we have to take those
toxins that we've

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.820 align:middle line:84%
absorbed through our
air, through the lungs,

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:09.782 align:middle line:84%
through our body,
food that we eat,

00:20:09.782 --> 00:20:12.240 align:middle line:84%
everything that we're getting
from all different directions

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.390 align:middle line:84%
that's making us toxic, and
we get rid of them, right?

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:16.598 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everybody knows if
your toilet's overflowing,

00:20:16.598 --> 00:20:19.082 align:middle line:84%
you call the Roto-Rooter
guy to unplug the pipes.

00:20:19.082 --> 00:20:20.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or get that plunger.

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:21.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Or you
get the plunger.

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.550 align:middle line:84%
But you don't just call
the janitor every day

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:25.760 align:middle line:84%
to mop up the mess, because
you didn't fix anything.

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.460 align:middle line:90%
You got to detoxify the system.

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:29.227 align:middle line:84%
And that's the same
way with our bodies.

00:20:29.227 --> 00:20:31.060 align:middle line:84%
We have to detoxify,
and not just the colon,

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.520 align:middle line:84%
but our liver, our
kidneys, our blood.

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:34.380 align:middle line:90%
Parasite cleanses.

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:36.810 align:middle line:84%
Were being just overwhelmed,
our immune system's

00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:37.890 align:middle line:90%
overwhelmed with toxins.

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:40.430 align:middle line:84%
So we have to get rid of
them, we have to sweat.

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:43.255 align:middle line:84%
Many people today, George, they
work at a desk all day long.

00:20:43.255 --> 00:20:45.130 align:middle line:84%
The most exercise they
get is their clicking.

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:45.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:47.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: And I'm not
making fun, that's what I do.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:47.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For the
rest, that's it.

00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:48.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: I do that.

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:49.420 align:middle line:90%
That's why I exercise every day.

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:50.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know, I work
our four days a week.

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:50.940 align:middle line:90%
You know, you have to do that.

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:53.562 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: I exercise-- I
exercise almost every day.

00:20:53.562 --> 00:20:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And I jump on a mini
trampoline every day

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:56.790 align:middle line:84%
to get the lymphatic
system working.

00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:59.240 align:middle line:84%
That's a detoxify--
that's a detoxification

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:00.270 align:middle line:90%
system in our body.

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:02.810 align:middle line:84%
I sit in a far infared
sauna to sweat.

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:04.200 align:middle line:90%
Most people, they don't sweat.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:04.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:05.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: So I sit
in a sauna each night

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:08.180 align:middle line:84%
to sweat because our skin
is actually the largest

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:10.190 align:middle line:84%
organ of detoxification
in the body,

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:12.540 align:middle line:84%
but how many people do
you know that never sweat?

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:13.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Lots of people.

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:13.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: So we
have to detoxify.

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:15.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm one of them.

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:16.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: You
got to detoxify.

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:17.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's very important.

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:19.794 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Even under these hot
lights, I don't sweat a lot.

00:21:19.794 --> 00:21:21.335 align:middle line:10%
>>BOLLINGER: Well,
far infared sauna.

00:21:21.335 --> 00:21:22.085 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:21:22.085 --> 00:21:24.640 align:middle line:84%
You'll feel better than you've
felt in years when you get out

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.110 align:middle line:84%
of that thing, because your body
just got rid of these toxins.

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:28.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you thirsty?

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:28.770 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: You are.

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:29.870 align:middle line:84%
And afterwards, drink
plenty of water.

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:31.860 align:middle line:84%
Because you just sweated
out a lot, so replenish.

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And you know, you
drink something

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:33.919 align:middle line:90%
that's got electrolytes in it.

00:21:33.919 --> 00:21:36.135 align:middle line:84%
You want to be sure that
you keep the mineral

00:21:36.135 --> 00:21:37.010 align:middle line:90%
balance in your body.

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:37.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.526 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: I heard a story
of a couple months ago,

00:21:39.526 --> 00:21:42.530 align:middle line:84%
maybe six months ago now,
a high school athlete that

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:44.910 align:middle line:84%
was drinking two gallons
water or something after he

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:45.730 align:middle line:90%
would get real hot.

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:46.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was
too much, right?

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:47.180 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Well,
it killed him.

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:47.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Killed him?

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.050 align:middle line:10%
>>BOLLINGER: Threw off
the electrolyte balance.

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:50.500 align:middle line:10%
You want to be sure that you're
replenishing with electrolytes.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:50.820 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's interesting.

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:52.944 align:middle line:10%
>>BOLLINGER: Yeah, coconut
water is great for that.

00:21:52.944 --> 00:21:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How much of
this is common sense?

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:57.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Much of
this is common sense.

00:21:57.790 --> 00:22:00.180 align:middle line:84%
Much of this is
common sense, but it's

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:02.442 align:middle line:84%
knowledge that has
been hidden, and so

00:22:02.442 --> 00:22:04.150 align:middle line:84%
we don't hear from
our mainstream doctor,

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:06.730 align:middle line:84%
so we think it's not true,
even though innately, we

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:07.974 align:middle line:90%
know that it is.

00:22:07.974 --> 00:22:09.390 align:middle line:84%
And that even those
of us who know

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:12.442 align:middle line:84%
that it is, the importance is
taking this knowledge that's

00:22:12.442 --> 00:22:14.150 align:middle line:84%
in the book, or that's
in other-- I mean,

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:15.210 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of
great researchers,

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:17.335 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of great
books, it's out there today.

00:22:17.335 --> 00:22:19.839 align:middle line:84%
But taking that knowledge
and applying it, right?

00:22:19.839 --> 00:22:21.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, can't just
have it up here,

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:22.650 align:middle line:90%
you got to act on in your life.

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:24.066 align:middle line:84%
And if you take
all this knowledge

00:22:24.066 --> 00:22:26.720 align:middle line:84%
that you have, and you act
on it, we can prevent cancer,

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.590 align:middle line:84%
we can prevent disease,
but it takes action,

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:29.630 align:middle line:90%
it takes work on our part.

00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:31.005 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
would you say might

00:22:31.005 --> 00:22:34.770 align:middle line:84%
be the single most important
factor in building up that body

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:37.360 align:middle line:90%
system to fight cancer?

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.330 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: Nutrition.

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:39.890 align:middle line:84%
It's got to be the
most important.

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
George, that's

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:44.184 align:middle line:84%
the one area in which medical
doctors are not trained.

00:22:44.184 --> 00:22:45.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right, right.

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:47.475 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: I just finished
this documentary miniseries,

00:22:47.475 --> 00:22:49.430 align:middle line:84%
"The Quest for the
Cures," and I interviewed

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:50.610 align:middle line:90%
dozens of medical doctors.

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:53.180 align:middle line:84%
And I asked each one of them,
"How much training did you

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:55.980 align:middle line:84%
get in medical school
regarding nutrition?"

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And the answers
were anywhere from 0

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:01.500 align:middle line:84%
to 2 little hours on
one day of the week.

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:03.640 align:middle line:84%
They are not educated
in nutrition.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's what fuels
our cells, that's

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:07.600 align:middle line:84%
what gives our body
what it needs to run.

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.430 align:middle line:10%
So that's why
medical doctors are

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:11.690 align:middle line:10%
ignorant on this huge
piece of the puzzle

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:13.700 align:middle line:10%
as far as providing disease
and staying healthy.

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:15.033 align:middle line:10%
They're just not educated on it.

00:23:15.033 --> 00:23:16.320 align:middle line:90%
And it's not their fault.

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:17.940 align:middle line:84%
They just learn what they're
taught in medical school.

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
the medical schools

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.980 align:middle line:84%
have been co-opted
a long time ago

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:23.305 align:middle line:90%
by pharmaceutical companies.

00:23:23.305 --> 00:23:23.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:26.170 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about "Cancer-
Step Outside the Box."

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:28.997 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: This is a
book that is a health book.

00:23:28.997 --> 00:23:30.580 align:middle line:84%
It's not just a
cancer treatment book,

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:32.530 align:middle line:90%
it's a cancer prevention book.

00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:34.210 align:middle line:84%
It's a book that you
can read and learn

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:36.360 align:middle line:84%
how to become healthy,
how to stay healthy,

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:38.710 align:middle line:84%
what supplements to
take, what exercises

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:42.450 align:middle line:84%
to do, what devices that you
could have in your house,

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:45.990 align:middle line:84%
things to avoid, the things that
you should intake every day.

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:47.999 align:middle line:84%
And a heck of a lot
of really good--

00:23:47.999 --> 00:23:49.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You leave
no stone unturned?

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:50.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: I really
think that's the case,

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:52.935 align:middle line:84%
and that was really the
purpose was to kind of make

00:23:52.935 --> 00:23:55.935 align:middle line:84%
it a one stop shop for staying
healthy and preventing disease.

00:23:55.935 --> 00:23:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And I hope that it's-- you know,
it has helped a lot of people.

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And again, thank you
for the platform.

00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:01.720 align:middle line:90%
Because since that time--

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:02.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm a believer.

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:03.641 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: --the
sales of this book

00:24:03.641 --> 00:24:05.960 align:middle line:84%
have tripled since four years
ago when we first talked.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.168 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a message,
and we want to get that out.

00:24:08.168 --> 00:24:09.440 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about the DVD series.

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:12.016 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Well, the DVD
series, it's called "The Quest

00:24:12.016 --> 00:24:12.640 align:middle line:90%
for the Cures."

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.556 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the "Quest for
the Cures Continues."

00:24:14.556 --> 00:24:17.170 align:middle line:84%
We did this back in the
spring, and basically, it

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:19.440 align:middle line:84%
was me as an investigative
reporter traveling

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:22.651 align:middle line:84%
across the country interviewing
medical doctors, scientists,

00:24:22.651 --> 00:24:23.150 align:middle line:90%
physicists.

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:24.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like
"Supersize Me," huh?

00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:25.362 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: It was, it was.

00:24:25.362 --> 00:24:26.919 align:middle line:84%
And it was kind of
a reality TV show

00:24:26.919 --> 00:24:28.710 align:middle line:84%
feel where they followed
me in the airports

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:30.290 align:middle line:84%
and driving the rental
cars and all that.

00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:31.880 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
catches people's attention,

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:34.290 align:middle line:84%
you know, we're kind of a
little five second society that

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:35.748 align:middle line:84%
wants something
really interesting,

00:24:35.748 --> 00:24:36.957 align:middle line:90%
or our attention span's gone.

00:24:36.957 --> 00:24:38.040 align:middle line:90%
So we gave that to people.

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:39.720 align:middle line:84%
We wanted them to
be interested in it

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:41.270 align:middle line:84%
and we wanted them to be
able to share something

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:43.580 align:middle line:84%
like this with people to
empower them with knowledge,

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:45.560 align:middle line:84%
some of them might not
read a 500-page book.

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:47.440 align:middle line:10%
So that's why we did the DVD
series, and we were able--

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:47.580 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:50.080 align:middle line:10%
>>BOLLINGER: And we're able to
do it again here in the fall,

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:51.781 align:middle line:10%
only we expanded to 51 experts.

00:24:51.781 --> 00:24:54.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind of reaction
do you get from people?

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:55.576 align:middle line:90%
To the book, to the DVD series.

00:24:55.576 --> 00:24:57.200 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Wow,
you know, at first it

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.790 align:middle line:90%
was kind of a mixed bag.

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:02.870 align:middle line:84%
But over the years, it has
grown to be, I'd say 95%, 98%

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:03.720 align:middle line:90%
positive.

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.380 align:middle line:84%
But it's not because
the book's great,

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:07.310 align:middle line:84%
it's not because the
DVD series are great.

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:09.070 align:middle line:84%
It's because the
people are waking up.

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:10.886 align:middle line:84%
The people are--
innately, we know,

00:25:10.886 --> 00:25:12.760 align:middle line:84%
we're being lied to
about some of this stuff.

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:13.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:15.261 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: And this--
it resonates with people.

00:25:15.261 --> 00:25:17.190 align:middle line:84%
People realize
that this is true.

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:19.777 align:middle line:84%
We are being lied to, we
do need to take control

00:25:19.777 --> 00:25:21.360 align:middle line:84%
of our own health,
and there are a lot

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:23.320 align:middle line:84%
of things that we can
do to stay healthy,

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:26.047 align:middle line:84%
even though the medical system
wants us to rely on our doctor.

00:25:26.047 --> 00:25:27.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not opposed
to having doctors.

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:28.835 align:middle line:90%
You need good doctors.

00:25:28.835 --> 00:25:30.960 align:middle line:84%
But you also need to realize
that the power to heal

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:31.970 align:middle line:90%
is yours.

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:33.160 align:middle line:90%
We've been given that.

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.730 align:middle line:84%
And the knowledge is what
puts that into fruition.

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:38.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ty, what would
you say in your life

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:43.240 align:middle line:84%
has been probably the most
sobering story that is ever

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:45.750 align:middle line:90%
come across your career?

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:48.449 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Wow, you know,
it's one that I tell often,

00:25:48.449 --> 00:25:50.990 align:middle line:84%
and it was when we were doing
an interview a couple years ago

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:52.240 align:middle line:90%
on "Coast to Coast."

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:54.990 align:middle line:84%
We were talking about the
toxicity and the expense

00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:57.480 align:middle line:84%
of chemotherapy
drugs, and I told you

00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:01.050 align:middle line:84%
that I had been in contact
with a man that had spent

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:02.890 align:middle line:90%
$50,000 for experimental chemo.

00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:04.060 align:middle line:90%
One shot.

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:05.937 align:middle line:84%
You may remember the
show few years ago.

00:26:05.937 --> 00:26:06.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.978 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: And I think after
that we either had a caller,

00:26:08.978 --> 00:26:12.200 align:middle line:84%
or I got an email that said,
actually my mother just

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.970 align:middle line:90%
got an experimental chemo shot.

00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:16.440 align:middle line:84%
She went into her
doctor, she was healthy.

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:19.736 align:middle line:84%
She went in for an annual
exam, didn't have any symptoms.

00:26:19.736 --> 00:26:20.860 align:middle line:90%
They said, you have cancer.

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:23.110 align:middle line:84%
You're dead if you don't
take this experimental chemo.

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:25.080 align:middle line:90%
They gave it to her. $70,000.

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.470 align:middle line:90%
She died in two weeks.

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:26.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh.

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:28.553 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: And the
death certificate

00:26:28.553 --> 00:26:31.200 align:middle line:84%
said that the death was chronic
toxicity from chemotherapy.

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.840 align:middle line:84%
So she died from the
experimental chemotherapy

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:34.340 align:middle line:90%
agent.

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:35.935 align:middle line:90%
That just stuck in my mind.

00:26:35.935 --> 00:26:36.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tragic

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:37.643 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: It is tragic.

00:26:37.643 --> 00:26:39.315 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This mission
that you're on.

00:26:39.315 --> 00:26:40.970 align:middle line:90%
Are you ever going to stop?

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:42.000 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: No.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.120 align:middle line:84%
I can't stop, because
that's why I'm here.

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:46.120 align:middle line:84%
You know, we did
this last series,

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:47.970 align:middle line:84%
this "The Quest for
the Cures," and my wife

00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:48.955 align:middle line:84%
Charlene-- you know,
it's her mission,

00:26:48.955 --> 00:26:50.660 align:middle line:84%
too, it's our whole
family's mission--

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:53.250 align:middle line:84%
and the last interview
was an interview of her.

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And she said this,
what we're doing now

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.700 align:middle line:84%
is what we were put
here on Earth to do.

00:26:57.700 --> 00:26:59.460 align:middle line:84%
This is our mission
to help people.

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:01.060 align:middle line:84%
To help people to
gain knowledge,

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:03.660 align:middle line:84%
to help people to be healthy,
to help people to break free

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:04.552 align:middle line:90%
from all these lies.

00:27:04.552 --> 00:27:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And so if that's the mission
we've been put here for,

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:08.800 align:middle line:84%
we can't stop, because
that's why we're here.

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:09.966 align:middle line:90%
And it's what we love doing.

00:27:09.966 --> 00:27:12.090 align:middle line:10%
And there's nothing that
makes me feel better,

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:15.370 align:middle line:10%
puts a tear in my eye quicker
than somebody that says,

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:17.640 align:middle line:10%
"I read your book, or I
watched your DVD series

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.220 align:middle line:10%
and I was thinking
about doing this,

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:22.580 align:middle line:10%
but I realized that I could
go nontoxic, and I used it,

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:26.300 align:middle line:10%
and I'm alive five years
later because of your book."

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:29.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are doctors beginning
to support your work?

00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:31.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER:
Absolutely, they-- yes.

00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:33.044 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
that's changed.

00:27:33.044 --> 00:27:34.710 align:middle line:84%
Because at first,
they were kind of, ah,

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:37.647 align:middle line:84%
this is some CPA guy that's
writing a book on cancer,

00:27:37.647 --> 00:27:38.980 align:middle line:90%
and they didn't-- they thought--

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:39.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Some whack job, right?

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:41.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: -- I was kind
of on their territory.

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:44.260 align:middle line:84%
But now they realize, we're
all in the same fight.

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:46.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and you
clearly tell people

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:46.860 align:middle line:90%
you're not a doctor.

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:47.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BOLLINGER: I'm not a doctor.

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:50.125 align:middle line:84%
And those doctors that have
stepped outside the box that

00:27:50.125 --> 00:27:52.630 align:middle line:84%
are really looking at things
from a holistic perspective,

00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:54.364 align:middle line:84%
knowing that we need
to heal the body,

00:27:54.364 --> 00:27:56.030 align:middle line:84%
they realize we're
all in this together.

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:57.080 align:middle line:90%
It's not me against them.

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:59.371 align:middle line:84%
It's all of us as a team to
help humanity be healthier.

00:27:59.371 --> 00:28:01.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you know,
if you save one life,

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:02.230 align:middle line:90%
it's all worth it, isn't it?

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:03.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: Absolutely
is all worth it.

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.833 align:middle line:84%
And that's what my dad said
when he was dying of cancer.

00:28:05.833 --> 00:28:08.620 align:middle line:84%
If this helps people in the
future, it's all worth it.

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:09.169 align:middle line:90%
And it has.

00:28:09.169 --> 00:28:11.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ty, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:11.450 align:middle line:90%
We really appreciate the effort.

00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:13.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BOLLINGER: George, thank
you, I appreciate the platform.

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:14.351 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate what you're doing.

00:28:14.351 --> 00:28:16.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: "Cancer:
Step Outside the Box."

00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:21.760 align:middle line:10%
Very important that you begin
to take care of your own body,

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:25.090 align:middle line:10%
and build up your immune
system, and make sure it's

00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:27.380 align:middle line:10%
ready for the unexpected.

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:30.840 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and
this is "Beyond Belief."
