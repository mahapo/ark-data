>>What would you say
your specialty is?

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.170 align:middle line:90%
>>Well, I study Egyptology.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.550 align:middle line:84%
We were the first to
discover the tomb of Osiris.

>>Really?

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.725 align:middle line:84%
>>And we did this
through the use

00:00:18.725 --> 00:00:21.070 align:middle line:84%
of musical sound or
acoustical vibrations.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.120 align:middle line:84%
We use what is called ground
penetrating radar to penetrate

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.800 align:middle line:90%
the area of the Sphinx.

>>What do you think
might be in there?

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.200 align:middle line:84%
>>Artifacts that show that
ancients were in contact

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.670 align:middle line:90%
with cosmic intelligence.

>>We have to change
our consciousness.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.600 align:middle line:84%
We have to be more
prepared for working

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.810 align:middle line:84%
with multiple forms of
intelligence, beings that are

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.448 align:middle line:90%
beyond our dimensional reality.

>>The veils are
being lifted, George.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.030 align:middle line:84%
This is really the
fantastic moment.

welcome to "Beyond Belief."

JJ and Desiree
Hurtak are with us,

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.327 align:middle line:10%
founders of the Academy
for Future Science--

00:01:00.327 --> 00:01:01.660 align:middle line:10%
we're going to talk about that--

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.540 align:middle line:10%
which is an international
organization

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.120 align:middle line:10%
that kind of bridges
the gap between science

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.470 align:middle line:10%
and spirituality.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.270 align:middle line:84%
Desiree, JJ, welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
Thank you, George.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:11.853 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be with you.

00:01:11.853 --> 00:01:13.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You two
look great together.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.090 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: We've been busy.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.510 align:middle line:10%
We've been given the rare
opportunity of travel

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:19.813 align:middle line:10%
during the COVID shutdown.

00:01:19.813 --> 00:01:20.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:21.990 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: So we've been
in Latin America, and the Far

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.460 align:middle line:90%
East, and also in East Europe.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long have
you two been married?

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Well,
we say over 40 years,

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.230 align:middle line:84%
but I was only two
when we married.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.390 align:middle line:90%
So I keep it like that.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's fantastic,
and congratulations.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:33.270 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Thank you.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.187 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:01:34.187 --> 00:01:37.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, wherever
I go, your names

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.290 align:middle line:84%
come up in some form or fashion
about extraterrestrial life,

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.640 align:middle line:90%
spirituality--

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.870 align:middle line:90%
I mean, constantly.

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.102 align:middle line:84%
What would you say your
specialty is, Desiree?

00:01:48.102 --> 00:01:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
Well, actually, I

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.360 align:middle line:90%
grew up in the Florida area.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.080 align:middle line:10%
And when I was quite young,
I actually saw a light ship

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.280 align:middle line:10%
when I was in high school.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.930 align:middle line:90%
So that kind of directed me.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm very much into geometry.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.050 align:middle line:10%
I studied architecture.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.930 align:middle line:10%
But ultimately, it's
understanding who we are

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:04.920 align:middle line:10%
and why we're here.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How about you, JJ?

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.370 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: Well,
I study Egyptology.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.670 align:middle line:84%
I went to the Middle East to
look at the Coptic documents

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.440 align:middle line:90%
of early Christianity.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.960 align:middle line:84%
I realized back in
the '70s that there

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.780 align:middle line:84%
was a whole dimension
of spiritual cosmology

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.960 align:middle line:84%
that was left out of the
chapters of official history

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.260 align:middle line:84%
and that, ultimately, as we
would understand the higher

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.630 align:middle line:84%
aspects of what the ancients
thought about in Egypt,

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.750 align:middle line:84%
in the Holy Land, we would
see a higher connection.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My father was born
in Cairo, god rest his soul.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.580 align:middle line:90%
I never went there, never have.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.560 align:middle line:84%
But I'd love to see
the pyramids up front.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.977 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
Oh, you have to.

00:02:38.977 --> 00:02:39.840 align:middle line:90%
They're amazing.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And also, they're starting to
understand, really, more of

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.637 align:middle line:84%
why they're there at
that particular place.

00:02:45.637 --> 00:02:47.220 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: We were
the first to work

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.020 align:middle line:84%
with the scientific team that
discovered the tomb of Osiris.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.653 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: And we did
this through the use

00:02:52.653 --> 00:02:54.900 align:middle line:84%
of musical sound or
acoustical vibrations.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.330 align:middle line:84%
We had the opportunity
to beat Zahi Hawass

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.690 align:middle line:84%
by a couple of years because
he acknowledges obliquely

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.670 align:middle line:84%
that there was someone
there before that

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.940 align:middle line:84%
ruffled the feathers of the
tombs underneath the sand.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.937 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He won't quite admit
who was it, but that's Zahi.

00:03:08.937 --> 00:03:10.020 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: That's right.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.410 align:middle line:84%
How did you get
involved in all of this?

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.640 align:middle line:90%
What was your evolution?

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.015 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
Well, you know,

00:03:16.015 --> 00:03:18.460 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Hurtak had this
unique experience in 1973,

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.080 align:middle line:84%
which he put down in a book
called "The Keys of Enoch."

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, classic book.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
And actually, that

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.510 align:middle line:84%
was one of the first books that
showed that the King's Chamber

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.590 align:middle line:84%
star shaft pointed to Orion,
and the Queen's Chamber

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:32.455 align:middle line:90%
pointed to Sirius.

00:03:32.455 --> 00:03:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And of course, this
is really something

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.710 align:middle line:84%
that we started to understand,
now, when you start asking,

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.270 align:middle line:90%
where did ETs come from?

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And we think some of them came
from some of these systems

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.380 align:middle line:90%
that the ancients talked about.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.838 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: It was 20 years
before the more popular writer

00:03:45.838 --> 00:03:47.700 align:middle line:84%
Robert Bauval and
Adrian Gilbert.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.430 align:middle line:84%
But we had the opportunity
to actually bring cameras

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.030 align:middle line:84%
underground and actually
film the actual situations

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.982 align:middle line:84%
of the massive tomb that was
there underground, some 100

00:03:57.982 --> 00:03:58.940 align:middle line:90%
feet below the surface.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.232 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think the
pyramids, JJ, might have been

00:04:01.232 --> 00:04:04.440 align:middle line:90%
built by extraterrestrials?

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.930 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: I feel that they
are chronomonitors, or time

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.280 align:middle line:84%
measuring devices, essentially
large batteries that bring

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.510 align:middle line:90%
different energies together.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And in that sense, I think
the Egyptian scientists

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.310 align:middle line:84%
were influenced by higher
thoughts, higher communication.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.770 align:middle line:84%
We would call it a metaphysical
contact of some sort.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.175 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Christopher
Dunn theory.

00:04:24.175 --> 00:04:25.050 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: Correct.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.733 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: We go a little
bit beyond Christopher

00:04:27.733 --> 00:04:30.720 align:middle line:84%
in acknowledging that there
also were solar batteries

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.430 align:middle line:84%
that the Egyptians
were able to use.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.972 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
Or hydrogen energy,

00:04:33.972 --> 00:04:37.530 align:middle line:84%
which only took water,
sun, and Egyptian cotton,

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.530 align:middle line:84%
I often say, to get it going,
and maybe some of the metals

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.450 align:middle line:84%
that they had for
creating batteries.

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.150 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting--
we're spending some time now

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.530 align:middle line:84%
by Sedona, and you have the
three mesas of the Hopi.

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And people have considered
those like the three

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.595 align:middle line:90%
stars of the belt of Orion.

00:04:53.595 --> 00:04:54.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same thing.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: And you
go to the Lakota people,

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.343 align:middle line:84%
and they have something
called tah-nam-ni, Tayamni.

00:05:02.343 --> 00:05:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And that actually shows in
their ancient constellations

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.050 align:middle line:90%
that they had the Pleiades.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.790 align:middle line:84%
They drew a direct
line to the three stars

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.520 align:middle line:84%
of the belt and then
another line to Sirius.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, we just talked
about Sirius and Orion

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.450 align:middle line:84%
connecting with
the Great Pyramid.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:26.940 align:middle line:84%
Why did these cultures all
over the place talk about Orion

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.745 align:middle line:84%
and talk about Sirius and
also, many, the Pleiades.

00:05:29.745 --> 00:05:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were almost
obsessed with them.

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.037 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: I've talked to
many of the indigenous elders,

00:05:34.037 --> 00:05:35.850 align:middle line:84%
and they believe that
the area of the Hopi

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.060 align:middle line:84%
just to the north
of Sedona may be

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.250 align:middle line:84%
one of the landing places for
the extraterrestrial others.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.860 align:middle line:84%
So we are really working behind
the scenes with the elders

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.380 align:middle line:84%
throughout the world, looking
at these sacred places

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.665 align:middle line:90%
of possible contact.

00:05:50.665 --> 00:05:53.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you done any
work about the Hall of Records

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.357 align:middle line:84%
that Edgar Cayce
has talked about?

00:05:55.357 --> 00:05:56.940 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: Significant
work, looking

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.540 align:middle line:84%
at not one room or chamber
but multiple chambers that

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.070 align:middle line:90%
give a mathematical matrix.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.530 align:middle line:84%
So our interpretation
of the Hall of Records

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.880 align:middle line:84%
is the whole geometry of the
whole Giza Plateau exemplifying

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.730 align:middle line:84%
the different parts of the human
body, connected with the three

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:12.855 align:middle line:90%
stars in the belt of Orion.

00:06:12.855 --> 00:06:15.147 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Although
we did work with Boris Said.

00:06:15.147 --> 00:06:17.070 align:middle line:84%
And he was the one
you see sometimes-- he

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.620 align:middle line:84%
hit the sledgehammer--
on the sound.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And it showed that there
was a chamber in front

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.030 align:middle line:90%
of the paws of the Sphinx.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, they wanted to just
use small fiber-optic cable

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.530 align:middle line:90%
to get there.

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.710 align:middle line:84%
But they weren't
able to be permitted.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.680 align:middle line:84%
But we know that there are
chambers around the Sphinx

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.020 align:middle line:84%
itself, one on the
back, one on the side,

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.840 align:middle line:84%
and maybe, someone
says, on the head.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:39.840 align:middle line:90%
I haven't seen that one.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.948 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Robert Schoch
says there's a huge chamber

00:06:41.948 --> 00:06:43.240 align:middle line:90%
right in the front of the face.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.330 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: He's
absolutely correct.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:45.270 align:middle line:90%
We worked with Robert.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.645 align:middle line:84%
We were on a
different expedition

00:06:46.645 --> 00:06:48.240 align:middle line:84%
that we use what
is called ground

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.980 align:middle line:84%
penetrating radar and musical
acoustics to penetrate

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.550 align:middle line:84%
other areas off the area
of the Sphinx proper.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.507 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think might be in there?

00:06:59.507 --> 00:07:01.590 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: I think we're
going to find artifacts

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.230 align:middle line:84%
that show that ancients
were in contact

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:06.150 align:middle line:90%
with cosmic intelligence.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:10.140 align:middle line:84%
I think we're going to find
that that which is beneath Egypt

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:15.510 align:middle line:84%
in the grounds we call
the Giza Plateau indicate

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:18.510 align:middle line:84%
a depository or an
archive of information

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:23.190 align:middle line:84%
from various cultures, from
Gobekli Tepe and Turkey

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:25.650 align:middle line:84%
to other cultures
throughout the Middle East.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:28.530 align:middle line:84%
So the Great Pyramid
complex represents,

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:31.480 align:middle line:84%
really, the library, the
archive of the ancient world.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And when we find the proper
key, the proper vibration,

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.980 align:middle line:84%
we can bring societies and
civilizations together.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it conceivable
that the ETs helped

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.473 align:middle line:90%
humankind develop these things?

00:07:43.473 --> 00:07:44.640 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: Oh, definitely.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:48.540 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we see
this in the facial forms.

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:52.560 align:middle line:84%
As you may or may not know,
some of the classified documents

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.920 align:middle line:84%
years ago suggest
that the ET visitors

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.310 align:middle line:84%
had what we call
voice computers,

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:01.920 align:middle line:84%
like a staff or a stick, similar
to what the Egyptians would

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.690 align:middle line:90%
hold in ceremonies.

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:05.970 align:middle line:84%
We believe, Desiree
and I, that there's

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:07.680 align:middle line:90%
more to the Egyptian story--

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And I think so too.

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:10.950 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: --and the
Egyptians really resynthesized

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:11.867 align:middle line:90%
what was there before.

00:08:11.867 --> 00:08:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that went
into the biblical period

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:17.400 align:middle line:84%
with the Exodus story out of
Egypt, the pillars of light.

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.040 align:middle line:84%
And all of that would
suggest a higher technology

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.530 align:middle line:84%
that would produce this
so-called superluminal light

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:26.017 align:middle line:84%
beam that guided the ancients
to the promised land.

00:08:26.017 --> 00:08:28.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: And one
could say that the Atlanteans,

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:31.170 align:middle line:84%
when their civilization went
under-- close to Florida,

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:32.580 align:middle line:90%
the Bermuda Triangle, perhaps--

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.190 align:middle line:84%
that they did travel
to Egypt and brought

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:36.480 align:middle line:90%
some of their technology.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.570 align:middle line:84%
But I think that, when you
look at the alignments, again,

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:40.690 align:middle line:90%
with Orion--

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:43.957 align:middle line:84%
which, if you go to the
Mayans, they also see Orion--

00:08:43.957 --> 00:08:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same thing.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:46.582 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: --as
their father figure.

00:08:46.582 --> 00:08:49.260 align:middle line:84%
So there must be something
about the connection.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And you go to South
America-- there's

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.400 align:middle line:90%
something called chakana.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And that also was the Inca
cross, or the Andes cross,

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:00.340 align:middle line:84%
which is aligned, they
think, with Orion.

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:03.060 align:middle line:84%
So there must be
something of contact

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.850 align:middle line:84%
because this is what the
myths have been telling us.

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:08.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want you to see
a clip from Gaia's "Cosmic

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:13.410 align:middle line:84%
Disclosure," where Jason Shurka
talks about his experience

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:15.030 align:middle line:90%
meeting extraterrestrials.

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:16.477 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating.

00:09:16.477 --> 00:09:18.060 align:middle line:84%
>>So tell me about
the mission of TLS.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:18.860 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.570 align:middle line:84%
So their overall mission, the
reason why they're here today,

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:24.150 align:middle line:84%
is to help assist
and guide humanity

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:28.770 align:middle line:84%
in reaching a higher level of
awareness, specifically gamma.

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:31.080 align:middle line:84%
Gamma is referred to
what many people call

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.740 align:middle line:90%
fifth-dimensional awareness.

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:33.870 align:middle line:90%
That's what gamma is.

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:36.000 align:middle line:84%
That's this new
era, this new age

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.380 align:middle line:84%
that they're trying to assist
and guide us into reaching.

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:44.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, everybody-- agent, no
agent, just every human being--

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.090 align:middle line:84%
is born with a specific
frequency, a specific energy.

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:52.170 align:middle line:84%
So there's, as I was taught,
10 different dimensions

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:53.580 align:middle line:84%
that the universe
is made out of.

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.440 align:middle line:84%
Each dimension is
infinite, but there's

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.480 align:middle line:90%
10 different dimensions.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:01.140 align:middle line:84%
The name of the first five
is what modern day science

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:04.080 align:middle line:84%
calls brainwave frequencies,
or brainwave patterns.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.590 align:middle line:84%
So that's beta, alpha,
theta, delta, and gamma.

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:10.197 align:middle line:84%
Each one of those
frequencies are actually

00:10:10.197 --> 00:10:12.030 align:middle line:84%
different dimensions
on the spiritual level.

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:15.750 align:middle line:84%
Only science is more focused on
the physical phenomenon instead

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:18.300 align:middle line:84%
of the non-physical,
so they keep it

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.070 align:middle line:90%
limited to that understanding.

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:21.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Break down
what he just told us.

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Well,
I have to agree with him

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.070 align:middle line:84%
that the fifth
dimension is something

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:29.520 align:middle line:84%
that it looks like ETs are
operating in because they

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.690 align:middle line:90%
can come through walls.

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:34.620 align:middle line:84%
They can even take people out
of their beds through walls.

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.750 align:middle line:84%
So this is part
of this operation

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:37.980 align:middle line:90%
in the fifth dimension.

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.140 align:middle line:84%
He was showing-- and
I agree with that--

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.210 align:middle line:84%
that there's a
spiritual side, which

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:44.940 align:middle line:84%
means that these
beings are not just

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.220 align:middle line:84%
operating like fifth
dimension, but they're actually

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:48.480 align:middle line:90%
changing their frequencies.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.760 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole
frequency reality

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.680 align:middle line:84%
to going into the
fifth dimension.

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.490 align:middle line:84%
So if they took you right now,
George, to the fifth dimension,

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:57.710 align:middle line:84%
they'd actually
almost just change

00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:59.840 align:middle line:84%
the frequencies of
every cell of your body

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.640 align:middle line:84%
to be able to move into
that fifth dimension.

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:03.440 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: Yes.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.720 align:middle line:84%
I feel that we're moving not
only in the understanding

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:09.020 align:middle line:84%
of the fifth dimension, but
also the sixth dimension, which

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:12.420 align:middle line:84%
seems to be, also, an
information dimension.

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:13.940 align:middle line:84%
In our work with
Elizabeth Rauscher,

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.640 align:middle line:84%
a famous mathematician
and nuclear physicist,

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.860 align:middle line:84%
we were able to show
with her abilities

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.860 align:middle line:84%
that we are also working with
the eighth dimension, which

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.940 align:middle line:84%
is the mirror of the
first four dimensions.

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:27.292 align:middle line:84%
So information can transcend
the local realities.

00:11:27.292 --> 00:11:29.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: And
I think that's very

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.845 align:middle line:84%
important, to really
understand that,

00:11:30.845 --> 00:11:33.830 align:middle line:84%
that we're stuck in this
third-dimensional reality

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:37.640 align:middle line:84%
of length, width, and
height, fourth being time,

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:38.720 align:middle line:90%
according to Einstein.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.660 align:middle line:84%
Some people question
that, but let's go

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.130 align:middle line:90%
with normal scientists.

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:45.390 align:middle line:84%
But then what
happens after that?

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Hurtak actually
talks about 24 dimensions

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:53.000 align:middle line:84%
even though the standard
string theory is 10 dimensions.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.770 align:middle line:84%
If you go 1 more,
which is what's

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:58.590 align:middle line:84%
called the M-brane theory, you
can get into 11 dimensions.

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:03.110 align:middle line:84%
So this is trying to tie in,
how do all the forces that

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:05.000 align:middle line:90%
make us who we are--

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.810 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetism, gravity-- how
do they really come together?

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:10.340 align:middle line:90%
Where do they come together?

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:13.470 align:middle line:84%
And this is what these other
dimensions provide for us.

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.200 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: In
fact, we have a lot

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.090 align:middle line:84%
of documentation
on the internet--

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:20.420 align:middle line:84%
some of our mathematical
papers with Elizabeth Rauscher,

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:21.980 align:middle line:84%
even going back
to Burkhard Heim,

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:23.960 align:middle line:84%
the great German
physicist who first

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.490 align:middle line:84%
postulated that the information
was in the sixth dimension.

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:29.600 align:middle line:84%
So we are really excited
about the breakthroughs.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.420 align:middle line:84%
It's really not only the
Second Coming of Christ

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:34.040 align:middle line:84%
but the second
coming of science,

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:36.530 align:middle line:84%
science waking up to
its spiritual potential

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:39.500 align:middle line:84%
to recognize the human mind
works in other dimensions.

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we living
in a quantum universe?

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:42.890 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: Definitely.

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:43.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You believe that?

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:44.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
Yeah, definitely.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And the fifth
dimension supposedly

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:48.560 align:middle line:90%
gives us the many opportunities.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.750 align:middle line:84%
So quantum physics
tells us there's

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:52.190 align:middle line:90%
myriads of opportunities.

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:54.860 align:middle line:84%
When we bring it into the
fourth dimension of time,

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:56.360 align:middle line:84%
the third dimension
of where we are,

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.510 align:middle line:84%
we concretize, we choose
one of those opportunities.

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:04.860 align:middle line:84%
But technically-- and the Blue
Brain Project in Switzerland,

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:07.220 align:middle line:84%
which was connected with the
Technikon Institute there,

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:09.890 align:middle line:84%
says our own brains
are able to operate

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:12.320 align:middle line:84%
in at least seven
different dimensions, which

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:16.040 align:middle line:84%
means we can actually
pull into our reality

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.505 align:middle line:90%
these different possibilities.

00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:19.130 align:middle line:84%
So when people wake
up in the morning--

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:20.985 align:middle line:90%
I'll give a very simple example.

00:13:20.985 --> 00:13:22.610 align:middle line:84%
If you're negative
all the time, you're

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:25.880 align:middle line:84%
only pulling in energy
from these other realities

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:26.720 align:middle line:90%
and quantum field--

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:27.865 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're
pulling in negative energy.

00:13:27.865 --> 00:13:29.407 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
In negative energy.

00:13:29.407 --> 00:13:31.190 align:middle line:84%
So if you just shift
that, you can open

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:32.450 align:middle line:90%
to myriads of possibilities.

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:33.710 align:middle line:90%
You can become rich.

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:36.650 align:middle line:84%
You can even become famous,
or at least have the intention

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:38.090 align:middle line:90%
to move forward in your life.

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's so
important to realize.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.220 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: So like the ancient
pictures of India and China

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:44.870 align:middle line:84%
show with the multiple
heads over the human head,

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:51.230 align:middle line:84%
we are a cosmo dash
quantetary dash planetary dash

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:54.830 align:middle line:84%
human-ecological
collection of dimensions.

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:57.050 align:middle line:84%
And we can choose these
dimensions like a television

00:13:57.050 --> 00:14:00.380 align:middle line:84%
receiver, depending upon
our passion for life

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:03.200 align:middle line:84%
or a concept of who
we are in the universe

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.940 align:middle line:84%
or our understanding
of what we will call

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:06.770 align:middle line:84%
the mystical
experience-- the ability

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:10.070 align:middle line:84%
to step out of this physical
form into any number of bodies

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:11.930 align:middle line:84%
and recognize that
we are ultimately

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:13.280 align:middle line:90%
multidimensional beings.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How much of this
do we know as human beings?

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:18.228 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Well, more
and more with remote viewing--

00:14:18.228 --> 00:14:21.020 align:middle line:84%
this is our book "Mind Dynamics"
with Elisabeth Rauscher--

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:24.620 align:middle line:84%
how can we, or how did,
even, SRI, Stanford Research

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:28.580 align:middle line:84%
Institute, remote view
to an NSA headquarters

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:33.560 align:middle line:84%
and see in their cabinets top
secret file project names.

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:36.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this really means that
we have a greater ability.

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And ETs are actually showing
us that same ability.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:44.720 align:middle line:84%
They can talk-- some of them
can talk, from what we've heard

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.520 align:middle line:84%
and some of the
reports we've studied.

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.280 align:middle line:84%
But most of them use
telepathic communication.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And most of them are
connected with what

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:55.460 align:middle line:84%
we would call the quantum
field, which makes available

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.980 align:middle line:84%
all the information in
the entire universe,

00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:59.360 align:middle line:90%
if we want to talk about it.

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:02.360 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: Yeah, this 600-page
study by SRI is the real

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.650 align:middle line:90%
"X-Files."

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And you know from
the copy I gave you

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:07.490 align:middle line:84%
that the studies
were essentially

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:09.942 align:middle line:84%
to look at the limitation
of human consciousness.

00:15:09.942 --> 00:15:10.775 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:15:10.775 --> 00:15:13.940 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: And what they
concluded back in the 1980s

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.890 align:middle line:84%
and '90s was,
really, we are just

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:19.430 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning of recognizing
that the human body is what

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:22.100 align:middle line:84%
is called a biotransducer,
or a vehicle that

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.590 align:middle line:84%
can pull in any number
of information signals,

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:28.070 align:middle line:84%
process this, and improve
the situation of human life.

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:30.500 align:middle line:84%
Or we can retreat
back into the closet

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.750 align:middle line:84%
and see ourselves merely as
three-dimensional beings that

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:36.490 align:middle line:84%
have evolved out of the
biological ooze of Mother

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:37.290 align:middle line:90%
Earth.

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:40.400 align:middle line:84%
We are, essentially, spiritual
beings in human form.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a theoretical
physicist named David Bohm,

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:46.340 align:middle line:84%
and he has got his own
theories about what's

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.920 align:middle line:90%
happening in the universe.

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.510 align:middle line:84%
>>With that absolute
contradiction

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:52.180 align:middle line:84%
of the two basic
theories, I said

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:53.920 align:middle line:84%
there was only-- we
could try to find out

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.420 align:middle line:90%
what they have in common.

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And what they have
in common is what

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:58.345 align:middle line:90%
I call undivided wholeness.

00:15:58.345 --> 00:16:00.450 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:04.530 align:middle line:84%
>>Just as Copernicus had
upended cosmological thought

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:07.980 align:middle line:84%
in the 16th century by
suggesting that the Earth was

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:12.130 align:middle line:84%
in orbit around the
sun and not vise versa,

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:15.060 align:middle line:84%
so too was Bohm
starting to intuit

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:18.570 align:middle line:84%
that we needed a fundamentally
new way to describe

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:21.765 align:middle line:84%
the connection between
the macro and the micro.

00:16:21.765 --> 00:16:25.110 align:middle line:90%


00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:28.890 align:middle line:10%
>>And my feeling is that that
gave an insight to Bohm that

00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:30.890 align:middle line:10%
this world we live in--

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:33.660 align:middle line:10%
it's all hard and fast,
the explicate order--

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:38.250 align:middle line:10%
this is the explicate order--
is really just a surface order--

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:39.840 align:middle line:10%
it's not a deep,
profound order--

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:42.090 align:middle line:10%
and that something lies
underneath it, which

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:44.460 align:middle line:10%
he called the implicate order.

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:46.650 align:middle line:84%
So the implicate
order is not so much

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:49.030 align:middle line:90%
a set of objects, but a process.

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:50.700 align:middle line:84%
It's a process of
constant movement,

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.220 align:middle line:84%
constantly unfolding
and enfolding.

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:56.580 align:middle line:84%
So the explicate order
comes out of the implicate.

00:16:56.580 --> 00:17:00.690 align:middle line:90%


00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:04.170 align:middle line:84%
>>David Bohm was suggesting
that everything is internally

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:09.500 align:middle line:84%
related to everything else and
that each part of the cosmos

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:13.490 align:middle line:84%
contains the whole
universe and unfolds

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:17.661 align:middle line:90%
into our perception of reality.

00:17:17.661 --> 00:17:18.619 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: Marvelous.

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:19.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
Yeah, we wholeheartedly

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:21.020 align:middle line:90%
agree with David Bohm.

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And the implicate order is
really what's important.

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:28.069 align:middle line:84%
That's the inner structure of
all, we'll say, mathematics.

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:31.220 align:middle line:84%
But above mathematics
is also consciousness.

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And that consciousness
field is what's

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:36.960 align:middle line:84%
critical for our thinking,
our movement, our creation.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.770 align:middle line:84%
So what we do every
moment of our lives

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:44.010 align:middle line:84%
is, really, unfold a connection
to that consciousness field.

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:46.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, the explicate order,
as he was explaining,

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:48.620 align:middle line:90%
is what we manifest and see.

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:53.180 align:middle line:84%
But so much of us still is part
of that inner connectedness,

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:55.948 align:middle line:84%
that we exist within us and
within the whole universe.

00:17:55.948 --> 00:17:57.740 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: So making
contact first begins

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:00.680 align:middle line:84%
with the implicate order to
recognize the cosmic weave

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:04.610 align:middle line:84%
of how all of the molecular
structure of our body

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:05.960 align:middle line:90%
is entangled.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:09.230 align:middle line:84%
And a very precise blueprint
is unfolded the more

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:13.490 align:middle line:84%
we begin to understand the
unique energy field that we are

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:16.850 align:middle line:84%
able to operate with, not
simply by being mind-centered,

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:19.970 align:middle line:84%
but by being heart-centered,
mind-centered, and ultimately,

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:22.070 align:middle line:84%
through every organ
of the body, we

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:24.830 align:middle line:84%
can ultimately evolve what is
called in "The Keys of Enoch"

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:28.263 align:middle line:84%
the light being, or the
light potential, that we are.

00:18:28.263 --> 00:18:29.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: William Henry
talks about that.

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:30.500 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: That's right--

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:31.790 align:middle line:90%
William Henry, a dear friend.

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:34.040 align:middle line:84%
This is also called
by modern scientists

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.840 align:middle line:90%
the biophotonic field.

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:38.630 align:middle line:84%
They realized every cell
in our body emits light.

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And if we can bring these
intriguing connections

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.640 align:middle line:84%
together, then we can step
into a whole new field

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:45.440 align:middle line:90%
of information.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: And I
think it's very important--

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:49.140 align:middle line:84%
this is one of our aspects
connected with "The Keys

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:49.940 align:middle line:90%
of Enoch"--

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:53.390 align:middle line:84%
that we don't feel that
everything is happenstance--

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:55.220 align:middle line:84%
and this is something
that David Bohm also

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:58.190 align:middle line:84%
acknowledged-- that there's
something behind it.

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And whether it's
just mathematics,

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.840 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the Fibonacci
series, whether it's

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:03.860 align:middle line:90%
certain other aspects--

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:04.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That something's
driving it, right?

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.145 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
--something is there.

00:19:06.145 --> 00:19:09.470 align:middle line:84%
Something gives us the
geometry for our bodies.

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And something gives us, also,
the consciousness language

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:13.010 align:middle line:90%
for our mind.

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:16.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, being here on this
planet, it seems to be--

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:18.950 align:middle line:84%
and this is something that's
talked about in ancient times--

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:21.290 align:middle line:84%
a limitation of
consciousness that we

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:23.720 align:middle line:90%
are trying to evolve out of.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.790 align:middle line:84%
And when we evolve out
of that, we actually

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:29.010 align:middle line:84%
become part of, we'll say,
the greater universal mind.

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:30.660 align:middle line:84%
So that's very
important as well.

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: So the drama before
us now is going from humankind

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:35.750 align:middle line:90%
to spacekind.

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:37.980 align:middle line:84%
How do we make this
leap into the future?

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:38.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:40.970 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: How do we begin to
work with the fifth, and sixth,

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:42.290 align:middle line:90%
and even the eighth dimension--

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:43.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And make
it mesh with us?

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:45.860 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: It's
the whole ability

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:49.910 align:middle line:84%
to recognize the
entirety of the universe

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:52.520 align:middle line:84%
within our potential
to co-create,

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:57.380 align:middle line:84%
and to enthusiastically
embrace the challenges of life

00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:01.460 align:middle line:84%
and go forward with a
sense of joy and curiosity,

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:04.160 align:middle line:84%
and not to sit back
as pacifist and deny

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:07.790 align:middle line:84%
this fantastic biotransducer
system, which we are.

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:10.910 align:middle line:84%
A human, as we say,
as a suit of clothes

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:12.170 align:middle line:90%
for a greater body of light.

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:13.545 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
And I just want

00:20:13.545 --> 00:20:15.770 align:middle line:84%
to say, in terms of our work
with Elizabeth Rauscher,

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:19.070 align:middle line:84%
in our work with her,
the eighth dimension

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:21.320 align:middle line:84%
was a place where we
not only could know

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:24.410 align:middle line:90%
past, present, but also future.

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:27.560 align:middle line:84%
Now we're trying to judge
how much into the future can

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.210 align:middle line:84%
we go because we
do have free will.

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:34.925 align:middle line:84%
So even though we may be set
in a certain path in our lives,

00:20:34.925 --> 00:20:38.720 align:middle line:84%
by our own choices, we can make
differences in that reality.

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.370 align:middle line:84%
But it's important
to realize that some

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:44.070 align:middle line:84%
of that future reality is
coded within us as well.

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:46.530 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: So at this time
of world changes and problems,

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:48.110 align:middle line:84%
it's so important
to see that we can

00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:52.250 align:middle line:84%
shift from as it were a passive
state into an activist state,

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:55.190 align:middle line:84%
where we can bring
in the light, begin

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:58.340 align:middle line:84%
the dialogue with our cosmic
others, our cosmic friends,

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:01.040 align:middle line:84%
and realize that this
is consistent with much

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:04.370 align:middle line:84%
of the earlier history that
has been ignored, particularly

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:07.940 align:middle line:84%
by the great thinkers
in Egypt, in Lebanon,

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:09.980 align:middle line:84%
in other countries of the
Near East, where there

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:13.010 align:middle line:84%
is vast documentation
that says we are not alone

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:13.820 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:17.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a cosmic
law out there somewhere?

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.650 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK:
Definitely, a cosmic law

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:22.790 align:middle line:84%
that respects all life, that
teaches us to not interfere

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:25.580 align:middle line:84%
with other people in terms
of the normal situation

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:26.630 align:middle line:90%
of evolution

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:29.133 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: I consider
it very much like "Star Trek."

00:21:29.133 --> 00:21:30.050 align:middle line:90%
"Star Trek" had that--

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:30.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Federation.

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:31.250 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Yes.

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:32.480 align:middle line:90%
Well, any of the Star Trek.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:34.370 align:middle line:84%
You had to be careful
where you went

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:35.990 align:middle line:84%
and what you did
to other species

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:38.370 align:middle line:84%
because you could influence
them, change them.

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's been our
situation here for a long time.

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:45.770 align:middle line:10%
We say we've been in a
quarantine, protected

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:48.770 align:middle line:10%
from all the, you know,
bar scene in Star Wars,

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:49.940 align:middle line:10%
if you think about that.

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:51.470 align:middle line:90%
And this is changing now.

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:54.290 align:middle line:84%
I think that's being
lifted, and we're

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:57.530 align:middle line:84%
starting to have contact with
all these different forms

00:21:57.530 --> 00:21:58.340 align:middle line:90%
of intelligence.

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And there's many
forms of intelligence.

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:03.150 align:middle line:84%
You consider the
fact that there's

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:05.690 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of trillions of
stars in the Milky Way,

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:09.490 align:middle line:84%
and there's also, we'll
say, trillions of galaxies.

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:11.440 align:middle line:90%
Then there has to be life.

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And not only us, not
only little green men,

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:16.870 align:middle line:84%
not only the Greys
and the reptilians,

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:18.310 align:middle line:90%
but many, many, many forms.

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:19.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:20.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
agree with that?

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:20.800 align:middle line:10%
>>JJ HURTAK: I agree with--

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:22.900 align:middle line:10%
I think we're going, really,
from the old textbook

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:25.150 align:middle line:10%
into the actual
experience of writing

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:27.280 align:middle line:10%
a new textbook of
evolution of biology

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.300 align:middle line:10%
in our lifetime, George.

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:31.510 align:middle line:84%
I think the cosmic others
are on our doorstep,

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:33.160 align:middle line:84%
waiting for us to
connect the points,

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.410 align:middle line:84%
to see the much larger
picture of life,

00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:37.390 align:middle line:84%
and to understand that
we have a major role

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:40.550 align:middle line:84%
to play in the way we
interpret this for all people--

00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:44.020 align:middle line:84%
not just for a limited area
of science or spirituality,

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:46.330 align:middle line:84%
but to see that they
both connect within us.

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:49.150 align:middle line:84%
Because we have, as we
have seen in our studies

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:51.190 align:middle line:84%
behind the scene with
the great scientists,

00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:53.890 align:middle line:84%
that we can think cosmically
on the spiritual side

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:57.760 align:middle line:84%
or the scientific side but
must bring them together

00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:58.677 align:middle line:90%
through the heartbeat.

00:22:58.677 --> 00:23:00.843 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: And this
is part of our evolution.

00:23:00.843 --> 00:23:02.080 align:middle line:90%
I think they're watching us.

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.958 align:middle line:90%
And one of the factors is--

00:23:03.958 --> 00:23:05.500 align:middle line:84%
"New York Times,"
I believe, came out

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:08.710 align:middle line:84%
with something that said,
in the last 3,400 years,

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:10.840 align:middle line:84%
we've only as a
planet had something

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:13.210 align:middle line:90%
like 268 years of peace.

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And if you look even more
recently, since 1945,

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:18.560 align:middle line:90%
we've had something like--

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:19.990 align:middle line:90%
a much less period of time--

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:20.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Much less.

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:20.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
Yeah, much less.

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:21.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Constant wars.

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:23.392 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
Yes, constant wars.

00:23:23.392 --> 00:23:26.030 align:middle line:84%
8% of history on this
planet, for the most part,

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:26.830 align:middle line:90%
has been war.

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:30.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, the new century that we're
in now has been a bit better.

00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:33.250 align:middle line:84%
But there's still things
going on in Africa,

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:36.450 align:middle line:84%
in the Far East, everywhere
that has these issues.

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:39.970 align:middle line:84%
So they don't want us,
really, out in space

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:43.330 align:middle line:84%
until we get rid of that
war energy, I think.

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:45.640 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How did the
ancients understand this?

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:47.410 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: Well,
they saw this as what

00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:51.460 align:middle line:84%
we would call a historic
dialectic between the gods

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:53.080 align:middle line:90%
and the humans.

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And we had the
opportunity to work

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:58.900 align:middle line:84%
with those who gave us, quote
unquote, "a real science,"

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:01.360 align:middle line:84%
or a theology,
cosmology of the future,

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:03.700 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to those
forms of intelligence

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:06.700 align:middle line:84%
that we use as slaves
or biological puppets,

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:11.500 align:middle line:84%
like the late Dr. Sitchin
indicated in some of his books.

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:14.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: The
Annunaki, but even first Enoch.

00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:16.660 align:middle line:84%
And some of that
talks about an entity

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:20.560 align:middle line:84%
very similar to the word of
Samyaza that had come down.

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And in some cases, they
didn't teach just agriculture

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:26.410 align:middle line:90%
or good things like medicines.

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:29.110 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, they actually
taught the art of warfare,

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:30.550 align:middle line:90%
and they gave weapons.

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:32.530 align:middle line:84%
So you have to
realize what's around

00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:35.320 align:middle line:84%
us is very similar to
what's on this planet--

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.480 align:middle line:84%
that we have both
types of intelligence,

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.910 align:middle line:84%
and we have to really
start attuning ourselves

00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:41.080 align:middle line:90%
to our higher nature.

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of the
most important things we're

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:47.500 align:middle line:84%
saying right now is that, as
we start graduating and getting

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:50.950 align:middle line:84%
to be one or connected
with the cosmic others,

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:52.540 align:middle line:90%
we're not going to be peons.

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:56.110 align:middle line:84%
We should never see ourselves
as peons or small beings

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:57.400 align:middle line:90%
just learning to grow up.

00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:01.000 align:middle line:84%
We actually have a higher
soul, as Linda Moulton Howe

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.050 align:middle line:84%
is talking about in some of her
talk, and other capabilities.

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:06.730 align:middle line:90%
We have that telepathy.

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:10.100 align:middle line:84%
We have that ability to
connect with other realities.

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:12.258 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to
graduate very quickly.

00:25:12.258 --> 00:25:14.800 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: We have connected
with the archives of knowledge

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.130 align:middle line:90%
in most parts of the world.

00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:18.160 align:middle line:84%
So there definitely
is a world map

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:21.160 align:middle line:84%
of what we believe to be
the event of the return

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:24.340 align:middle line:84%
of the cosmic others, that
they are returning to the areas

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:26.470 align:middle line:84%
where they originally had
the experiments, where

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:28.000 align:middle line:84%
they originally
built the pyramids

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.920 align:middle line:84%
or they originally created the
great temples of vibration.

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's the shift to the higher
vibratory nature of the mind

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:36.040 align:middle line:84%
and the heart
working together that

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:39.160 align:middle line:84%
is the key to what we believe
the quantum change that's

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.240 align:middle line:90%
coming around the corner.

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:42.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On a Gaia show
called "Deep Space,"

00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:44.050 align:middle line:84%
they talked about
how the ancients

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:46.690 align:middle line:84%
might have had more
knowledge and contacts

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:48.520 align:middle line:90%
with extraterrestrials.

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:49.750 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:52.870 align:middle line:84%
>>I believe that we have
been observed and monitored

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:54.020 align:middle line:90%
for a long, long time.

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:56.710 align:middle line:84%
I think what we call the
UFO phenomenon probably goes

00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:58.870 align:middle line:90%
through our entire history.

00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:02.560 align:middle line:10%
For me, when I look
at ancient advanced--

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:04.840 align:middle line:10%
ridiculously,
inexplicably advanced

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:06.490 align:middle line:10%
technology, the one
thing I continue

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:09.520 align:middle line:10%
to go back to is the
Great Pyramid at Giza.

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:12.700 align:middle line:84%
There is, in my view, not
any conventional explanation

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:14.808 align:middle line:90%
for this at all.

00:26:14.808 --> 00:26:17.350 align:middle line:84%
When you start getting into the
mathematics, the engineering,

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:21.610 align:middle line:84%
the geographic location of it,
among many, many other things,

00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:24.583 align:middle line:84%
this indicates to me that
whoever built that pyramid knew

00:26:24.583 --> 00:26:25.750 align:middle line:90%
that the Earth was a sphere.

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:27.625 align:middle line:10%
They knew exactly where
they were in relation

00:26:27.625 --> 00:26:29.170 align:middle line:10%
to the entire world.

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:33.040 align:middle line:10%
They had engineering and
transport capabilities

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:36.340 align:middle line:10%
that no one is able to explain.

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:41.200 align:middle line:84%
They completed a task that not
a single human civilization

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:45.040 align:middle line:84%
could possibly have done until
possibly the last hundred

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.240 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.980 align:middle line:10%
It's even a stretch
to ask ourselves,

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:49.990 align:middle line:10%
could we have
duplicated this today?

00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:51.130 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we could.

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:54.580 align:middle line:84%
But could we have even done it
as recently as 100 years ago?

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:57.550 align:middle line:84%
Could the United States
of, say, Teddy Roosevelt

00:26:57.550 --> 00:26:58.870 align:middle line:90%
have built the Great Pyramid?

00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:00.410 align:middle line:90%
The answer is "no."

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:01.210 align:middle line:90%
It's "no."

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:01.990 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't have done it.

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:03.865 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't have done
it with the precision

00:27:03.865 --> 00:27:05.140 align:middle line:90%
and the exactitude.

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:08.590 align:middle line:84%
So I asked myself, if the
ancient Egyptians were

00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:11.260 align:middle line:84%
more advanced than America
of the early 20th century,

00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:13.490 align:middle line:84%
then there's something wrong
here with this picture.

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:17.722 align:middle line:84%
So there's something in
the mix of our civilization

00:27:17.722 --> 00:27:18.680 align:middle line:90%
that we're not getting.

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:22.240 align:middle line:10%
There's a hole in our ancient
history, and some of that

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:25.180 align:middle line:10%
includes very
advanced knowledge.

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:26.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dolan's
spot on, isn't he?

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:27.310 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: Great, great.

00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:28.990 align:middle line:84%
Desiree's father
was down in Egypt

00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:31.060 align:middle line:84%
in 1921 as a young
medical student

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:32.980 align:middle line:90%
at the University of Vienna.

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:35.200 align:middle line:84%
He and other colleagues
went down to Egypt

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.940 align:middle line:84%
and always felt a
connection there.

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:39.370 align:middle line:84%
But in "The Keys of
Enoch," our classical book,

00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:43.240 align:middle line:84%
we show that there are 11
other places like Egypt.

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And we've been investigating
this over the last 45 years.

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:46.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All around the planet.

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:47.998 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: All
around the planet,

00:27:47.998 --> 00:27:50.560 align:middle line:84%
which suggests that there is
a planetary grid system, some

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:54.070 align:middle line:84%
would say, that has portals
of ascension or places

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:57.700 align:middle line:84%
of communication that were used
by the ancients, which would

00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:01.120 align:middle line:84%
indicate why the ancients
spent, as it were,

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:04.420 align:middle line:84%
whole generations putting
together libraries

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:05.917 align:middle line:90%
of information in stone.

00:28:05.917 --> 00:28:08.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: But I have to
say, Richard Dolan is correct.

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:11.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, not only putting
a block upon a block,

00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:14.635 align:middle line:84%
but when you go inside and
see the intricate corridors

00:28:14.635 --> 00:28:15.435 align:middle line:90%
and passageways--

00:28:15.435 --> 00:28:16.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, it's remarkable.

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:16.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Yeah.

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we can
actually do it today.

00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:19.870 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we could.

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:23.080 align:middle line:84%
But it really would be difficult
because you have 50 to 80 ton

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:26.080 align:middle line:84%
blocks way high up, not
lower to the ground.

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:27.430 align:middle line:90%
So that's amazing.

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:30.490 align:middle line:84%
And actually, we have
on our YouTube site

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:32.620 align:middle line:84%
something from Nippon
Corporation, which back

00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:34.420 align:middle line:90%
in the '70s tried to do it.

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:37.330 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to do it with
hammers, chisels, and barges.

00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:38.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They tried to duplicate
it, and it didn't work.

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:39.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Yeah,
and they couldn't do it.

00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:41.170 align:middle line:84%
Then they did it
with jackhammers,

00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:42.940 align:middle line:84%
and they still
couldn't duplicate it.

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:45.230 align:middle line:84%
They actually just did it
about-- not even a quarter

00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:46.660 align:middle line:90%
the size of the actual pyramid.

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And then they made
them tear it down

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:49.570 align:middle line:90%
because it was such an eyesore.

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And there was no caverns or
anything inside, no rooms.

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:55.840 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, it's not
as easy as you think.

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:57.760 align:middle line:90%
So he's absolutely correct.

00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:59.200 align:middle line:90%
And why?

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.380 align:middle line:90%
That's the real question.

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:02.860 align:middle line:84%
Why do you have all
these intricate chambers?

00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:04.668 align:middle line:84%
Why do you have star
shafts, what we call.

00:29:04.668 --> 00:29:06.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's got
to be a reason for it.

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:07.045 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Yeah.

00:29:07.045 --> 00:29:09.670 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: And the other side
of the story is the so-called

00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:12.760 align:middle line:84%
pyramidal geometries that have
appeared over the Pentagon

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:17.710 align:middle line:84%
a couple of years ago and
also in 2009 over Moscow--

00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:21.430 align:middle line:84%
actual paraphysical geometries,
like pyramidal capstones.

00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:22.690 align:middle line:90%
Why this geometry?

00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:24.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've discussed
this with others

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:26.260 align:middle line:84%
who believe that this
is the central building

00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:27.400 align:middle line:90%
block of civilization.

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.980 align:middle line:84%
The cosmic others, leaving
behind the pyramid,

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:31.690 align:middle line:84%
have left behind
what we would call

00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:33.940 align:middle line:84%
a future artifact,
something that takes us

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:36.580 align:middle line:84%
into the future of how
we would design cities

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:39.520 align:middle line:84%
in space and other planets, by
using the pyramidal geometry.

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:40.478 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Yeah.

00:29:40.478 --> 00:29:42.550 align:middle line:84%
It's the most, we'll
say, stable geometry.

00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:44.770 align:middle line:84%
We think it's really
at the heart of all

00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:47.740 align:middle line:84%
of our geometry of
life, is a tetrahedron.

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:49.840 align:middle line:84%
And so it's interesting
you see them in space.

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:52.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, some people say,
oh, it's the military.

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:53.410 align:middle line:90%
We don't think that way.

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:55.840 align:middle line:84%
We feel it is-- it
could be a projection.

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.630 align:middle line:84%
It could be a type of
hologram from another reality.

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:02.920 align:middle line:84%
But basically, I think it's
the other intelligences telling

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:04.165 align:middle line:90%
us to look--

00:30:04.165 --> 00:30:05.710 align:middle line:90%
especially over the Pentagon--

00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:07.900 align:middle line:84%
that they are
superior technologies,

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:09.550 align:middle line:84%
and the tetrahedron
and the pyramid

00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:12.430 align:middle line:84%
is part of that knowledge,
that ancient wisdom.

00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:14.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's got
to be another reason.

00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:16.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you talked about
it as a power plant.

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.700 align:middle line:84%
You took Christopher
Dunn's theories

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:20.530 align:middle line:90%
and took it a little further.

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:23.030 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be a
reason for this structure,

00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:23.830 align:middle line:90%
don't you think?

00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:26.205 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Well, of
course, one of the main things

00:30:26.205 --> 00:30:28.270 align:middle line:84%
was, in the King's
Chamber, supposedly,

00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:30.880 align:middle line:84%
that the pharaoh, if
he was buried there--

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:32.380 align:middle line:84%
we don't even think
he was-- but was

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:35.110 align:middle line:84%
to travel to Orion,
to the stars.

00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:36.820 align:middle line:90%
So we feel it really is--

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:40.900 align:middle line:84%
as Dr. Hurtak says, it's
a chronology statement.

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:45.310 align:middle line:84%
It actually can maybe emanate
some of our own thought forms

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:48.340 align:middle line:84%
and then can be picked up by
other levels of intelligence.

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:50.550 align:middle line:84%
So it's really a chronomonitor,
is what we call it.

00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:52.342 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: When you
have star shafts that

00:30:52.342 --> 00:30:56.080 align:middle line:84%
can point to star constellations
something on the order of 1,300

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:59.650 align:middle line:84%
to 1,400 light years
away with precision,

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:02.110 align:middle line:84%
you're dealing with a planetary
physics and science that

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:06.350 align:middle line:84%
is far beyond the imagination
of anyone until recent times.

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:10.270 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking, really,
at a stone configuration,

00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:13.630 align:middle line:84%
the Great Pyramid, as a clue
to the evolutionary process

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:16.810 align:middle line:84%
of opening the mind to think
and to connect science,

00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:18.670 align:middle line:84%
spirituality,
philosophy, and what

00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:21.370 align:middle line:84%
we found in musical
studies, the vibrations

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:23.350 align:middle line:84%
of the tombs themselves
that corresponded

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:26.050 align:middle line:84%
to the various heartbeats
of the human heart.

00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:27.092 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's dramatic.

00:31:27.092 --> 00:31:29.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: And if
you really look at it,

00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:30.970 align:middle line:84%
if consciousness is
really behind everything,

00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:34.990 align:middle line:84%
if we're exuding consciousness
and consciousness as a field

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:36.880 align:middle line:84%
that not only
encompasses the Earth--

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:40.510 align:middle line:84%
it's not just a global field,
it's a universal field--

00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:44.710 align:middle line:84%
then we can also tune in,
and they can tune in to us

00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:47.860 align:middle line:84%
from wherever they
are in the universe,

00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:49.570 align:middle line:90%
on other dimensional realities.

00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:51.610 align:middle line:90%
They can also tune in to us.

00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we feel is
really happening right now,

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:58.600 align:middle line:84%
and that the pyramid
is a configuration that

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:00.040 align:middle line:90%
shows how that works.

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:03.730 align:middle line:84%
We have pyramidal
cells inside our brains

00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:05.140 align:middle line:90%
that are part of the neurons.

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:09.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's really a model
for not only healing, health,

00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:12.220 align:middle line:84%
but also, I think,
consciousness ascension.

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:14.220 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: And taking
this into space, George,

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:15.720 align:middle line:84%
you know that I was
one of the first

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:18.720 align:middle line:84%
to release the actual pictures
of the Great Pyramids found

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:22.830 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of Mars in the
Elysium Quadrangle in 1973.

00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:26.340 align:middle line:84%
So as we push outwards, we
begin to realize, possibly,

00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:29.670 align:middle line:84%
on our sister planets that
pyramidal design was also

00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:34.080 align:middle line:84%
used as a way of harnessing
energy and providing knowledge

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:35.880 align:middle line:84%
that we would
eventually rediscover.

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is Zahi Hawass,
the former head of Egypt's

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:42.330 align:middle line:84%
antiquities, so
reluctant to acknowledge

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:45.033 align:middle line:84%
the possibility of
extraterrestrial involvement?

00:32:45.033 --> 00:32:46.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Well,
I think in some part--

00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:49.530 align:middle line:84%
and we have talked to
him and had time with him

00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:50.700 align:middle line:90%
on the plateau.

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And he's given us permission
for certain things-- not us,

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:55.320 align:middle line:84%
but the shore
expedition, for example.

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:57.012 align:middle line:90%
But he has a whole philosophy--

00:32:57.012 --> 00:32:57.970 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: Tradition.

00:32:57.970 --> 00:32:59.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
Yeah, a tradition,

00:32:59.470 --> 00:33:01.770 align:middle line:84%
a philosophy that he
has to uphold, actually.

00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:03.990 align:middle line:84%
And that is very difficult
to break through.

00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And look how difficult it
is for us to break through,

00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:08.025 align:middle line:90%
the fact that--

00:33:08.025 --> 00:33:09.510 align:middle line:90%
even religion is now.

00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:11.340 align:middle line:84%
The Catholic Church,
I think, is totally

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:14.018 align:middle line:84%
prepared for understanding
extraterrestrials.

00:33:14.018 --> 00:33:15.810 align:middle line:84%
They're just waiting
for the US government.

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:18.143 align:middle line:84%
Then they're going to release
some of their information.

00:33:18.143 --> 00:33:21.750 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't fly in the face
of any religious beliefs,

00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:23.100 align:middle line:90%
really, throughout the world.

00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:25.980 align:middle line:84%
But it's just so hard
to get beyond the norm

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:28.652 align:middle line:84%
that people have seen in
their religious traditions.

00:33:28.652 --> 00:33:29.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You agree with that?

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:30.570 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: I agree with that.

00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And your role, George,
is to put all of this

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:36.240 align:middle line:84%
together on a drawing board
so that the public at large

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:39.022 align:middle line:84%
can understand the
various levels of training

00:33:39.022 --> 00:33:40.230 align:middle line:90%
that we're now going through.

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:42.420 align:middle line:84%
We are going through
a vast orientation

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:45.210 align:middle line:84%
of finding the higher
evidences of how

00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:49.110 align:middle line:84%
ancient civilizations were in
contact with the cosmic others.

00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:51.180 align:middle line:84%
We're beginning to discover
through breakthroughs

00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:53.400 align:middle line:84%
in paraphysics and
parapsychology,

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:56.610 align:middle line:84%
like at Stanford Research
Institute in California

00:33:56.610 --> 00:33:58.320 align:middle line:84%
here, that the mind
has the ability

00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:59.500 align:middle line:90%
to reach other dimensions.

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:01.667 align:middle line:84%
And finally, we're finding
through a whole new study

00:34:01.667 --> 00:34:04.590 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness physics
that we have a greater power

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:06.810 align:middle line:84%
within ourselves to
be more and to do more

00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:09.370 align:middle line:84%
in co-creativity than has
been taught in the past.

00:34:09.370 --> 00:34:10.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
And I know we talked

00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:11.777 align:middle line:84%
about the fifth
dimension and connecting

00:34:11.777 --> 00:34:14.520 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrials, and
that's really your forte.

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:17.010 align:middle line:84%
But we also talk
about and have talked

00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:20.159 align:middle line:84%
about for 40 years
ultraterrestrial beings, which

00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:23.040 align:middle line:84%
are beings that don't need
a spaceship to come here,

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:25.834 align:middle line:84%
that are really
more light energy.

00:34:25.834 --> 00:34:27.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or dimensional.

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:28.018 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Yeah.

00:34:28.018 --> 00:34:32.173 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually, eighth
dimensional, 24th dimensional.

00:34:32.173 --> 00:34:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
we've talked about

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:36.110 align:middle line:90%
is multi-universes.

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:39.540 align:middle line:84%
"Keys of Enoch" talked about
the multi-universes in the '70s.

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:45.179 align:middle line:84%
And so some of them may not even
reside within our own universe.

00:34:45.179 --> 00:34:47.393 align:middle line:84%
They may reside in another
field of consciousness--

00:34:47.393 --> 00:34:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Somehow, they
filter over into ours, right?

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:50.280 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Exactly.

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And they can materialize
where they want to.

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:53.747 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is
important for people

00:34:53.747 --> 00:34:56.500 align:middle line:84%
to realize with the
understanding of quantum

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:57.300 align:middle line:90%
physics--

00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:00.100 align:middle line:84%
that if you're in touch
with one of these beings,

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:02.010 align:middle line:84%
they don't leave where
they are, even if it's

00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:03.840 align:middle line:90%
another universe, to come here.

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:05.700 align:middle line:90%
It's not flying in a UFO.

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:08.340 align:middle line:84%
They actually can just
project their consciousness

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:10.980 align:middle line:84%
to where we are, and
they can materialize.

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:13.320 align:middle line:84%
And they can do that to
1,000 different places

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.580 align:middle line:90%
simultaneously.

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:16.860 align:middle line:84%
That's another level
of consciousness.

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:19.410 align:middle line:84%
But that's also a
level of consciousness

00:35:19.410 --> 00:35:22.538 align:middle line:84%
I believe we have the ability
to experience at some time.

00:35:22.538 --> 00:35:25.080 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: And we believe this
has been the stumbling block

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:26.520 align:middle line:84%
of government
disclosure, why it's

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:28.020 align:middle line:84%
taken so long--
because there are so

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:30.450 align:middle line:84%
many different cosmic
races and groups.

00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:32.520 align:middle line:90%
You need a larger blueprint.

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:34.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They can't
keep track of them.

00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:36.990 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: It's showing the
multi-levels of the multi,

00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:39.150 align:middle line:84%
shall we say,
organizations out there

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:41.130 align:middle line:84%
in terms of a
unified field, things

00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:44.880 align:middle line:84%
that David Bohm and others were
searching for many years ago.

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:47.760 align:middle line:84%
But we've reached the
magic point, I believe,

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:52.140 align:middle line:84%
of having a mature youth in the
age of Steven Spielberg that

00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:55.110 align:middle line:84%
can now accept the fact that
we've got cosmic friends that

00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:57.660 align:middle line:84%
can come and communicate
with us through the higher

00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:58.807 align:middle line:90%
powers of consciousness.

00:35:58.807 --> 00:36:00.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
ETs have learned

00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:02.185 align:middle line:84%
how to bend space
and time, and that's

00:36:02.185 --> 00:36:03.435 align:middle line:90%
another way they're traveling?

00:36:03.435 --> 00:36:03.750 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: Absolutely.

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:04.050 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Yes.

00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:06.008 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about this
in a recent book, which

00:36:06.008 --> 00:36:08.250 align:middle line:84%
you're a part of,
called "Making Contact."

00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:10.485 align:middle line:84%
Alan Steinfeld's the editor
in one of the chapters.

00:36:10.485 --> 00:36:10.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good book.

00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:12.735 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: And
we talk about wormholes

00:36:12.735 --> 00:36:14.010 align:middle line:90%
and teleportation.

00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:16.680 align:middle line:84%
Teleportation is still
a very hot topic.

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And scientists have teleported
things that aren't alive--

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:23.790 align:middle line:84%
no organic matter-- but it's
really only a matter of time.

00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:27.510 align:middle line:84%
So one is traveling through
the physical reality,

00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:29.640 align:middle line:84%
and that would be the
wormhole, or hyperspace,

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:31.650 align:middle line:84%
or teleportation,
so to speak, where

00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:33.240 align:middle line:90%
you materialize somewhere else.

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:35.190 align:middle line:84%
But there's also
the whole ability

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:37.980 align:middle line:84%
to travel through the
consciousness field

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:40.710 align:middle line:84%
and just materialize,
not stay a long time.

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:44.040 align:middle line:84%
You have ancient peoples
talked about in the Bible,

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:45.210 align:middle line:90%
like Melchizedek.

00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:47.640 align:middle line:84%
He was supposedly
motherless and fatherless.

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:50.108 align:middle line:84%
He never was born here, but
he lived here for a while.

00:36:50.108 --> 00:36:51.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But he was here.

00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:52.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
And he was here.

00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:52.937 align:middle line:90%
And then he went away.

00:36:52.937 --> 00:36:54.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, how did these
things happen?

00:36:54.490 --> 00:36:56.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, maybe he came
on a flying saucer.

00:36:56.370 --> 00:36:58.050 align:middle line:84%
But we would rather
think he came

00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:00.510 align:middle line:84%
from a higher dimensional
reality and materialized.

00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:02.490 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: So we've
demythologized the myths.

00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:04.170 align:middle line:84%
We've gone behind
the myths to show

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:06.060 align:middle line:84%
that there's a science
of consciousness

00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:08.050 align:middle line:90%
behind these great stories.

00:37:08.050 --> 00:37:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And if we connect
these myths worldwide,

00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:12.750 align:middle line:84%
what we come up
with is a whole new,

00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:16.830 align:middle line:84%
shall we say, incentive to
see that we are being prepared

00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:20.550 align:middle line:84%
to be this Renaissance, this
new civilization, this Homo

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:22.830 align:middle line:84%
universalis, the
universal humanity

00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:24.450 align:middle line:90%
that the ancients thought about.

00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:26.645 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What will it
take to get these answers?

00:37:26.645 --> 00:37:28.020 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: It
will take a sense

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:30.810 align:middle line:84%
of humility and compassion
that we're not alone

00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:31.770 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:34.620 align:middle line:84%
It will take us a deep
sense of scholarship

00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:38.250 align:middle line:84%
as well as sociology to prepare
us to go beyond the fear

00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:42.270 align:middle line:84%
barrier, to realize that our
friends are out there working

00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:45.392 align:middle line:84%
with us, and we can
use discernment to work

00:37:45.392 --> 00:37:47.850 align:middle line:84%
with those who truly are there
to give us higher knowledge.

00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
And I also want

00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:50.190 align:middle line:84%
to say it takes more
and more contact.

00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:52.860 align:middle line:84%
So even though maybe we don't
get it all from the government

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:55.800 align:middle line:84%
sources, people more and
more are getting contact.

00:37:55.800 --> 00:38:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And what we've found is that,
once you even just see a UFO,

00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:02.850 align:middle line:84%
a light in the sky, you
have an entanglement--

00:38:02.850 --> 00:38:04.830 align:middle line:84%
this is a term in
quantum physics--

00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:05.730 align:middle line:90%
with that.

00:38:05.730 --> 00:38:10.230 align:middle line:84%
And I had a friend that actually
had contact with alien beings

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:12.180 align:middle line:84%
when she was at the
Bermuda Triangle.

00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:14.550 align:middle line:84%
Actually, she was
a marine biologist.

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And they told her certain
things and whatever.

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:19.898 align:middle line:84%
And then she actually
was talking about it

00:38:19.898 --> 00:38:22.440 align:middle line:84%
in a friend's house, and they
told her not to say everything.

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And she started
saying more and more,

00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:27.790 align:middle line:84%
and a shelf literally
flew up in the kitchen

00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:29.040 align:middle line:90%
that had been there for years.

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:31.457 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't fall down, or
it didn't break in that sense,

00:38:31.457 --> 00:38:32.370 align:middle line:90%
and it flew up.

00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:33.900 align:middle line:84%
She says, oh, I
can't say any more.

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:37.415 align:middle line:84%
There is a constant entanglement
that we have with beings--

00:38:37.415 --> 00:38:39.540 align:middle line:84%
especially if you see them
face to face, of course.

00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:40.590 align:middle line:84%
That's a whole
different reality.

00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:42.660 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: So a whole
new, younger generation

00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:46.398 align:middle line:84%
of scientists are beginning to
realize our cosmic potential.

00:38:46.398 --> 00:38:47.565 align:middle line:90%
I work with the indigenous--

00:38:47.565 --> 00:38:48.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which is a good thing.

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:50.637 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: Very good
thing-- have shown us--

00:38:50.637 --> 00:38:52.950 align:middle line:84%
the world cultures
have known in the past

00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:55.170 align:middle line:84%
that we can live with
the extraterrestrial,

00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:58.170 align:middle line:84%
the ultraterrestrial
reality and not be overcome.

00:38:58.170 --> 00:39:01.650 align:middle line:84%
Three, our spiritual
philosophers and poets,

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:04.350 align:middle line:84%
namely the mystics,
realized years ago

00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:07.380 align:middle line:84%
that we have this
ability of extended life.

00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:08.940 align:middle line:84%
And now, putting
this all together

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:12.600 align:middle line:84%
has come an opportunity to see
this as a age of synthesis.

00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:14.880 align:middle line:84%
This is the opportunity
to bring all of this

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:16.680 align:middle line:84%
together, what the
ancient writers called

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:18.090 align:middle line:90%
the Age of the Holy Spirit--

00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:20.640 align:middle line:84%
the fact that we have the
gifts of remote viewing,

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:22.190 align:middle line:84%
we have the gifts
of remote healing,

00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:23.940 align:middle line:84%
we have the gifts of
remote communication,

00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:26.280 align:middle line:84%
we have the gifts of
renewing ourselves.

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:29.370 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have to live under
an umbrella of doubt anymore.

00:39:29.370 --> 00:39:31.795 align:middle line:84%
The facts are being
put on the table,

00:39:31.795 --> 00:39:33.420 align:middle line:84%
and the veils are
being lifted, George.

00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:35.640 align:middle line:84%
This is really the
fantastic moment

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:39.675 align:middle line:84%
of seeing how we have come
at the right time of history.

00:39:39.675 --> 00:39:41.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's go back
to "Cosmic Disclosure"

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:44.640 align:middle line:84%
and look at Jason
Shurka's remarks.

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:47.880 align:middle line:84%
>>Let's say TLS came out today
and showed high technology

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:51.780 align:middle line:84%
crafts, and extraterrestrials,
and hologram beings,

00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:54.057 align:middle line:90%
and everything in between.

00:39:54.057 --> 00:39:55.890 align:middle line:84%
It would probably freak
a lot of people out.

00:39:55.890 --> 00:39:58.410 align:middle line:84%
There are many people that
are ready to receive that,

00:39:58.410 --> 00:40:03.060 align:middle line:84%
but on the collective level of
our human race on the universe,

00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:04.620 align:middle line:90%
it would cause a lot of chaos.

00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:06.720 align:middle line:90%
That's the truth.

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:10.230 align:middle line:84%
They will reveal
themselves to that extent

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:12.150 align:middle line:84%
when people are ready
to receive that.

00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:13.950 align:middle line:90%
But that's up to us.

00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:17.790 align:middle line:84%
How open are we to changing
our belief systems?

00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:21.870 align:middle line:84%
How open are we to letting
our belief systems dissolve

00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:24.510 align:middle line:84%
and start fresh, even
if it's uncomfortable?

00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:28.830 align:middle line:84%
And how open are we to accepting
that new possibilities that we

00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:32.460 align:middle line:84%
might have thought in the past
were impossible may actually

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:33.930 align:middle line:90%
be possible?

00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:35.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jack Nicholson
in "A Few Good Men"

00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:38.740 align:middle line:84%
said, "you can't
handle the truth."

00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:39.540 align:middle line:90%
Can we?

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:40.415 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: No.

00:40:40.415 --> 00:40:42.710 align:middle line:90%
That was also Philip Corso.

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:43.960 align:middle line:90%
He said, if you can handle it.

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:45.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The day after Roswell.

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:46.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: So
that's his big thing.

00:40:46.930 --> 00:40:49.500 align:middle line:84%
But what we're trying
to say to the world

00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:52.500 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that
we can handle it.

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:56.700 align:middle line:84%
We are beings that are beyond
this earthly dimension.

00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:59.010 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if you go back
to the Bible times,

00:40:59.010 --> 00:41:01.530 align:middle line:84%
basically, we took
on garments of skin.

00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:03.180 align:middle line:90%
So what were before that?

00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:06.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, we were beings that could
travel through the universe.

00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And you don't just see little
green men or grey beings

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:09.820 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:11.680 align:middle line:90%
You see us out there.

00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:14.250 align:middle line:84%
So we really need to
start standing our ground,

00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:16.800 align:middle line:84%
knowing that we are
much greater than we've

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:20.640 align:middle line:84%
been told for the last, well
say, 6,000, 10,000 years.

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:22.500 align:middle line:84%
And we're graduating
at this time.

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:24.300 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: We've worked with
many of the ancient documents.

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:26.670 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting that in
Scripture, the Book of Genesis

00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:28.530 align:middle line:84%
speaks in the
Hebrew of Shamayim,

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:31.680 align:middle line:84%
the many heavens-- in the Greek,
Ouranos, the many heavens.

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:34.050 align:middle line:84%
So whether you take the
tradition in the Greek,

00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:35.970 align:middle line:84%
or the Hebrew, or
whatever tradition,

00:41:35.970 --> 00:41:38.460 align:middle line:84%
the ancients recognized
we were not alone,

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:41.520 align:middle line:84%
and they realized we had to
have a spiritual psychology-- we

00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:44.910 align:middle line:84%
think is best exemplified in
the Christ figure of the New

00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:47.310 align:middle line:84%
Testament-- that we have
to love our enemies.

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:51.300 align:middle line:84%
We have to love ourselves, in
a cosmic sense, a preparation.

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:54.120 align:middle line:84%
We reached that level
of a higher vibratory

00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:55.590 align:middle line:84%
level of the mind
and spirit, where

00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:57.860 align:middle line:84%
we can enter into
the understanding

00:41:57.860 --> 00:41:59.110 align:middle line:90%
of the house of many mansions.

00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:00.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Right.

00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:03.210 align:middle line:84%
So if we look at Haim
Eshed from Israel,

00:42:03.210 --> 00:42:05.820 align:middle line:84%
who was one of the main
people for the space program

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:07.290 align:middle line:90%
from the Israelis--

00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:08.970 align:middle line:84%
he talked about the
Galactic Federation.

00:42:08.970 --> 00:42:10.410 align:middle line:84%
But he also said
they don't think

00:42:10.410 --> 00:42:11.820 align:middle line:90%
we're ready at this point.

00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:13.710 align:middle line:90%
Well, we actually think we are.

00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:15.750 align:middle line:84%
But we have to change
our consciousness.

00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:18.090 align:middle line:84%
We have to be more
prepared for working

00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:20.550 align:middle line:84%
with multiple forms
of intelligence,

00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:24.870 align:middle line:84%
not just strange, alien,
reptilian, insectoid types

00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:27.300 align:middle line:84%
of beings, but also
beings that are, really,

00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:29.460 align:middle line:90%
beyond our dimensional reality.

00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we have
to start understanding--

00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:35.760 align:middle line:84%
it's a vast growth
factor for all of us--

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:39.000 align:middle line:84%
but also to
understand that we are

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.600 align:middle line:84%
powerful beings in
the universe, and we

00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:45.930 align:middle line:84%
will be handshaking to
our own cosmic cousins

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:47.320 align:middle line:90%
in the very near future.

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:49.778 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: And this is why
we're working with theologians

00:42:49.778 --> 00:42:52.110 align:middle line:84%
like Ted Peters from
Berkeley, who wrote--

00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:55.920 align:middle line:84%
I should say, edited a book
called "Astral Theology," where

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:58.710 align:middle line:84%
scientists and theologians are
beginning to recognize there is

00:42:58.710 --> 00:43:02.770 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual side, a dimension
to the cosmic scheme of things.

00:43:02.770 --> 00:43:05.820 align:middle line:10%
So we have to be able to
go beyond what, Steven

00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:07.500 align:middle line:10%
Hawking and others
have suggested,

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:09.720 align:middle line:10%
the negative forces,
by realizing that there

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:12.390 align:middle line:10%
is a divine source,
a much higher level

00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:16.170 align:middle line:10%
of the ultraterrestrial that can
overpower the extraterrestrial,

00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:19.110 align:middle line:10%
shall we say, experimental
games and take us

00:43:19.110 --> 00:43:21.660 align:middle line:10%
into a whole new
reality of recognizing

00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:24.613 align:middle line:10%
genuine spirituality and genuine
science can meet and embrace.

00:43:24.613 --> 00:43:26.280 align:middle line:10%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: And
we have to do this

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:28.338 align:middle line:10%
with some levels of
unconditional love--

00:43:28.338 --> 00:43:29.880 align:middle line:10%
and I think that's
really important--

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:32.340 align:middle line:10%
and a higher consciousness
understanding

00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:37.830 align:middle line:10%
that we are able to greet each
other on a handshake level

00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:40.470 align:middle line:10%
and on a cosmic
level and understand

00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:44.220 align:middle line:10%
that we are literally able
to now maybe take our baby

00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:46.410 align:middle line:10%
steps in a positive
way-- not with war.

00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:48.810 align:middle line:84%
We've got to leave war
behind on this planet.

00:43:48.810 --> 00:43:51.750 align:middle line:84%
We've got to leave the fact
that we can't work together, be

00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:53.160 align:middle line:90%
together, share together.

00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:55.380 align:middle line:84%
That all has to go
away, and we have

00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:58.753 align:middle line:84%
to open our consciousness to
greater realms of intelligence.

00:43:58.753 --> 00:43:59.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I share that.

00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:02.398 align:middle line:84%
Mr. and Mrs. Hurtak, thanks
for being on "Beyond Belief."

00:44:02.398 --> 00:44:03.690 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: Thank you, George.

00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:06.720 align:middle line:84%
And to the audience, we
must take the higher path.

00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:07.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:11.160 align:middle line:10%
Because one day, if we
don't, we will realize

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:12.840 align:middle line:10%
what we've lost on this planet.

00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:15.960 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
