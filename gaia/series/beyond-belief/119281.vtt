00:00:05.192 --> 00:00:07.770 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[THEME MUSIC] And I think
many people today don't

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.110 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:10.735 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.735 --> 00:00:13.440 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.790 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.840 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.600 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:26.555 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.555 --> 00:00:28.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to this edition

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.221 align:middle line:90%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:29.221 --> 00:00:32.490 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and back
with us is Frank Joseph Hoff.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.200 align:middle line:10%
He is, of course, the president
of Atlantis Publications,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.840 align:middle line:10%
and he's a researcher.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.750 align:middle line:84%
In our first program, we
talked a lot about Lemuria.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.460 align:middle line:84%
In this program,
we're going to talk

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.790 align:middle line:84%
about the very
mystical Atlantis.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.069 align:middle line:84%
That has captured everybody's
imagination, Frank, hasn't it?

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:51.610 align:middle line:10%
>>FRANK JOSEPH HOFF:
Oh, it sure has,

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.240 align:middle line:10%
and that's gone back
way back through time.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.240 align:middle line:10%
Yes, it's a riddle.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was it that because of
Plato we knew about Atlantis?

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.580 align:middle line:10%
>>HOFF: That's where we
originally heard about

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.750 align:middle line:10%
Atlantis, is through
Plato, or "Pla-teau,"

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.060 align:middle line:10%
through his two dialogues,
called the Critias and Timaeus

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.550 align:middle line:10%
Dialogues.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where did he
say Atlantis might be,

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.110 align:middle line:84%
and does that jive with
what you've uncovered?

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: Well, there's a lot
of confusion about that,

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.010 align:middle line:84%
and it's a misinterpretation of
his two dialogues, the Critias

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.760 align:middle line:90%
and Timaeus Dialogues.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.610 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people think
that if it was Atlantis,

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.030 align:middle line:84%
it has to be located in
the Atlantic Ocean, but not

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.190 align:middle line:90%
the Atlantic Ocean as today.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.080 align:middle line:10%
What we found out is that it was
located in the Atlantic Ocean

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.530 align:middle line:10%
as it was basically close
to 11,600 years ago.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: OK, what do you
think happened to it?

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: Well, we've done
some research on this,

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.710 align:middle line:84%
and we found out that there
were several things that

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.660 align:middle line:90%
were going on at the time.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.700 align:middle line:84%
First of all-- and I know
you'll be interested in this--

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.660 align:middle line:84%
there was a War of
Atlantis, and that

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.520 align:middle line:84%
was some of what ended up
causing some of the problem

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.020 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: High-tech war?

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: It was a high-technology
war, but it was not only that.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.270 align:middle line:10%
But we also had some natural
events that were going on, too,

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.340 align:middle line:10%
and what I'm speaking
about here is

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.610 align:middle line:10%
on actually the opposite
side of the world.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
the confusion is

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.110 align:middle line:84%
because the Atlantis Ocean, or
the Oceans of the Atlanteans,

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.440 align:middle line:90%
used to be a worldwide ocean.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.160 align:middle line:90%
It circumnavigated the globe.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.400 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that's what you can
do from one ocean to the other,

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.990 align:middle line:84%
even today, and that scientific
term is called terminus.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And so whether it be
the Pacific Ocean,

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.390 align:middle line:84%
or it would be the Atlantic
Ocean, or the Indian Ocean,

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.300 align:middle line:84%
you can travel from
one ocean to the next.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.485 align:middle line:10%
What happened in all
this confusion is

00:02:53.485 --> 00:02:57.330 align:middle line:10%
that we-- and this even
goes back to Columbus--

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.820 align:middle line:10%
we found out he was looking
for Atlantis for the kings

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.140 align:middle line:10%
and queens of Europe.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was
gone, though, right?

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: Yeah, well,
to a large extent,

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.660 align:middle line:84%
because if you recall
from your school days

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.100 align:middle line:84%
is that he was looking
for the East Indies,

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.810 align:middle line:84%
by the way, not the West Indies,
which is like the Caribbean.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.380 align:middle line:84%
He was looking for
the East Indies,

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.756 align:middle line:84%
but, again, we found out he was
looking for that for the kings

00:03:22.756 --> 00:03:23.630 align:middle line:90%
and queens of Europe.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And he ran into the Americas,
and that's where it dead ends.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.730 align:middle line:10%
And, really, if you
were probably in school

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.585 align:middle line:10%
and you were wondering,
whatever happened

00:03:33.585 --> 00:03:36.870 align:middle line:10%
to this idea of finding the East
Indies-- because after they ran

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.740 align:middle line:10%
into the Americas, they found
out shortly after that they

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:40.930 align:middle line:10%
weren't in the East Indies.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.767 align:middle line:84%
And my thought question
has always been,

00:03:42.767 --> 00:03:45.350 align:middle line:84%
whatever happened to this idea
of looking for the East Indies?

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.141 align:middle line:90%
Where are those at?

00:03:46.141 --> 00:03:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And if you probably stood up in
school and asked this question,

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.240 align:middle line:84%
they'd probably tell you to
sit down and shut up, you know,

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.410 align:middle line:84%
because either they
didn't know or they

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.410 align:middle line:90%
didn't want to tell you.

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:02.971 align:middle line:84%
So what we found out
is that originally

00:04:02.971 --> 00:04:05.670 align:middle line:84%
an explorer by the
name of Vasco Balboa.

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.345 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mm-hmm, I know the
name from my school days.

00:04:08.345 --> 00:04:12.190 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: Right, he supposedly
discovered the Pacific Ocean,

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.270 align:middle line:90%
didn't name it.

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.440 align:middle line:84%
Another explorer, by the
name of Ferdinand Magellan,

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.490 align:middle line:84%
ended up seeing it down
through the Magellan Strait,

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:25.130 align:middle line:84%
down by Chile and Argentina,
actually through Argentina

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.430 align:middle line:84%
and Chile, and he saw it as a
very calm and passive ocean.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.230 align:middle line:10%
So he named it from the
infinitive Portuguese

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.229 align:middle line:10%
and Spanish word
called pacificar,

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:39.020 align:middle line:10%
and depending how you
use it in a sentence,

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.030 align:middle line:10%
they shorten it to either
pacifico or pacifica.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And we dropped the A or
the O and named it Pacific,

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.500 align:middle line:90%
and it stuck.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.990 align:middle line:10%
And so that adds
confusion to everything,

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.150 align:middle line:10%
and also where the
Atlantic Ocean is today,

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.200 align:middle line:10%
instead of changing
that name to, let's say,

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.690 align:middle line:10%
the English Ocean
or something like

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.780 align:middle line:10%
that, they left it as Atlantic.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And then the Indian
Ocean, which got changed,

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.620 align:middle line:84%
was actually
Atlantean Ocean, too,

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.997 align:middle line:84%
if that name would have
been left the same,

00:05:10.997 --> 00:05:12.330 align:middle line:90%
it would have been a lot easier.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.000 align:middle line:84%
But it also got changed
to the Erythraean Sea

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.130 align:middle line:84%
before it got changed
to the Indian Ocean.

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:23.230 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: When Atlantis happened,
imploded, what happened to it?

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:28.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: Well, what we found
out is a couple of things,

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.860 align:middle line:84%
just ending up on this,
is that we found out

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.690 align:middle line:84%
that Atlantis was-- and this
is a highly encoded word

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.730 align:middle line:84%
in the word Atlantis, itself,
which is a Greek word--

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:39.460 align:middle line:84%
but it's actually
in three languages.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:46.780 align:middle line:10%
One is Sanskrit, the
ancient language of India,

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.330 align:middle line:10%
and then also the
language we found out

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.180 align:middle line:10%
that Atlanteans
spoke themselves,

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.180 align:middle line:10%
which is called Dravida,
which is Dravidian, and then

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.075 align:middle line:10%
also in ancient Greek.

00:05:58.075 --> 00:06:01.877 align:middle line:10%
And Professor Santos, that's
Professor Arysio Santos, who--

00:06:01.877 --> 00:06:03.460 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Author of
these works, right?

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.766 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: Author of the works
who I'm following up with.

00:06:05.766 --> 00:06:07.890 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: By the way, this
is the English version

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.670 align:middle line:10%
of Atlantis, right, by him?

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:15.220 align:middle line:10%
>>HOFF: Yes, exactly, he found
out and was able to decode it

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.310 align:middle line:10%
that this word, Atlantis,
it not only just

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.615 align:middle line:10%
has Atlas in it, which is
the person that was a pillar

00:06:23.615 --> 00:06:27.890 align:middle line:10%
and holding up the skies before
they fell down in a sense,

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:30.830 align:middle line:10%
but he found out it
was highly encoded

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.740 align:middle line:10%
and that it meant antipodal.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And that word
means it's actually

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.000 align:middle line:84%
on the opposite
side of the world,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:44.600 align:middle line:84%
but it also means more that it's
in a sunken or marsh, mountain

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.820 align:middle line:84%
land on the opposite
side of the world.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's highly encoded
that way, that it

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.730 align:middle line:84%
means that it's located
in the furthest west

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:56.020 align:middle line:84%
if you're looking from one
side of, like, say, Europe,

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.300 align:middle line:84%
but also to the furthest
east if you're looking

00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:59.960 align:middle line:90%
on the other side of the world.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:05.990 align:middle line:84%
And that location ends up
being in this sunken mountain

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.410 align:middle line:84%
marshland in the area of
Southeast Asia in Indonesia.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: OK, where
Lemuria is, same area.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.190 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: Same idea.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:14.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were they
one and the same?

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.870 align:middle line:10%
>>HOFF: Basically
one and the same,

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.010 align:middle line:10%
now that's just a matter
of having to rebuild.

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:22.220 align:middle line:10%
As I mentioned on a
previous program with you,

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.410 align:middle line:10%
Lemurian Atlantis ended
up getting destroyed

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:29.030 align:middle line:10%
by the Toba volcano, the Tobal
super volcano, a caldera one,

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:31.930 align:middle line:10%
about 74,000 or
75,000 years ago,

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:33.687 align:middle line:10%
well documented, by the way.

00:07:33.687 --> 00:07:35.270 align:middle line:84%
But they had to
rebuild, and they went

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:37.890 align:middle line:90%
in this valley area of India.

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:41.001 align:middle line:84%
And so they got chased out
of some other areas in India,

00:07:41.001 --> 00:07:42.750 align:middle line:84%
but had to go to the
place that was still,

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:45.485 align:middle line:84%
you know, habitable,
even after Lemurian--

00:07:45.485 --> 00:07:47.914 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they all went down
about the same time period?

00:07:47.914 --> 00:07:50.330 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: No, what happened is
they ended up rebuilding over

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.190 align:middle line:84%
60,000 years back to
basically the same spot where

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:54.350 align:middle line:90%
Lemurian Atlantis was.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:56.266 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right,
Lemuria came first, right?

00:07:56.266 --> 00:07:57.620 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: Lemuria came first.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.450 align:middle line:84%
The other one in a
sense is the second one.

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:02.670 align:middle line:84%
It was maybe over
in India where they

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:04.920 align:middle line:84%
had to rebuild for a
while, but they came back.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.429 align:middle line:84%
But they rebuilt over a
period of 60,000 years,

00:08:07.429 --> 00:08:08.970 align:middle line:84%
and you can imagine
how advanced they

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:11.260 align:middle line:84%
would be after that period
of time to Atlantis proper.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then
what happened again?

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: The next volcano
went off, called Krakatoa.

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:20.632 align:middle line:84%
The Krakatoa actually means
in the language, or Krakatoa--

00:08:20.632 --> 00:08:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that near
the Canary Islands?

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:25.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: No, this is
in Indonesia on what

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:32.390 align:middle line:84%
was between the island of Java,
or as they pronounce Andravida

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:35.620 align:middle line:84%
still in Bahasa,
Indonesia, it's "Jawa."

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's separating
what is now

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:40.659 align:middle line:84%
Sumatra and Java,
which used to be known

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:42.850 align:middle line:90%
as Upper Java and Lower Java.

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:45.850 align:middle line:84%
And the word, Krakatoa,
means to saw or saw in half,

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:47.560 align:middle line:84%
so it's right through
the Sunda Strait.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:51.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would
somebody, Frank, like Plato

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:53.130 align:middle line:90%
pick up the story of Atlantis?

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:54.701 align:middle line:90%
How would that get to him?

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:57.200 align:middle line:10%
>>HOFF: Great question, George,
and we traced this one back,

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:57.950 align:middle line:10%
too.

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:01.340 align:middle line:10%
Plato actually picked
up the information

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.760 align:middle line:10%
from a discussion of
some contemporaries that

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.820 align:middle line:10%
were going on with Saul
and the great lawmaker

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:09.440 align:middle line:10%
or giver of Athens.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:14.150 align:middle line:10%
And he, in turn, learned of
it from the Egyptian priests

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:16.770 align:middle line:10%
when he was on
vacation over in Egypt,

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:22.000 align:middle line:10%
but we found out further that
the Egyptian priests learned it

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.700 align:middle line:10%
from the Hindus.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And then the Hindus
in turn learned of it

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:28.490 align:middle line:90%
from the Atlanteans, themselves.

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:30.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's how
it got passed through.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:34.410 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: That's how it got passed
along and diffused, and then,

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:36.830 align:middle line:84%
of course, Plato, or
"Plat-eau," picked it up.

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:39.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In Indian texts, they
talk about flying machines,

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:41.160 align:middle line:90%
the vimanas.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.600 align:middle line:84%
Is it conceivable that,
at least on Atlantis,

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.540 align:middle line:90%
they had flying machines?

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: At least
on Atlantis proper,

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:53.290 align:middle line:84%
before it got destroyed by the
Krakatoa or Krakatau volcano,

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:55.380 align:middle line:84%
they had the flying
machines, the vimanas,

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.460 align:middle line:84%
and I've mentioned this on
your "Coast to Coast" show,

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:04.640 align:middle line:84%
that they could really deliver
huge populations and even had,

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:11.690 align:middle line:84%
like, parks or environmental
parks onboard the aircraft.

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:14.550 align:middle line:10%
And so they were very
advanced technology,

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:17.920 align:middle line:10%
but again, they had
a worldwide calamity

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:21.730 align:middle line:10%
that took place, a
conflagration, and because

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:26.400 align:middle line:10%
of the super Krakatoa volcano,
which is a caldera volcano.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.374 align:middle line:84%
And this really
decimated the whole area.

00:10:28.374 --> 00:10:30.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is what we have
at Yellowstone, by the way,

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:31.690 align:middle line:90%
same kind of thing.

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:34.292 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: The same
kind of volcano.

00:10:34.292 --> 00:10:35.754 align:middle line:90%
It's extremely powerful.

00:10:35.754 --> 00:10:37.920 align:middle line:84%
It's not like the one we
have up in Washington state

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.820 align:middle line:90%
called Mount Saint Helens.

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:42.361 align:middle line:90%
It went off on May 18th, 1980.

00:10:42.361 --> 00:10:43.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's not a caldera.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:46.930 align:middle line:84%
Caldera, it looks like an
inverted volcano, right?

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:48.840 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of underground.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the cone, but
it's around ground surface,

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:53.130 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:56.705 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: Yeah, it's more like
a submarine type of a volcano,

00:10:56.705 --> 00:10:58.790 align:middle line:90%
and it's got a lot more force.

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:01.760 align:middle line:10%
As a matter of fact,
Professor Santos-- and that's

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.100 align:middle line:10%
Professor Arysio
Nunes dos Santos--

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.590 align:middle line:10%
was a nuclear physicist
and a nuclear engineer.

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:09.860 align:middle line:10%
He also, as I mentioned
before, spoke 14 languages.

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.020 align:middle line:10%
He taught in the
disciplines of archeology,

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.046 align:middle line:10%
anthropology, even occultism.

00:11:14.046 --> 00:11:15.420 align:middle line:84%
Even though he
didn't necessarily

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.920 align:middle line:84%
want to be an occultist, he had
to learn the hidden meanings

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.460 align:middle line:90%
and derivations behind things.

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:21.870 align:middle line:10%
But because he was also
a nuclear physicist

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:23.370 align:middle line:10%
and took all these
other disciplines

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:26.290 align:middle line:10%
and uncovered the
riddle of Atlantis,

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:29.930 align:middle line:10%
he found out that that power
of the Krakatoa went off

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:32.531 align:middle line:10%
was something like
releasing a million atom

00:11:32.531 --> 00:11:34.780 align:middle line:10%
bombs like that went off in
Hiroshima, a million times

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:35.280 align:middle line:10%
the power.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:36.152 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez, huge.

00:11:36.152 --> 00:11:38.110 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: And then not only
that, the other thing

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:40.026 align:middle line:84%
he found out, too, and
I mentioned about this,

00:11:40.026 --> 00:11:45.440 align:middle line:84%
is the War of Atlantis that was
going on between the Dravidas

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.139 align:middle line:84%
on one side and also the aerial
Semites on the other side.

00:11:48.139 --> 00:11:49.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With high
technology, right?

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.138 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: With high
technology, we're

00:11:51.138 --> 00:11:54.607 align:middle line:84%
using tactical nuclear
weapons, but also one side

00:11:54.607 --> 00:11:56.940 align:middle line:84%
thought they were going to
get one up on the other side.

00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.070 align:middle line:84%
Because they were
at war, they decided

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:03.690 align:middle line:84%
to end up dropping a nuclear
type of mechanism, bomb,

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:06.370 align:middle line:84%
down in and around
the Krakatoa volcano,

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:07.707 align:middle line:90%
and it ended up going off--

00:12:07.707 --> 00:12:09.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's what set it off.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:09.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: --much
worse than what they

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:10.830 align:middle line:90%
thought it was going to go off.

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:11.450 align:middle line:84%
They just thought
they were going

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:13.220 align:middle line:84%
to get ones up and
almost destroyed

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:15.030 align:middle line:84%
the whole world
and all humanity.

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:19.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So this war was pretty
darn violent, wasn't it, Frank?

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: Yes, because they
held it in some places

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:25.950 align:middle line:84%
were actually even the nuclear
signatures are there today,

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:29.480 align:middle line:84%
and one is over in the Indus
Valley area of Harappa, which

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.790 align:middle line:84%
is like between
India and Pakistan.

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:34.480 align:middle line:84%
It was more India at the time,
I think more Pakistan today.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just us saying
it, like, Professor Santos

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:38.870 align:middle line:84%
and myself, but
these are reports

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:41.120 align:middle line:84%
that have come out where
they've taken Geiger counters

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:46.630 align:middle line:84%
and measured abnormal radiation
type of, you know, detection

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:53.810 align:middle line:84%
there, and also in another place
called Mohenjo-daro as well.

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And this is nothing
you can fake.

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:58.080 align:middle line:10%
It has a half-life
daughter products

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:03.980 align:middle line:10%
and a nuclear
signature, and so it's

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:07.940 align:middle line:10%
something that shows that there
was something going on there.

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:11.550 align:middle line:10%
Also in the area of
Indonesia, too, I'm

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:13.050 align:middle line:10%
not sure so much
about the signature

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:15.110 align:middle line:10%
there, but also over in
Mesopotamia and Sumeria

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:16.620 align:middle line:10%
there have been
signatures there.

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:18.661 align:middle line:84%
And there's maybe some
other places in the world.

00:13:18.661 --> 00:13:20.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the
message for mankind today,

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.640 align:middle line:84%
looking back at things
that happened to Lemuria,

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.475 align:middle line:90%
Atlantis, high-technology wars?

00:13:26.475 --> 00:13:28.990 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like it
could happen today.

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:32.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: Yes, the
message is here, too,

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.720 align:middle line:84%
that we need to be careful
what we're doing and getting

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.400 align:middle line:90%
along with one another.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.330 align:middle line:84%
We need to respect
to each other.

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:43.700 align:middle line:84%
This whole project that I'm
working on is about humanity,

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:47.170 align:middle line:84%
not just for some people on
Earth, but all people on Earth,

00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:50.640 align:middle line:84%
and we need to really come
back to respecting each other

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:54.660 align:middle line:84%
and to respecting each
other's views on maybe science

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:58.070 align:middle line:84%
and religion and, let's say,
even politics and things.

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And also people need to be
accountable for their actions,

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.730 align:middle line:84%
too, so this is
the kind of thing

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:06.070 align:middle line:84%
when things get out
of control and people

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:08.700 align:middle line:84%
don't respect to each other
or respect to other people's

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:12.612 align:middle line:84%
religions and things
like that and also

00:14:12.612 --> 00:14:14.320 align:middle line:84%
governments maybe not
respect each other.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.100 align:middle line:90%
It goes that way socially.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.930 align:middle line:84%
You run into these
things, so these

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:20.210 align:middle line:84%
are the lessons I
think we can learn

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:24.560 align:middle line:84%
from, let's say, maybe not
so much Lemurian Atlantis,

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.340 align:middle line:90%
but especially Atlantis proper.

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:31.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If we don't learn,
are we going that way?

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:34.690 align:middle line:10%
>>HOFF: Well, as
Professor Santos mentions

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:37.900 align:middle line:10%
on a little video we've
had up on our website--

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:42.030 align:middle line:10%
and this also I think is maybe
it's Albert Einstein that

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:46.530 align:middle line:10%
mentioned it-- we could end
up going back to the Iron Age,

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:47.030 align:middle line:10%
you know?

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:51.470 align:middle line:10%
If we have a nuclear war or
something like that, I mean,

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:54.250 align:middle line:10%
it could wipe everything
out on this planet

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:57.170 align:middle line:10%
and, you know, hardly any
resources or anything much

00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:57.760 align:middle line:10%
left.

00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you'd have to
start from ground zero,

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:05.540 align:middle line:84%
and actually one of
the biggest inventions

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:09.170 align:middle line:84%
that started all this was
agriculture and animal

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:09.807 align:middle line:90%
domestication.

00:15:09.807 --> 00:15:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, they were
geniuses, weren't they?

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:12.431 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: Look.

00:15:12.431 --> 00:15:15.550 align:middle line:84%
It may seem simple today
for agriculture and animal

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:17.440 align:middle line:84%
domestication, but
it's really not.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:20.250 align:middle line:84%
It's really the
biggest scientific

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:22.980 align:middle line:84%
or invention of
all time because it

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:25.000 align:middle line:84%
allows you to be
fixated to the land,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.210 align:middle line:84%
between agriculture and
animal domestication.

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:30.860 align:middle line:84%
By the way, they were also
into doing genetic engineering

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:31.550 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:34.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wow, they're
way, really advanced.

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:36.510 align:middle line:84%
I had always heard
that Atlantis might

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:39.100 align:middle line:84%
have had some kind of
huge crystal on it,

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:41.070 align:middle line:84%
and something happened
with that, too.

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:42.310 align:middle line:90%
Did you ever hear that?

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:44.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: I've heard this before.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.356 align:middle line:84%
That's going to be some
additional research that I'm

00:15:46.356 --> 00:15:47.470 align:middle line:90%
going to have to get into.

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:50.450 align:middle line:84%
So far, what Professor
Santos and I have released

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:52.470 align:middle line:84%
is probably only about
10% of the information.

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:54.690 align:middle line:90%
We got, like, 90% to go.

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:57.592 align:middle line:84%
And as I mentioned, you know,
we're not going away on this.

00:15:57.592 --> 00:15:59.300 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get to
the bottom of this.

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:00.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I just want to
let your listeners know.

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:02.410 align:middle line:84%
We are going to get
to the bottom of this,

00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:04.201 align:middle line:84%
and I am going to
release this information.

00:16:04.201 --> 00:16:08.461 align:middle line:84%
It's been held secret for
11,600 years, plus and more.

00:16:08.461 --> 00:16:09.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You want
it out, don't you?

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.134 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: I want to get it out.

00:16:12.134 --> 00:16:13.300 align:middle line:90%
It's not just I want it out.

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.820 align:middle line:84%
Professor Santos wanted it out,
and also, more importantly,

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:19.180 align:middle line:84%
the Atlanteans, themselves,
our ancient ancestors, they

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:21.010 align:middle line:90%
want it out.

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:24.630 align:middle line:84%
Our information, our message
to us-- and I'm the messenger

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:27.110 align:middle line:84%
to do this now, as
Professor Santos was--

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:30.410 align:middle line:84%
is to get this information out
to the public, to the world.

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And finally, after
all this time,

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:34.489 align:middle line:84%
there were reasons
for keeping it secret.

00:16:34.489 --> 00:16:36.530 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want the area
pillaged and plundered.

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:37.310 align:middle line:90%
It's a holy land.

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:39.750 align:middle line:10%
It is actually the holiest
land in the world, not

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:41.270 align:middle line:10%
the Middle East.

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:42.636 align:middle line:10%
This is the original holy land.

00:16:42.636 --> 00:16:44.260 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: This is the
cradle, wasn't it?

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.218 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: Of the civilization,
where civilization

00:16:46.218 --> 00:16:48.820 align:middle line:84%
began, not necessarily
where maybe humans were,

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.620 align:middle line:84%
because that is a migration
going back from Africa where

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:54.480 align:middle line:84%
they began, but they used
to migrate back and forth

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:57.480 align:middle line:84%
from Africa to the
area Southeast Asia,

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.520 align:middle line:84%
depending on
climatic conditions.

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.330 align:middle line:10%
Again, this is the middle
of the Pleistocene ice age,

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:05.440 align:middle line:10%
and the only thing that ended it
was the Krakatoa volcano going

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:06.250 align:middle line:10%
off.

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And how it ended it is
because we found out

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:14.345 align:middle line:84%
that all the fly ash eventually
from the Krakatoa volcano

00:17:14.345 --> 00:17:17.520 align:middle line:84%
came down on the glaciers,
and we had a as much

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.560 align:middle line:84%
as a two-mile-high sheet of ice
here in North America as well

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.660 align:middle line:90%
as other areas of the world.

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:26.369 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is that
when the fly ash came down

00:17:26.369 --> 00:17:29.240 align:middle line:84%
over a period of time
on those glaciers,

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:32.280 align:middle line:84%
it ended up absorbing
the sunlight.

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And this absorption
versus reflection

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:38.210 align:middle line:84%
is called, scientifically,
the albedo effects.

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:40.950 align:middle line:90%
This is not just us saying this.

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:44.810 align:middle line:84%
We actually found out that
NASA confirms this as well.

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:49.000 align:middle line:10%
And in our book on Atlantis,
we have some book links

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.490 align:middle line:10%
on our website at
www.atlan.org, and it's

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:58.090 align:middle line:10%
the number 12 book link has
a link to the NASA website,

00:17:58.090 --> 00:17:59.440 align:middle line:10%
confirming this.

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And then when all that
glacier water went off,

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:03.410 align:middle line:84%
it ended up going
into the oceans.

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:05.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is
this kept so secret?

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:09.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what's the
big deal about this?

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:10.550 align:middle line:90%
What are they hiding?

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: Well, again, they want
the area not to become pillaged

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:14.670 align:middle line:84%
and plundered as
far as that goes

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:17.030 align:middle line:84%
and desecrated because of
all the riches of Atlantis.

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:18.613 align:middle line:84%
There's the gold,
the silver, the tin,

00:18:18.613 --> 00:18:20.200 align:middle line:84%
the zinc all these
strategic metals,

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.740 align:middle line:84%
also all the spices in the
woods and everything like that.

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:24.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They would
pillage it, too.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.615 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: And they
would pillage it

00:18:25.615 --> 00:18:28.140 align:middle line:84%
because they need it
for the wars and battles

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.270 align:middle line:84%
because the Atlanteans
from Atlantis proper

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:31.400 align:middle line:90%
were actually weakened.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And they had to disperse
into other areas,

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.520 align:middle line:84%
and this valley civilization
was one of them, also

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:39.090 align:middle line:84%
over to, let's say, Sumeria
and Mesopotamia, Turkey,

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:42.090 align:middle line:84%
where they have Gobekli Tepe,
you found out information

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:44.100 align:middle line:90%
going on, very ancient there.

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:46.640 align:middle line:84%
That's when they went over
there later, also into Egypt

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.550 align:middle line:84%
and so on, and also to other
parts of Europe as well.

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:51.610 align:middle line:84%
The other route, they
were a seafaring people.

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:53.570 align:middle line:84%
They ended up going
down to the Americas.

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:55.830 align:middle line:84%
In this case, they had to
go down to lower latitudes

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:58.040 align:middle line:84%
because the Pleistocene
ice age was still ending.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.770 align:middle line:10%
So they went into
Ecuador and Peru,

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:01.830 align:middle line:10%
where there's probably
more archeological ruins

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:03.870 align:middle line:10%
than any place in the world.

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:09.600 align:middle line:84%
The Machu Picchu in
Peru, that is basically

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.555 align:middle line:90%
an Atlantean type of site.

00:19:11.555 --> 00:19:15.920 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the terracing
to control all the water and all

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:18.520 align:middle line:84%
the erosion and
everything on that site

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:22.120 align:middle line:84%
is all Atlantean-type
technology, not necessarily

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.380 align:middle line:84%
directly passed
on, but indirectly

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:27.140 align:middle line:84%
over a period of time
through all their relatives,

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:30.470 align:middle line:84%
in other words, the sons,
the daughters, the grandsons,

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:32.929 align:middle line:84%
you know, and the
great-grandsons and all

00:19:32.929 --> 00:19:34.720 align:middle line:84%
of this, all the way
down, and passing that

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:40.030 align:middle line:84%
on through the fallen
angels or civilizing heroes,

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:46.420 align:middle line:84%
the Quetzalcoatls and Kukulkans
and all these people that

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:51.370 align:middle line:84%
ended up going down
there that ended up

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:54.970 align:middle line:84%
infusing this ancient
technology information

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:56.669 align:middle line:90%
into the indigenous populations.

00:19:56.669 --> 00:19:58.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With your
permission, can we

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:01.060 align:middle line:84%
use a little bit of that clip
of Professor Santos that's

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:01.859 align:middle line:90%
on your website?

00:20:01.859 --> 00:20:02.400 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: Sure.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.775 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's
take a look at it.

00:20:03.775 --> 00:21:48.300 align:middle line:90%


00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:50.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's pretty
fascinating, and I'm

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:52.170 align:middle line:90%
glad you had subtitles there.

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:54.130 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about the
Atlantis Cross.

00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:55.350 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:57.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: Well, there
is an Atlantis Cross,

00:21:57.510 --> 00:22:00.950 align:middle line:84%
and we have a picture up
on the screen of that.

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:02.950 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
sacred symbol cross,

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:04.440 align:middle line:90%
and also I'm wearing one here.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:04.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You are.

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:04.900 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:06.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: But this
one here is an ankh

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:09.300 align:middle line:84%
that you usually see in
Egypt, but actually it's

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:10.660 align:middle line:90%
not originally from Egypt.

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:12.900 align:middle line:84%
It went over to the
Hindus in India,

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:15.425 align:middle line:84%
and actually it was an
Atlantean Cross originally.

00:22:15.425 --> 00:22:17.050 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people don't
know that, but we

00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:18.540 align:middle line:90%
were able to track that down.

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:21.070 align:middle line:84%
But this here is the
original Cross of Atlantis,

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:22.720 align:middle line:90%
as you see on the screen there.

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.910 align:middle line:10%
And that particular
cross denotes

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:26.610 align:middle line:10%
where the location
of Atlantis is

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:30.280 align:middle line:10%
and also where the location
even of the capital

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:31.030 align:middle line:10%
city of Atlantis--

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:32.080 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Like a map?

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.496 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: It's like
a map-- but it's

00:22:33.496 --> 00:22:37.180 align:middle line:84%
highly symbolic and coded--
that points to the direction

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:38.730 align:middle line:90%
where it is in this world.

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:39.930 align:middle line:90%
And here is the deal.

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:42.440 align:middle line:10%
It not only denotes all the
different canals and everything

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:45.730 align:middle line:10%
of the capital city of
Atlantis, because there

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:47.110 align:middle line:10%
is a continent of Atlantis.

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And it was a continent,
not an island.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.984 align:middle line:84%
The island was the capital city
with all the concentric rings.

00:22:51.984 --> 00:22:52.858 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was huge.

00:22:52.858 --> 00:22:55.000 align:middle line:84%
You were telling me
before we started taping,

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.930 align:middle line:90%
as big as the United States.

00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:58.860 align:middle line:10%
>>HOFF: With Alaska
and Hawaii combined,

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:01.810 align:middle line:10%
actually probably even
bigger, but this cross

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:05.860 align:middle line:10%
denotes the capital city but
also denotes the location.

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:08.410 align:middle line:84%
All the big ships used
to come into port.

00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:12.311 align:middle line:84%
See, the original Pillars
of Hercules was not, like,

00:23:12.311 --> 00:23:13.060 align:middle line:90%
over in Gibraltar.

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:18.160 align:middle line:84%
They were actually between
Lombok and also Bali,

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:21.300 align:middle line:84%
the islands of Lombok and Bali,
and going down the Wallace Line

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:22.550 align:middle line:90%
into the capital city.

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:23.707 align:middle line:90%
That's where it is.

00:23:23.707 --> 00:23:25.790 align:middle line:84%
And so they had to have
these deep channels to get

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:28.560 align:middle line:90%
all the big ships into port.

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:32.230 align:middle line:10%
This also denotes the
latitude and longitude

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:34.992 align:middle line:10%
of the location of Atlantis.

00:23:34.992 --> 00:23:37.200 align:middle line:84%
They had a population of
more than 20 million people.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you have to
decipher that, don't you?

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:41.217 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: Right, and we deciphered
it because the latitude still

00:23:41.217 --> 00:23:42.800 align:middle line:84%
goes through there
today, through what

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:46.020 align:middle line:84%
is now known as Sumatra
at zero degrees latitude.

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:49.380 align:middle line:84%
But what we also found out--
and it's changed over time--

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:53.300 align:middle line:84%
is that the meridian,
the longitude today,

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:55.530 align:middle line:84%
actually goes through
Greenwich, England.

00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:57.204 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is
by convention, also

00:23:57.204 --> 00:23:58.870 align:middle line:84%
because they were the
most powerful navy

00:23:58.870 --> 00:23:59.470 align:middle line:90%
in the world at one.

00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:00.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was
all over the place.

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:03.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: Right, but that
meridian wasn't there all along.

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:06.760 align:middle line:84%
What we found out, previously,
it was in Paris, France.

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:08.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did it change?

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:11.934 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: By convention, they
thought that by convention they

00:24:11.934 --> 00:24:13.350 align:middle line:84%
changed it over
to Paris, and that

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:15.020 align:middle line:90%
was before it went to England.

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:18.104 align:middle line:84%
Now, before it went
to Paris, it ended up

00:24:18.104 --> 00:24:19.770 align:middle line:84%
being in the Canary
Islands because they

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:23.250 align:middle line:84%
thought the Canary Islands,
in this case, was Atlantis.

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And this goes back a
while on the timeline,

00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:27.960 align:middle line:84%
and then before that,
maybe someplace else,

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.140 align:middle line:90%
but before that, Atlantis.

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:33.564 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Will we ever find
Atlantis definitively?

00:24:33.564 --> 00:24:35.480 align:middle line:10%
>>HOFF: Well, here's the
rest of that, George,

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:37.100 align:middle line:10%
about definitively.

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:39.880 align:middle line:10%
We also found out the
longitude ended up

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:44.720 align:middle line:10%
going over Sumatra as
well, so it ended up

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:48.380 align:middle line:10%
being at zero degrees latitude
and also zero degrees longitude

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:49.660 align:middle line:10%
before they changed it around.

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:50.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's that mean to us?

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:52.170 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFF: That means
X marks the spot,

00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:54.820 align:middle line:84%
and it was right over what
is now still Sumatra today.

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
they could actually

00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:59.130 align:middle line:84%
live in the middle of
the Pleistocene ice age,

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:03.420 align:middle line:84%
close to the Equator,
and at the same time

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:07.080 align:middle line:84%
have all the agriculture and
invention and the climate

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:08.860 align:middle line:84%
and the precipitation
and the soil--

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:09.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bingo,
it's right there.

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:11.060 align:middle line:10%
>>HOFF: -to take care
of the population.

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:12.800 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Frank, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:13.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFF: Thank you.

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:17.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Fascinating,
Atlantis, it is out there.

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:19.580 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
