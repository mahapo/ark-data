>>[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think many
people today don't

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.840 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.464 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.464 --> 00:00:13.430 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

was watching me.

>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.345 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:26.437 --> 00:00:28.270 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY MISHLOVE: And
very importantly, we

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.080 align:middle line:84%
developed the concept
of virtue and character.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.810 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Greeks
themselves did.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.370 align:middle line:84%
And that concept
was, in particular,

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.240 align:middle line:90%
elaborated by the Romans.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And so you hear-- I believe
it's the philosopher

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.040 align:middle line:84%
Epicurus, amongst
others, who said

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.745 align:middle line:90%
your fate is your character.

00:00:53.745 --> 00:00:55.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY:
Who was that guy?

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.420 align:middle line:10%
Well, that's Doctor
Jeffrey Mishlove, PhD

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.940 align:middle line:10%
You've seen him on television
programs-- noted author, as

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.459 align:middle line:10%
well-- and just a great
researcher into the paranormal.

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:08.580 align:middle line:84%
He's a clinical
psychologist who has

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.480 align:middle line:84%
been dealing with this for
now-- Jeffrey, how many years?

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.726 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: About 40.

00:01:12.726 --> 00:01:13.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 40 Years?

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.270 align:middle line:90%
You don't look a day over 45.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: I had more
hair when I started out.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love it.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.700 align:middle line:90%
How did you start out?

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.110 align:middle line:90%
What actually happened?

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.870 align:middle line:10%
>>MISHLOVE: I had personal
experiences, George,

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.860 align:middle line:10%
that were so earth
shaking, I made a decision

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.610 align:middle line:10%
when I was in my
early 20s that nothing

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.420 align:middle line:10%
could be more important
than studying this field.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what a
great field it is.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm obsessed with it.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.360 align:middle line:84%
When I do the Coast to Coast
radio show, of which you've

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.850 align:middle line:84%
been on several times
with us-- and by the way,

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.860 align:middle line:84%
you do a great job
on that-- I can't

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.490 align:middle line:84%
get enough of this, when
we deal with telepathy

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.530 align:middle line:84%
and intuitiveness
and consciousness.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.560 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.624 align:middle line:90%
I can't stop.

00:01:56.624 --> 00:01:57.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: It's my passion.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.390 align:middle line:90%
It's your passion.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure the viewers
feel the same way.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.800 align:middle line:90%
That's why you're here.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And for a lot of people
who don't know this,

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.980 align:middle line:84%
my late aunt was my father's
cousin, Dr. Shafica Karagulla.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And Shafica was a
psychiatrist who decided years

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.770 align:middle line:84%
ago in her practice, since
she's no longer with us-- died

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.140 align:middle line:84%
tragically in an
episode that we'll

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.100 align:middle line:84%
talk about later-- that
she wanted to devote

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.270 align:middle line:84%
her practice into the field
of telepathy and consciousness

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.630 align:middle line:90%
and intuitiveness.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.290 align:middle line:84%
Wrote a book called
"Breakthrough to Creativity,"

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.560 align:middle line:84%
and that'll tell you
how small this world is.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.600 align:middle line:90%
You knew her.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: Yes I did.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:43.450 align:middle line:90%
I knew her.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.860 align:middle line:84%
I brought her to
Berkeley in 1972.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.290 align:middle line:84%
She was part of a Frontiers
of Consciousness symposium

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.780 align:middle line:90%
that I organized at the time.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I remember
talking to her a few years

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.900 align:middle line:84%
before she died tragically
in an episode of-- this

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.010 align:middle line:84%
is what we're told-- a
radio of all things--

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.160 align:middle line:84%
thank God it wasn't my
program she was listening

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.170 align:middle line:84%
to at the time-- fell into a
tub, and she got electrocuted.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.374 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: Oh.

00:03:13.374 --> 00:03:14.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just a
tragic way to die.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.750 align:middle line:84%
But I remember her telling
me to come out to Los Angeles

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.730 align:middle line:84%
to visit her-- she
lived out in that area--

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.440 align:middle line:84%
because she knew
I was into this,

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.846 align:middle line:84%
and I was starting to learn it,
and I was doing broadcasting.

00:03:28.846 --> 00:03:31.630 align:middle line:84%
I never had a chance to
really sit down and talk

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:32.840 align:middle line:90%
with her about this field.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.956 align:middle line:90%
So I'm glad you did.

00:03:33.956 --> 00:03:34.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: I did indeed.

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:35.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She was a
pioneer, wasn't she?

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: She certainly was.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.590 align:middle line:84%
She referred to it as
higher sense perception.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:41.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Rather than
extrasensory perception.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: And she seemed
to be very much influenced

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.230 align:middle line:84%
by the idea that we are
being guided by-- I guess

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.990 align:middle line:90%
you could call them adepts.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.560 align:middle line:84%
Highly evolved people,
humans, some of them

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.560 align:middle line:84%
in the physical plane, some of
them not in the physical plane.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And they teach us
sometimes in our dreams.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.230 align:middle line:84%
She talked about, for
example, one of her patients

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.220 align:middle line:84%
who had dreams every
night of being in a school

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.190 align:middle line:84%
and receiving
spiritual teachings.

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And she noticed other
people in the classroom.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.209 align:middle line:84%
And on one occasion
in her dream,

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.940 align:middle line:84%
she was able to identify such
a person who lived across

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.759 align:middle line:84%
the country-- I think
from LA to New York--

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:27.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love it.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: --actually
managed to contact that person

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.360 align:middle line:84%
and learn that he was
having similar dreams.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:41.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you look at these
aspects of what's happening,

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you ask yourself,
how does this happen?

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:45.340 align:middle line:90%
How does this work?

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.280 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean?

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.500 align:middle line:84%
Have you gotten any
of those answers

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.610 align:middle line:90%
to those questions, Jeff?

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Well, I
think it's fair to say

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.450 align:middle line:84%
that the traditional Western
notion that all of this

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.080 align:middle line:84%
is impossible, that it goes
against our understanding

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.930 align:middle line:84%
of how the universe
works, I think

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.650 align:middle line:84%
it's fair to say at this
point that that is not

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.120 align:middle line:84%
a good argument any
longer, that if we look

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.560 align:middle line:84%
at new developments in physics
and in biology, in cosmology,

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.280 align:middle line:84%
in mathematics, even higher
dimensional mathematics,

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.420 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.690 align:middle line:84%
There's every reason
to think that the world

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.550 align:middle line:84%
of the paranormal--
particularly parapsychological,

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.550 align:middle line:84%
which is my specialty--
that it's not

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.570 align:middle line:84%
inconsistent with
what we're learning

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.409 align:middle line:90%
in other fields of science.

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:36.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had a
television program

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.950 align:middle line:84%
called "Thinking Allowed"
that aired on a number of PBS

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:41.390 align:middle line:90%
stations around the country.

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:45.230 align:middle line:84%
You now have "New Thinking
Allowed," which is on YouTube.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And people can simply
find it with that name.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: They can go
to newthinkingallowed,

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.170 align:middle line:90%
A-L-L-O-W-E-D, dot com.

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And we just started
this year after a hiatus

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.860 align:middle line:90%
of over a decade.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.060 align:middle line:84%
And so far, I've done
over 40 interviews.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.976 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:06:02.976 --> 00:06:03.530 align:middle line:90%
Good for you.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:04.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: Thank you.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.410 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for mentioning it.

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
drives you, Doctor?

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.310 align:middle line:90%
What pushes you into this field?

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.120 align:middle line:84%
Because this is an unusual
field for a lot of people.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: Yes.

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, to me, nothing
could be more important--

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:20.730 align:middle line:84%
both in terms of the very
profound personal experiences

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:24.050 align:middle line:84%
that I've had, but
also as a scientist.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.120 align:middle line:84%
This is a
paradigm-changing field.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.340 align:middle line:84%
It's a field that tells us
more about the deep nature

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.402 align:middle line:84%
of the human being and
about consciousness itself

00:06:35.402 --> 00:06:36.485 align:middle line:90%
than any other discipline.

00:06:36.485 --> 00:06:38.610 align:middle line:90%
And it's extremely important.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And hundreds of
people-- hundreds

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:43.190 align:middle line:84%
of thousands of
people, in fact--

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:46.880 align:middle line:84%
I understand this network
has a million subscribers.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.390 align:middle line:84%
People are hungry
for information.

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:55.290 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I through a lot of
hard effort and heartache,

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.110 align:middle line:84%
have a doctoral degree
in parapsychology.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:02.700 align:middle line:84%
I earned it in 1980 at the
University of California

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:03.470 align:middle line:90%
at Berkeley.

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:04.386 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:07:04.386 --> 00:07:06.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: And to
this day, George,

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.640 align:middle line:84%
in spite of enormous hunger in
the populace for information,

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm still the only
person in the world

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:17.290 align:middle line:84%
with an accredited doctoral
diploma in parapsychology.

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:19.730 align:middle line:90%
And that saddens me.

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:23.440 align:middle line:84%
So one of the reasons I'm
doing the television work

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:28.060 align:middle line:84%
and I teach at a couple of
schools that can't offer

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.290 align:middle line:84%
doctoral degrees in the field,
but at least I teach courses,

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:36.510 align:middle line:84%
is I want to see the day when
there are many doctoral degrees

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:38.510 align:middle line:90%
offered in parapsychology.

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:39.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:40.140 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:40.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: It's kind of lonely.

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.003 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --an interesting field.

00:07:42.003 --> 00:07:43.240 align:middle line:90%
It is lonely to be out there.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.870 align:middle line:84%
It's lonely at the top
sometimes, as they always say.

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any regrets
doing what you do?

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:51.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Well, there have
been some very painful moments.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.070 align:middle line:84%
You know, the
skeptics can be-- not

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:59.270 align:middle line:84%
genuine philosophical
skeptics, but the debunkers who

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.030 align:middle line:84%
just want to have nothing
to do and not allow

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:06.410 align:middle line:84%
this field to continue, they
can be vicious at times.

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And I had to, for example,
after I got my doctoral degree

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:15.120 align:middle line:84%
from Berkeley, there
was an effort launched

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.500 align:middle line:84%
by these debunkers who
knew nothing about me

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:22.332 align:middle line:84%
to get the university to
withdraw the diploma that

00:08:22.332 --> 00:08:23.515 align:middle line:90%
had been awarded.

00:08:23.515 --> 00:08:25.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aww, unbelievable.

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:27.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: Yeah.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are
they so cutthroat?

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:32.190 align:middle line:90%
Why are they so vindictive?

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:34.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Well, to
put the best face on it,

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:37.950 align:middle line:84%
they are concerned about
what they called the rising

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:39.510 align:middle line:90%
tide of superstition.

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:40.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.659 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: They think
that there's a lot

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:43.789 align:middle line:90%
of irrationality--

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:44.872 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're purists.

00:08:44.872 --> 00:08:45.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: --going on.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And they would point to
things like how many people

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.950 align:middle line:84%
in the United
States don't believe

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:54.310 align:middle line:84%
in the theory of evolution
and don't accept science.

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And so they lump
parapyschology together

00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:01.297 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of irrational beliefs
that are held in this society.

00:09:01.297 --> 00:09:02.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what
they don't realize

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:06.900 align:middle line:84%
is if you mesh science
with the paranormal world--

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:12.200 align:middle line:84%
parapsychology, for example--
everybody wins, because there

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.620 align:middle line:90%
is a science to what you do.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:15.980 align:middle line:90%
It's real.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:19.270 align:middle line:84%
So science needs to start
investigating how in the heck

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:20.540 align:middle line:90%
does this stuff happen.

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:23.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: You probably
know that, in 1969,

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:27.840 align:middle line:84%
the American Association for
the Advancement of Science

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:32.040 align:middle line:84%
evaluated the work being
done in parapsychology,

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.460 align:middle line:84%
and admitted The
Parapsychological

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:38.800 align:middle line:84%
Association, which is a small
organization of about 200,

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:42.550 align:middle line:84%
300 professional people
working in this field,

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:47.090 align:middle line:84%
it's now affiliated with the
major scientific organization

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:50.690 align:middle line:90%
in the world, really, the AAAS.

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:53.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My aunt was a living
example at the time, Jeffrey.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.510 align:middle line:90%
She was a medical doctor.

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:58.190 align:middle line:90%
She was a trained psychiatrist.

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:00.860 align:middle line:84%
And she turned her
practice into dealing

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:06.320 align:middle line:84%
with this kind of unusual,
strange, but at the same time,

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.476 align:middle line:90%
very important field.

00:10:08.476 --> 00:10:10.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: And in
so doing, she was

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:14.274 align:middle line:84%
able to honor the inner
experiences of her patients.

00:10:14.274 --> 00:10:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's no
question about that.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:16.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: That's
very important.

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:18.364 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She was
a believer, too.

00:10:18.364 --> 00:10:19.550 align:middle line:90%
She was a believer.

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:21.660 align:middle line:84%
And she started
because things were

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:23.740 align:middle line:90%
happening with her patients.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:27.530 align:middle line:84%
She would see things
that we're very unusual.

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And she said, there's
something to this.

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:31.430 align:middle line:90%
And so she flipped.

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:34.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Well, there are
now hundreds, maybe thousands,

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:38.010 align:middle line:84%
of serious professionals
in different disciplines

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:41.860 align:middle line:84%
who have their eyes open
and know what's going on.

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And they're being
supported every day

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:47.090 align:middle line:84%
by just looking at the
news in, for example,

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:52.480 align:middle line:84%
quantum teleportation that is
being reported on all the time.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.360 align:middle line:84%
There are new discoveries
in quantum physics

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.700 align:middle line:84%
that they don't necessarily
explain the paranormal,

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:02.520 align:middle line:84%
but at least you can say they
are not inconsistent with it.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's go
through different areas

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:07.520 align:middle line:90%
of the parapsychological world.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.760 align:middle line:84%
And I want to start it
by talking about someone

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.414 align:middle line:90%
we both know, Uri Geller.

00:11:11.414 --> 00:11:12.080 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: Yes.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Uri, of course,
has been on "Coast to Coast"

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:16.290 align:middle line:90%
with me a number of times.

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:18.980 align:middle line:84%
For people who may
not know who he is,

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:24.310 align:middle line:84%
he is the person who's got
this ability to change things

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:26.100 align:middle line:90%
with mind over matter.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:29.420 align:middle line:84%
He can bend spoons and he
can do all kinds of things.

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:32.350 align:middle line:84%
The spoons may be
more of a parlor item,

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:34.955 align:middle line:90%
but it's a great visual.

00:11:34.955 --> 00:11:37.300 align:middle line:84%
He came down for some
ridicule years ago

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:40.190 align:middle line:84%
when he was on "The Tonight
Show" with Johnny Carson.

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And he froze, and he wasn't
able to bend the spoon.

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And Johnny made a
little joke about that,

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.140 align:middle line:84%
and it kind of followed
Uri all over the place.

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:51.830 align:middle line:90%
But I think he's the real deal.

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:53.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: I
sponsored Uri Geller's

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:57.210 align:middle line:84%
first major public appearance
in the United States

00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:59.480 align:middle line:84%
at the University of
California Berkeley

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:02.860 align:middle line:84%
when I was a student
back in 1972.

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:04.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:05.380 align:middle line:90%
And he was young too then.

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:06.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: He was very young.

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And we've been friends
ever since then.

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:12.600 align:middle line:84%
I have had many,
many observations

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:16.830 align:middle line:84%
about what he has done
and what other people have

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:17.550 align:middle line:90%
seen with him.

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:19.420 align:middle line:84%
I've been with him
in the laboratory

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:21.970 align:middle line:90%
and in personal circumstances.

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:26.880 align:middle line:84%
I can't claim that I know that
everything he does everywhere

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:27.730 align:middle line:90%
is legitimate.

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:30.600 align:middle line:84%
He does have a background
as a stage magician.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:31.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:34.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: But I can say
that in numerous occasions,

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:40.040 align:middle line:84%
he has done things that the
skeptics cannot explain away.

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's absolutely true.

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:45.960 align:middle line:84%
I can cite a couple examples
we've seen him bend spoons.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.500 align:middle line:84%
But when he's been
on the radio show,

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:51.780 align:middle line:84%
he has asked
people-- via radio--

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:55.610 align:middle line:84%
to get their dead clocks
that have stopped running.

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And he said, put
them by the radio,

00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:59.450 align:middle line:90%
and let's use our energy.

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:02.340 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm starting to get
these emails from people,

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:04.370 align:middle line:90%
Jeffrey, my clock's working.

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:06.750 align:middle line:90%
It hasn't worked in 10 years.

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:11.520 align:middle line:84%
The ironic part of all of
this was, years later we

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:16.110 align:middle line:84%
re-ran the program in one
of our best of segments.

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:18.920 align:middle line:84%
In that segment, he
talked about the radio.

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:20.330 align:middle line:90%
He's not live by any means.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:21.800 align:middle line:90%
He's on tape.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.780 align:middle line:90%
The same thing happened.

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.976 align:middle line:84%
I started getting
emails from people.

00:13:25.976 --> 00:13:27.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I didn't even
know this program

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.170 align:middle line:90%
was running that weekend.

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:31.094 align:middle line:84%
I started getting emails
from people saying,

00:13:31.094 --> 00:13:32.010 align:middle line:90%
my clocks are running.

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:32.801 align:middle line:90%
My clock's running.

00:13:32.801 --> 00:13:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, what am I getting
these emails for from a show I

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:38.600 align:middle line:90%
did two years ago?

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at the
schedule, and there

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.360 align:middle line:90%
was the best of running.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.710 align:middle line:84%
We have a producer
who picks the programs

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:46.820 align:middle line:84%
and runs them on a Saturday
night, Sunday night.

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.730 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, the
clocks worked again.

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:52.040 align:middle line:84%
The guy's got some kind of
energy force around him.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:55.101 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Well, it might
be this, that psychokinesis,

00:13:55.101 --> 00:13:55.600 align:middle line:90%
which is--

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which is what that is.

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:58.366 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: --the
parapsychological term

00:13:58.366 --> 00:14:01.320 align:middle line:84%
for mind over matter may
be much more widely spread

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.920 align:middle line:84%
in the general population
than is typically thought.

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And it might be
the case that when

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.440 align:middle line:84%
people hear about
Uri Geller doing it,

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:14.030 align:middle line:84%
it sort of frees up everyone
else's ability a little bit,

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:16.310 align:middle line:84%
so you get what the
parapsychologists call

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:20.320 align:middle line:84%
the mini-Gellers happening
all over the world.

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And there have been
thousands of them,

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:24.610 align:middle line:90%
thousands of them, reported.

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk about
pre-cognition to start.

00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:28.217 align:middle line:90%
What exactly is that?

00:14:28.217 --> 00:14:30.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: You could
think of pre-cognition

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:31.950 align:middle line:90%
as backward causality.

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell, amongst
parapsychologists,

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:37.620 align:middle line:84%
there's sort of a
debate going on as

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.100 align:middle line:84%
to whether the phenomenon
we're looking at

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:43.570 align:middle line:84%
is pre-cognition
or something else.

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:47.200 align:middle line:84%
Because some people
say that you can't

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.680 align:middle line:84%
know the future because
the future hasn't happened.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:50.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:54.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: That seems like an
obvious philosophical point.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And if that's the
case, then people who,

00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:02.590 align:middle line:84%
in experiments of pre-cognition,
who can identify the future,

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:05.240 align:middle line:84%
could it be that
they're actually

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.870 align:middle line:84%
using some other
skill, that they're

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:08.930 align:middle line:90%
looking at the probabilities?

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:12.900 align:middle line:84%
Or could it be that
it's multiple universes,

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:15.780 align:middle line:84%
that they're seeing
a particular future,

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:17.180 align:middle line:90%
it may or may not happen?

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:20.100 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they get very
precise descriptions

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:21.390 align:middle line:90%
of things that don't occur.

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:24.550 align:middle line:84%
Or could it be, as was
the case in the book

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:28.000 align:middle line:84%
I wrote, "The PK Man,"
an individual who

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.540 align:middle line:84%
was using psychokinesis
to say this and that event

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:34.920 align:middle line:84%
will happen, and
it was something

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:38.180 align:middle line:90%
he caused rather than predicted.

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:41.720 align:middle line:84%
This is a big mystery
and a big controversy

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.730 align:middle line:90%
within parapsychology today.

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:48.710 align:middle line:84%
There are some people who insist
that psychokinesis is not real,

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:50.660 align:middle line:90%
it's all pre-cognition.

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:55.540 align:middle line:84%
So you can't be sure
at this point in time.

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:57.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So this
pre-cognition I have found,

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:01.570 align:middle line:84%
Jeffrey, is
manifested when people

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:03.060 align:middle line:84%
are in a different
state of mind,

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:05.220 align:middle line:84%
when they're a little
more relaxed, when

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:06.990 align:middle line:90%
they're a little more positive.

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:11.832 align:middle line:84%
It seems like that scope
makes it work better.

00:16:11.832 --> 00:16:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Well, not
just pre-cognition,

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:18.310 align:middle line:84%
but all of the forms of
extrasensory perception--

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:21.290 align:middle line:84%
retro-cognition,
clairvoyance, telepathy,

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:26.300 align:middle line:84%
anything that requires a
receptive mind works better

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:29.800 align:middle line:84%
when people are
relaxed and feeling

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:33.680 align:middle line:90%
very positive about themselves.

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:38.420 align:middle line:84%
Whereas psychokinesis, or even
sending a telepathic message,

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:42.190 align:middle line:84%
seems to work better when
a person is more aroused.

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:43.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:45.820 align:middle line:90%
Clairvoyance is what?

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Clairvoyance,
it's French for clear seeing.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And it would be an example
of extrasensory perception

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.760 align:middle line:90%
across space in real time.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.900 align:middle line:84%
Like it's sometimes
called remote viewing

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:04.349 align:middle line:84%
these days, where a person
can simply relax and obtain

00:17:04.349 --> 00:17:07.180 align:middle line:84%
information about
what another person is

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:12.250 align:middle line:84%
doing maybe 100 or 1,000
miles or 10,000 miles away.

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:14.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you, with
this kind of ability,

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:18.619 align:middle line:84%
plant seeds in other
people's minds?

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:20.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: That
would be, for example,

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:23.470 align:middle line:90%
telepathic hypnotic suggestion.

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:27.449 align:middle line:84%
And the Russians began
researching that--

00:17:27.449 --> 00:17:28.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They loved that.

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:31.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: --back
in the 19th century.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.840 align:middle line:84%
And in the early
20th century, there

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:38.510 align:middle line:84%
are some good examples of that
reported in the literature.

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:40.936 align:middle line:84%
So I would say
it's a possibility.

00:17:40.936 --> 00:17:42.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They had some
success stories there.

00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:44.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: Yes.

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's exciting and
dangerous at the same time,

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:48.180 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:50.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: A lot of this is
dangerous at the same time.

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:55.760 align:middle line:84%
I think we have to appreciate
that only 300 years ago, which

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:59.129 align:middle line:84%
is a relatively short time,
we were burning witches

00:17:59.129 --> 00:17:59.670 align:middle line:90%
at the stake.

00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:00.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: And I guess
that's one of the reasons

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:09.290 align:middle line:84%
that the debunkers are so afraid
of this, because how can we

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:12.340 align:middle line:84%
handle the idea that
somebody can throw

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:14.900 align:middle line:90%
a hex at you, for example?

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:16.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it works.

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:16.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: Yeah.

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:17.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it works.

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:21.455 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: When I did the
research on "The PK Man"

00:18:21.455 --> 00:18:22.372 align:middle line:90%
on one occasion--

00:18:22.372 --> 00:18:24.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that was about
an individual, wasn't it?

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:25.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Ted
Owens was his name.

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:26.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yep, OK.

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:27.930 align:middle line:10%
I remember that.

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:30.640 align:middle line:10%
>>MISHLOVE: He had a lot of
extraordinary psychokinetic

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:32.830 align:middle line:10%
abilities, and he was
demonstrating them

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:34.390 align:middle line:10%
right and left to me.

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:36.790 align:middle line:84%
But I was on the phone
with him on one occasion.

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And he had promised
me he was going

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:43.840 align:middle line:84%
to create three UFO appearances
within a particular time

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:44.570 align:middle line:90%
window.

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:46.380 align:middle line:90%
And two of them had happened.

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him, well, you
haven't done the third one yet.

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And he was angry at me
for having said this.

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:54.915 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did he go ballistic?

00:18:54.915 --> 00:18:56.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Well, he
hung up the phone.

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:57.414 align:middle line:90%
He slammed the phone.

00:18:57.414 --> 00:18:58.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:01.909 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: And within
minutes, I began to feel ill.

00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:03.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like he was doing
something to you, huh?

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:06.241 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: You know the
feeling you get in your throat

00:19:06.241 --> 00:19:08.217 align:middle line:84%
when you know, uh oh,
I'm about to get sick?

00:19:08.217 --> 00:19:08.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: A little scratchy
feeling in your throat?

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:14.256 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh, there's
nothing I can do now.

00:19:14.256 --> 00:19:15.130 align:middle line:90%
It's going to happen.

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:18.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm about to have
a cold or a flu.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.730 align:middle line:84%
And 45 minutes later,
he called me back.

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me, without
explaining anything,

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:27.110 align:middle line:90%
he said Jeffrey, I'm sorry.

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:28.220 align:middle line:90%
I apologize.

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:29.880 align:middle line:84%
I will never do
that to you again.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:30.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: And the cold lifted.

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:35.550 align:middle line:84%
My throat felt
better right away.

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:40.970 align:middle line:84%
So I think most people
are not prepared to live

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:44.140 align:middle line:84%
in a world like that,
because amongst other things,

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:47.860 align:middle line:84%
it means that you've got
to treat every other person

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:49.480 align:middle line:90%
with respect.

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:52.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: In Ted Owens'
case, he would come around

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:55.990 align:middle line:84%
and he would tell people, I
can do this and I can do that.

00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:58.247 align:middle line:90%
And he wanted to show them.

00:19:58.247 --> 00:19:58.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:02.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: And I have
168 demonstrations

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:05.670 align:middle line:84%
that he provided, roughly
two thirds of them

00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:07.590 align:middle line:90%
occurred as he said they would.

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:11.890 align:middle line:84%
Not 100% by any means,
but you wouldn't

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:14.710 align:middle line:84%
expect these things to
occur more than one time

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:15.470 align:middle line:90%
in a hundred.

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:19.100 align:middle line:84%
So to thirds is a
great batting average.

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:21.560 align:middle line:84%
In any case, he would
make these claims,

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:22.910 align:middle line:90%
and people would laugh at him.

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:24.000 align:middle line:90%
They'd say, you're a fool.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:24.840 align:middle line:90%
You're an idiot.

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And then he would say,
well, you think so?

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:29.640 align:middle line:84%
I guess I have to
teach you a lesson.

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:32.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So how did Ted
Owens have this power?

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:35.690 align:middle line:84%
How did he have this
ability to do what he did?

00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And I assume he had it
since he was a baby.

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:41.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: He claimed that
he was working with aliens.

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:42.720 align:middle line:90%
This was his story.

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:46.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: He called them
the space intelligences.

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:52.400 align:middle line:84%
He claimed that he had been
guided by them since childhood,

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.770 align:middle line:84%
that he was taught a special
language to communicate

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:57.920 align:middle line:90%
with them, a symbolic language.

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And in order for him
to learn that language,

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:03.180 align:middle line:84%
they arranged for
him to hold down

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:05.160 align:middle line:90%
many different professions.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.460 align:middle line:90%
He was a jazz drummer.

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:08.790 align:middle line:84%
He was a bull whip
artist in a circus.

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:10.440 align:middle line:90%
He was a high speed typist.

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.400 align:middle line:84%
He was a parapsychology
researcher with J. B.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:16.470 align:middle line:90%
Rhine at Duke University, yes.

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:19.940 align:middle line:84%
But he said he had to have all
of these different backgrounds

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:24.920 align:middle line:84%
in order to understand their
complex symbolic system.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
believe that story?

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:26.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: No.

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:27.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You did not?

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: To be honest, I--

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:30.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But he
did have some gift?

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:30.800 align:middle line:90%
You're convinced of that?

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Oh yes,
he clearly had a gift.

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And my co-author on the
original book of "The PK Man"

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:40.910 align:middle line:84%
was D. Scott Rogo, one
of the now deceased

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:43.490 align:middle line:84%
but very knowledgeable
on the whole history

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:46.340 align:middle line:84%
of psychical research
and parapsychology.

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And Scott believed
that there wasn't

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:51.310 align:middle line:84%
anyone in the history
of the field who

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:57.230 align:middle line:84%
exhibited such unusual, large
scale psychokinetic abilities.

00:21:57.230 --> 00:22:00.170 align:middle line:84%
Ted Owens said he was the
first person since Moses

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:01.790 align:middle line:90%
to have these.

00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:04.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So he was kind of
boisterous though, wasn't he?

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:05.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Yes, you could
call him a braggadocio.

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:07.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Over the top?

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:08.218 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: Yeah, completely.

00:22:08.218 --> 00:22:12.144 align:middle line:84%
He was like Pecos Bill or
Paul Bunyan, larger than life.

00:22:12.144 --> 00:22:14.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I assume
he's not with us either?

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:16.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: He died in 1987.

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:21.940 align:middle line:84%
At the time of his death, in a
farmhouse in upstate New York,

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:26.730 align:middle line:84%
lights were spotted in the sky
hovering above the farmhouse.

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:30.369 align:middle line:84%
So I cannot discount
his story about the--

00:22:30.369 --> 00:22:30.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: ETs.

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:33.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Yes, he called
them the space intelligences,

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.700 align:middle line:90%
other dimensional beings.

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:38.200 align:middle line:84%
He went into great
detail about them.

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that it's
true, so I don't believe it.

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.300 align:middle line:90%
But I don't dismiss it, either.

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:43.220 align:middle line:90%
It's one of those--

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:45.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why would
he make it up?

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:47.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Well, people
make these things up

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:51.820 align:middle line:84%
because they don't want to
believe that they themselves

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:53.400 align:middle line:90%
are doing it.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:23:00.720 align:middle line:84%
There was a psychokinetic person
in England, Susanne Padfield,

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:04.000 align:middle line:84%
she was the wife of a famous
physicist named Ted Bastion.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.770 align:middle line:84%
And she had
psychokinetic abilities.

00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:08.560 align:middle line:84%
They were tested
in the laboratory.

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:12.910 align:middle line:84%
And at one point, she gave a
talk called Psychic Support

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:13.870 align:middle line:90%
Figures.

00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:15.950 align:middle line:84%
She said she, at
one time, believed

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:19.320 align:middle line:84%
that there were spirits who were
doing this because she couldn't

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.920 align:middle line:90%
accept it was herself.

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:24.280 align:middle line:84%
Finally, she came to accept
that it was really her,

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:27.280 align:middle line:84%
and she didn't need
the support figures.

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:30.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That is-- it's
amazing how this all works.

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:34.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm convinced it's real, and
I'm convinced some people have

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:36.870 align:middle line:90%
better abilities than others.

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:39.990 align:middle line:84%
Though we all have
the ability, don't we?

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:42.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: It seems like
any other human ability

00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:45.160 align:middle line:90%
that there's a bell curve.

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:47.720 align:middle line:84%
Some people have it
to an extreme degree,

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:49.850 align:middle line:84%
some people hardly
have it at all.

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:53.990 align:middle line:84%
But by virtue of the fact
that we have consciousness,

00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:56.980 align:middle line:84%
it has to do with the very
nature of consciousness.

00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:58.900 align:middle line:90%
We all have some.

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:02.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it the process
of the brain, Jeffrey,

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:05.960 align:middle line:84%
or is it something outside
of the physical realm?

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: I would
say that consciousness

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.820 align:middle line:90%
is much more than the brain.

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:14.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm kind of comfortable with
the philosophical notion

00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:18.730 align:middle line:84%
of pantheism or
panpsychism, which

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:20.970 align:middle line:84%
suggests that
consciousness goes right

00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:25.140 align:middle line:84%
down to subatomic
particles and atoms

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:28.290 align:middle line:84%
and molecules and
single-celled creatures,

00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:31.700 align:middle line:84%
that there's consciousness
at every level.

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So tell us more about
the new program, New Thinking

00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:35.500 align:middle line:90%
Allowed.

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:36.820 align:middle line:90%
This is exciting.

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:39.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Well, as
I'm a parapsychologist,

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.510 align:middle line:84%
I hope to interview
lots of other people

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:46.080 align:middle line:84%
who are working professionally
in the field of parapsychology

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:52.260 align:middle line:84%
in order to create a library of
real parapsychologists talking

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:56.050 align:middle line:84%
to other real parapsychologists
so that, in the future,

00:24:56.050 --> 00:24:59.140 align:middle line:84%
people who wish to
be parapsychologists

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:01.537 align:middle line:84%
will be able to use
this as a resource.

00:25:01.537 --> 00:25:02.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a great program.

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:04.890 align:middle line:84%
Are you starting to get
YouTube hits on that?

00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:05.681 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: We are.

00:25:05.681 --> 00:25:08.380 align:middle line:84%
We have only been at
it for a few months.

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:10.794 align:middle line:84%
We have over 1,000
subscribers now.

00:25:10.794 --> 00:25:11.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:14.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: The original
"Thinking Allowed"

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:17.200 align:middle line:84%
is also on YouTube,
and they have

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.860 align:middle line:90%
had over four million hits.

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:20.877 align:middle line:90%
So I'm sure we'll get there.

00:25:20.877 --> 00:25:23.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what has been
your most important influence,

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:24.040 align:middle line:90%
Jeffrey?

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:27.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: When I created an
interdisciplinary, individual,

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:32.190 align:middle line:84%
doctoral major at Berkeley
in parapsychology,

00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:35.580 align:middle line:84%
one of my faculty
members was Charlie Tart.

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:41.704 align:middle line:84%
And he's a very experienced
and wise parapsychologist.

00:25:41.704 --> 00:25:42.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Into this big time.

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:44.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: He's done
a lot of research

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:48.010 align:middle line:84%
on out of body experiences
and on training

00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:50.880 align:middle line:84%
extrasensory
abilities, which became

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:53.380 align:middle line:90%
my focus as a graduate student.

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:56.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, I would say when
you specialize in something

00:25:56.100 --> 00:26:00.250 align:middle line:84%
here, what would you say is the
topic you think you're the best

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:01.380 align:middle line:90%
at?

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Training
psychic abilities.

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:04.610 align:middle line:90%
That was my focus.

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:08.390 align:middle line:84%
I have a book out on it called
"Psi Development Systems."

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:10.950 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's very important.

00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:13.920 align:middle line:84%
It's not the same as
the research field,

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:16.350 align:middle line:84%
but I'm most
interested in training

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:18.640 align:middle line:84%
and in practical
applications, because I

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.470 align:middle line:84%
think as more and
more people are

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:22.560 align:middle line:84%
comfortable with
their own abilities,

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:24.550 align:middle line:84%
and are finding that
they can use them

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:28.060 align:middle line:84%
for the benefit of everybody--
in law enforcement,

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:32.140 align:middle line:84%
in financial forecasting,
in archeology, in medicine,

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:35.530 align:middle line:84%
and in healing-- that there'll
be general acceptance.

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And I look forward to a
day, probably in the far

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:42.125 align:middle line:84%
distant future, where
human beings everywhere

00:26:42.125 --> 00:26:44.730 align:middle line:84%
are just comfortable and
are willing to accept this

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:47.980 align:middle line:84%
as a natural part of what
it means to be human.

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:50.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I'm sure you've
seen better students than some?

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:51.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: Yup.

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:55.180 align:middle line:84%
I've had some great students
I have to say, yeah,

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:59.330 align:middle line:84%
in the schools where I teach--
the University of Philosophical

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:01.720 align:middle line:84%
Research and the
Holmes institute.

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:06.110 align:middle line:84%
I asked students to write
about their own experiences.

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing some
of the papers I get.

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a common
denominator, Jeffrey,

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.840 align:middle line:84%
between those people,
those students,

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:18.490 align:middle line:90%
who are good at this field?

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:19.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: No.

00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:22.050 align:middle line:84%
You know, I wish I
could say there--

00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:25.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like if you looked
at five great students

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:29.830 align:middle line:84%
of parapsychology, could
you say, all five of these

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:36.579 align:middle line:84%
are positive thinking people,
or all five of these people

00:27:36.579 --> 00:27:38.620 align:middle line:84%
take certain supplements,
or something like that?

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:41.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: (LAUGHING) It's
definitely not supplements.

00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:43.620 align:middle line:84%
But yes, I suppose
it's fair to say

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:46.264 align:middle line:84%
they have a positive
attitude towards themselves.

00:27:46.264 --> 00:27:47.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They believe in it.

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:50.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Towards
life in general.

00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:53.320 align:middle line:84%
That probably is, now
that you mention it,

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:54.860 align:middle line:90%
a common denominator.

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:58.210 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes, I get
stories from people

00:27:58.210 --> 00:27:59.620 align:middle line:90%
who are in the military.

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:00.840 align:middle line:90%
They're in battle.

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And for example,
in one instance,

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:07.350 align:middle line:84%
a person wrote about
a situation where

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:09.160 align:middle line:90%
they're in Vietnam in battle.

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:10.290 align:middle line:90%
And they just hear a voice.

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:11.310 align:middle line:90%
It says, turn around.

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:12.990 align:middle line:90%
Turn around now.

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And it enabled them to turn
around and kill a Viet Cong who

00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:21.270 align:middle line:90%
had their rifle aimed at them.

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:22.095 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:28:22.095 --> 00:28:22.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: It saved their life.

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:24.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They picked
that up, yeah.

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.600 align:middle line:84%
I used to, in high
school, some girl

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:28.470 align:middle line:90%
would be sitting in front of me.

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And I'd try to send her
thoughts-- hey, hey, come on.

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:32.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm a kid in high school, right?

00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:36.510 align:middle line:84%
I'd send her thoughts to get
her to turn around or something

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:37.570 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And I still could never
figure out if I did it

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:46.680 align:middle line:84%
or if just the process of
time she turned around,

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:49.270 align:middle line:84%
but it was always fun
to experiment with that.

00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:51.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: There's an
interesting line of research

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:54.889 align:middle line:84%
having to do with the
feeling of being stared at.

00:28:54.889 --> 00:28:55.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:55.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: People get like a--

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:57.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a
vibrational tingling.

00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:59.485 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: --tingle in the
back of their neck sometimes.

00:28:59.485 --> 00:29:03.190 align:middle line:84%
So researchers put subjects
in an isolated room.

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And then from another room,
watching them on video,

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:09.760 align:middle line:84%
would be other people
at random intervals.

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And they measured their
physiological responses

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:17.490 align:middle line:84%
to when they were actually
being stared at on video

00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:19.124 align:middle line:90%
and got successful results.

00:29:19.124 --> 00:29:20.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's great.

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:20.748 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: Yeah.

00:29:20.748 --> 00:29:24.090 align:middle line:84%
So it seems to be
that in daily life,

00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:28.040 align:middle line:84%
we're all using these
abilities, but sort of just

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.157 align:middle line:90%
below the level of awareness.

00:29:30.157 --> 00:29:32.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the best thing
about being a parapsychologist?

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:35.730 align:middle line:84%
It can't be because you
make a million dollars year.

00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:37.707 align:middle line:90%
That's not it.

00:29:37.707 --> 00:29:39.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: No, it's
certainly not it.

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:42.640 align:middle line:84%
Parapsychologists
are not well paid.

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:46.260 align:middle line:84%
There's very little funding in
the field of parapsychologist.

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:47.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's unfortunate.

00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:48.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: It is unfortunate.

00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:51.560 align:middle line:84%
You have to be a person
who's self-motivated.

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:54.900 align:middle line:84%
You have to be a person
who's willing to overcome

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:58.180 align:middle line:84%
difficulties and overcome
challenges and approach

00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:03.600 align:middle line:84%
it more or less as a passion,
as a love, first and foremost.

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.770 align:middle line:84%
And when you do
that, you'll find

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:09.450 align:middle line:84%
that you're part of a
community of similar people.

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And I would say that being
part of that community

00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:17.590 align:middle line:84%
has been a great joy and
pleasure throughout my life.

00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:18.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's good.

00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:21.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: I just love the
other people in the field,

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:24.340 align:middle line:84%
and I feel like I
get a lot of love

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:26.180 align:middle line:90%
and support back from them.

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:27.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it growing?

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.690 align:middle line:90%
The field?

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:32.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Parapsychology,
professional parapsychology,

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:35.620 align:middle line:84%
is maybe only 200 or
300 people in the world.

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:37.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gosh, that's nothing.

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:40.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: But think of
your viewers, for example.

00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:44.430 align:middle line:84%
Think of the millions of people
who are hungry for information

00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:45.173 align:middle line:90%
about this.

00:30:45.173 --> 00:30:46.256 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, they love it.

00:30:46.256 --> 00:30:47.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: And I
have to consider you.

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:51.060 align:middle line:84%
Even though you're not a
professional parapsychologist,

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:54.925 align:middle line:84%
you are working professionally
in a related field

00:30:54.925 --> 00:30:56.697 align:middle line:84%
so that you're part
of the community.

00:30:56.697 --> 00:30:57.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:30:57.530 --> 00:31:00.965 align:middle line:84%
I guess you must feel pretty
good being the only one.

00:31:00.965 --> 00:31:03.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Well, I suppose
I could be proud of it,

00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:05.700 align:middle line:90%
but after 30 years?

00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:07.284 align:middle line:84%
It's a big sadness,
to be honest.

00:31:07.284 --> 00:31:08.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, you
wish there were more.

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:10.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: I sure do.

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:11.660 align:middle line:90%
I sure do.

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:13.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that
going to change?

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:15.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: I hope so.

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:20.260 align:middle line:84%
I would say, if somebody is
able to watch this interview 200

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:23.560 align:middle line:84%
years from now, they'll
probably look back and say,

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.720 align:middle line:90%
wow, it did change.

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:26.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:27.010 align:middle line:90%
That could be.

00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:29.760 align:middle line:84%
Or they may be
communicating via telepathy.

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:30.510 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:32.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: But it's
going to take time.

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:36.710 align:middle line:84%
The opposition, the fact
that after 35 years,

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:40.610 align:middle line:84%
not a single doctoral
degree in parapsychology

00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:43.560 align:middle line:84%
has been awarded elsewhere
anywhere in the world

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:47.520 align:middle line:84%
speaks a ton of words
about the resistance.

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:48.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Volumes, volumes.

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:53.590 align:middle line:84%
I think the universities
probably thank this is fu-fu,

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:55.620 align:middle line:84%
and we're not going to
give degrees in this.

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:56.953 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: They're embarrassed.

00:31:56.953 --> 00:32:01.090 align:middle line:84%
They're afraid of the horse
laugh, which is the skeptic's

00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:02.000 align:middle line:90%
biggest weapon.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They don't get it.

00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:04.420 align:middle line:90%
They don't get it.

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:07.460 align:middle line:84%
Years ago, the government
had a remote viewing program,

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:10.000 align:middle line:84%
because some of the great
remote viewers of our time

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.480 align:middle line:84%
are still alive, and they
appear on my program.

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:16.260 align:middle line:90%
They claim that it stopped.

00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:17.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure it did.

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:20.470 align:middle line:84%
It may have stopped
with these individuals,

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:22.530 align:middle line:90%
but it may still be going on.

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:23.510 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:25.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Well, I
have no direct knowledge

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:27.090 align:middle line:90%
that it is going on.

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:30.650 align:middle line:84%
Everybody I talk to
says that it's not.

00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:34.459 align:middle line:84%
But if it were going on, the
people who were involved--

00:32:34.459 --> 00:32:35.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You would have--

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:37.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: --would not be
afraid to talk about it.

00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:38.013 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:32:38.013 --> 00:32:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: And it might
be smart on their part,

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:43.200 align:middle line:84%
because if it were
publicly discussed,

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:46.210 align:middle line:84%
it would just be
embroiled in controversy.

00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:49.490 align:middle line:84%
If I were in the government and
wished to do remote viewing,

00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:50.770 align:middle line:90%
I would keep it very quiet.

00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:51.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I would too.

00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:54.250 align:middle line:84%
Taxpayers would say,
this is a waste of money.

00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:55.631 align:middle line:90%
What are we spending it for?

00:32:55.631 --> 00:32:56.380 align:middle line:90%
And this and that.

00:32:56.380 --> 00:33:00.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Oh, there's plenty
of good research at this point

00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:03.310 align:middle line:84%
to suggest that it's a
legitimate phenomenon.

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And in m the government
commissioned a study

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:10.120 align:middle line:90%
to review the 20 year program.

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And they hired a
skeptic, Ray Hyman,

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:19.080 align:middle line:84%
and a proponent, Jessica Utts,
a statistician who is currently,

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:22.210 align:middle line:84%
I believe, the president
of the American Statistical

00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:23.390 align:middle line:90%
Association.

00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And they both agreed that
there is a phenomenon there

00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:30.070 align:middle line:90%
that hasn't been explained.

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:31.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is exciting.

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:32.580 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:33.840 align:middle line:90%
What drives you, Jeffrey?

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:36.470 align:middle line:84%
At this point, what
drives you to keep

00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:38.790 align:middle line:90%
looking for these answers?

00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:41.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Well, I
took Ted Owens' training

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:45.360 align:middle line:84%
because he convinced me
that something was going on.

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And I figured I better learn
as much as I can about him.

00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And when I began
the training, he

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.380 align:middle line:84%
said to me, what do you
want to do with this?

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
well, I don't really

00:33:55.970 --> 00:34:00.060 align:middle line:84%
care to make UFOs appear
in the sky, or control

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:03.700 align:middle line:84%
hurricanes and tornadoes or
earthquakes, as he had done,

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:05.130 align:middle line:90%
or power blackouts.

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:09.719 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I want to be able
to communicate to the world

00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:14.889 align:middle line:84%
at large the truths of the
esoteric parapsychological

00:34:14.889 --> 00:34:15.389 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:18.409 align:middle line:84%
And it was months
thereafter that I

00:34:18.409 --> 00:34:21.760 align:middle line:84%
started the original
Thinking Allowed TV series.

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:24.580 align:middle line:84%
We were carried on
about 100 stations.

00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:27.409 align:middle line:84%
So it was, at that
time, successful

00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:29.100 align:middle line:84%
beyond what I could
have imagined.

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And I hope to continue
that work moving forward.

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:35.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm going to do a
little experiment with you

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:37.042 align:middle line:90%
on what I call sending.

00:34:37.042 --> 00:34:39.250 align:middle line:84%
What do you call that again,
when you send something?

00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:40.541 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: Telepathic sending.

00:34:40.541 --> 00:34:42.659 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm going to
send something to you.

00:34:42.659 --> 00:34:43.409 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: OK.

00:34:43.409 --> 00:34:45.158 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Between one
and five, now there's

00:34:45.158 --> 00:34:47.380 align:middle line:84%
a 20% chance that
you're going to get it

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:49.340 align:middle line:90%
right just by guessing.

00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:51.330 align:middle line:90%
So let's see what happens.

00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:53.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm to send you a number.

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And I want to close
your eyes, Jeffrey,

00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:58.700 align:middle line:84%
and turn your head, because I'm
going to show the camera that.

00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:00.490 align:middle line:90%
Turn your head, all right?

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:02.160 align:middle line:90%
So you can't see me.

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:06.650 align:middle line:84%
Here's the number I'm
going to flash at Jeffrey.

00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:08.440 align:middle line:90%
So clean your head.

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:10.310 align:middle line:84%
I sound like I'm
the instructor here,

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:13.190 align:middle line:84%
but just pretend your
head is like a chalkboard

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:14.720 align:middle line:90%
and it's empty.

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:15.720 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing there.

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And I am going to write the
number on your chalkboard right

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:22.490 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:23.920 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:25.490 align:middle line:90%
What's that number?

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:28.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: I'm
going to say one.

00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:30.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Four.

00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:33.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: OK, well I missed,
because first I got a three,

00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:35.370 align:middle line:84%
then I got a two,
then I got a one.

00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:35.970 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:37.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now I want
you to do it to me.

00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:38.045 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: OK.

00:35:38.045 --> 00:35:40.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:42.000 align:middle line:84%
Hold your hand up to
the camera so they

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:42.999 align:middle line:90%
know what the number is.

00:35:42.999 --> 00:35:44.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: Oh, OK.

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:48.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when you're
ready, flash it to me.

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:51.015 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: OK.

00:35:51.015 --> 00:35:53.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I saw two and a three,
but I'm going to say two.

00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:54.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: It was a two.

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:55.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: See?

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:56.068 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: Yeah.

00:35:56.068 --> 00:35:58.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're a
better sender than I am,

00:35:58.490 --> 00:35:59.880 align:middle line:90%
or maybe I'm a better receiver.

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:02.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: You're a
better receiver, who knows?

00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:03.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you need both?

00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:08.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Well, I think every
parapsychological experiment

00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:11.350 align:middle line:84%
involves all the
people involved.

00:36:11.350 --> 00:36:16.090 align:middle line:84%
It's not just this receiver or
not just the sender or not just

00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:17.300 align:middle line:90%
the experimenter.

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:20.850 align:middle line:84%
Every person contributes in
one way or another-- including,

00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:23.047 align:middle line:90%
for example, your crew here.

00:36:23.047 --> 00:36:24.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So that was not set up.

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:25.980 align:middle line:90%
That was not set up.

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:30.690 align:middle line:84%
So I had a 20% chance, one
to five, of getting it right.

00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:33.410 align:middle line:84%
But what are the odds
of hitting it like that?

00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:35.660 align:middle line:90%
So there's something there.

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:38.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I actually-- did you
think three also for a moment?

00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:39.324 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: Yeah.

00:36:39.324 --> 00:36:40.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah,
because I saw that.

00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:44.220 align:middle line:84%
I saw two and a three, but the
two looked a little stronger

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:45.770 align:middle line:90%
on my mental chalkboard.

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:46.655 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: Mmhm.

00:36:46.655 --> 00:36:48.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
you explain that?

00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:48.822 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:36:48.822 --> 00:36:50.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Well, you
can't read too much

00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:52.760 align:middle line:90%
into a simple one or two tries.

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:55.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That is a great
scientific experiment.

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:58.760 align:middle line:10%
>>MISHLOVE: I encourage
people to try and familiarize

00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:03.700 align:middle line:10%
themselves with the 150-year
history of this field.

00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:06.190 align:middle line:10%
These tests have been going
on since the mid-1800s.

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:09.890 align:middle line:10%
1800s There's a huge database.

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And my wish is for people to dig
into it, become more familiar,

00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:18.860 align:middle line:84%
even with popular
accounts of this,

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:22.820 align:middle line:84%
because that's the
basis upon which people

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:24.900 align:middle line:90%
can make a fair evaluation.

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:28.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you find, Jeffrey,
that this ability makes one's

00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:31.140 align:middle line:90%
life a little more pleasant?

00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:33.536 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: I find
that, yes I do.

00:37:33.536 --> 00:37:34.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a great gift.

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:35.368 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: Yeah.

00:37:35.368 --> 00:37:36.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm a happy person.

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:37.334 align:middle line:90%
I can tell you that.

00:37:37.334 --> 00:37:38.166 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I can tell.

00:37:38.166 --> 00:37:39.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: In spite
of whatever obstacles

00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:40.510 align:middle line:90%
I've had to deal with.

00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:41.635 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, we're human.

00:37:41.635 --> 00:37:43.785 align:middle line:84%
Human beings get hit
with all kinds of things.

00:37:43.785 --> 00:37:44.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MISHLOVE: Right.

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:47.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you have to be able
to pull yourself away from it,

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:48.655 align:middle line:90%
and it's fantastic.

00:37:48.655 --> 00:37:50.280 align:middle line:84%
So if people want to
get a hold of you,

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:51.950 align:middle line:90%
how do they find you again?

00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:56.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE:
www.newthinkingallowed.com,

00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:59.757 align:middle line:90%
A-L-L-O-W-E-D.

00:37:59.757 --> 00:38:01.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jeffrey, thanks
for being on the program.

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:02.820 align:middle line:90%
Really appreciate it.

00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:04.319 align:middle line:84%
>>MISHLOVE: Thank
you for having me.

00:38:04.319 --> 00:38:06.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is one of
my favorite subjects--

00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:09.600 align:middle line:84%
clairvoyance,
telepathy, the unusual,

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:13.790 align:middle line:84%
being able to use your mind
to do incredible things.

00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:17.230 align:middle line:10%
It's a power we all possess.

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:18.720 align:middle line:10%
You just need to work at it.

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:21.700 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:27.600 align:middle line:90%
