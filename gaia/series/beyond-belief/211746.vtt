>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.370 align:middle line:10%
We have JJ and Desiree
Hurtak with us,

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.450 align:middle line:10%
social scientists,
archeologists, cosmologists,

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.510 align:middle line:10%
and great authors who have
researched ancient cultures

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.820 align:middle line:10%
in Mexico, Egypt, South
America for more than 40 years.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.940 align:middle line:84%
JJ, how did you guys
get started in this?

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.100 align:middle line:10%
>>JJ HURTAK: It
goes back, really,

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.240 align:middle line:10%
to the 1970s, when I was a young
professor at the University

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.770 align:middle line:10%
of California.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.380 align:middle line:10%
I had several
exceptional experiences

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.140 align:middle line:10%
of seeing beings of
light, what would

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.730 align:middle line:10%
be called in psychological
language archetypal energy

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:56.790 align:middle line:10%
forms.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.600 align:middle line:10%
And so this got me started
in looking behind the scenes

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.640 align:middle line:10%
to what I call the
science behind the myth.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.129 align:middle line:84%
And this took me to
different parts of the world.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.430 align:middle line:84%
With Desiree's help, we
were able to catalog,

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.040 align:middle line:84%
with permission of scientists
on very high levels, the story

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.860 align:middle line:84%
of the origin of humanity
through the figure

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.173 align:middle line:90%
of what we call the Bird Man.

00:01:18.173 --> 00:01:19.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And,
Desiree, we're going

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.780 align:middle line:84%
to talk a lot about
the Bird Man tonight.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.330 align:middle line:84%
Did JJ pull you in
on this, or were you

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.620 align:middle line:90%
always interested in this?

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: I
always had an interest.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.040 align:middle line:10%
That was why we really
started to work together.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.930 align:middle line:10%
Because I grew up
in Florida, and I

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.780 align:middle line:10%
had seen other realms of
intelligence flying overhead.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.130 align:middle line:90%
I said, there has to be more.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.088 align:middle line:84%
So when he had his
unique experience,

00:01:37.088 --> 00:01:38.880 align:middle line:84%
I was one of the few
people that understood

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.830 align:middle line:90%
what was going on in his life.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when you mention
Bird Man, what is that?

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.320 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: Bird Man,
for most anthropologists,

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.970 align:middle line:84%
is what is called man
covered by feathers

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.880 align:middle line:84%
or the feathered
serpent, Quetzalcoatl,

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.320 align:middle line:84%
as it is called in the mythology
of Central and South America.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.260 align:middle line:84%
Bird Man represents to
the Oriental cultures,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.180 align:middle line:84%
as well as to those
in other parts

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.470 align:middle line:84%
of the world, a wing-like
figure that is primarily

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.550 align:middle line:84%
a human being that has
extensions of wings,

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.170 align:middle line:84%
like Thunderbird seen in the
Indigenous traditions of North

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.950 align:middle line:84%
America, man who can fly to
space, one who represents,

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.320 align:middle line:84%
really, the offspring
of the gods.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.470 align:middle line:84%
Not an extraterrestrial,
but an extra celestial,

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.012 align:middle line:84%
one even beyond the
extraterrestrial.

00:02:27.012 --> 00:02:28.387 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
But many people

00:02:28.387 --> 00:02:30.870 align:middle line:84%
have actually experienced
in their own dream state

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.820 align:middle line:90%
the soaring into the heavens.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And the Indigenous
people of North America

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.790 align:middle line:84%
actually feel that
the bird itself takes

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.310 align:middle line:84%
our prayers and our energies
and takes them into the sky.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.230 align:middle line:84%
So it's something that's
worldwide, but also personal,

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.230 align:middle line:90%
I believe.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was the Bird Man
a physically real entity?

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:51.770 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: Definitely.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.910 align:middle line:84%
You see this, as I will show
in a couple of minutes, some

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.530 align:middle line:84%
of the figurines presented
by different tribal groups

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.100 align:middle line:84%
in North America, but
also, in stone figures

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.437 align:middle line:84%
in parts of Africa
and parts of Asia.

00:03:06.437 --> 00:03:08.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: I
think the Bird Man

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.860 align:middle line:84%
cult is most well
known in Easter Island,

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.960 align:middle line:90%
a place called Rapa Nui.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's very interesting,
because, actually,

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.120 align:middle line:84%
Easter Island went
through various stages.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.370 align:middle line:84%
They made those big moai
statues that everyone--

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huge.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Yeah, huge.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't even
know how they moved them.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.630 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: No.

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Actually, there's one large
one that they never did move,

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.560 align:middle line:90%
actually, it was so big.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.070 align:middle line:84%
But usually, they're like, 6
to 20 feet, but that's a lot.

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.120 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are made out of
basalt, which is really heavy.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.800 align:middle line:84%
So that comes from the
magma of the Earth.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.800 align:middle line:84%
There's one that the
British took away with them

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.265 align:middle line:90%
when they got to Easter Island.

00:03:43.265 --> 00:03:44.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They pillaged
it, didn't they?

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Yeah.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:45.750 align:middle line:90%
Well, of course.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.180 align:middle line:84%
But 1868, they took it
all the way to England.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.530 align:middle line:90%
Now it's in the British Museum.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.820 align:middle line:84%
What's unique about that is
not only is it a perfect moai

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.010 align:middle line:90%
statue, but on the back--

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.770 align:middle line:84%
and they think it came
from a more recent era--

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.480 align:middle line:90%
are Bird Man.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.320 align:middle line:90%
There's actually birds carved.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.320 align:middle line:84%
So if you ever go to the
British Museum, George,

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.070 align:middle line:90%
you can actually see it there.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.850 align:middle line:84%
But the moai was
really one, we'll say,

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.560 align:middle line:84%
generation of people
who made those,

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.620 align:middle line:84%
and the second
generation later on,

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.740 align:middle line:84%
when they were trying to
find balance and harmony

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.720 align:middle line:90%
on this small little island.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.320 align:middle line:84%
It's literally 14
miles by 7 miles.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.322 align:middle line:90%
It's a small island.

00:04:24.322 --> 00:04:25.780 align:middle line:84%
You had to get
together and you had

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.010 align:middle line:90%
to be able to work together.

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.172 align:middle line:84%
And they actually came up
with this bird cult race.

00:04:31.172 --> 00:04:32.722 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: Motu Nui.

00:04:32.722 --> 00:04:34.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You went
to Easter Island.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Yes, we did.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.580 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: We did
extensive filming there.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And we saw in the
petroglyphs a similarity

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.410 align:middle line:84%
with the other petroglyphs
we've seen throughout the world.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.720 align:middle line:84%
So the Bird Man represents
one of the oldest phenomena

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.370 align:middle line:84%
of a superhuman being who
is connected with the gods,

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.070 align:middle line:84%
or we would call the
higher creative forces.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take
a look at this trip.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.420 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: We have
here on Easter Island ahu

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:05.610 align:middle line:84%
platform where we were told
in the original transmission

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.590 align:middle line:84%
of the information that Easter
Island was part of a vast grid

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.120 align:middle line:84%
system or geometry of
sacred contact areas

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.660 align:middle line:90%
throughout the world.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.360 align:middle line:84%
And if we would put
together the missing

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.110 align:middle line:84%
pieces of these platforms,
these statues would speak.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.270 align:middle line:84%
For they represent
the great architects,

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.920 align:middle line:84%
and their eyes
looking to the heavens

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.700 align:middle line:84%
is to remind us
that as we connect

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.030 align:middle line:84%
the teaching of our ancestry
throughout the world

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.680 align:middle line:84%
with our future in space,
our eyes will be prepared

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.840 align:middle line:84%
for the coming
and the quickening

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.950 align:middle line:84%
of a great civilization
of cosmic cultures.

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.450 align:middle line:84%
In essence, with our
eyes, exemplifying

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.920 align:middle line:84%
what these statues have
meant to the ancients,

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.950 align:middle line:84%
we will be, in turn, the
custodians and guardians

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.250 align:middle line:84%
of the platforms and the
temples of sacred knowledge.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.270 align:middle line:84%
Not only throughout all
parts of our worlds,

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.930 align:middle line:84%
but truly in conjunction
with the star people.

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.640 align:middle line:84%
We will be the first, as the
harbinger, to lift up our eyes

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.330 align:middle line:84%
and expressions of greeting
to our brothers of light

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.310 align:middle line:90%
from the higher worlds.

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: JJ, were you in
awe at the moai figures when

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:21.760 align:middle line:90%
you were there?

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:22.000 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: I was.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.200 align:middle line:90%
I was, George.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.380 align:middle line:84%
Because of the size,
gargantuan statues

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.880 align:middle line:84%
reaching from 12, to even
24 feet, in some instances.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.390 align:middle line:84%
When Desiree and I were there
with an archeological team,

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:38.770 align:middle line:84%
we also used, shall we say,
wooden instruments to beat

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.740 align:middle line:84%
on the back of the moai,
and some of them had sounds.

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.750 align:middle line:84%
So part of our
work in musicology

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.240 align:middle line:84%
is to look at the
sound structures

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.450 align:middle line:84%
or the biological
signatures of these beings

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.070 align:middle line:84%
that do not speak
with the mouth,

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:52.900 align:middle line:90%
but speak with the vibration.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were they
hollow at all?

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:55.300 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: Yes.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.890 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are hollow.

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:59.020 align:middle line:84%
Indicating that
there is a, shall

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.200 align:middle line:84%
we say, a language
of communication

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.680 align:middle line:90%
in certain parts of the world.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.290 align:middle line:84%
We find this in Egypt
when we did the sound test

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:09.470 align:middle line:90%
inside the Giza Plateau.

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.910 align:middle line:84%
We find this also all
throughout Mexico.

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:14.990 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we published
our work in a journal

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:17.960 align:middle line:84%
called "Arqueología," which
is the most significant

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.400 align:middle line:84%

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.890 align:middle line:84%
and Anthropology,
like the Smithsonian,

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:28.970 align:middle line:84%
governing, should we say, all
of the major archeological sites

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:31.942 align:middle line:84%
now being probed by the
best scholars in the world.

00:07:31.942 --> 00:07:33.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Desiree, were
you there as well?

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:34.858 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Yes, I was.

00:07:34.858 --> 00:07:37.250 align:middle line:84%
And actually, a lot of them
are just literally cut out

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:39.600 align:middle line:90%
of the ground near a volcano.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.130 align:middle line:84%
So if they're hollow, it's
because it wasn't a solid rock

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:44.420 align:middle line:90%
that they were cut from.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.430 align:middle line:90%
But it's an amazing island.

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:49.130 align:middle line:84%
And really, I just
want to quickly say

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:52.670 align:middle line:84%
about the Bird Man, which
was the second aspect of what

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:54.770 align:middle line:84%
happened with the
people there, they just

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:57.500 align:middle line:84%
had a race where once a
year, they would actually

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.780 align:middle line:84%
swim to this area,
and then, they

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:04.293 align:middle line:84%
would grab the sooty tern egg,
the first one that would come--

00:08:04.293 --> 00:08:05.210 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: The bird.

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:06.752 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
--of this bird that

00:08:06.752 --> 00:08:09.990 align:middle line:84%
would land on this rock
cropping out in the ocean,

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:12.050 align:middle line:84%
and if they got
it, they came back,

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:15.530 align:middle line:84%
and that man became the
Bird Man for a whole year.

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:16.490 align:middle line:90%
He was the chief.

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:17.570 align:middle line:90%
His whole tribe got--

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:18.528 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A real person?

00:08:18.528 --> 00:08:20.112 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: A
real person, yeah.

00:08:20.112 --> 00:08:21.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually,
he sent a sponsor.

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:22.670 align:middle line:90%
It was called a hopu.

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.320 align:middle line:84%
He was the strong man who
would do the race for him.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.440 align:middle line:84%
And when he came
back, he became--

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.900 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: Tangata Manu.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do
they face the ocean?

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:32.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
Well, actually,

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:34.730 align:middle line:84%
some of them-- of course,
they were on platforms,

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:38.100 align:middle line:84%
and almost all of them
were knocked down.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.669 align:middle line:84%
They think a lot of them
did not face the ocean.

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:42.830 align:middle line:84%
Some of them might
have, but some of them

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:45.770 align:middle line:84%
also looked inland, so that
when you looked at them

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:47.900 align:middle line:84%
and you looked at the
ocean, you actually

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.600 align:middle line:90%
had them staring back at you.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.040 align:middle line:90%
So no one really knows.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.620 align:middle line:84%
In fact, for a long
time, this island

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.130 align:middle line:84%
was really decimated
by smallpox,

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:01.190 align:middle line:84%
by people taking
the individuals that

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:03.740 align:middle line:84%
were living there and bringing
them to Peru for slaves.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.530 align:middle line:84%
So it was a real
chaotic situation.

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:08.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who knocked them down?

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:10.608 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Actually, we
think that either the people

00:09:10.608 --> 00:09:13.070 align:middle line:84%
did, or the early, we'll
say, religious people

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:15.410 align:middle line:84%
that came to visit the
island, some of the priests

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:16.470 align:middle line:90%
that came over.

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:18.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would you have
knocked them down physically?

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.700 align:middle line:90%
Would you use logs or something?

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.470 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: Would have
a huge team of soldiers,

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:26.330 align:middle line:84%
if there were
foreigners coming in,

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.150 align:middle line:84%
or local people that could
be conscripted into a labor

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:32.300 align:middle line:84%
team that would just pull them
in or to the side with ropes

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:33.140 align:middle line:90%
or knock them over.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:36.290 align:middle line:84%
Some of them still remain
in their original position.

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:38.070 align:middle line:84%
But the bottom
line here, George,

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:40.940 align:middle line:84%
is this is the first
worldwide archetypal

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:44.630 align:middle line:84%
symbol of men becoming
gods and gods becoming men

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:46.610 align:middle line:84%
through the feathered
serpent symbol.

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:49.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
these inhabitants witnessed

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:50.690 align:middle line:90%
something?

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:51.950 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: Definitely.

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:52.820 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:55.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which must have just
been overwhelming to them.

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:56.330 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: Well,
we have seen this

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:57.600 align:middle line:90%
in other parts of the world.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:03.590 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we went also to South
America and Central America,

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:07.640 align:middle line:84%
talking with the shamans, the
leaders of traditional groups.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.040 align:middle line:84%
All of them suggested
that, at one time,

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.490 align:middle line:84%
had been a motherland that
had sunk in the South Pacific,

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:17.630 align:middle line:84%
and the survivors came in
boats or through island hopping

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:20.720 align:middle line:84%
to the areas of South America
where the reestablished

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.530 align:middle line:84%
themselves, creating the
pyramid as a symbol of going

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:26.570 align:middle line:90%
above the water horizon.

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And at the top of
the pyramidal symbol,

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:30.650 align:middle line:84%
you have all of
these structures that

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:33.050 align:middle line:84%
look like small boats
or geometries that

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:34.910 align:middle line:84%
look like waveforms,
suggesting that there

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:39.110 align:middle line:84%
was a cataclysmic change in
ancient times, in the Orient.

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And the surviving cultures
then remanifested themselves

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:43.970 align:middle line:90%
in the Americas.

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:45.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: So when he
says pyramid, he means the ahu,

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:47.300 align:middle line:90%
and these are platforms.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:50.480 align:middle line:84%
They were actually standing
on all these sacred-altar

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:54.260 align:middle line:84%
like platforms around the
island in various places.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.960 align:middle line:84%
But there's been a
lot of, we'll say,

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.210 align:middle line:84%
loss of understanding
of civilization,

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:00.950 align:middle line:90%
even in contemporary times.

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:04.110 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you go to
Quetzalcoatl, which was also

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:07.950 align:middle line:84%
considered a type of bird
man or feathered serpent,

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:11.640 align:middle line:84%
you have the pyramids
of Teotihuacan.

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know
who built them.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:19.300 align:middle line:84%
That civilization that built
Teotihuacan is completely gone.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And even the Mexican people, the
Aztecs, the Mayans, the Toltec,

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:24.678 align:middle line:90%
can't tell you who built that.

00:11:24.678 --> 00:11:26.220 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: As a
young archeologist,

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:29.790 align:middle line:84%
I was invited to meet the former
president of Mexico, Jose Lopez

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:32.400 align:middle line:84%
Portillo, in the
1970s and he gave me

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.170 align:middle line:84%
a gift of his book
called "Quetzalcoatl."

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And he said, the
mythologies that

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:39.870 align:middle line:84%
suggest that people came from
the oceans of the Pacific

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:43.248 align:middle line:84%
to inhabit the mainland of
Central America and Mexico.

00:11:43.248 --> 00:11:44.790 align:middle line:10%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
Well, this is the--

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:47.730 align:middle line:10%
one of the three in pyramids
there, and that's interesting.

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:49.470 align:middle line:10%
I believe there's a
lot of coordination

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:52.260 align:middle line:10%
between the Mexican
pyramids of Teotihuacan

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.200 align:middle line:10%
and the Egyptian pyramids,
of course, of Giza.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.770 align:middle line:10%
But the one called the
feathered serpent we see here.

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:01.630 align:middle line:10%
And Dr. Hurtak, even
since the 1970s, has said,

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:05.140 align:middle line:10%
look, you see on one side,
we'll see the Quetzalcoatl,

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:07.532 align:middle line:10%
which is the dragon
serpent, so to speak,

00:12:07.532 --> 00:12:08.740 align:middle line:10%
with the feathers around him.

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:10.090 align:middle line:10%
But then, look, George.

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:13.840 align:middle line:10%
You see these kind of
unusual almost magnetic bars

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:14.642 align:middle line:10%
in between.

00:12:14.642 --> 00:12:16.100 align:middle line:10%
>>JJ HURTAK: And
at the other side,

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:17.920 align:middle line:10%
you see what looks
like a computer

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:22.150 align:middle line:10%
face, robotic-like face that
represents a different tier

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:23.210 align:middle line:10%
of civilization.

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:26.980 align:middle line:10%
So when I was doing this work
in the 1970s, it was clear to me

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:31.600 align:middle line:10%
that, on one side of
the pyramidal construct,

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.500 align:middle line:10%
you have the dinosaurs
of representations

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.680 align:middle line:10%
of early civilization,
and then, you

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.630 align:middle line:10%
have the bar magnets
that represent

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:45.730 align:middle line:10%
what I consider to be the
multiple magnetic field, which

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:48.160 align:middle line:10%
explain levitation craft
going from planet still

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.560 align:middle line:10%
in the dinosaur phase
to planets working

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:53.020 align:middle line:10%
with robotics in a modern age.

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:54.982 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How old
is that structure?

00:12:54.982 --> 00:12:56.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
Again, they think

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.470 align:middle line:84%
it's before, we'll say,
over 2,000 years ago.

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:02.170 align:middle line:84%
It could be as much
as 3,000 years ago.

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:04.090 align:middle line:90%
And again, no one knows.

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:06.670 align:middle line:84%
Because the Olmec
civilization, which

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:10.210 align:middle line:84%
is where you have monument 17
also looking like Quetzalcoatl,

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:13.570 align:middle line:84%
actually never was considered
to have gone as far

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:15.850 align:middle line:90%
as this area near Mexico City.

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:17.470 align:middle line:90%
So no one knows.

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:21.550 align:middle line:84%
It was completely abandoned
about the year 700 AD.

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And then, the Aztecs
later on picked it up.

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:26.380 align:middle line:90%
So again, three pyramids.

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, what's
interesting about it,

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:30.010 align:middle line:84%
and Dr. Hurtak and
I have visited,

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:33.110 align:middle line:84%
going underneath the
Pyramid of the Sun.

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:35.330 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole
underground chamber.

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And just in 2004,
they recently found

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.210 align:middle line:84%
a whole underground
chamber underneath

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:43.040 align:middle line:90%
the feathered serpent pyramid.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:46.503 align:middle line:84%
Now, this goes for
300 feet underground.

00:13:46.503 --> 00:13:48.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well carved
out and everything?

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:48.800 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Well, yeah.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.690 align:middle line:84%
It took them a while
to find the entrance.

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And now, they've had to
use some robots to even go

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:54.440 align:middle line:90%
certain places.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:59.060 align:middle line:84%
They found 75,000 artifacts
underneath that pyramid.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:02.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why does it seem
like the ancients had

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:06.530 align:middle line:84%
incredible knowledge, and then,
it disappeared and popped up

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:07.910 align:middle line:90%
later?

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:09.330 align:middle line:90%
Where did it go?

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.510 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: We lived
in a fantastic world

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:13.580 align:middle line:84%
of rediscovering
who we are in terms

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:16.580 align:middle line:84%
of beings in the electromagnetic
spectrum of life.

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:20.960 align:middle line:84%
And now, it occurs to us,
as we probe into the cosmos,

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:25.460 align:middle line:84%
that there are other timelines
of evolution, other life forms.

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:29.870 align:middle line:84%
And it appears that we work in
cycles of advancing and then

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:33.110 align:middle line:84%
going through what I would call
a highly materialistic phase

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:36.060 align:middle line:84%
where we lose our spirituality,
our concept of a living

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:36.860 align:middle line:90%
universe.

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:39.890 align:middle line:84%
And we fall back into
a situation of a lower

00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:41.990 align:middle line:90%
singularity and Quetzalcoatl.

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And all of these sacred
areas throughout the world

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:46.670 align:middle line:84%
with the pyramids
as constructs remind

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:51.320 align:middle line:84%
us of those basic elemental
building blocks or geometric

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:53.040 align:middle line:90%
forms of reaching the heavens.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And so again, we're
beginning to find in our work

00:14:56.030 --> 00:15:00.140 align:middle line:84%
with remote sensing technology
underneath parts of Mexico,

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:05.000 align:middle line:84%
a whole underground passageways
that run in one example

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.430 align:middle line:90%
under 25 different pyramids.

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:11.480 align:middle line:84%
A corridor perfectly shaped
suggesting that, shall we say,

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.780 align:middle line:84%
the forefathers of the
Aztecs had some type

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:19.900 align:middle line:84%
of pneumatic energy tool to make
these so perfect underground.

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:20.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: And you
find this also in Cahokia.

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:26.710 align:middle line:84%
We actually had an office
near Saint Louis in Missouri.

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:28.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've been
there many times.

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:29.543 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Yeah, exactly.

00:15:29.543 --> 00:15:32.020 align:middle line:84%
That is now considered
the largest Earth

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:34.090 align:middle line:90%
mound in North America.

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:38.200 align:middle line:84%
It's actually taller and
bigger than the Great Pyramid

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.212 align:middle line:84%
when you really have
reconstructed it.

00:15:40.212 --> 00:15:41.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mind boggling.

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:43.795 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Yeah, and they
had an amazing structure there

00:15:43.795 --> 00:15:47.320 align:middle line:84%
where probably 10,000 people
at one point lived there.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And now they found that
there was actually--

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.050 align:middle line:90%
they were able to smelt copper.

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:58.120 align:middle line:84%
What we find in all the other
Mississippi cultures around

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:01.570 align:middle line:84%
there going down to Georgia,
going up to Minnesota,

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:03.670 align:middle line:84%
going down as far
as Tallahassee,

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:08.170 align:middle line:84%
you actually find copper
plates of Birdman.

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:10.120 align:middle line:90%
It was a very popular theme.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.803 align:middle line:84%
We believe that there
was a connection.

00:16:11.803 --> 00:16:13.720 align:middle line:84%
We call it the Mayan
connection, but it's also

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:19.100 align:middle line:84%
the Aztec connection between
Mexico and North America.

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the
concept of the Birdman

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:25.390 align:middle line:84%
goes as far as the
Hopi and the Navajo.

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:28.420 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: I brought
some small figurines here

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:30.520 align:middle line:90%
from the Zuni and the Navajo.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.710 align:middle line:90%
This is of the Falcon.

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:37.600 align:middle line:84%
Note the embellishments of the
face, the bird-like symbols,

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.090 align:middle line:84%
and the plumes of
the top of the head.

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:42.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, is
this a guy in costume

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:43.898 align:middle line:90%
or is this something real?

00:16:43.898 --> 00:16:45.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: These
were supposed to be types

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:48.430 align:middle line:84%
of kachinas, which means
they lived on this planet,

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:49.570 align:middle line:90%
they were on this planet--

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:50.380 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: Godlike figures.

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:52.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: --but
then at a certain point,

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.640 align:middle line:84%
they decided this planet
had too much confusion,

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:56.020 align:middle line:90%
and they needed to leave.

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:58.450 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: They were
also time shifters.

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:06.480 align:middle line:84%
They could-- there's
another of the hawk--

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:08.027 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Truly
looks like a bird.

00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:09.569 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
Yeah, but they have

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:11.369 align:middle line:90%
the arms and legs of a human.

00:17:11.369 --> 00:17:13.380 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: And the
third one I have too.

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:14.579 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: This
is a beautiful one.

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: This is the most
beautiful is that of the eagle.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:19.200 align:middle line:84%
You think, for example, of
the bald eagle in the United

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.780 align:middle line:84%
States, you think of
the eagle on the flags

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:26.460 align:middle line:84%
of the European countries,
of Germany, Austria, Russia--

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:29.940 align:middle line:84%
all throughout the world
you see in the human psyche

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.370 align:middle line:84%
there is this symbol
of the bird or the eye

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:36.090 align:middle line:84%
of the hawk representing a
type of universal knowledge,

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:39.070 align:middle line:84%
the ability to see any point
on Mother Earth from space,

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:41.550 align:middle line:84%
the ability to translate
different dimensions.

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:44.490 align:middle line:10%
Again, there's a whole
cosmology and sociology

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:48.390 align:middle line:10%
built into the Birdman
and all of his plumage

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:51.180 align:middle line:10%
which represents what
I feel the missing

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:54.370 align:middle line:10%
key not only to the
extraterrestrial

00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:58.050 align:middle line:10%
but to what I call the
ultra or extra celestial

00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:00.300 align:middle line:10%
form of intelligent
life that comes

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:03.420 align:middle line:10%
from a different solar system
that is able to transit

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:06.100 align:middle line:10%
between the planets and
leave behind the knowledge

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:09.730 align:middle line:10%
of building pyramids, creating
mathematical knowledge

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:14.830 align:middle line:10%
of the other planetary systems,
and actually give humanity

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:19.360 align:middle line:10%
a hope of a return visit of
beings who can, as it were,

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:21.230 align:middle line:10%
make their way to
the higher worlds.

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:23.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you believe,
though, that the Birdman

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:26.667 align:middle line:84%
may be from some other
extraterrestrial dimension?

00:18:26.667 --> 00:18:28.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Yes,
let's look at Egypt, right?

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:29.950 align:middle line:90%
You have Horus.

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:33.430 align:middle line:84%
But in addition, you actually
have the sons of Horus.

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:36.370 align:middle line:84%
You also, if you look at
the solar boat, right,

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:38.890 align:middle line:84%
and we'll say some
of the Boat of Nut,

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:42.250 align:middle line:84%
you have everything
from reptilian forms,

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:45.560 align:middle line:84%
you have dog-faced ones,
you have cat-faced ones--

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:46.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Birds.

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
--birds obviously.

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is exactly
what we're finding

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.850 align:middle line:90%
in extraterrestrial contact.

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:54.850 align:middle line:84%
People are seeing very
unusual forms of life.

00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:57.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the connection
between Birdman and Chichen

00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:58.540 align:middle line:90%
Itza.

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:00.340 align:middle line:10%
>>JJ HURTAK: Well,
Chichen Itza, of course,

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:04.300 align:middle line:10%
in the Yucatan Peninsula is
known for its unique pyramid

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:09.167 align:middle line:10%
structure that is the equivalent
of a 365-day calendar cycle.

00:19:09.167 --> 00:19:10.500 align:middle line:10%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Like Kukulkan.

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.125 align:middle line:10%
>>JJ HURTAK: It's
also called Kukulkan.

00:19:12.125 --> 00:19:14.980 align:middle line:10%
But it represents
really the shadow

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:20.680 align:middle line:10%
of the serpent that comes down
in the spring and the fall

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:21.880 align:middle line:10%
equinox.

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:25.030 align:middle line:84%
The staircase represents
however the human ascent

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:28.720 align:middle line:84%
beyond the shadow-like figures
of the lower part of evolution

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.400 align:middle line:84%
into the light of
the higher world.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So Jay, you and
Desiree visited Chichen Itza

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:36.555 align:middle line:84%
and found some
evidence of Birdman?

00:19:36.555 --> 00:19:38.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: We
see the first rays

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:40.730 align:middle line:90%
of lightning up on the special.

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:43.760 align:middle line:84%
Day we've passed
through the time

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:50.690 align:middle line:84%
now of the rising, we'll say,
of the solstice sun energy.

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And we're able to
energize, seeing the things

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:58.820 align:middle line:84%
above the doorway connected with
an understanding of the higher

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:00.740 align:middle line:90%
life, the higher vibration.

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:04.850 align:middle line:10%
And it's here also that we
find the Temple of the Bearded

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:08.690 align:middle line:10%
Man connected with Quetzalcoatl
but also, of course, we

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:11.690 align:middle line:10%
represent that understanding
that the bearded ones actually

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:16.070 align:middle line:10%
come from a higher aspect
of divine intelligence.

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:19.340 align:middle line:84%
So there was the knowledge of
Quetzalcoatl, the Feathered

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:22.790 align:middle line:84%
Serpent, the one who could
take the energies of the Earth,

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:24.650 align:middle line:84%
connect it with the
serpentine energy

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:27.290 align:middle line:84%
or the anthropic,
syntropic energy

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:31.490 align:middle line:84%
and put the power of light upon
it with the wings of the dove,

00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:32.750 align:middle line:90%
with the wings of the eagle.

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:34.167 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: So
with this in mind,

00:20:34.167 --> 00:20:38.610 align:middle line:84%
we ask you to keep in
mind the larger depiction.

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:42.000 align:middle line:84%
The pyramids here
are stepping stones

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.840 align:middle line:84%
to a much higher cosmic
order of divine teaching.

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.273 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did they make that?

00:20:47.273 --> 00:20:48.690 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: Well,
it certainly it

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:51.660 align:middle line:84%
took several generations
of cosmic engineers.

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:55.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm wearing here the teaching
belt that was given to me

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:57.600 align:middle line:84%
by the Xavante
peoples of Brazil,

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.660 align:middle line:84%
one of the larger nations
because of my charity

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:02.500 align:middle line:84%
and my educational work
with the Indigenous.

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:03.300 align:middle line:90%
But they--

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:04.675 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And who
are the Xavante?

00:21:04.675 --> 00:21:07.590 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: Xavantes were one
of the larger tribes in Brazil

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:11.400 align:middle line:84%
in the region of Mato
Grosso, South Central Brazil,

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.770 align:middle line:84%
that preserved their
heritage of contact

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:16.140 align:middle line:84%
with the star
nations, one of which

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:19.390 align:middle line:90%
is the bearded bird people.

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:21.540 align:middle line:10%
And the reason why
this is so important

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:24.930 align:middle line:10%
is when I talk to the
shamans, who may be the chief,

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:27.840 align:middle line:10%
they said, we are giving you
knowledge that you already

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.810 align:middle line:10%
possess of the Golden
Egg that we see

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:32.700 align:middle line:10%
coming from the higher worlds.

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:36.900 align:middle line:84%
The Fiery or the Golden Egg
represents for the Indigenous,

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:38.700 align:middle line:84%
the egg born, the
person who comes

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:41.460 align:middle line:84%
from the higher world
who manifests new life

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:42.790 align:middle line:90%
and new direction.

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And I believe the Indigenous
people hold the key,

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:49.530 align:middle line:84%
the missing key to how we
have to expand our cosmology

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:52.380 align:middle line:84%
from an Earth-based
culture going simply

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:56.520 align:middle line:84%
to an extraterrestrial
culture of mechanical machines

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.190 align:middle line:84%
to something of greater
spiritual significance, which

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:02.970 align:middle line:84%
is the extra celestial, the
beings that have the ability

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:06.128 align:middle line:84%
to be physical and nonphysical
in the twinkling of an eye.

00:22:06.128 --> 00:22:08.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: And just to
take that egg one step further,

00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:12.510 align:middle line:84%
there's a legend
in India of Garuda.

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:14.730 align:middle line:84%
And supposedly, people
were standing around

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:16.740 align:middle line:84%
because there was this
huge egg that appeared

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:18.270 align:middle line:90%
that came from this wise man.

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:19.410 align:middle line:90%
His name was Sage.

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:22.290 align:middle line:84%
And when it opened
it, it was a birdman.

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:24.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's
where we get sage, right?

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:25.680 align:middle line:90%
He's a sage.

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:26.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Maybe.

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:32.910 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, he was a wise man
who gave birth to this birdman.

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And this birdman was
an amazing being.

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:40.920 align:middle line:84%
So he was Garuda, and he became
the vehicle or the vessel

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:46.140 align:middle line:84%
to bring Vishnu, which is one
of the trinity forms, Brahma,

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:49.240 align:middle line:84%
Shiva, and Vishnu
to this planet.

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:51.000 align:middle line:90%
So it was the vehicle used.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.290 align:middle line:84%
A birdman also in the
East symbolizes the way

00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:57.595 align:middle line:90%
of bringing the gods to Earth.

00:22:57.595 --> 00:22:59.970 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: Garuda in the
Sanskrit means one who speaks.

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:02.730 align:middle line:10%
So when we were doing
archeological work in Mexico

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:05.580 align:middle line:10%
and I was using energy
mantras of the natives

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:08.430 align:middle line:10%
along with the biblical
languages Hebrew and Aramaic,

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:10.590 align:middle line:10%
all of a sudden light
appeared around my body.

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:13.410 align:middle line:84%
You're also going to
see light manifestations

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:17.380 align:middle line:84%
around pyramidal forms, again,
when one uses sacred language.

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:19.530 align:middle line:84%
So the missing part
of this discussion

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:22.560 align:middle line:84%
is the acoustical physics
completely overlooked

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:25.380 align:middle line:84%
by most anthropologists
until recent times.

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:28.440 align:middle line:84%
These structures are not
just simple structures.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:32.430 align:middle line:84%
They're structures that can
convey sound, can vibrate

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:36.840 align:middle line:84%
or magnify sound, and connect
the subtle aspects of the mind

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:38.680 align:middle line:84%
into a higher state
of consciousness.

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And this is why, for example,
Ingo Swann, in one of the books

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.860 align:middle line:84%
that was done with
Russell Targ and myself,

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:47.040 align:middle line:84%
he was from Stanford Research
Institute-- illustrated

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.960 align:middle line:84%
the cover of the
book as a cosmic egg

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.440 align:middle line:90%
that we were all connected with.

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: So if I
can also say, the wings,

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.117 align:middle line:90%
why do you have wings?

00:23:53.117 --> 00:23:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, wings actually not only to
fly, but they actually vibrate.

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:59.520 align:middle line:84%
So Garuda supposedly
could even change time.

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:00.930 align:middle line:90%
His wings were so powerful.

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:04.210 align:middle line:84%
He could vibrate and
change realities of nature.

00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:06.030 align:middle line:84%
This is the power
of the Birdman.

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:09.150 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about just the
form, but what can they do?

00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:11.700 align:middle line:84%
What can they-- what's
their experience?

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:14.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, they can take
us into the heavens.

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:15.960 align:middle line:84%
They can bring the
heavens to Earth.

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.280 align:middle line:90%
This is part of their work.

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:18.672 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where did they go?

00:24:18.672 --> 00:24:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: Into
the higher worlds

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:24.300 align:middle line:84%
that are far beyond the physical
dimension of what we would call

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:27.330 align:middle line:90%
the Galactic Base of Evolution.

00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:28.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And why did they go?

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:31.020 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: They were
there to be representatives

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:33.090 align:middle line:84%
of the higher
evolution, the higher

00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:35.070 align:middle line:90%
management behind the scenes.

00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:36.810 align:middle line:84%
As the Greek
philosopher said, why

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:38.200 align:middle line:90%
do the gods hide themselves?

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.230 align:middle line:10%
So they don't show
themselves because they're

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:44.010 align:middle line:10%
part of comanaging or
cocreating many interlocking

00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:45.120 align:middle line:10%
systems of life.

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:48.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was the intention
always to just come and go?

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:51.150 align:middle line:10%
>>JJ HURTAK: The intention was
to provide spiritual knowledge

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:53.370 align:middle line:10%
or higher knowledge
so that we would

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:56.470 align:middle line:10%
see the infinite
way of God's plan,

00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:58.380 align:middle line:10%
not that they were to
be equated with God,

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:01.980 align:middle line:10%
but they were simply couriers
or hierarchical members

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:03.660 align:middle line:10%
of a much larger divine family.

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:05.790 align:middle line:84%
In the Judeo-Christian
tradition,

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:09.750 align:middle line:84%
we would call that the Homo
Deus, The man-god figure that

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:13.020 align:middle line:84%
would bring higher cosmic
teaching of the cosmic law

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:16.980 align:middle line:84%
to elementary civilization
on a planet like our own

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:19.140 align:middle line:84%
with the hope that
we would integrate

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:25.250 align:middle line:84%
the stages of architecture, art,
music, cosmology, ultimately

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:28.190 align:middle line:84%
with an ecumenical theology
that we were part of a much

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:30.410 align:middle line:84%
larger family, but
we had to learn

00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:32.480 align:middle line:84%
to behave and to
balance the energy

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.968 align:middle line:90%
forces in this physical form.

00:25:33.968 --> 00:25:35.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
George, if you ever

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:39.230 align:middle line:84%
go to the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art,

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:43.190 align:middle line:84%
you will find an eagle
figure holding a bag.

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:48.800 align:middle line:84%
He's from the Northwest Palace
of Nimrud in what's today Iraq.

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that bag is
the wisdom and knowledge

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:52.940 align:middle line:90%
that they bring.

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:55.610 align:middle line:84%
It's very similar
to what's considered

00:25:55.610 --> 00:26:01.100 align:middle line:84%
the Quetzalcoatl figure
of Monument 19 in La Venta

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:02.600 align:middle line:90%
from the Olmecs.

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:07.040 align:middle line:84%
So you have this bag in
Mexico and you have someone

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.770 align:middle line:90%
in Iraq carrying the same bag.

00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:13.040 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: The figurines as
well as the gargantuan statues

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.870 align:middle line:84%
would indicate they
were different in

00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:16.730 align:middle line:90%
their anthropological makeup.

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:20.060 align:middle line:84%
Yes, large heads that look
like spheres or heads of eggs.

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:23.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you surprised
that the Birdman is gone

00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:26.090 align:middle line:90%
or do you expect it to be gone?

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:27.800 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: Well,
the Birdman also

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:30.950 align:middle line:84%
includes the concept
of not only the eagle,

00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:33.350 align:middle line:84%
the symbol of the
executive office,

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:35.510 align:middle line:84%
but also the concept
of the Phoenix,

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:38.300 align:middle line:90%
of rebirth or regeneration.

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:42.530 align:middle line:84%
So in cosmic time, which is
beyond our arbitrary space

00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:45.140 align:middle line:84%
and time, there is
a cycle of rebirth

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:48.050 align:middle line:84%
that takes place where we
rediscover within ourselves

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:51.470 align:middle line:84%
the power of the Phoenix of
giving ourselves genetically

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:53.450 align:middle line:90%
the concept of rebirth.

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:54.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.938 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
And I'd just like

00:26:55.938 --> 00:26:58.580 align:middle line:84%
to say we have to bring
in Horus from Egypt

00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:01.805 align:middle line:84%
because he also is
considered the Falcon man.

00:27:01.805 --> 00:27:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And of course, some of
the ancient sculptures

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:06.710 align:middle line:84%
just show him as a falcon
but more of the modern ones

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:09.590 align:middle line:84%
or more recent times
of ancient Egypt

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:14.160 align:middle line:84%
show him as being able to walk
and to literally just show

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:14.960 align:middle line:90%
his wings.

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:17.840 align:middle line:84%
So Horus was a very
important aspect

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:21.590 align:middle line:84%
of the Birdman in
ancient Egypt, as well as

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:23.610 align:middle line:90%
Thoth, who was the ibis bird.

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:26.490 align:middle line:84%
He was the scribe who
wrote down everything.

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:32.400 align:middle line:10%
And a third bird in Egypt, which
most people ignore, was Maat.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.690 align:middle line:10%
She was a woman.

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:35.340 align:middle line:10%
I don't want to
just keep saying man

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:37.590 align:middle line:10%
because there was
also a birdwoman.

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:39.810 align:middle line:90%
And she had her own wings.

00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And in addition to that,
there was the Ba, the soul,

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:44.830 align:middle line:90%
which had the opposite.

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:49.500 align:middle line:84%
It had the body of the bird
but the face and head of a man.

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And it was our soul when
we left this planet.

00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:56.190 align:middle line:84%
So I think the Birdman is
still here, is still watching.

00:27:56.190 --> 00:28:00.150 align:middle line:84%
According to the Egyptians,
the BA is always with us

00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:03.290 align:middle line:90%
and can be used by us to ascend.

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:05.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got
some pictures of Horus.

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:07.320 align:middle line:84%
I want you to explain what
we're looking at in some

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:09.910 align:middle line:90%
of the temple walls in Egypt.

00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:12.660 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: This is the
stylized form of Horus

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:16.080 align:middle line:84%
representing his
multidimensionality on three

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:20.130 align:middle line:84%
levels, of working with past,
present, future, reality,

00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:22.185 align:middle line:84%
Horus, of course, is
the conveyor of wisdom.

00:28:22.185 --> 00:28:23.432 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they all Horus?

00:28:23.432 --> 00:28:24.390 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: All Horus.

00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:27.480 align:middle line:84%
Some would refer to Horus
the Elder, Horus the Younger,

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:30.600 align:middle line:84%
and Horus that which
is to come or manifest.

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:33.510 align:middle line:84%
We have various stylized
forms of Egyptian art

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:36.168 align:middle line:90%
where Horus appears as Herihor.

00:28:36.168 --> 00:28:37.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he's
got that bird head.

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:39.335 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: He's
connected with-- yes,

00:28:39.335 --> 00:28:41.730 align:middle line:84%
and this is again,
what I feel is

00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:44.010 align:middle line:84%
so important in the
new anthropology

00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:48.960 align:middle line:84%
and cosmology is that in all of
the major Egyptian depictions,

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:51.850 align:middle line:84%
you have the human body
but the head is different.

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:52.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:56.370 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: And so conceivably
in the future meeting

00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:58.860 align:middle line:84%
with cosmic
intelligence there would

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:02.530 align:middle line:84%
be amongst the varieties those
who have engineered themselves

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:04.350 align:middle line:84%
so they have a bird-like
face although they

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:05.550 align:middle line:90%
have a human body.

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:07.620 align:middle line:84%
Here we have another
situation where

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:12.260 align:middle line:84%
Horus is beholding knowledge
that is being presented to him.

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:15.050 align:middle line:84%
This is, of course, through
the "Book of Breathings"

00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:18.710 align:middle line:84%
or certain sounds,
certain vibrations that

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:21.440 align:middle line:84%
allow the figure on the
left and the right side

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:24.920 align:middle line:84%
to take and use this
knowledge for temple building,

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:28.540 align:middle line:90%
for science of the human race.

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:32.830 align:middle line:84%
A third example is the
beholding of knowledge

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:35.770 align:middle line:90%
principally in the governing.

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:39.910 align:middle line:84%
Horus represents to the
Egyptian priests, the knowledge

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:43.270 align:middle line:84%
of sacred geometry,
of how the universe is

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:44.860 align:middle line:90%
built upon these geometries.

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:47.680 align:middle line:84%
The eye of Horus represents
on the right side

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:50.020 align:middle line:84%
the sun on the
left side the moon.

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:52.660 align:middle line:84%
But the eye also is divided,
if you look carefully

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:56.800 align:middle line:84%
at the eye of Horus, into
certain mathematical parts.

00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:03.200 align:middle line:84%
One represents one fourth, one
half, one eighth, et cetera,

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.710 align:middle line:90%
et cetera till you get to 1/64.

00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And we have found that this
is a way that the ancients saw

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:10.090 align:middle line:90%
the genetic code.

00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:12.670 align:middle line:84%
There were 64 basic figures
in the genetic code.

00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:14.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do we know,
JJ, that Horus is not

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:17.060 align:middle line:90%
wearing a mask?

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:18.640 align:middle line:10%
>>JJ HURTAK: Well,
again, I can only

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:22.090 align:middle line:10%
say the representation
that have come down

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:25.720 align:middle line:10%
through honest artisans and
anthropologists would all

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:28.900 align:middle line:10%
agree that this is something
very atypical of what

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:32.140 align:middle line:10%
normal artists
would put together

00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:33.640 align:middle line:10%
in terms of the kingship line.

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:36.520 align:middle line:10%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: And why
would we ever limit creation

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:38.500 align:middle line:10%
to just the adamic form?

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.990 align:middle line:10%
Although, I have
to say that Horus

00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:43.990 align:middle line:10%
was represented of
life while Osiris

00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:46.130 align:middle line:10%
was representative of death.

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:47.350 align:middle line:10%
So very, very interesting.

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:51.610 align:middle line:10%
But I also want to add the
similarity between Egypt

00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:55.990 align:middle line:10%
and Mexico, Horus
actually fought with Set.

00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:58.630 align:middle line:10%
Now, Set was a dog-faced one.

00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:01.630 align:middle line:10%
Interesting, you go
to Mexico and you

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:07.360 align:middle line:10%
find Quetzalcoatl who had a
brother, a kind of twin, called

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:08.620 align:middle line:10%
Xolotl.

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:12.250 align:middle line:10%
And he also was a dog-faced one.

00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:16.750 align:middle line:84%
So very, very interesting that
the dog-faced ones and the,

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:20.410 align:middle line:84%
we'll say, birdmen
really were known

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:23.320 align:middle line:84%
on both the East and
the West and the Middle

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:25.030 align:middle line:90%
part of this world.

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:28.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The tomb of Osiris,
what's the significance here?

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:31.520 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: Well, Osiris
represents the father figure,

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:33.590 align:middle line:90%
the giver of knowledge.

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:40.190 align:middle line:84%
Really the progenitor of
Horus and the offspring

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:41.210 align:middle line:90%
of the divine family.

00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And we had the
opportunity many years ago

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.790 align:middle line:84%
to get permission
to do ground sensing

00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:48.940 align:middle line:90%
in Egypt in the Giza Plateau.

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:49.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh fascinating.

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:51.607 align:middle line:10%
>>JJ HURTAK: And we
were able to locate,

00:31:51.607 --> 00:31:54.470 align:middle line:10%
because the water tables
were low at that time,

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:58.790 align:middle line:10%
the actual tomb of Osiris,
which later was claimed by Zahi

00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:04.280 align:middle line:10%
Hawass, but it was really our
team two years before in 1997

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:06.890 align:middle line:10%
through the use of
sound measurements

00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:08.300 align:middle line:10%
and the use of
ground penetrating

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:11.030 align:middle line:10%
radar that located
the actual lid

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:12.770 align:middle line:10%
of this massive tomb of Osiris.

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:16.010 align:middle line:10%
According to Egyptian mythology,
when the tomb of Osiris

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:19.430 align:middle line:10%
is found, Osiris who brought
music to Mother Earth,

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:21.588 align:middle line:10%
then we would understand
the music of the heavens.

00:32:21.588 --> 00:32:22.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So you found the tomb?

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:24.172 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: We found the tomb.

00:32:24.172 --> 00:32:28.100 align:middle line:10%
Our team, known as the Joe
Schor Expedition from New York,

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:32.330 align:middle line:10%
we found the tomb, but also
we found the underground grid

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:35.550 align:middle line:10%
system or the portals
that apparently extend

00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:38.110 align:middle line:10%
all throughout underground
Giza, so all of the pyramids

00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:38.910 align:middle line:10%
are linked.

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:41.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You both toured
the tomb of Osiris.

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:42.840 align:middle line:90%
Let's share that with our--

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:44.130 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: Thank you.

00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:45.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --viewers.

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
There probably were

00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:51.570 align:middle line:84%
all of these filled with
some sort of mummy that

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:55.060 align:middle line:84%
was connected with the
main tomb underneath.

00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the main thing
that was not known in 1997

00:32:58.650 --> 00:33:02.220 align:middle line:84%
was that there was an
actual tomb underneath.

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:04.110 align:middle line:84%
Zahi Hawass eventually
after we found

00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:09.180 align:middle line:84%
the lid was able to go down and
dig down underneath the water

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:12.935 align:middle line:84%
and pull up the one
sarcophagus that was below.

00:33:12.935 --> 00:33:14.310 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: So
this is important

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:17.160 align:middle line:84%
because we also
discovered the fact

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:20.160 align:middle line:84%
that the Egyptians were doing
at the lower level water

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:21.300 align:middle line:90%
hydraulics.

00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:25.800 align:middle line:84%
So we believe that they were
able to manufacture hydrogen,

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:28.350 align:middle line:84%
and the way they were
using water hydraulics.

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:29.940 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that the Japanese

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:32.010 align:middle line:90%
have done in recent times.

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:34.530 align:middle line:84%
And engineers at Stanford
Research Institute

00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:36.090 align:middle line:90%
in California have done.

00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:39.390 align:middle line:84%
That under certain
movements of water,

00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:45.460 align:middle line:84%
the water molecule
produces not H20 but--

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:46.880 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Yeah, HHO.

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:47.680 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: --HHO.

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:50.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Or separating
the hydrogen and the oxygen.

00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:51.940 align:middle line:84%
Some of you know
this from our book.

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:54.610 align:middle line:84%
But I think what's
really interesting is

00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:57.100 align:middle line:84%
that it's similar in
Sweden to find some

00:33:57.100 --> 00:34:00.790 align:middle line:84%
of these kind of underground
storage for the chemicals

00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:03.247 align:middle line:84%
that they are storing
and trying to get rid of.

00:34:03.247 --> 00:34:05.830 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: So the Egyptians
we believe use chemical switches

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:08.350 align:middle line:84%
to create a light
source, which they

00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:10.607 align:middle line:84%
used to do all of this
underground engineering.

00:34:10.607 --> 00:34:12.774 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: And then
Asclepius, as some of you

00:34:12.774 --> 00:34:14.469 align:middle line:84%
know from the Nag
Hammadi library, which

00:34:14.469 --> 00:34:17.530 align:middle line:84%
was found down closer
to Luxor and Karnak,

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:21.280 align:middle line:84%
it says that at one time this
was the area of the gods.

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:22.780 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: Full
House of the gods.

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:25.929 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: And then later
on it became a place of tomb.

00:34:25.929 --> 00:34:28.480 align:middle line:84%
So I think our guide
today was correct

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:33.350 align:middle line:84%
that there were things even
pre what we know today.

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:35.920 align:middle line:84%
So that they're
even the sarcophagi

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:40.210 align:middle line:84%
were probably not for all
the gods or all the pharaohs

00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:42.980 align:middle line:84%
who they thought were
gods but for something

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:45.170 align:middle line:84%
before that, and then
were turned into tombs.

00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: So we look at
the tomb behind where we're

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:49.219 align:middle line:90%
talking, that's down 75 feet.

00:34:49.219 --> 00:34:51.860 align:middle line:84%
So how do the Egyptians
get these massive tomb-like

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:53.429 align:middle line:84%
structures down to
such low heights?

00:34:53.429 --> 00:34:54.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did they do that?

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:56.193 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: Well,
there's various theories.

00:34:56.193 --> 00:34:59.720 align:middle line:84%
One being that they were helped
by higher cosmic intelligence

00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:03.020 align:middle line:84%
that gave them the
energy tools to make

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:06.770 align:middle line:84%
these very precise areas where
they could drop the tombs

00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:08.870 align:middle line:90%
and bring them underground.

00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:09.670 align:middle line:90%
This is explained--

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:10.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why the
pyramids were made.

00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:11.853 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: That's right.

00:35:11.853 --> 00:35:13.850 align:middle line:84%
The book that we published
a couple of years

00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:17.390 align:middle line:84%
ago called "Giza's Industrial
Complex," entertains

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:18.710 align:middle line:90%
with Desiree had said.

00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:22.700 align:middle line:84%
They had the ability to engineer
through water hydraulics,

00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:25.310 align:middle line:84%
through hydrogen
production, through the use

00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:28.610 align:middle line:84%
of all sorts of collection
and storage of solar energy

00:35:28.610 --> 00:35:29.720 align:middle line:90%
through solar batteries.

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:32.810 align:middle line:84%
So we point this
out in great depth.

00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, this is one of
many of the film documentaries

00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:39.800 align:middle line:90%
that we did underground in 1997.

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:43.160 align:middle line:84%
So underneath where
we were talking

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:45.440 align:middle line:84%
in this recent
documentation there

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.935 align:middle line:84%
is still a deeper water system
that runs throughout Egypt.

00:35:47.935 --> 00:35:49.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
And it's really

00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:52.035 align:middle line:84%
right in alignment between the
Sphinx and the Middle Pyramid.

00:35:52.035 --> 00:35:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And we believe that,
of course, there's

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:56.930 align:middle line:84%
much more cavities and
underground tunnels

00:35:56.930 --> 00:35:59.960 align:middle line:84%
just like they recently found
at the Feathered Serpent

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:00.800 align:middle line:90%
in Mexico.

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.330 align:middle line:90%
They only found it in 2004.

00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:04.835 align:middle line:84%
This place has been
frequented since the Aztecs.

00:36:04.835 --> 00:36:05.090 align:middle line:90%
They just found it now.

00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:06.590 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: So
Horus, the, Birdman,

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:08.360 align:middle line:84%
was connected also
with the Sphinx.

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:10.400 align:middle line:84%
The Sphinx represents
the human face.

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.470 align:middle line:84%
On stone, it
represents the ability

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:15.350 align:middle line:84%
to command what the Sphinx
represents historically,

00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:18.870 align:middle line:84%
the power of light or
fire, solar energy.

00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:21.320 align:middle line:84%
So this is a depiction
of what we believe

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:23.840 align:middle line:84%
to be the opening
stage of finding

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:25.790 align:middle line:84%
other rooms inside
the Great Pyramid

00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:27.800 align:middle line:84%
and understanding of
alternative energy

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:30.380 align:middle line:84%
the ancient Egyptians
used, and possibly

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:32.510 align:middle line:84%
an extraterrestrial race
that would be connected

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:34.910 align:middle line:84%
with the historic
Egyptian culture that

00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:37.640 align:middle line:84%
will be returning to the
scene of the human experiment.

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:39.890 align:middle line:84%
Mind you, our
Christian Bible begins

00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:41.360 align:middle line:90%
with the Exodus out of Egypt.

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.070 align:middle line:90%
Why does Egypt come first?

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:46.510 align:middle line:84%
Why are there lamentation over
the body of Jacob and Joseph

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:49.770 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt if there wasn't some
significance to the vibration,

00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:50.570 align:middle line:90%
the sound wave?

00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:54.370 align:middle line:84%
So again, acoustical
physics, the use of music

00:36:54.370 --> 00:36:57.670 align:middle line:84%
harmonics, the understanding
of energy alternatives.

00:36:57.670 --> 00:37:00.130 align:middle line:84%
All of this is
important in rescuing

00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:03.730 align:middle line:84%
what I will call the missing
pieces of the Egyptian story.

00:37:03.730 --> 00:37:06.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: And one other
missing piece is the astronomy.

00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And there was on
Hatshepsut's temple,

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.120 align:middle line:84%
actually in the sky
when they're looking

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:16.450 align:middle line:84%
at the different
archeological studies,

00:37:16.450 --> 00:37:22.960 align:middle line:84%
there is both the Birdman
and, we'll say, also the bull.

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:24.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's
interesting about that

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:28.272 align:middle line:84%
is if you take this to Ezekiel,
because I know a lot of people

00:37:28.272 --> 00:37:30.730 align:middle line:84%
are interested in how does this
relate to the Middle East--

00:37:30.730 --> 00:37:33.028 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: The Old
Testament prophet Ezekiel.

00:37:33.028 --> 00:37:34.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
--you find you have

00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:39.310 align:middle line:84%
four heads that were part
of the vehicle of Ezekiel

00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:40.840 align:middle line:90%
in Ezekiel 1:10.

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:42.700 align:middle line:90%
You have the bird.

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:46.730 align:middle line:84%
You have the bull, which can
also be considered the ox.

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:49.640 align:middle line:84%
You also have the
angelic form, and you

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:51.408 align:middle line:90%
have a man-like form, correct?

00:37:51.408 --> 00:37:52.700 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: You have the lion.

00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:53.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
And the lion, yes.

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:55.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
Horus and Thoth might

00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:56.600 align:middle line:90%
have been extraterrestrials?

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:59.630 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: Definitely
because of the whole totemism

00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:03.540 align:middle line:84%
built around their names
and their traditions.

00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:04.670 align:middle line:90%
The work that--

00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:06.017 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From Mars maybe?

00:38:06.017 --> 00:38:07.850 align:middle line:10%
>>JJ HURTAK: Well, we
found pyramids on Mars

00:38:07.850 --> 00:38:10.730 align:middle line:10%
through remote viewing
experiments back in the '70s.

00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:12.890 align:middle line:84%
So yes, Mars would be
a candidate because it

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:15.320 align:middle line:84%
lines up with the
Arabic Al-Qahira,

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:18.650 align:middle line:84%
which is the name for the
Giza area of ancient Egypt.

00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:22.040 align:middle line:84%
Why would the Egyptians
have an emphasis on Mars

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:24.290 align:middle line:84%
or the spacious one in
connection with the place

00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:27.450 align:middle line:84%
where the pyramids were as the
nexus point of civilization?

00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:29.780 align:middle line:84%
There's a higher
astronomy that has

00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:31.738 align:middle line:84%
to be brought into play
with planetary science.

00:38:31.738 --> 00:38:33.531 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Right,
so we don't really

00:38:33.531 --> 00:38:35.720 align:middle line:84%
think that they're
from Mars, but we think

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:37.470 align:middle line:90%
that they frequented Mars.

00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:39.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And something
happened on Mars

00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:40.220 align:middle line:90%
a long time ago. what was it?

00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:42.340 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: Civilization was
wiped out either by a comet

00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:43.140 align:middle line:90%
or--

00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:44.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or they came here.

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.980 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: Well, the Zulus
feel the descendants of that

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:50.700 align:middle line:84%
conflict on Mars made their way
through what they call in Zulu

00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:53.790 align:middle line:84%
[NON-ENGLISH] which is close
to the Hebrew word merkava,

00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:57.330 align:middle line:84%
for vehicle of light from that
planet to this planet where

00:38:57.330 --> 00:38:59.530 align:middle line:84%
the story of evolution
begins again.

00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:01.302 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Truly
remarkable, isn't it?

00:39:01.302 --> 00:39:02.760 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: It's
remarkable if you

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:05.430 align:middle line:84%
can look at the Bible
in terms of the Bible

00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:08.190 align:middle line:84%
within a Bible in terms
of the inner mathematics

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:10.710 align:middle line:84%
and music vibrations
of teaching,

00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:13.740 align:middle line:84%
it is clear that the Bible
has many levels of meaning,

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:17.010 align:middle line:84%
one of which deals with
the eagle-faced ones,

00:39:17.010 --> 00:39:21.150 align:middle line:84%
the lion-faced ones, and the
others who represent some

00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:22.830 align:middle line:84%
of the other
experimental cultures

00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:25.410 align:middle line:84%
the ancient scholars,
sages, and rabbis

00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:28.500 align:middle line:84%
referred to as the Nephilim,
the fallen experimenters.

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:32.550 align:middle line:10%
Which is why they look forward
to the deliverance from bondage

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:34.530 align:middle line:10%
out of Egypt from a
higher person that

00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:36.750 align:middle line:10%
was in the Christian
tradition, the New

00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:41.340 align:middle line:10%
Testament in the work of Clement
and other interpreters the Deus

00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:43.660 align:middle line:10%
or the Homo Deus, the
man-god figure that

00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:45.280 align:middle line:10%
was beyond the Birdman.

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:47.410 align:middle line:90%
One who was a prince of peace.

00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:50.440 align:middle line:84%
One who was a deliverer
from enslavement cycles.

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:54.010 align:middle line:84%
One who was also able to
show the temple of spirit as

00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:57.520 align:middle line:84%
opposed to the temple of stone
to be the quintessence of life.

00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:01.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do you believe
the Birdman came here?

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:04.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Well,
he is the angelic power.

00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:07.120 align:middle line:84%
He is that energy that
is able to take us

00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:10.270 align:middle line:84%
from this reality, at least
in terms of our thoughts,

00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:11.680 align:middle line:90%
to the higher realities.

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:15.970 align:middle line:84%
If we look at some of
the ancient teachings,

00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:19.990 align:middle line:84%
again, if you look at Garuda
connected with Vishnu,

00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:22.480 align:middle line:84%
he was the vehicle
that brought Vishnu.

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:23.290 align:middle line:90%
Who was Vishnu?

00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:25.960 align:middle line:84%
He was the one that tried
to bring order here.

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Any time this planet
is out of order,

00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:33.130 align:middle line:84%
then Vishnu is said to come
to create that balance.

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:37.660 align:middle line:84%
It's the same also we mentioned
Thoth as also the ibis bird,

00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:40.060 align:middle line:84%
it looks also like a
birdman in that sense.

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:42.850 align:middle line:84%
He was working with
Maat, which was

00:40:42.850 --> 00:40:44.620 align:middle line:90%
the woman who brought harmony.

00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:48.490 align:middle line:84%
So all these energies are
really from the heavens seeking

00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:50.710 align:middle line:90%
to bring balance to the Earth.

00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:53.710 align:middle line:90%
The Earth is a dualistic system.

00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:56.950 align:middle line:84%
All of the birdmen
practically around the world

00:40:56.950 --> 00:41:00.920 align:middle line:84%
are talking and showing that
it is a dualistic system.

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:02.960 align:middle line:90%
So what do we do with it?

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:05.560 align:middle line:84%
Do we just give up or
do we work with those

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:10.330 align:middle line:84%
of the positive figures of light
and move into that reality?

00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:12.310 align:middle line:84%
That's what I think
they're here to show us.

00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:13.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't think they left.

00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:16.930 align:middle line:84%
I think they're always here
if we simply call upon them

00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:18.238 align:middle line:90%
like the angelic powers.

00:41:18.238 --> 00:41:19.780 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: And
we're being prepared

00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:22.420 align:middle line:84%
for psychological and
sociological shock

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:26.200 align:middle line:84%
as we began to understand who
are these other cosmic races.

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:27.663 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And maybe change?

00:41:27.663 --> 00:41:29.080 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: They
have the ability

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:33.550 align:middle line:84%
to shift or change
their facial features,

00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:35.440 align:middle line:84%
but their historic
precedents, which

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:39.280 align:middle line:84%
is to say if our ancestors could
accept biological diversity

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:42.910 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, why can't we
at this age of the 21st century?

00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:45.482 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were there
ever birdwomen?

00:41:45.482 --> 00:41:46.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Absolutely.

00:41:46.690 --> 00:41:50.650 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there's a
Russian folklore, Gamayun

00:41:50.650 --> 00:41:53.560 align:middle line:90%
who actually is also similar.

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:54.970 align:middle line:90%
She brings wisdom.

00:41:54.970 --> 00:41:56.350 align:middle line:90%
She brings knowledge.

00:41:56.350 --> 00:41:59.600 align:middle line:84%
She brings prophecy
to the people.

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:01.900 align:middle line:84%
This is part of the
Slavic tradition.

00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:04.210 align:middle line:84%
It's an amazing
phenomenon that is

00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:06.910 align:middle line:84%
similar to that which
is around the world,

00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:08.840 align:middle line:90%
you also have Gamayun.

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:10.090 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: The same cognate.

00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And in the concept of Garuda,
the bird that brings knowledge,

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:17.500 align:middle line:84%
you have also the
avatar or the master

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:21.580 align:middle line:84%
who rides the bird such as
in the Sanskrit tradition

00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:26.950 align:middle line:84%
that which was called the
Vajrakilaya, which was the man

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:31.030 align:middle line:84%
or the face that had three
faces representing the Oriental

00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:35.840 align:middle line:84%
tradition of the divine law, the
divine body, the etheric body,

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:38.770 align:middle line:84%
which is the Eastern equivalent
of the Trinity concept

00:42:38.770 --> 00:42:40.150 align:middle line:90%
and the ancient Near East.

00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:43.390 align:middle line:84%
So there is a common
tradition of both the male

00:42:43.390 --> 00:42:46.330 align:middle line:84%
and the female
figure growing into,

00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:49.660 align:middle line:84%
shall we say, a
higher awareness stage

00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:53.320 align:middle line:84%
that the spiritual dimension
has to come in to balance

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:54.403 align:middle line:90%
as it were the imbalances.

00:42:54.403 --> 00:42:56.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Now, I
have to say also the Greeks

00:42:56.570 --> 00:42:59.110 align:middle line:84%
and the Romans they always had
a certain type of hierarchy.

00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:01.810 align:middle line:84%
They had something
called the Harpys.

00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And those were also
feminine birdwomen

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:07.750 align:middle line:90%
who would come and take things.

00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:10.240 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they would even
take the soul of the dead.

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:12.700 align:middle line:90%
So these were not so positive.

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:16.090 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, if we go back
to the Slavic, of course,

00:43:16.090 --> 00:43:18.190 align:middle line:84%
then you have a more
positive aspect.

00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Also the same in the New
Zealand Maori culture,

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:25.900 align:middle line:84%
you also have positive
energy of birdwomen.

00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:28.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
track your work?

00:43:28.210 --> 00:43:30.400 align:middle line:10%
>>JJ HURTAK: They can track
us through our website,

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:32.080 align:middle line:10%
keysofenoch.org.

00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:34.000 align:middle line:10%
They can track us
to our documentaries

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.900 align:middle line:10%
that we are doing, that we're

They can track us through
the various conferences

00:43:40.270 --> 00:43:43.310 align:middle line:10%
that we have done throughout
the world over the last 40

00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:44.740 align:middle line:10%
to 50 years.

00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:47.470 align:middle line:10%
More importantly, things
we are about to publish,

00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:50.290 align:middle line:10%
which is the whole
musical scheme

00:43:50.290 --> 00:43:51.550 align:middle line:10%
inside the Great Pyramid.

00:43:51.550 --> 00:43:53.200 align:middle line:90%
We were the first to do this.

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:54.820 align:middle line:84%
Very sophisticated
musical instruments

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:57.520 align:middle line:84%
we found that the music
of the pyramids in Egypt

00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:01.660 align:middle line:84%
matched the music of the
pyramids in Mexico, Yucatan.

00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:04.160 align:middle line:84%
Also, the music of
the pyramids in China,

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:07.030 align:middle line:84%
which is to show that
there is thousands of years

00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:11.710 align:middle line:84%
before the last chronology
was put together by Europeans,

00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:13.840 align:middle line:84%
there was a
consistency in music,

00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:16.960 align:middle line:84%
mathematics, and geometric
form of a world culture

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:18.610 align:middle line:84%
that circumnavigated
Mother Earth.

00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:21.820 align:middle line:84%
We are at the point, George,
of rediscovering who we really

00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:23.220 align:middle line:90%
are as a cosmic civilization.

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:24.178 align:middle line:90%

00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:32.610 align:middle line:10%
the ancient history
of this planet

00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:34.830 align:middle line:10%

about our future.
