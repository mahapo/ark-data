exactly is the 27 club?

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's a group
of musicians who

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.150 align:middle line:84%
have sadly and tragically
died at the age of 27.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.734 align:middle line:84%
Let me show you a little bit
more about what that means.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.650 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How uncanny they
all died at the age of 27.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And with me on "Beyond
Belief," of course,

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.150 align:middle line:84%
is rock and roll historian and
noted author R. Gary Patterson.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Gary, we've talked about
this over the years.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.732 align:middle line:90%
Truly bizarre story.

00:02:51.732 --> 00:02:53.190 align:middle line:84%
>> R. GARY PATTERSON:
It really is.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And I know that a lot of people
who are in rock and roll, they

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.750 align:middle line:90%
sort of hold that age of 27.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.750 align:middle line:84%
They sort of think, I
need to really be careful.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.160 align:middle line:84%
I know I read an
interview with John Mayer.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.240 align:middle line:90%
It was in a BMI publication.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And they asked him,
they said, what

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.720 align:middle line:84%
was your greatest
contribution so far?

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
I made it past 27.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, every time,
if there's an accident,

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.940 align:middle line:84%
I hear about some
rock star who died.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.110 align:middle line:84%
In my mind, I say, oh my
gosh, please don't be 27.

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.790 align:middle line:84%
But with Amy Winehouse,
I was headed to Florida.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And I bet I had 16 phone calls
from radio networks wanting

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.820 align:middle line:84%
to do an interview on
the 27 club and with Amy.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.300 align:middle line:84%
So what was odd, I did a segment
with E. And they picked out,

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.495 align:middle line:84%
it was either going to
be Britney Spears or Amy

00:03:37.495 --> 00:03:39.600 align:middle line:84%
Winehouse who'd be the
next member of the club.

>> PATTERSON: Yeah.

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.120 align:middle line:84%

that, it had Amy.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And they said she
better watch out.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.010 align:middle line:84%
It was just really interesting
that they would pick that.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.135 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I don't think
Britney ever have that kind

00:03:50.135 --> 00:03:52.240 align:middle line:84%
of a lifestyle where
she would have ended up.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.020 align:middle line:90%
Or did she?

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.561 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: Well, there was
a time that people were worried

00:03:55.561 --> 00:03:57.792 align:middle line:84%
about her because she
became very out there,

00:03:57.792 --> 00:04:00.250 align:middle line:84%
I guess you would say, shaving
her head and all the others.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.140 align:middle line:84%
But she seemed to have
got her act together.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's not to say that if
you're a rock star and not 27

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.310 align:middle line:84%
you don't have
your act together.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.130 align:middle line:84%
It just seems like maybe the
mystery of this whole thing

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.690 align:middle line:84%
is some synchronicity,
or whatever.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.160 align:middle line:84%
But we've talked
about it many times.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And the story, when I started
this, I was doing research

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.980 align:middle line:84%
on my second book,
"Hellhounds on their Trail,"

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.650 align:middle line:84%
and I found it fascinating
that the very first chapter

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.620 align:middle line:84%
of my book was on Robert
Johnson, the famous blues

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.490 align:middle line:84%
man who supposedly made
a deal with the devil.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:29.800 align:middle line:90%
But he died at 27.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And when I found other rock
stars in the book-- Jimi

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.100 align:middle line:84%
Hendrix, Brian Jones,
Janis Joplin-- I

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.830 align:middle line:84%
thought it was odd
they all died at 27.

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.654 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: We just looked at just
a small glimpse of the amount.

00:04:39.654 --> 00:04:40.570 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Exactly.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.200 align:middle line:84%
There over 45 rock stars
who've died at the age of 27.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.930 align:middle line:84%
It's the number one age for
the death of rock stars.

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.360 align:middle line:90%
It's truly bizarre.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.510 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So when you look
at something like that,

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.630 align:middle line:84%
do you think, well,
maybe as a rock star--

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.060 align:middle line:84%
and they do live these
very wild lives--

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:02.100 align:middle line:84%
get close to that age of 27 that
they pile it on because they

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.190 align:middle line:84%
think they're going
to die at that age?

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.159 align:middle line:84%
Do you think they will this onto
themselves in an unknowing way?

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:10.450 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: You know, that's
an interesting question.

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.850 align:middle line:84%
In Romantic
literature, John Keats

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.240 align:middle line:90%
found out that he was dying.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.300 align:middle line:90%
He had one year to live.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.170 align:middle line:84%
So what he did, he wrote
the five greatest odes

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:19.320 align:middle line:84%
in the history of
the English language.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.080 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: In his last year.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.290 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: And he did it.

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.540 align:middle line:84%
He was obsessed to
getting finished.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.250 align:middle line:84%
He had a famous
sonnet, "When I Have

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.100 align:middle line:90%
Fears that I May Cease to Be."

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.290 align:middle line:84%
I think in rock
stars, they are always

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:31.940 align:middle line:84%
capable of writing
great material.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.440 align:middle line:84%
I think that sometimes at
the age of 27, when it hits,

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.610 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's
because they're more,

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.911 align:middle line:84%
well, they use more drugs
or they take more risk.

00:05:41.911 --> 00:05:43.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you look
at the cause of death,

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:44.960 align:middle line:90%
they're not all drug overdoses.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And there's no doubt
in my mind that some

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.250 align:middle line:84%
of the rock stars who've
been accused of dying of drug

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.830 align:middle line:90%
overdose were actually murdered.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.620 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, that's
a good point, too.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:55.955 align:middle line:90%
That's a good point.

00:05:55.955 --> 00:05:57.580 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: It's
a coincidence at 27,

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.070 align:middle line:90%
but their creativity is great.

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.950 align:middle line:84%
So we talked about
numerology with this.

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:04.874 align:middle line:84%
We talked about
astrology with this.

00:06:04.874 --> 00:06:06.290 align:middle line:84%
And when you talk
about the number

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.860 align:middle line:84%
9-- 2 plus 7 being 9-- that it's
their highest spiritual power

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.160 align:middle line:84%
and they're ready to leave
this version of the world.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.720 align:middle line:90%
So their music's great.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.887 align:middle line:90%
We have their music.

00:06:15.887 --> 00:06:17.220 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That lives on forever.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.620 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: Yeah, the
music lives on forever.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:19.790 align:middle line:84%
They're immortal,
and they'll always

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.440 align:middle line:84%
influence us in the
next generations.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.470 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is it possible that
there's some sick cult out

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:30.430 align:middle line:84%
there that looks at these
rock stars and has decided,

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.920 align:middle line:84%
over the years, to
kill them off at 27?

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:34.670 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Wow.

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:35.750 align:middle line:90%
Now, that'd make a good movie.

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:36.958 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It would be a good.

00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.894 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
have to write it.

00:06:38.894 --> 00:06:40.560 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: I'd
have to co-credit you.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.674 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, Id do that for you.

00:06:42.674 --> 00:06:43.840 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Just send a check.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.214 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Yeah.

00:06:45.214 --> 00:06:46.130 align:middle line:90%
I've had those checks.

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:48.120 align:middle line:90%
But what happens is basically--

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.070 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: That would be
an interesting theory.

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.070 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: It would
be an interesting theory.

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:53.190 align:middle line:90%
It really would be.

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:57.600 align:middle line:84%
You might think that there
may be government entities who

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.900 align:middle line:84%
have been involved in the
death of certain rock stars.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.760 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Just to get rid of
them because they're changing

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.606 align:middle line:90%
culture.

00:07:04.606 --> 00:07:05.730 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: That's right.

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:07.920 align:middle line:84%
So I'll give you
another hypothesis.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.990 align:middle line:84%
Let's say that if you did
have some secret government

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:13.260 align:middle line:84%
agency that's
setting up rock stars

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.760 align:middle line:84%
because they're in
holding companies

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.010 align:middle line:84%
making millions of
dollars off their music,

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:18.929 align:middle line:84%
and if their music
was dying out--

00:07:18.929 --> 00:07:19.970 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They make more.

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:21.150 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: Right,
when they're dead.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:22.050 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Look at
Michael Jackson.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:23.633 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: Look
at Michael Jackson.

00:07:23.633 --> 00:07:25.660 align:middle line:84%
Look at anyone who
dies, the obsession

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:28.076 align:middle line:84%
to go out and buy their
Greatest Hits, or anything

00:07:28.076 --> 00:07:28.700 align:middle line:90%
by that artist.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.575 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Elvis's estate
is making a fortune.

00:07:30.575 --> 00:07:32.580 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: Elvis makes
more money now, dead,

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:33.830 align:middle line:90%
than he did when he was alive.

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.790 align:middle line:84%
Jimi Hendrix said, it's funny
how people love the dead.

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.200 align:middle line:84%
Once you're dead,
you're made forever.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:39.890 align:middle line:90%
And it's true.

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And when the first rock and
roll fatality, Johnny Ace,

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:46.150 align:middle line:84%
when he accidentally
shot himself

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:49.030 align:middle line:84%
with a pistol he thought was
unloaded and booked his ticket

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:53.361 align:middle line:84%
to rock and roll heaven, the
late, great Johnny Ace album

00:07:53.361 --> 00:07:53.860 align:middle line:90%
came out.

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And it sold more records,
because everybody

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.260 align:middle line:90%
heard about his death.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.770 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to commemorate
with the music.

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:02.600 align:middle line:84%
And so those are two theories
that would be interesting.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.947 align:middle line:90%
They would make great movies.

00:08:03.947 --> 00:08:04.780 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it, George.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:05.405 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:08:05.405 --> 00:08:06.880 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there's something there.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.460 align:middle line:84%
It is too ironic, Gary, that
so many of these people-- 40

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:13.250 align:middle line:84%
plus-- would die
at the age of 27.

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:17.154 align:middle line:84%
It just defies logic
and it defies odds.

00:08:17.154 --> 00:08:18.320 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Well, it does.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, hopefully--
I hate these to even think

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:25.507 align:middle line:84%
of the idea that it
continues, but now it

00:08:25.507 --> 00:08:27.340 align:middle line:84%
seems like it's in
everyone's consciousness.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.920 align:middle line:84%
Every time, like when
Amy Winehouse died,

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.650 align:middle line:84%
it was all over
newspapers everywhere,

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:34.690 align:middle line:90%
the 27 club, the curse of 27.

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:36.710 align:middle line:84%
So when I did my
second book, I called

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:40.470 align:middle line:84%
it "The Club and
the Curse of 27."

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:41.634 align:middle line:90%
We did it on VH1.

00:08:41.634 --> 00:08:44.340 align:middle line:84%
So they usually call
me to talk about it.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And we do it every time
someone passes away at 27,

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.792 align:middle line:90%
we have our discussion.

00:08:47.792 --> 00:08:48.750 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:49.250 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:50.380 align:middle line:90%
I always call you.

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:51.672 align:middle line:90%
There's another one, Gary.

00:08:51.672 --> 00:08:52.880 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: That's it, man.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:53.960 align:middle line:90%
And we know that.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And still, it's probably
the strangest curse ever.

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:01.150 align:middle line:84%
You talk about Tutankhamen's
Tomb and all that.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:03.180 align:middle line:84%
Rock stars' deaths
at the age of 27

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:07.470 align:middle line:84%
has got to be one of the
most puzzling coincidences,

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:08.820 align:middle line:90%
if there is a coincidence.

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.110 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You know I
don't believe in them.

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:10.985 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: I know.

00:09:10.985 --> 00:09:13.570 align:middle line:84%
Because a coincidence is an
explanation waiting to happen.

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:14.630 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:17.130 align:middle line:84%
Have you talked
to any rock stars

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:23.350 align:middle line:84%
who are aged under 27 who talk
to you about this possibility

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:24.570 align:middle line:90%
and this fear?

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: I've
had some emails.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.050 align:middle line:84%
And the email is
that they've actually

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:33.170 align:middle line:84%
gone to the crossroads in
Clarksdale, Mississippi.

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:35.870 align:middle line:90%
They follow the myth so closely.

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And they're tied into
this Robert Johnson motif.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
Jimmy Page and Robert

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.590 align:middle line:84%
Plant had an album,
"Walking into Clarksdale."

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:46.260 align:middle line:84%
So some of them
get really tied up.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.280 align:middle line:84%
But then again, sometimes it
might be good publicity also,

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.350 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:53.230 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think anybody's
ready to let go at 27.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:56.520 align:middle line:84%
If I were 27 and a rock star,
I would really watch it.

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:59.350 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't take a bath with
my electric guitar plugged in.

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:01.320 align:middle line:84%
I would not doing
anything that would

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.400 align:middle line:84%
make me the next
member of the club.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:08.270 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And even those
that live beyond 27 who die

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:10.880 align:middle line:84%
in their 40s, like Elvis,
and-- I don't know,

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.085 align:middle line:90%
how old was Michael Jackson?

00:10:12.085 --> 00:10:13.100 align:middle line:90%
He was in his 40s?

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:15.190 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Yeah.

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:16.749 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: That's
still young, too.

00:10:16.749 --> 00:10:17.540 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Yeah.

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:21.735 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So what does that tell
you about the entire business

00:10:21.735 --> 00:10:23.230 align:middle line:90%
of music like that?

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:25.980 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: I would say
that when you have to perform,

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:29.240 align:middle line:84%
when you have to write songs,
when you're on that grueling

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:34.310 align:middle line:84%
schedule, you may become
more susceptible to certain

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:35.940 align:middle line:90%
pharmaceuticals.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.592 align:middle line:84%
I think that you
burn yourself out.

00:10:38.592 --> 00:10:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And then I think sometimes
you look in a mirror

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:42.660 align:middle line:84%
and you see a
character of yourself.

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And sadly or not,
the music is great.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And those artists who pass
away, they've given their all.

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:52.360 align:middle line:84%
But as we said before, as
long as their music lasts,

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.790 align:middle line:84%
they've been able to
grasp immortality.

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:58.420 align:middle line:84%
Because when we did "The
End" at the opening segment,

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:02.290 align:middle line:84%
Jim Morrison will
always be under 27.

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:05.970 align:middle line:84%
He died young, and
the music will always

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:07.270 align:middle line:90%
inspire new generations.

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:11.540 align:middle line:84%
Other people who want to
touch Morrison's psyche, who

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:14.310 align:middle line:84%
want to be involved
in his lifestyle, who

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:17.277 align:middle line:84%
want to make names for
themselves in this field.

00:11:17.277 --> 00:11:18.110 align:middle line:90%
But it's really odd.

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:20.060 align:middle line:84%
I haven't checked how
many country music artists

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:20.670 align:middle line:90%
have died at the age of 27.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:22.628 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Now that's an
interesting twist, too.

00:11:22.628 --> 00:11:25.200 align:middle line:84%
I remember a few years ago
when I had the late Ray

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.440 align:middle line:90%
Manzerak on and Robby Krieger.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.390 align:middle line:84%
Ray, of course,
just passed away.

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:34.190 align:middle line:84%
But they were the two remaining
living members of The Doors.

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And I asked them both,
I said, all right.

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:37.960 align:middle line:90%
Tell me right now.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.950 align:middle line:84%
Do you think Jim
Morrison is still alive?

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And they both looked
at each other.

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:44.790 align:middle line:90%
Then they looked at me.

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:47.630 align:middle line:90%
And they went, absolutely not.

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:48.760 align:middle line:90%
He's dead.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.620 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: And
I have to tell you.

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:52.000 align:middle line:90%
I was involved in that show.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:52.999 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yes, you were.

00:11:52.999 --> 00:11:55.300 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: And I will
tell you that I was shocked.

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.340 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Did you think they
were going to say he was alive?

00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:59.756 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: I thought Ray
Manzerak would say that he did

00:11:59.756 --> 00:12:04.830 align:middle line:84%
not believe that Jim Morrison
was in that coffin at Pere

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:05.631 align:middle line:90%
Lachaise.

00:12:05.631 --> 00:12:07.380 align:middle line:84%
Now do you want me to
tell you why I know?

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:08.880 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Tell me why.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.460 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I did a
series with VH1.

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:13.160 align:middle line:84%
It was called "VH1
Confidential."

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.420 align:middle line:90%
And Ray was on the show.

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:19.320 align:middle line:84%
And at that time,
the French government

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:22.990 align:middle line:84%
was going to exhume Jim Morrison
and send him back to LA.

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:26.330 align:middle line:84%
I guess it was Jim's
2001 tour, or whatever.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.750 align:middle line:84%
But they were upset
because of the vandalism

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:31.200 align:middle line:84%
in the cemetery,
all the graffiti.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And it had to be cleaned, people
trying to get into the grave,

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:35.580 align:middle line:90%
dig him up.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And so on July 10, 2001, he
was supposed to be exhumed.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.230 align:middle line:84%
And we asked Ray
that same question.

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And this is what Ray Manzerak
said, and this was in 2001.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.830 align:middle line:84%
He said, when they
open that coffin,

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:55.050 align:middle line:84%
I will be with Doors' fans
from around the world.

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:58.050 align:middle line:84%
And we will be standing
at Pere Lachaise.

00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And we will all be
saying, open the box.

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:02.420 align:middle line:90%
Open the box.

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:06.284 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't believe
Jim Morrison is in there.

00:13:06.284 --> 00:13:07.200 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Interesting.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.760 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: So now you
see how shocked I was.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:09.385 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:13:09.385 --> 00:13:12.226 align:middle line:84%
Why did he change
over those years?

00:13:12.226 --> 00:13:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: I don't know.

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:17.974 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know some individuals
within the Morrison family.

00:13:17.974 --> 00:13:19.890 align:middle line:84%
I guess now if we think
about Jim being alive,

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:20.900 align:middle line:90%
he'd be much older.

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:23.010 align:middle line:90%
He wouldn't look like himself.

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:27.370 align:middle line:84%
It's awful hard to hide
an identity that long.

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:31.660 align:middle line:84%
But when "No One Here Gets
Out Alive" was published,

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:34.330 align:middle line:84%
they were talking
about Pamela Courson.

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And Jerry Hopkins and
Sugarman asked her.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.040 align:middle line:90%
They said, is Jim still alive?

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, if he
were alive, he would call me.

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:45.880 align:middle line:90%
How many people saw the body?

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.230 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Exactly.

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:50.190 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: When Bill Siddons
came over by The Doors request

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:54.190 align:middle line:84%
to go to Paris, all he saw was
a simple veneer coffin with

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:56.750 align:middle line:90%
the lid screwed into place.

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:58.340 align:middle line:90%
And Ray Manzerak told Siddons.

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:02.410 align:middle line:84%
He said, Bill, when
you go, make sure.

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:05.077 align:middle line:84%
And when he came back, he
said, I just saw the coffin.

00:14:05.077 --> 00:14:06.660 align:middle line:84%
We went to the funeral
and buried him.

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:07.660 align:middle line:90%
You didn't see the body.

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:09.140 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They all had their
suspicions, didn't they?

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:09.570 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Yeah.

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:10.520 align:middle line:90%
There were suspicions.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:14.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the way it happened,
the Morrison family

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:17.710 align:middle line:84%
didn't even know about
it until he was buried.

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And of course, if he died
of a drug overdose, then

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:23.410 align:middle line:84%
the question is somebody
would have to be arrested.

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:28.710 align:middle line:84%
So it was very generous
that a Parisian coroner

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:30.670 align:middle line:90%
said he died of a heart attack.

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:31.360 align:middle line:90%
And that way--

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.420 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: In a bath tub.

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:34.920 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: Yeah, but here's
the thing about the bath tub.

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:36.890 align:middle line:84%
When I was in Paris,
there was a new book

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:38.240 align:middle line:90%
that came out on The Doors.

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And it said that Jim
was in a nightclub

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:43.770 align:middle line:84%
and that two men
had sold him heroin,

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:46.250 align:middle line:84%
and then he went into
a bathroom stall.

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And they found him sprawled
out against the floor.

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:52.100 align:middle line:84%
The manager of the
club called a medic

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.000 align:middle line:84%
to come in and take a look
at him, an EMT specialist.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.340 align:middle line:90%
And he pronounced him dead.

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:56.930 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Right
there in the club?

00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:58.040 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: Right
there in the club.

00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.645 align:middle line:84%
And the two men who
sold him the drugs

00:14:59.645 --> 00:15:00.770 align:middle line:90%
said no, no, he's not dead.

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:01.610 align:middle line:90%
He'll be fine.

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:03.440 align:middle line:84%
They kept slapping
him on the face.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:06.054 align:middle line:84%
They picked him up and they
carried him to his apartment.

00:15:06.054 --> 00:15:07.970 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Even though
he might have been dead.

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:10.000 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: Even though
he may have been dead.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.060 align:middle line:84%
The problem was-- and this
is what always amazes me--

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:17.966 align:middle line:84%
when they found his body, his
back was against the faucets.

00:15:17.966 --> 00:15:18.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't know anyone--

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.923 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Nobody sits with
your back against that.

00:15:20.923 --> 00:15:22.390 align:middle line:90%
The feet are against the faucet.

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:23.306 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Exactly.

00:15:23.306 --> 00:15:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And his back was against it
like he'd been placed there.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:28.690 align:middle line:90%
And then it ended.

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:31.250 align:middle line:84%
But I think there's
a lot of questions.

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:32.790 align:middle line:90%
I don't think Jim's still alive.

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:35.340 align:middle line:84%
But I'm thinking that there
was a heck of a cover up.

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:36.480 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Like they played
around with the way he died.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.521 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Yeah, yeah.

00:15:37.521 --> 00:15:40.640 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What is it about the
American and the human psyche,

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:44.750 align:middle line:84%
Gary, that wants these rock
stars to live on forever?

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:48.580 align:middle line:84%
We want to believe that Jim
Morrison is alive somewhere.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.540 align:middle line:84%
We want to believe that
Eddie and the Cruisers

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:54.430 align:middle line:84%
is still alive, that
Elvis is still alive.

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:57.220 align:middle line:90%
Why won't we let them die?

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:59.220 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: Because
they're too much of a part

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:00.080 align:middle line:90%
of our lives.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.450 align:middle line:84%
If you go back to
ancient Greece?

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:05.930 align:middle line:84%
When a great athlete
died, he was a god.

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:07.750 align:middle line:84%
You didn't have
politicians back then,

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:09.770 align:middle line:90%
but if you had a great general?

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:11.000 align:middle line:90%
He was a god.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And they were thought of
as always living with it.

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:18.190 align:middle line:84%
When you listen to their music,
and it sounds so viable today,

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:20.820 align:middle line:84%
then they're living on in our
consciousness and our memories.

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:23.470 align:middle line:84%
So we just refuse
to let them die.

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:24.410 align:middle line:90%
We think about it.

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:26.250 align:middle line:84%
And if it's a great
story, you know.

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:28.320 align:middle line:84%
And we love conspiracies,
and the idea,

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:31.080 align:middle line:84%
how could Jim Morrison
get out of Paris?

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.406 align:middle line:90%
How can he have faked it?

00:16:32.406 --> 00:16:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard
stories that there

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:36.470 align:middle line:90%
was a look-alike, a German.

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:39.280 align:middle line:84%
I think his name was Dietmer,
and that he looked just

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.040 align:middle line:90%
like Morrison.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And the idea was that this man
had died of the drug overdose,

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:45.560 align:middle line:90%
Morrison had him buried.

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And that way, he was able
to get out of the country.

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:51.530 align:middle line:84%
There were people who swear they
saw Morrison board a plane out

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:54.710 align:middle line:84%
of Paris three days after
his announced death.

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:56.480 align:middle line:90%
So you have all that.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And when Michael Jackson
died, if you remember,

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:02.220 align:middle line:84%
there were people claiming
to have seen Michael Jackson.

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:02.920 align:middle line:90%
It's just--

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:06.589 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Outside of the, or
getting out of the ER area?

00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:07.380 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Yeah.

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:10.569 align:middle line:84%
And walking out and
seeing him amongst people.

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is it
fits the pattern.

00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:16.849 align:middle line:84%
So any time a great rocker
dies, I will guarantee you,

00:17:16.849 --> 00:17:18.970 align:middle line:90%
you'll hear that he faked it.

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:21.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, Morrison, he
had an IQ over 150.

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:24.384 align:middle line:90%
So he was very, very bright.

00:17:24.384 --> 00:17:25.800 align:middle line:84%
So if anybody could
have faked it,

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:26.290 align:middle line:90%
it would have been Morrison.

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:27.706 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Here's
another question.

00:17:27.706 --> 00:17:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Why would anybody want to fake
one's death and end whatever

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:35.359 align:middle line:84%
was going on, and
just give it all up?

00:17:35.359 --> 00:17:37.150 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: What's
the theory with Elvis,

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:39.800 align:middle line:84%
that he had turned in a drug
ring and that the mob was after

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:40.310 align:middle line:90%
him?

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:42.000 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And he
was part of the CIA.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.730 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: Yeah, and that
they protect him with witness

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:44.740 align:middle line:90%
protection.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And then you take the
same thing with Morrison.

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:49.450 align:middle line:90%
Morrison was a poet.

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:51.510 align:middle line:84%
He was tired of
being a rock god.

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:54.780 align:middle line:84%
He went to Paris to write
poetry, serious poetry.

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:56.920 align:middle line:84%
He didn't really like
performing anymore.

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And he tells The Doors
before he leaves,

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:02.300 align:middle line:84%
he said, you know, I can see
myself dropping out, going

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.540 align:middle line:84%
into business, wearing
a three-piece suit.

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:06.340 align:middle line:84%
And just see myself dropping
out of the whole music thing.

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:06.930 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: He wanted a change.

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:07.721 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Yeah.

00:18:07.721 --> 00:18:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And think of the
royalties he collected.

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:10.529 align:middle line:90%
The money was coming in.

00:18:10.529 --> 00:18:13.350 align:middle line:84%
And of course now, the Courson
family and the Morrison family,

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:14.540 align:middle line:90%
I understand, split it.

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:17.793 align:middle line:84%
But there was a great
deal of money coming in.

00:18:17.793 --> 00:18:18.626 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And still.

00:18:18.626 --> 00:18:19.730 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: And still.

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:21.646 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: We've got some
clips of some people.

00:18:21.646 --> 00:18:23.086 align:middle line:90%
And I want to play them for you.

00:18:23.086 --> 00:18:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll talk a little
bit about them, their lives.

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:28.297 align:middle line:84%
Let's look first at Old
Bue Eyes, Frank Sinatra.

00:18:28.297 --> 00:18:30.255 align:middle line:84%
[MUSIC -- FRANK SINATRA, "NEW
 YORK, NEW YORK"]

00:18:30.255 --> 00:19:29.970 align:middle line:90%


00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:34.300 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Nobody had charisma
and presence like he did, Gary.

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:38.310 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: Well he was a rock
star before rock and roll ever

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:39.060 align:middle line:90%
started.

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:41.770 align:middle line:84%
But when it came out,
he hated rock and roll.

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:43.220 align:middle line:90%
And he really condemned it.

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And then he sort
of, eh, Elvis isn't

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.640 align:middle line:84%
so bad after all,
when Elvis came out.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:50.170 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But there were some
who say he got to where he is

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:52.437 align:middle line:90%
and was because of the mob.

00:19:52.437 --> 00:19:53.520 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: Well, I think that
he had many interesting ties,

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:57.600 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard the scene in "The
Godfather" about the horse's

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.650 align:middle line:84%
head was supposed to
be a thing to help--

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:04.720 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Help Frank.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.570 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: --get into the
business and make his name.

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:11.412 align:middle line:84%
And you think about the
ties, the relationships.

00:20:11.412 --> 00:20:12.870 align:middle line:84%
I don't think
there's anything that

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:15.590 align:middle line:84%
says that Frank Sinatra
had anyone killed,

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:16.860 align:middle line:90%
but that he had many friends.

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:18.985 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure there were
very helpful in his career.

00:20:18.985 --> 00:20:20.669 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's no
doubt about that.

00:20:20.669 --> 00:20:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And of course, if you're
going to do Frank,

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:24.600 align:middle line:84%
you may look at the
Kennedy assassination.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:25.660 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:27.359 align:middle line:90%
That could be all tied in.

00:20:27.359 --> 00:20:28.150 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Mmhm.

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:30.326 align:middle line:90%
That would be tied in with that.

00:20:30.326 --> 00:20:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, you say you
can't be that kind of a star.

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And even though he
developed, he was on a star

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:39.700 align:middle line:90%
before he had the mob ties.

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:43.470 align:middle line:84%
But you can't be who he
was and not know everybody.

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:45.490 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: It's true.

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:48.224 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And so he touched
their lives, they touched his.

00:20:48.224 --> 00:20:50.765 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: And maybe you'd
be very thankful for people who

00:20:50.765 --> 00:20:53.744 align:middle line:84%
helped you climb the ladder to
get the success that you had.

00:20:53.744 --> 00:20:55.410 align:middle line:84%
And you wouldn't turn
your back on them.

00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:56.368 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:20:56.368 --> 00:20:57.970 align:middle line:84%
Because the one
thing about Frank is,

00:20:57.970 --> 00:20:59.660 align:middle line:84%
I've heard better
singer singers.

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:02.880 align:middle line:84%
I think Tony Bennett
has a better voice.

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:05.710 align:middle line:84%
But he has amazing
stage presence.

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:09.720 align:middle line:84%
He's got this aura about
him when he was out there.

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.450 align:middle line:84%
I spent some time
looking at old clips

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:15.960 align:middle line:84%
when he was on
Johnny Carson's show.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.540 align:middle line:84%
He was in Saint Louis
performing at a benefit.

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:21.920 align:middle line:84%
So there's some old
YouTube stuff on that.

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:24.830 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't the greatest
singer of all the people.

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:28.952 align:middle line:84%
But he had the charisma
that made him a superstar.

00:21:28.952 --> 00:21:31.410 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: And I think the
word charisma sums it all up.

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:32.993 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of these
rock stars, I mean,

00:21:32.993 --> 00:21:35.240 align:middle line:90%
did Jim Morrison have charisma?

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:36.190 align:middle line:90%
They all did.

one of the greatest voices.

And it saddened me when I
heard that he had passed away.

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:12.570 align:middle line:84%

was in a whole different time

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And before he
started Led Zeppelin,

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:32.430 align:middle line:84%
he played with the
Yardbirds, and actually kept

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:34.390 align:middle line:90%
the name the New Yardbirds.

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:36.350 align:middle line:84%
But what always
amazed me about Page,

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:40.270 align:middle line:84%
he was probably the number one
session guitarist in England.

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And if you listen to Donovan,
like "Hurdy Gurdy Man,"

00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:48.720 align:middle line:84%
and you listen to "Sunshine
Supermam," that's Jimmy Page.

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:52.110 align:middle line:84%
And he had a fabulous
array of sounds.

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:54.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, what makes
Page interesting is

00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:56.190 align:middle line:84%
he had an interest
in the occult.

They could blame us
for that, I guess.

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:22.020 align:middle line:84%
But the whole idea
is that he was--

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:25.470 align:middle line:84%
I guess you could say he was
obsessed with Aleister Crowley.

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And Crowley was probably
a leading figure

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:29.690 align:middle line:90%
of the mid to late '60s.

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And people were fascinates
in the idea magick.

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.730 align:middle line:84%

meant that it was real,

not someone who goes over

00:24:58.548 --> 00:25:01.870 align:middle line:84%
But then, he collected the
ultimate Crowley piece.

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
house that Crowley

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:05.191 align:middle line:90%
lived in called Boleskin.

>> PATTERSON: He
bought the house.

00:25:07.856 --> 00:25:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And the house had
a great history.

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:11.940 align:middle line:84%
It was built in
the medieval age.

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:16.230 align:middle line:84%
It was built on the spot where
an entire church was burned

00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:19.250 align:middle line:84%
to the ground with
all its people in it.

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And then the house was
built on top of that.

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And bad luck happened to
people who owned this house.

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:26.910 align:middle line:84%
There were stories of a man
trying to kill his family,

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:28.270 align:middle line:90%
like in "The Shining."

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:31.250 align:middle line:84%

after writing out a list.

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:32.680 align:middle line:84%

madness filled it.

>> NOORY: Evil.

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.031 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: And when
Crowley lived there,

00:25:35.031 --> 00:25:37.130 align:middle line:84%
the story goes that one
of the rooms was so dark,

00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:40.110 align:middle line:84%
you couldn't illuminate
it with light.

00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And a story goes that "The Book
of the Law" was lost there,

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:44.640 align:middle line:90%
some of it was written there.

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And when Crowley left and he
died-- I think it was in 1947--

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:53.940 align:middle line:84%
the house went through a series
of other, I guess you'd say,

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:56.070 align:middle line:90%
owners who had terrible luck.

00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:58.940 align:middle line:84%
So when it went up on
auction, Page bought it.

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:02.910 align:middle line:84%
But the story goes that he
didn't spend the night there.

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:03.535 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Ever?

>> PATTERSON: That's
what I understand.

00:26:05.159 --> 00:26:06.960 align:middle line:84%
We did an interview
with Malcolm Dent,

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.640 align:middle line:90%
who was the groundskeeper.

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.790 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I wonder how
soon he died after that.

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:16.740 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: Well, to tell you
the truth, Page sold the house.

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And Bonham died
shortly afterwards

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:21.820 align:middle line:90%
in his house in Windsor.

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:23.740 align:middle line:90%
But not at Boleskin House.

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And if you watch the movie,
"The Song Remains The Same,"

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:27.820 align:middle line:90%
you can see the house.

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And you can see Page
climbing the mountain top

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:33.610 align:middle line:84%
to see the old man-- the old
hermit-- in the tarot deck.

00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:35.470 align:middle line:90%
So you had that.

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And then you had a curse
that was placed on Jimmy Page

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:42.040 align:middle line:84%
and Zeppelin that
affected its members.

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:45.870 align:middle line:84%
So I think that John Paul
Jones broke his left hand

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:47.610 align:middle line:90%
and they had to cancel the tour.

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:49.530 align:middle line:84%
John Bonham had a
number of car accidents.

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:53.420 align:middle line:90%
It was terrible.

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:55.360 align:middle line:84%
He had an accident
in Rhodes also.

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And when he did the album
"Presence," the story goes,

00:26:57.650 --> 00:26:59.330 align:middle line:84%
he was in a wheelchair
as he sang it.

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:01.110 align:middle line:90%
But nothing touched Jimmy Page.

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:02.460 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he passed 27.

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:04.370 align:middle line:90%
And he's still alive today.

00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And he's playing
some great music.

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:10.407 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And he still has
remained scot-free from many

00:27:10.407 --> 00:27:11.656 align:middle line:90%
curses, or anything like that?

00:27:11.656 --> 00:27:12.739 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: That's true.

00:27:12.739 --> 00:27:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And people say, well,
that's just because he

00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:17.890 align:middle line:84%
has such a knowledge of
the certain skills that he

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:19.600 align:middle line:90%
was able to bypass it.

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not sure
they're curses.

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.920 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're just
strange happenstance.

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:28.010 align:middle line:84%
But at that time, I'm sure that
if you were in Led Zeppelin,

00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:29.300 align:middle line:90%
you would wonder.

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you have
the famous backward track

00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:34.930 align:middle line:84%

an abandoned workhouse where

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:42.240 align:middle line:84%
a number of people had to
work, the working poor.

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:44.042 align:middle line:90%
And they died there.

00:27:44.042 --> 00:27:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think Jimmy Page
said in an article

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:47.166 align:middle line:84%
that he actually

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:51.000 align:middle line:90%
to where he was?

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: What
a great story.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.580 align:middle line:84%
When Robert Johnson was
living in the delta,

00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:58.680 align:middle line:84%
he was probably the worst
guitar player there.

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:02.180 align:middle line:84%
And all the old blues men
would dodge him, the Son House

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:03.400 align:middle line:90%
and the others.

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And Johnson disappeared
for maybe six months.

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And when he came back, he was
probably the hottest guitar

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:11.570 align:middle line:90%
player there.

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:12.270 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Just like that?

00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:13.050 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: Just like that.

00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:14.508 align:middle line:84%
Now let me tell
you, I play guitar.

00:29:14.508 --> 00:29:16.050 align:middle line:84%
Six months is
almost unbelievable

00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:18.590 align:middle line:90%
to learn to be that proficient.

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And it was Son House who turned
to the others and said, hey,

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:23.830 align:middle line:84%
he sold his soul
to play like that.

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:25.250 align:middle line:90%
And then he was great.

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And people would come to
see him in the roadhouses.

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:31.150 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure, having a
cataract on one of his eyes,

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:33.870 align:middle line:84%
that when he would hold his head
down and his eye would glow,

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:34.370 align:middle line:90%
the people--

00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:35.440 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They didn't have
surgery in those days.

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:35.530 align:middle line:90%
>> PATTERSON: No.

00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:37.250 align:middle line:84%
And the people noticed, oh
my gosh, look at his eye.

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:38.310 align:middle line:90%
It's the evil eye.

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:41.479 align:middle line:84%
And when he would play licks,
he would turn his back.

00:29:41.479 --> 00:29:43.270 align:middle line:84%
Because he didn't want
other guitar players

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:45.360 align:middle line:90%
to steal his technique.

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:47.620 align:middle line:84%
But they thought, oh, he
has something to hide.

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:49.130 align:middle line:84%
Because they
believed, the legend

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:51.880 align:middle line:84%
said that when you went
to the crossroads right

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:56.920 align:middle line:84%
outside Clarksdale, and
you offered up your soul,

00:29:56.920 --> 00:30:00.560 align:middle line:84%
you felt the presence of this
huge black man behind you.

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:03.230 align:middle line:84%
But you did not want to
turn and look at him.

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:05.860 align:middle line:84%
So you handed your guitar
over your shoulder.

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And then you would hear this
man tune it to a special tuning.

00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:13.030 align:middle line:84%
And when he handed it
back over your shoulder,

00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:14.500 align:middle line:90%
the deal was made.

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And what you would
gain, you would

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:19.020 align:middle line:84%
gain the power to
play the blues.

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:21.240 align:middle line:84%
You would have the
effects of all the women

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:22.182 align:middle line:90%
that you could choose.

00:30:22.182 --> 00:30:23.390 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Until the day came.

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:24.470 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON:
Until the day came.

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:25.520 align:middle line:90%
And it was a short day.

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's why when Robert
Johnson was in his last juke

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:31.890 align:middle line:84%
joint, and he drank from an
open bottle of whiskey that

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:35.780 align:middle line:84%
had been laced with strychnine,
it took him three days to die.

00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:39.350 align:middle line:84%
And he died on his hands and
knees howling like a dog.

00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:44.240 align:middle line:84%
And that story was
fascinating to Jimmy Page.

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:47.050 align:middle line:84%
It was fascinating
to Robert Plant,

00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:50.410 align:middle line:84%
to Keith Richards of the Rolling
Stones, and Eric Clapton.

00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:53.490 align:middle line:84%
They got into the music
because of the legend.

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:55.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, did he really
sell his soul?

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:59.400 align:middle line:84%
Robert Johnson never stated that
he made a deal with the devil.

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:02.680 align:middle line:84%
But there was another
Johnson, Ledell Johnson,

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:05.567 align:middle line:84%
who claimed that his
brother, Tommy, had actually

00:31:05.567 --> 00:31:06.900 align:middle line:90%
sold his soul to the crossroads.

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And if you see the movie "Oh
Brother, Where Art Thou?,"

00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:12.421 align:middle line:84%
they pick up this
black musician.

00:31:12.421 --> 00:31:13.670 align:middle line:90%
And they said, what are doing?

00:31:13.670 --> 00:31:15.440 align:middle line:84%
He said, I just sold
my soul to the devil.

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:17.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, that was the
story of Tommy Johnson.

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:19.040 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And so many
of them probably have.

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:21.150 align:middle line:84%
Gary, thank you for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:23.233 align:middle line:84%
>> PATTERSON: Always great
to be with you, George.

00:31:23.233 --> 00:31:24.710 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: R. Gary Page.

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:26.660 align:middle line:84%
Make sure you look
at some of his work,

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:28.750 align:middle line:90%
it's simply fantastic.

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:31.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:47.734 align:middle line:90%
