00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: What
is orgone energy?

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE HOOD: Orgone
energy is the layering

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.250 align:middle line:84%
of organic and inorganic
materials, which

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:24.190 align:middle line:84%
somehow harnesses chi
force or etheric energy.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How did you begin
to build things like this

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.140 align:middle line:90%
and realize they work?

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: I didn't
know they work.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.920 align:middle line:84%
So I had to buy a meter
to find out that they did.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:34.720 align:middle line:90%
And I just--

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.860 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What did
the meter show you?

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.568 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: The meter
showed me that when

00:00:37.568 --> 00:00:41.620 align:middle line:84%
I put the pyramid in between
the Wi-Fi or electronics,

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.535 align:middle line:90%
the microwaves were reduced.

00:00:43.535 --> 00:00:44.335 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Really?

00:00:44.335 --> 00:00:49.650 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:50.850 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.670 align:middle line:10%
Our guest, Michelle Hood, is
a photographer, artist, owner

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.630 align:middle line:10%
of LitetheLight.com, making
orgone energy pyramids.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.120 align:middle line:84%
we're going to show you
them and other tools

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.820 align:middle line:84%
for restoring harmonic balance
to the planet and all living

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:04.620 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.160 align:middle line:84%
Michelle, welcome
to the program.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.060 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: Thank you, George.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.560 align:middle line:84%
It's such an honor
to be here with you.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.227 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: We're going
to get into these,

00:01:10.227 --> 00:01:11.920 align:middle line:84%
but these things
are simply gorgeous.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.837 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: Thank you.

00:01:12.837 --> 00:01:15.045 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How long does it
take to make one of these?

00:01:15.045 --> 00:01:16.379 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: It depends on a lot.

00:01:16.379 --> 00:01:17.880 align:middle line:10%
There's a lot of
factors that can

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.250 align:middle line:10%
add to that--
intricacy, temperature.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.820 align:middle line:10%
But six days to three
weeks, depending.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I used to have a
friend in school, grade school.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.360 align:middle line:84%
He used to come to school
wearing a pyramid hat.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And he claimed that it
helped him in his studies.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.360 align:middle line:90%
He was an A student.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: Well, maybe.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Who can
doubt it, right?

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: I don't know.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:39.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Pyramid
power, he called it.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:40.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: I slept on books.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.390 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.260 align:middle line:84%
I felt that that was
a good way to go.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.510 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: What is orgone energy?

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.420 align:middle line:10%
>>MICHELLE: Orgone energy
is the layering of organic

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.570 align:middle line:10%
and inorganic materials, which
somehow harnesses chi force--

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.420 align:middle line:10%
like Star Wars--
or etheric energy.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.440 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, the layering
masculine feminine, the yin

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.470 align:middle line:84%
and yang symbol also kind
of display this energy.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.150 align:middle line:90%
There's kind of a swoosh to it.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.687 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Where
did it come from?

00:02:07.687 --> 00:02:09.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: It's
everywhere around us.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.289 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Always has been?

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: Always has been.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How did you
get involved in this?

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.703 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: I started paying
attention to the frequencies

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:18.870 align:middle line:84%
coming through the cell
towers, and the high pitched

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.610 align:middle line:84%
frequencies in my ears,
and the sonar going on--

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:22.410 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Not good.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.535 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: --in the ocean.

00:02:23.535 --> 00:02:27.315 align:middle line:84%
And someone mentioned to me
that they throw these pyramids--

00:02:27.315 --> 00:02:30.423 align:middle line:84%
orgonite, they used to
call them-- in the ocean

00:02:30.423 --> 00:02:31.590 align:middle line:90%
and the dolphins would come.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.870 align:middle line:84%
So I realized there
was some generation

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.690 align:middle line:84%
of harmonic frequencies
with these devices.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Are there
frequencies all around us?

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.087 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: Well,
we're surrounded

00:02:40.087 --> 00:02:43.080 align:middle line:84%
by cell towers and
satellites and electronics

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.470 align:middle line:90%
and all kinds of things.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.770 align:middle line:84%
Everything generates
a frequency.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.200 align:middle line:90%
The Muir Woods, the Redwoods--

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Isn't that
interference, though?

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.570 align:middle line:90%
Cell towers, 5G, all that stuff?

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.582 align:middle line:90%
How does this work?

00:02:54.582 --> 00:02:56.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: Well, when you
put the crystals in resin,

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.940 align:middle line:84%
as the resin hardens,
it squeezes the crystal

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.130 align:middle line:84%
and locks it in an
amplified state.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.430 align:middle line:84%
So the crystals, like the volume
of a speaker, is turned on high

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.630 align:middle line:90%
and just left there.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.480 align:middle line:84%
And you add other
inorganic materials,

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.310 align:middle line:90%
which for me work as metals.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.240 align:middle line:84%
And the combination of
the organic crystals,

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.380 align:middle line:84%
the metals with the adhesion
of the resin, makes the orgone.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.820 align:middle line:90%
At least it seems to work.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.520 align:middle line:84%
I have meters that
tell me it does.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Now, there seems
to be different things

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.650 align:middle line:90%
within each pyramid.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.325 align:middle line:90%
Do they do different things?

00:03:30.325 --> 00:03:31.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: Well you
must have a quartz

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.630 align:middle line:90%
for the piezoelectric effect.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.408 align:middle line:84%
It can be quartz,
amethyst, or citrine.

00:03:35.408 --> 00:03:37.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: That's what
we see inside, right?

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.517 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: Those
are the main stones.

00:03:39.517 --> 00:03:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
adding other stones

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.400 align:middle line:84%
for their spiritual, etheric,
psychological and healing

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.240 align:middle line:90%
benefits.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.130 align:middle line:84%
I felt that adding
those stones not only

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.080 align:middle line:84%
added to the beauty
of the pieces,

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.870 align:middle line:84%
but it added to the depth
of frequencies available.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:55.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Can I
hold one of these?

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: Sure.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.060 align:middle line:90%
Which one would you like?

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.060 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: You just pick.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: This one.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:01.740 align:middle line:90%
That's a pretty intricate one.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: So how
would you use this?

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: First,
originally made these two

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.690 align:middle line:84%
because I felt that there
was a war on creation.

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to create
beautiful things

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.450 align:middle line:84%
that people, whether they
understood what was happening

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.223 align:middle line:84%
or not, would be
attracted to these

00:04:17.223 --> 00:04:18.390 align:middle line:90%
and have them in their home.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.807 align:middle line:84%
And it would raise
the frequencies

00:04:19.807 --> 00:04:21.300 align:middle line:84%
of their environment,
and therefore

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.290 align:middle line:90%
raise their frequencies.

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.280 align:middle line:84%
So people can put them
in front of the Wi-Fi.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.500 align:middle line:84%
They can put them in
front of their computer.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.502 align:middle line:84%
If you notice
sometimes when you're

00:04:30.502 --> 00:04:32.460 align:middle line:84%
sitting in front of the
computer too long, what

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.085 align:middle line:84%
happens to me is my heart
chakra tends to collapse.

00:04:36.085 --> 00:04:36.885 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Really?

00:04:36.885 --> 00:04:39.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: So if you put
something-- because we're not

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.080 align:middle line:90%
used to the blue light.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.430 align:middle line:84%
That's a whole new
introduction to our field.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.085 align:middle line:84%
So we want to put
something in between.

00:04:44.085 --> 00:04:45.502 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Do you
get palpitations?

00:04:45.502 --> 00:04:47.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: No, but
I have bad posture.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.540 align:middle line:84%
So I'm realizing my energy
field is being disturbed.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.500 align:middle line:84%
So in front of your computer,
people put them in their room.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.650 align:middle line:84%
Some find them too much
so they can't sleep.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.950 align:middle line:84%
Other people write to me
that they sleep better.

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.020 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of
ways to use these.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You're telling
us more about orgon energy.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.650 align:middle line:90%
Or you call it orgone?

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:09.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: Orgone.

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.580 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Is that positive
or negative for people?

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: Well, it could
be orgon too, by the way.

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.740 align:middle line:84%
I have not found it to
be negative for anyone.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.030 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: It's all good stuff?

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.988 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: I think so.

00:05:18.988 --> 00:05:20.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: James Demeo,
do you know him?

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.765 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: I don't know
him, but I have his books.

00:05:22.765 --> 00:05:25.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: He's founder of the
Orgone Biophysical Research

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.160 align:middle line:84%
Lab, talks about some of
this with Regina Meredith.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: OK.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.355 align:middle line:84%
>>JAMES DEMEO: You're
talking about something

00:05:32.355 --> 00:05:33.840 align:middle line:90%
that's in the atmosphere.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.110 align:middle line:10%
But after you exclude
all of the atmosphere,

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.680 align:middle line:10%
exclude all the molecules of
air, something is in there.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.450 align:middle line:10%
Now, Reich was one
of the first people

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.390 align:middle line:10%
to point out that the
Earth has an energy

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.260 align:middle line:10%
field, what he called the orgone
energy envelope of the Earth.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:55.080 align:middle line:10%
And he pointed to this long
before the astronauts came back

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.140 align:middle line:10%
with pictures of the Earth
showing that it has this blue--

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.780 align:middle line:10%


00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.570 align:middle line:10%
the blue aura of the
Earth, if you will.

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.755 align:middle line:10%
And today, of course--

00:06:05.755 --> 00:06:06.630 align:middle line:10%
well, let me back up.

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.660 align:middle line:10%
During Reich's time, the
theory was that space

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.272 align:middle line:10%
was empty, totally empty space.

00:06:12.272 --> 00:06:13.730 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
It was a vacuum.

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:14.530 align:middle line:10%
Truly a vacuum.

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.590 align:middle line:10%
>>JAMES: It was totally
a vacuum of emptiness.

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.230 align:middle line:10%
Now, if you go back
100 years earlier,

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:21.280 align:middle line:10%
they talked about
the ether of space.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.950 align:middle line:10%
But that was done away with.

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:26.010 align:middle line:10%
Then in Reich's time, you
had Einstein's theory,

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:30.600 align:middle line:10%
and all of the empty space
theory, which was very popular.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.910 align:middle line:10%
Today, they're getting
back to the idea

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.190 align:middle line:10%
that there must be
something out there.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:39.000 align:middle line:10%
And it's given the name dark
matter or the neutrino sea

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.100 align:middle line:10%
or the interstellar media.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.740 align:middle line:10%
They have all different
kinds of terms for something

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:49.410 align:middle line:10%
is out there beyond just
merely ions or magnetic fields.

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:53.610 align:middle line:10%
But ions and magnetic fields
and electrical fields combined.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.640 align:middle line:10%
They talk about the
plasma of space.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.850 align:middle line:10%
And that gets closer,
but I don't think--

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:03.060 align:middle line:10%
one of the criticisms of that
from the classical, narrow

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.470 align:middle line:10%
minds is that there's not
enough ions or magnetic field

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.760 align:middle line:10%
or electric field to really
count for a true plasma.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.620 align:middle line:10%
But nevertheless, there's
all kinds of stuff

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.050 align:middle line:10%
you can see out in space
that behaves like a plasma.

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:18.150 align:middle line:10%
So what's going on?

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.290 align:middle line:10%
I think is its orgone energy.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:22.530 align:middle line:10%
It's the same energy
that Reich discovered.

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:26.830 align:middle line:10%
It has components of a plasma,
but it's not exactly that.

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.560 align:middle line:10%
It's something that's
a little bit more--

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.530 align:middle line:10%
it's a life energy.

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:33.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Michelle, how do
we tap into this energy?

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.850 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems
to me if you can,

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:37.140 align:middle line:90%
do incredible things with it.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:41.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: Nature, meditation,
focus, orgone pyramids.

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:42.587 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Pyramids.

00:07:42.587 --> 00:07:43.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: All kinds of things.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:48.090 align:middle line:84%
Orgone is just the
layering-- inorganic layering

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:50.270 align:middle line:90%
of materials.

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.500 align:middle line:84%
Reich's orgone
accumulators were that.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.910 align:middle line:84%
He created these boxes that
seemed to harness the chi,

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:58.860 align:middle line:90%
but crystals do that very well.

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Edgar Cayce,
the late American prophet,

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:04.900 align:middle line:84%
said if you put a cold coin--
that's what he called it,

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:08.010 align:middle line:84%
it's a piece of
some kind of metal--

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:14.130 align:middle line:84%
in your pocket, it will prevent
illnesses, diseases, colds,

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:16.290 align:middle line:90%
all kinds of afflictions.

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:20.848 align:middle line:84%
If he's correct, what
has he tapped into?

00:08:20.848 --> 00:08:22.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: Maybe it's
just the frequencies

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.420 align:middle line:84%
of that and your
energetic field,

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:29.880 align:middle line:84%
or your morphogenic field
accesses extra frequencies

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:30.680 align:middle line:90%
to block things.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.409 align:middle line:90%
I'm not an expert on that.

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:36.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Your artwork
is very unique.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.710 align:middle line:84%
How did you begin to
build things like this

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:42.640 align:middle line:90%
and realize they work?

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: I
started as a hobby.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.110 align:middle line:84%
I researched orgone
energy for one year

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.900 align:middle line:84%
and how to make these and
all the different things.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.350 align:middle line:90%
I started making them.

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:54.230 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know they worked.

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:56.510 align:middle line:84%
So I had to buy a meter
to find out that they did.

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:57.310 align:middle line:90%
And I just--

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:58.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Then what
did the meter show you?

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:00.158 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: The meter
showed me that when

00:09:00.158 --> 00:09:04.210 align:middle line:84%
I put the pyramid in between
the Wi-Fi or electronics,

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.350 align:middle line:90%
the microwaves were reduced.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:07.150 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Really?

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:08.942 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: From maybe
7 to 1 on the meter.

00:09:08.942 --> 00:09:10.210 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: They absorb it?

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:11.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: They do something.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:12.760 align:middle line:90%
They block it, they absorb it.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:16.270 align:middle line:84%
When you have frequencies,
a high frequency

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:18.730 align:middle line:84%
comes into contact
with a low frequency,

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:20.620 align:middle line:84%
the high frequency
doesn't come down.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.090 align:middle line:90%
The low frequency comes up.

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:23.673 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What do
you think, Michelle,

00:09:23.673 --> 00:09:26.320 align:middle line:84%
is the significance
of the pyramid shape?

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.003 align:middle line:90%
Why does that seem to work?

00:09:29.003 --> 00:09:30.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: When I first
started making these,

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.870 align:middle line:84%
I just knew that it
had to be a pyramid.

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.720 align:middle line:84%
I did not-- there was
no other option for me.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.150 align:middle line:84%
Just, I'm going to
do this as a pyramid.

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:40.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Well, that
was a smart move.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: But I have learned
that, well, pyramids there's

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:47.990 align:middle line:84%
a clockwise spiral vortex of
energy coming out of the apex.

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:51.890 align:middle line:84%
And all the sides emit
powerful energies as well.

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:55.460 align:middle line:84%
I think pyramids tap
in somehow to the Earth

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:58.550 align:middle line:84%
and amplify what's inside
them, what's above,

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:01.250 align:middle line:84%
and the combination of
that in all directions.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:03.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Now, how did you
know about the pyramid shape

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.210 align:middle line:90%
and that it works?

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:07.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: It was instinctual
knowing about the pyramid

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:08.440 align:middle line:90%
shape.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.490 align:middle line:84%
I just knew it had
to be a pyramid.

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I did
go to Egypt and did

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:14.780 align:middle line:90%
experience the Great Pyramid.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:18.050 align:middle line:84%
So that's where I can speak
that all the sides definitely

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:20.545 align:middle line:84%
emanate a magical
and powerful energy.

00:10:20.545 --> 00:10:22.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: The ancients
knew about that.

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:25.350 align:middle line:84%
Let me see the
turquoise one, Michelle.

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:27.750 align:middle line:90%
And what's in here, crystals?

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:31.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: That is an
aqua aura quartz, celestite

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.580 align:middle line:90%
and Madagascar apatite.

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:35.600 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: What?

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.400 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: Yeah.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Just there's three different
combinations of stones,

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:44.750 align:middle line:84%
so it would be a very elestial,
high spiritual and manifesting

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:45.560 align:middle line:90%
pyramid.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.018 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Would it
behoove somebody

00:10:47.018 --> 00:10:50.207 align:middle line:84%
to put one by their
nightstand, by their bed?

00:10:50.207 --> 00:10:51.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: Not everybody.

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:52.490 align:middle line:90%
Some people do well.

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:54.680 align:middle line:84%
Some people are
sensitive to the energies

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.180 align:middle line:90%
and it's better in another room.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:57.110 align:middle line:90%
Everyone's unique.

00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:58.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Because
I had heard not

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:02.815 align:middle line:84%
to put your cell phone close to
your head when you're sleeping.

00:11:02.815 --> 00:11:04.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: Yeah,
do not do that.

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:05.855 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Will this negate that?

00:11:05.855 --> 00:11:06.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: It should help.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:08.550 align:middle line:90%
It should definitely help.

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:11.090 align:middle line:84%
In fact, base to body
with these pyramids--

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:13.970 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: There you go.

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:16.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: People
find incredible--

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:19.710 align:middle line:84%
I get testimonials every week
of people using the pyramids

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:20.510 align:middle line:90%
on their bodies.

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:22.220 align:middle line:90%
I have healers and doctors.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:25.527 align:middle line:84%
I make chakra sets,
and they write to me

00:11:25.527 --> 00:11:26.360 align:middle line:90%
that they love them.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.330 align:middle line:84%
They bring the people into
a parasympathetic state,

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.490 align:middle line:84%
so that their healing
or their energy work

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:34.592 align:middle line:84%
can begin much sooner,
quicker, and more effective.

00:11:34.592 --> 00:11:36.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Are there
different kinds

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:38.970 align:middle line:84%
of crystals for different
kinds of things?

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:39.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: Yes.

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:44.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, every crystal has a
unique signature frequency.

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:46.740 align:middle line:90%
Individually, by the way.

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And then, as a group,
quartz crystals

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.140 align:middle line:84%
are considered the
master healers.

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:54.380 align:middle line:84%
Black tourmaline is considered
good for psychic protection

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.130 align:middle line:90%
and grounding.

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:57.653 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Are they
good for healing?

00:11:57.653 --> 00:11:58.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: All of them are.

00:11:58.820 --> 00:11:59.653 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: All right.

00:11:59.653 --> 00:12:02.090 align:middle line:84%
Theresa Bullard in Gaia's
"Mystery Teachings"

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:03.410 align:middle line:90%
talks about that.

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:04.910 align:middle line:10%
>>THERESA BULLARD:
When light enters

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:07.940 align:middle line:10%
a medium that is different
from the density of air,

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:10.700 align:middle line:10%
it will bend or refract.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:13.190 align:middle line:84%
We've seen how light
travels through a prism,

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:16.040 align:middle line:84%
for example, which
is a type of crystal,

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:18.830 align:middle line:84%
and that white light
is in refracted out

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:21.980 align:middle line:90%
into a rainbow of colors.

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:25.340 align:middle line:84%
And different crystals will do
different things with the light

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:28.110 align:middle line:90%
as it passes through.

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:32.010 align:middle line:84%
So how does this relate to
using crystals for healing work?

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:34.820 align:middle line:84%
When we're working with
crystals for healing,

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:37.880 align:middle line:84%
we're sending a form
of light through them.

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.190 align:middle line:84%
It's a spiritual
light, or light that

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:44.390 align:middle line:84%
is based on life force
energy and conscious intent.

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:47.150 align:middle line:84%
You can think of it
as a ray of vibration

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:50.360 align:middle line:84%
at a higher frequency
level than visible light.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And that crystal takes that
energy in and then does

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:55.550 align:middle line:90%
something with it.

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:58.070 align:middle line:84%
It may color it,
it may amplify it,

00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:01.730 align:middle line:84%
or it might refract it in a
certain way to spread it out.

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:05.483 align:middle line:84%
Different crystals will
work in different ways.

00:13:05.483 --> 00:13:07.650 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I think, Michelle,
you're on to something.

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:11.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: Well, crystals
are windows to dimensional--

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:13.440 align:middle line:90%
higher dimensional frequencies.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.660 align:middle line:84%
They are transmitters
and receivers.

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And used in this way,
they're amplified.

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:21.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: We used to use
them in old time radios.

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: They think--
don't they still?

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.780 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: In some cases, yeah.

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:27.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, now everything's
chips and computerized,

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:29.868 align:middle line:90%
but they work.

00:13:29.868 --> 00:13:30.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: They do work.

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:32.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You've
got a big pyramid,

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:33.220 align:middle line:90%
you've got a small pyramid.

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:35.140 align:middle line:84%
Is there a difference
in terms of what

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:37.900 align:middle line:90%
they do because of their size?

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:40.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: Bigger definitely
has a larger output,

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:42.670 align:middle line:84%
but not everyone
needs a giant pyramid.

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:44.830 align:middle line:84%
Some people do very
well with smaller ones.

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:47.223 align:middle line:84%
I have four different sizes,
maybe five different sizes.

00:13:47.223 --> 00:13:48.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Even
smaller than these?

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:49.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: Even smaller.

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:51.340 align:middle line:90%
They're good little travel ones.

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:53.570 align:middle line:90%
They're good for on the body.

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What about
electromagnetic frequency?

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:58.010 align:middle line:90%
Good or bad for us?

00:13:58.010 --> 00:13:59.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: It depends on which.

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:03.020 align:middle line:84%
Depends on what
distortion it is.

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:04.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Explain that.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:07.190 align:middle line:10%
>>MICHELLE: Well, cell phone
towers will never have birds

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:09.050 align:middle line:10%
on them, but telephone lines--

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:11.420 align:middle line:10%
which driving here, saw again--

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:12.540 align:middle line:10%
have birds on them.

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:16.253 align:middle line:84%
So if the animals know, maybe
they're telling us something.

00:14:16.253 --> 00:14:18.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Teach them
about windmills, however.

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:20.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: Yeah, no,
they don't like that.

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:24.785 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: So when you have
something like this with you,

00:14:24.785 --> 00:14:27.170 align:middle line:84%
can you have a small one
and put it in your pocket?

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:28.263 align:middle line:90%
Or is it too pointy?

00:14:28.263 --> 00:14:29.180 align:middle line:90%
Would it hurt you or--

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:30.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: I think
it's too pointy,

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:33.110 align:middle line:84%
but you could maybe keep
one around you in the car.

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:36.260 align:middle line:84%
I make pendants also,
but a lot of people

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.827 align:middle line:90%
make different pendants.

00:14:38.827 --> 00:14:40.410 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds
of things people can

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:41.820 align:middle line:90%
use this is just one option.

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:45.660 align:middle line:84%
I consider these pyramids
in particular made also

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:47.910 align:middle line:90%
for spiritual awakening.

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:51.387 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Is there a
danger of too much EMFs?

00:14:51.387 --> 00:14:52.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: Too much EMFs?

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:53.880 align:middle line:90%
I think so, yeah.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.167 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: I think so, too.

00:14:55.167 --> 00:14:57.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: Yeah, I think we're
being bombarded by satellites.

00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:59.083 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: What does it do to us?

00:14:59.083 --> 00:15:00.960 align:middle line:90%
Does it play with our brains?

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:01.967 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:15:01.967 --> 00:15:03.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: All kinds of things.

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:07.140 align:middle line:84%
I just think it's not great
for cellular harmonics.

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:10.950 align:middle line:84%
If trees don't like to
grow nearer a lot of this,

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:13.380 align:middle line:84%
why would cellular
structure of the humans?

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:15.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Well, let's talk
just about that from Gaia's

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:19.620 align:middle line:90%
E-Motion health program.

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:23.280 align:middle line:84%
>> In 2006, we lost,
in some countries,

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.717 align:middle line:90%
70% of all our honeybees.

00:15:25.717 --> 00:15:27.300 align:middle line:10%
Everyone was trying
to work out what's

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:28.350 align:middle line:10%
happened to all our honeybees.

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:30.058 align:middle line:84%
I mean, honeybees are
essential for life.

00:15:30.058 --> 00:15:30.930 align:middle line:90%
We know this, guys.

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:33.270 align:middle line:84%
They pollinate all our
nuts and our seeds.

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:36.030 align:middle line:84%
But what one guy worked
out, he put these eight--

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:37.575 align:middle line:90%
set up these eight beehives.

00:15:37.575 --> 00:15:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And he put a deck phone
in five of the hives.

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:41.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, a deck phone is,
like, a cordless phone.

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:42.780 align:middle line:84%
You know, like in
your home when you're

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:43.950 align:middle line:90%
talking on a cordless phone?

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:46.770 align:middle line:84%
So he put these deck phones,
right, in five hives.

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And those five hives
that had the deck

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:52.080 align:middle line:84%
phones, 90% of the bees did
not return back to the hive.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And then one of the hives,
not one single bee returned,

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:57.030 align:middle line:90%
which is very alarming.

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:59.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, next to that was
another three hives.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And in those three hives,
all the bees came back.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:06.570 align:middle line:84%
Bees basically navigate with
electromagnetic frequencies.

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:09.780 align:middle line:84%
In the last 30 years, we
have flooded this planet

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:11.822 align:middle line:90%
with man-made EMFs.

00:16:11.822 --> 00:16:14.280 align:middle line:84%
All these new electromagnetic
fields in the air and the bee

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.260 align:middle line:84%
can't navigate back
to its little hive.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And the bee doesn't
know where it's going.

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.630 align:middle line:84%
Who knows where
the bee is going?

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:20.200 align:middle line:84%
But the bees aren't
there anymore.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And so we know it's
affecting nature.

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:24.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's take it
another step further.

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:28.440 align:middle line:84%
We know that EMFs are
affecting our bodies

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.360 align:middle line:84%
because the microwaves
that are being sent

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:32.880 align:middle line:84%
from the mobile phone tower
to your phone, that are then

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.400 align:middle line:84%
going through your skull
and affecting your brain

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.420 align:middle line:90%
are affecting your melatonin.

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:42.340 align:middle line:84%
Melatonin is the body's
most powerful antioxidant.

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:44.610 align:middle line:84%
It's five times more
powerful than vitamin C.

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:47.790 align:middle line:84%
It's twice as powerful as
vitamin E. What melatonin does

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:49.920 align:middle line:84%
in your brain is when it
detects that you're asleep

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.578 align:middle line:84%
and there's no light around,
when your cells are recreating

00:16:52.578 --> 00:16:54.870 align:middle line:84%
at night, there's a waste
product called free radicals.

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:56.537 align:middle line:84%
And the melatonin
basically goes through

00:16:56.537 --> 00:16:58.560 align:middle line:84%
and flushes all your
free radicals out so

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.450 align:middle line:84%
that you have healthy
cell reproduction.

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:02.040 align:middle line:90%
That's what melatonin does.

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And when you're talking
on your phone all the time

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.772 align:middle line:84%
and you've got this phone on
your head day and day out,

00:17:06.772 --> 00:17:08.730 align:middle line:84%
you're actually affecting
your melatonin, guys.

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:10.680 align:middle line:90%
And that's a very serious thing.

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:13.859 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies are in sync with
the natural EMFs of the Earth.

00:17:13.859 --> 00:17:17.040 align:middle line:84%
Now we've introduced
all these man-made EMFs

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.430 align:middle line:84%
with all the cell phone towers,
radio waves, microwaves,

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:21.838 align:middle line:90%
wireless, satellites.

00:17:21.838 --> 00:17:23.630 align:middle line:84%
What do you think the
satellites are doing?

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:25.589 align:middle line:90%
They're beaming down EMFs on us.

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:27.000 align:middle line:90%
You can't avoid it.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: He's spot
on, Michelle, isn't he?

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:29.610 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: Yes, he is.

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:30.410 align:middle line:90%
I agree with him.

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:32.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Now you just
said you can't avoid it.

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:34.225 align:middle line:90%
Does that mean we're doomed?

00:17:34.225 --> 00:17:35.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: I don't
think we're doomed,

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:38.250 align:middle line:84%
but there's a way to
bring into balance.

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:42.180 align:middle line:84%
We have to adjust somehow,
but we-- doing it all at once

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:43.793 align:middle line:90%
can be difficult for the body.

00:17:43.793 --> 00:17:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: But we can't all
walk around with pyramids

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:46.440 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.482 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: No, we can't.

00:17:47.482 --> 00:17:48.990 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: So what do you do?

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:50.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: I stay home.

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:51.860 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: You stay home?

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:53.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: I work with
these all the time.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm around pyramids
all the time.

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.030 align:middle line:90%
It's good to go out in it.

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:57.900 align:middle line:90%
We have to.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.630 align:middle line:84%
They did a study with these
chickens that were only

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:03.330 align:middle line:84%
in a harmonic state, and
when they did release them,

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:04.170 align:middle line:90%
they didn't do well.

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:06.270 align:middle line:84%
But the chickens that
would come in and out

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:09.540 align:middle line:84%
of the pen that was in a
harmonic state did much better.

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:12.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What is the
light gridding project?

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:17.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: I decided to place
large pyramids like this--

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:18.090 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Like this one?

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:19.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: --like this one--

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.570 align:middle line:84%
in a few places
around the planet

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:22.980 align:middle line:90%
to help with the Earth changes.

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:24.720 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How did
you get them there?

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: It was
finding the right people.

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:27.450 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Are they hidden?

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:28.742 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: It was an endeavor.

00:18:28.742 --> 00:18:31.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, no, they're just
with a few key people

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:32.380 align:middle line:90%
around the planet.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:34.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Who won't throw
them away or anything.

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:35.190 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: I hope not.

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:35.730 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: No.

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:36.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: No, they were--

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:38.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: So you've got them
spotted around the world?

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:40.035 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: Got them spot--

00:18:40.035 --> 00:18:41.830 align:middle line:90%
Australia, Chile.

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:44.040 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And what was
the reasoning behind that?

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:48.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: Just to
help amplify and secure

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:53.370 align:middle line:84%
the harmonics in certain
key places on the planet.

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:58.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Which is one purpose,
I think, of the real pyramids.

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:00.912 align:middle line:84%
The same thing, but on
a much grander scale.

00:19:00.912 --> 00:19:02.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: Yes, that
was-- they're incredible.

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:04.230 align:middle line:90%
They are absolutely beyond.

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:05.990 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: They were
probably put where

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:07.910 align:middle line:90%
they are for specific reasons.

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:08.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: Mm-hmm.

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:09.840 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's what I did.

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.090 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That's what you did.

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:13.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: I also think
all the pyramids that people

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:15.320 align:middle line:84%
have bought over
the last 10 years

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.030 align:middle line:90%
are also part of the grid.

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:20.750 align:middle line:84%
All the pyramids kind of
communicate, although everyone

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:22.220 align:middle line:90%
sets their own intention.

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:24.620 align:middle line:84%
But they're all kind of
working together in unison.

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:28.128 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Can you get too
much orgone, too much energy?

00:19:28.128 --> 00:19:30.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: I don't know
if you can get too much,

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:32.840 align:middle line:84%
but there are
consequences to too much.

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:39.680 align:middle line:84%
You know, Reich did play with
high orgone spaces and UFOs.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.870 align:middle line:84%
So there's something
to the coordination

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:45.540 align:middle line:90%
of a lot of orgone as a beacon.

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:48.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You think they
kind of summoned UFOs?

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: Well, when I had
all this work in my house,

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:53.770 align:middle line:84%
I had some definitely
interesting encounters.

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:55.020 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Tell us about those.

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:56.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: Well,
some were good.

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:57.850 align:middle line:90%
Some were not good.

00:19:57.850 --> 00:20:02.790 align:middle line:84%
So I think that it's just, like,
a flashing harmonic light that

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:06.100 align:middle line:84%
draws all kinds of
dimensional beings in.

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:09.450 align:middle line:84%
So I would say have
some, don't have so much.

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:12.300 align:middle line:84%
I no longer work with
the pyramids in my home.

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:13.770 align:middle line:90%
I have a separate workshop.

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:15.667 align:middle line:90%
It's much more peaceful.

00:20:15.667 --> 00:20:17.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Just for
that purpose alone?

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:18.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: Just for
that purpose alone.

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:20.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Did you see a
difference when you switched?

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:21.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: I did.

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:23.790 align:middle line:84%
I was able to
sleep better, yeah.

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:27.300 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't so many
interruptions during the night.

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:29.220 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That's remarkable.

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:32.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you are
in this mode, when

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:35.310 align:middle line:90%
you're using your pyramids--

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:36.352 align:middle line:90%
how many do we have here?

00:20:36.352 --> 00:20:37.152 align:middle line:90%
We have four--

00:20:37.152 --> 00:20:38.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: I think 12.

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:39.060 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: 12!

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:40.910 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot.

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:42.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: I have a lot more.

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:44.455 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Do 12
do more than one?

00:20:44.455 --> 00:20:46.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: You know,
it's interesting.

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:49.560 align:middle line:84%
You can place these in
geometric patterns on the floor

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.260 align:middle line:84%
and sit inside them
and have more--

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:56.170 align:middle line:84%
it's more powerful energy to
meditate or do energy work on.

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:56.970 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:58.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You work
with clients, right?

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:00.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: Just with friends.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:02.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm so busy making
these, I don't--

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:05.350 align:middle line:84%
but I do, on friends, do
pyramid work on the body.

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:06.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:08.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Have you
seen an impact on them?

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:10.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: They
all bought them.

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:12.090 align:middle line:84%
They all bought them and
used them on their clients.

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:12.570 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Really?

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:13.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: Yeah.

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:14.370 align:middle line:90%
They love them.

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:15.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And they've
seen a difference?

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:17.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: Well, some
people feel that it

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:20.280 align:middle line:90%
keeps the office clearer.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:23.250 align:middle line:84%
Some people use-- some
healers use them on the body,

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:24.450 align:middle line:90%
on the chakras.

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:27.388 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What other shapes
will do similar things?

00:21:27.388 --> 00:21:28.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: Well, the triangle.

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm working on a
three-sided pyramid.

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:32.430 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Would a sphere do it?

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:35.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: A sphere definitely
is very powerful, a crystal

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:36.907 align:middle line:90%
ball, for example.

00:21:36.907 --> 00:21:39.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: But a pyramid shape
is the biggest, strongest?

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.365 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: The pyramid
shape is my favorite shape.

00:21:41.365 --> 00:21:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know how
to do a sphere yet.

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:46.110 align:middle line:84%
I would tell people to
just go buy a crystal ball,

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:47.905 align:middle line:84%
and that would be great
energy in a house.

00:21:47.905 --> 00:21:50.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: That's high production
if you make it a sphere.

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:51.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: Yeah.

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:52.920 align:middle line:90%
It's beyond me right now.

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:53.938 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Is that resin?

00:21:53.938 --> 00:21:55.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: This is resin, yes.

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:56.772 align:middle line:90%
Resin is the adhesion.

00:21:56.772 --> 00:21:58.230 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You mix
all that together

00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:59.587 align:middle line:90%
in a big old vat or what?

00:21:59.587 --> 00:22:00.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: Well, it takes time.

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:01.576 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: (IMITATING
WITCH) My pretty.

00:22:01.576 --> 00:22:02.310 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:03.268 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: Little bit.

00:22:03.268 --> 00:22:04.410 align:middle line:90%
No, not quite like that.

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:06.480 align:middle line:84%
I would say to
anybody making these,

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:09.510 align:middle line:84%
definitely use protective
gear, because you

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:12.967 align:middle line:84%
can get sick from the fumes
and the chemicals for sure.

00:22:12.967 --> 00:22:15.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Sharon Schloss has
talked about orgone energy,

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:16.100 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:17.310 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:19.530 align:middle line:10%
>>SHARON SCHLOSS: We
are transforming things

00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:23.130 align:middle line:10%
using orgonite, because not only
does it clean the atmosphere

00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:25.270 align:middle line:10%
and bring things
back into balance,

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:28.350 align:middle line:10%
but actually this energy,
by quieting all that EMF,

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:32.520 align:middle line:10%
allows humanity to
find themselves again.

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.170 align:middle line:84%
Because we're
quieting all the noise

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:38.598 align:middle line:84%
that has been kind of
suppressing our consciousness.

00:22:38.598 --> 00:22:41.820 align:middle line:84%
We're unable to think
straight when we're bombarded

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:43.680 align:middle line:90%
with these dangerous energies.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And by transmitting that
and removing that influence,

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:49.620 align:middle line:84%
people all of a sudden can
think clearly and see clearly.

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:52.170 align:middle line:84%
So I've actually seen
neighborhoods change.

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:53.760 align:middle line:84%
In Hollywood, where
we were living,

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.770 align:middle line:84%
it was just chaos
over there, you know?

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:56.640 align:middle line:90%
So noisy.

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:59.640 align:middle line:84%
We started doing this and
a lot of the crazy people

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:00.930 align:middle line:90%
started acting less crazy.

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:01.870 align:middle line:90%
It became quiet.

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:04.500 align:middle line:84%
We had nice, quiet nights
where we could sleep.

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:06.817 align:middle line:84%
It didn't even sound
like Los Angeles anymore.

00:23:06.817 --> 00:23:08.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Now, let's
talk a little bit

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.900 align:middle line:84%
about how this has
impacted you personally.

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:12.432 align:middle line:90%
You're around this every day.

00:23:12.432 --> 00:23:13.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: Well,
I agree with her.

00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:16.140 align:middle line:90%
It does calm your mind.

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:18.250 align:middle line:90%
I would say yes to all of that.

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:20.010 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I use
them in the garden.

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:21.820 align:middle line:84%
It helps plants
regenerate that are--

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:22.620 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Really?

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:23.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: --not doing well.

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:24.330 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:26.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Now, you've
generated a number of plates.

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:28.350 align:middle line:90%
How many have you made?

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:29.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: Oh, maybe 50 plates.

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:29.970 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: All right.

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:31.928 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at a few of
them and you can tell us

00:23:31.928 --> 00:23:33.692 align:middle line:90%
what we're looking at.

00:23:33.692 --> 00:23:35.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: Originally,
I made the plates

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:38.220 align:middle line:84%
so that people could put their
grocery bag on top of it.

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:41.020 align:middle line:84%
And the frequencies would raise
the frequencies in the food.

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:41.820 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Really?

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: In a way, bless the
food just like a prayer would.

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:48.660 align:middle line:84%
It's all very similar in
raising the consciousness.

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's what I originally
made them for, but found

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:53.670 align:middle line:84%
that people put
them under the bed

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:56.400 align:middle line:84%
when they're recovering from
surgery and they heal faster.

00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:00.247 align:middle line:84%
I make 9 inches, 7
inches, and 14 inches.

00:24:00.247 --> 00:24:01.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And what
are they made with?

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:04.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: I make them with
basically the same mixture

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:05.500 align:middle line:90%
as the pyramids.

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:06.150 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: The same resin?

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:07.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: Yes, same recipe.

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:09.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And do you put
crystals in the plates, too?

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:10.908 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: Crystals
in the plates.

00:24:10.908 --> 00:24:12.240 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: How thick are they?

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: Maybe
inch and a half.

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:14.855 align:middle line:84%
It's in a different
pattern, though.

00:24:14.855 --> 00:24:15.190 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Pretty good size.

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:15.990 align:middle line:90%
Are they heavy?

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:17.073 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: They're heavy.

00:24:17.073 --> 00:24:18.750 align:middle line:84%
They're heavy with
sacred geometry.

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:19.550 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: OK.

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And so, you put them
under beds and places.

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:22.800 align:middle line:90%
And they do what?

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.217 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: And
people-- actually,

00:24:24.217 --> 00:24:26.430 align:middle line:84%
I did a test with
people in Idaho.

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And seven different people
came in and put their bare feet

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:31.530 align:middle line:84%
on the plate, I--
because I wanted

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:33.420 align:middle line:84%
to see what the effects
were on the body.

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And I got seven
different testimonials.

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:38.220 align:middle line:84%
One woman, in fact,
who had diabetes

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:41.200 align:middle line:84%
hadn't felt her
feet in 18 years.

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.808 align:middle line:84%
And for the first time in
18 years, she felt her feet.

00:24:43.808 --> 00:24:44.850 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That's amazing.

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:46.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: Yeah,
I was very happy.

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:49.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And you make
these for the public?

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:51.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: They're all
on my site and stores.

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:53.160 align:middle line:90%
I also sell--

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:55.860 align:middle line:84%
I have a beautiful
website that sells

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:58.980 align:middle line:84%
large pyramids, medium
pyramids, plates,

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:00.690 align:middle line:90%
chakra sets, and pendants.

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:02.100 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Spell it out for us.

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:06.960 align:middle line:10%
>>MICHELLE: Lite the Light,
L-I-T-E T-H-E L-I-G-H-T.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:10.952 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE: Now, these
here would cost how much?

00:25:10.952 --> 00:25:13.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: Everyone's different
depending on the crystals,

00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:17.030 align:middle line:84%
but this size maybe
runs from $190 to $250,

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:18.030 align:middle line:90%
depending on the stones.

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:19.363 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: How about the big one?

00:25:19.363 --> 00:25:21.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: That one is $1,800.

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:22.590 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Really?

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: It takes me
six weeks to make it.

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:27.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Will the big one work
quicker than the small ones?

00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:29.580 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: Not necessarily.

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:32.790 align:middle line:84%
But do take into account
if you're by cell towers,

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:36.420 align:middle line:84%
if you're by a lot of
electronics, smart meters.

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:39.450 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of things
people can do to also generate

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:40.860 align:middle line:90%
orgone in their house.

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:43.620 align:middle line:84%
They can put their
crystals on a silver tray.

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:44.880 align:middle line:90%
It won't be as amplified.

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.440 align:middle line:90%
It'll have a subtler energy.

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.177 align:middle line:84%
But they can do that
right now at home.

00:25:48.177 --> 00:25:50.010 align:middle line:84%
There's many different
things people can do.

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:52.218 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How did you get
involved in this, Michelle?

00:25:52.218 --> 00:25:55.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: I was concerned
about the frequencies

00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:57.960 align:middle line:84%
descending upon the planet,
how it was affecting us.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Did anything
happen to you personally?

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:02.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: Well, I
wasn't sleeping, actually.

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And come to find that they hit
the smart meters about 3:00

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:06.300 align:middle line:90%
in the morning.

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:07.883 align:middle line:84%
That's why a lot of
people are waking.

00:26:07.883 --> 00:26:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Have you always
been this tuned in?

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:13.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: Yes, but the more
I've worked with the crystals,

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:16.200 align:middle line:90%
the more sensitive I've gotten.

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:17.455 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:17.455 --> 00:26:18.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Fascinating
that you've

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:20.007 align:middle line:90%
been able to do all this.

00:26:20.007 --> 00:26:21.590 align:middle line:84%
How about when you
were a little girl?

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:23.420 align:middle line:90%
Did you have this ability?

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:25.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: Well, I loved rocks.

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:25.870 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:28.280 align:middle line:84%
I would ride my
horse in the desert

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:30.410 align:middle line:84%
and imagine different
things and hunt rocks.

00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:32.150 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: So you've
always been earthy.

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:33.858 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: I've been
a rock hunter, yes.

00:26:33.858 --> 00:26:35.210 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: A rock hunter?

00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:36.320 align:middle line:90%
Spiritual?

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:37.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: Yeah.

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.030 align:middle line:10%
I've studied with a lot
of different people,

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:40.860 align:middle line:10%
different modalities for energy.

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:43.400 align:middle line:10%
And I feel that
all of it brings me

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:45.440 align:middle line:10%
to this place where
I can make these.

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And what makes my pyramids
different than other-- well

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:50.780 align:middle line:84%
I can't say how
other people's are.

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:53.990 align:middle line:84%
But they're very beautiful, so
people would love to have them.

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:56.150 align:middle line:84%
But I don't put
my energy in them.

00:26:56.150 --> 00:27:00.650 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I try and be as clear
and pristine in my frequency

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:01.745 align:middle line:90%
when I'm making these.

00:27:01.745 --> 00:27:05.305 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: These actually
could also serve as artwork.

00:27:05.305 --> 00:27:06.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: That's
what I thought

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.050 align:middle line:84%
would work for people that
weren't really into this.

00:27:09.050 --> 00:27:10.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: The fact
that they work.

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:11.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: And they
would get the benefit.

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:12.832 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: And not even know it.

00:27:12.832 --> 00:27:15.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: But all
things emit a frequency.

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:17.150 align:middle line:90%
Paintings emit frequency.

00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:19.460 align:middle line:84%
You know, even in
Feng Shui, where

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:23.180 align:middle line:84%
things are placed can change
how a frequency is in a room.

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:26.000 align:middle line:84%
So all these things really
do matter in our lives.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Fascinating
that you do all this.

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:30.765 align:middle line:84%
And people would ship
these right to their home?

00:27:30.765 --> 00:27:32.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: I ship
right to their home.

00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:32.870 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Perfect.

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:33.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: It's pretty easy.

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:33.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Let me
hold another one.

00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:34.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: What would you like?

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:34.830 align:middle line:90%
Which one?

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:35.630 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Any one.

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:36.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: Try this one.

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:37.820 align:middle line:90%
This is a new symbol.

00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:40.410 align:middle line:84%
It's the Sumerian
sun symbol in there.

00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:41.330 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Great.

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:43.257 align:middle line:84%
Michelle, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:27:43.257 --> 00:27:44.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHELLE: Thank
you so much, George.

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:45.540 align:middle line:90%
It's an honor.

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:47.180 align:middle line:84%
I've been waiting to
meet you a long time.

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:47.980 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: It's fun.

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:49.953 align:middle line:90%
What a great piece of machinery.

00:27:49.953 --> 00:27:50.870 align:middle line:90%
Should I call it that?

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:51.703 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHELLE: Why not?

00:27:51.703 --> 00:27:54.740 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE: Or equipment
that really filters out

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:58.880 align:middle line:10%
dangerous frequencies that are
bombarding us all the time.

00:27:58.880 --> 00:27:59.900 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:02.650 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:07.000 align:middle line:90%
