00:00:19.012 --> 00:00:20.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.810 align:middle line:10%
Ben Stewart is with us,
a researcher, filmmaker,

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.450 align:middle line:10%
and host of the incredible
Gaia Psychedelics Show.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.770 align:middle line:84%
He is currently
researching DMT, which

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.740 align:middle line:84%
is a natural psychedelic
found in the human brain

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.370 align:middle line:90%
and in nature.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.480 align:middle line:84%
It's recognized by both ancient
traditions and modern science.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.320 align:middle line:84%
It is linked to healing
trauma, provides

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.040 align:middle line:84%
spiritual growth, and access
to transcendent realms

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.220 align:middle line:90%
and entities.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.390 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back, Ben.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.320 align:middle line:90%
How have you been?

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.028 align:middle line:84%
>>BEN STEWART: I've
been so good, George.

00:00:51.028 --> 00:00:52.800 align:middle line:10%
Having babies,
doing the dad life,

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.970 align:middle line:10%
but also researching a
lot, especially about

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.260 align:middle line:10%
these topics about
expansion of consciousness.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
babies now for Ben?

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.520 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well, a
five-month-old at home.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.010 align:middle line:10%
And then there's three
more on top of that,

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.703 align:middle line:10%
ranging all the way
up to 9 years old.

00:01:06.703 --> 00:01:07.620 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.940 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Yeah,
they're teachers.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:09.857 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:01:09.857 --> 00:01:12.170 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
take after Daddy.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.610 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: I hope.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: DMT, what does it do?

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.810 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: So DMT, it's
short for dimethyltryptamine.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.300 align:middle line:90%
And it is a psychedelic.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And anyone who has heard
the term psychedelic

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.210 align:middle line:84%
but hasn't used it
before, you need

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.250 align:middle line:84%
to understand that they're
all classified as drugs.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.870 align:middle line:84%
But psychedelics are vastly
different than other drugs

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.910 align:middle line:84%
like deliriants, dissociatives,
things like alcohol,

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.360 align:middle line:84%
methamphetamines,
the opiate class.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.530 align:middle line:84%
So psychedelics are very
different because they don't

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.090 align:middle line:90%
just alter or distort reality.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.760 align:middle line:84%
They seem to open
up consciousness

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.680 align:middle line:84%
and the doors of perception
so we can see more.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.320 align:middle line:84%
But DMT is the most common
because it's found in nature,

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.970 align:middle line:84%
but it's just as different from
all the rest of the psychedelics

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.530 align:middle line:84%
as psychedelics are
from all other drugs.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And there's very many
reasons for that.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.350 align:middle line:90%
It's very short acting.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.030 align:middle line:84%
Many psychedelics they last up
to anywhere from 5 to 12 hours.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.000 align:middle line:90%
DMT lasts maybe 5 to 10 minutes.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And when you're back,
there's no weirdness.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.740 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to get
your legs back under you.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:26.760 align:middle line:90%
You're just back.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.970 align:middle line:84%
It metabolizes really
well inside the body.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And it gives probably
the craziest, most potent

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.190 align:middle line:84%
psychedelic experience
out of all of them.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.620 align:middle line:84%
So they call it the King
of the psychedelics.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.490 align:middle line:84%
And to explain
it, if people want

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.620 align:middle line:84%
to know what the sensation
is, is within seconds,

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.810 align:middle line:84%
let's say you smoke it,
within seconds, there's

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:48.930 align:middle line:90%
this acceleration.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.150 align:middle line:84%
You feel like you're shot
out of a cosmic cannon.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.730 align:middle line:84%
You're not here in
your body anymore.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.640 align:middle line:84%
And there's this really wild,
kaleidoscopic acceleration

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.390 align:middle line:90%
feeling that you go through.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ben, DMT is natural
in the brain, which you're

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.730 align:middle line:84%
going to talk about in
a minute, but it's also

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.210 align:middle line:90%
prevalent in nature.

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.070 align:middle line:90%
Where?

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.230 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well, it's
in a lot of grasses,

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.610 align:middle line:84%
a lot of plants,
the acacia tree.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.310 align:middle line:84%
It's in all mammalian
cortices, which is wild.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are they?

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.000 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well,
the mammals that

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.090 align:middle line:84%
have the cortices and
the mammalian and also

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.540 align:middle line:84%
in humans in the
neocortex, we produce DMT.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.980 align:middle line:84%
So not only is it the wildest
psychedelic that we know of,

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.970 align:middle line:84%
it's very fast acting, but our
brain is producing it almost

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.060 align:middle line:90%
around the clock.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the leading studies

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.090 align:middle line:84%
that we've found out of
the University of Michigan,

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.210 align:middle line:84%
is that we're always
producing DMT.

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:44.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
we producing it for?

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.680 align:middle line:84%
What's its purpose
in the human body?

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.190 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: We don't know.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.490 align:middle line:84%
Which is why there needs to
be a lot more study on this.

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think the studies need
to be asking deeper questions

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.100 align:middle line:84%
than how can we turn this
into a drug and make billions.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.870 align:middle line:84%
I think we really
need to be asking,

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.900 align:middle line:90%
why is DMT in all mammals?

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.670 align:middle line:84%
Why when you upregulate
DMT, does it take you

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.745 align:middle line:90%
to this vastly different place.

00:04:09.745 --> 00:04:11.120 align:middle line:84%
It takes you to
a different place

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.500 align:middle line:84%
than all of the other
psychedelics as well.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.680 align:middle line:84%
So if you think about a
key, every psychedelic,

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.820 align:middle line:84%
they fit into the 5-HT2A
receptors in the brain as part

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.630 align:middle line:90%
of the serotonergic pathway.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.440 align:middle line:84%
But DMT fits with a
specific affinity.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.240 align:middle line:84%
So the specificity
of that key takes us

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.910 align:middle line:84%
to a vastly different place than
all these other psychedelics.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.830 align:middle line:90%
Why is it in the human brain?

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.830 align:middle line:84%
The leading scientists
studying DMT still don't know.

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.840 align:middle line:84%
All we know is
that we produce it.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And in 2019, they found
out that we don't just

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.790 align:middle line:90%
produce trace amounts of it.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's probably not
even in the pineal gland.

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.280 align:middle line:84%
It may produce it,
but it turns out

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.080 align:middle line:84%
in the corpus callosum that
produces cerebrospinal fluid.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.720 align:middle line:84%
We're producing--
and this is in 2019,

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.730 align:middle line:84%
we're producing almost as
much DMT around the clock

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.095 align:middle line:84%
as we are serotonin,
dopamine, and norepinephrine.

00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:04.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.053 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Those are
functional neurotransmitters.

00:05:07.053 --> 00:05:08.480 align:middle line:90%
We know their purpose.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And then there was this other
study that just came out

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.880 align:middle line:84%
last year that
says, we're actually

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.740 align:middle line:84%
producing twice
the amount of DMT

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.510 align:middle line:84%
than any of the other
neurotransmitters in the brain,

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.190 align:middle line:90%
and we still don't know why.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does the human
body when it manufactures it

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.700 align:middle line:90%
in the brain use it?

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:25.970 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: It does.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:27.500 align:middle line:90%
And we metabolize it.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And tryptophan is
a precursor to it.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.590 align:middle line:84%
There's a couple other
precursors to it as well.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.040 align:middle line:84%
It's very hard to
study it because it

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.760 align:middle line:90%
metabolizes so quickly.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.830 align:middle line:84%
So we could be
producing a lot of it.

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.730 align:middle line:84%
But by the time we
get a sample of it,

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.950 align:middle line:84%
while we're getting that
sample, it's still metabolizing.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.920 align:middle line:84%
So when we study how much
we actually have of it,

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.700 align:middle line:84%
it might have been
twice that amount.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.090 align:middle line:84%
It started metabolizing
while it was

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:57.670 align:middle line:84%
being prepared to be
viewed under a microscope.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.400 align:middle line:90%
So we don't know exactly why.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.990 align:middle line:90%
There are some suggestions.

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.560 align:middle line:84%
Rick Strassman, he's the one
who broke through the Controlled

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.650 align:middle line:90%
Substance Act.

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.900 align:middle line:84%
He made DMT: The
spirit Molecule.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.690 align:middle line:84%
He initially started
saying things

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.990 align:middle line:84%
like, everyone that came
back from a high dose of DMT

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:17.140 align:middle line:84%
was saying, that felt more
real than this reality.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing-- there's
two things that that could mean.

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:24.580 align:middle line:84%
That the DMT space is a more
base layer of our reality,

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:30.160 align:middle line:84%
or it could mean that while
oxytocin, serotonin, dopamine,

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.640 align:middle line:84%
norepinephrine, they all
give us a feeling state.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.530 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps DMT, no matter
how wild the experience

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.990 align:middle line:84%
that we're experiencing,
it feels very familiar

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:44.290 align:middle line:84%
because perhaps DMT gives us
the feeling of familiarity.

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:46.800 align:middle line:84%
So we're not really
sure what DMT

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.460 align:middle line:84%
is saying about how
we perceive reality,

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.900 align:middle line:84%
but it has to be a part
of how we perceive reality

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.160 align:middle line:90%
because we're all--

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.690 align:middle line:84%
everyone listening to this is on
a relatively high amount of DMT

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:00.020 align:middle line:90%
at all times.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where does the
DMT psychedelic experience

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.787 align:middle line:90%
take us then?

00:07:04.787 --> 00:07:06.620 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: I wish I
knew how to answer that.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.690 align:middle line:84%
There are so many questions
that are unanswered.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:10.607 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're finally
getting to the point

00:07:10.607 --> 00:07:12.790 align:middle line:84%
where scientific
studies are starting

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:15.710 align:middle line:84%
to ask the more pertinent
questions like this.

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:20.930 align:middle line:84%
Where does the DMT drug
take consciousness.

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:22.220 align:middle line:90%
Is it somewhere else.

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.530 align:middle line:84%
Is it just a distortion
of our psyche.

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:25.970 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.240 align:middle line:84%
But I will say,
when I said that DMT

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.560 align:middle line:84%
is vastly different than
all other psychedelics,

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.200 align:middle line:84%
it truly is because on
all other psychedelics,

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.330 align:middle line:90%
people meet their ancestors.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:40.690 align:middle line:84%
They meet beings, people from
their family that has passed.

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:44.120 align:middle line:84%
On DMT, you're taken to
a very specific place,

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.220 align:middle line:84%
and only if you
take enough of it.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And if you take
enough of it, you

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.190 align:middle line:90%
may be presented with a door.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
take enough, you're

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:53.300 align:middle line:90%
not allowed through that door.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:53.340 align:middle line:90%
So it's kind of like--

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if
you take too much.

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:58.080 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well, I
don't know because there

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.790 align:middle line:84%
are people who have taken
an exceedingly high dose,

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:03.510 align:middle line:84%
and what they say is the
only thing that happens

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:05.800 align:middle line:90%
is they blast through this door.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And once they do that,
all of that intensity

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.680 align:middle line:84%
and that acceleration
that I was explaining,

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.860 align:middle line:84%
that seems to subside and
give way to another world.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:18.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, this world isn't just like
a dream state where everything's

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.900 align:middle line:90%
amorphous and changing.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:20.980 align:middle line:90%
It's structured.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:22.000 align:middle line:90%
It's fixed.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.420 align:middle line:84%
It almost seems like
you could map it out

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:27.550 align:middle line:84%
if you had enough time,
but it's also inhabited.

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:30.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just
a virtual reality.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.559 align:middle line:90%
It's inhabited by beings.

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:35.309 align:middle line:84%
And there are certain
kinds of beings.

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:38.190 align:middle line:84%
There are thousands of trip
reports, and a lot of them

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:41.460 align:middle line:84%
are saying, I met this kind of
a being, like a mantis being

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:42.610 align:middle line:90%
or a light being.

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And when they lay it out,
to such a specific degree

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:51.220 align:middle line:84%
that if two people were to meet
you and then go report back

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:55.150 align:middle line:84%
what it was like meeting you,
that's how similar it is to say

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:56.980 align:middle line:90%
I met this mantis being.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:59.960 align:middle line:84%
People are coming back and
reporting what they look like,

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.290 align:middle line:84%
what their demeanor is
like, enough to where we

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:04.460 align:middle line:90%
have characteristics for them.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:10.670 align:middle line:84%
So the DMT molecule takes our
consciousness to a doorway.

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And if we take enough, we
go through the doorway.

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:15.500 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a rite of
passage because it's scary.

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:16.430 align:middle line:90%
Most people stop.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:19.190 align:middle line:84%
They don't go any further
because it's already scary.

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:20.300 align:middle line:90%
Your heart is pounding.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.060 align:middle line:84%
But if you do more, like
Terence McKenna said,

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:24.830 align:middle line:84%
just when you think
it's too much,

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:28.040 align:middle line:84%
that's when you should do a
little bit more or a lot more,

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.890 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden
you are transported

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:33.190 align:middle line:90%
into a different realm.

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:36.410 align:middle line:84%
Another dimension maybe
inhabited by other beings?

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:37.730 align:middle line:90%
We just don't know.

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:41.230 align:middle line:84%
But there are enough
anecdotal cases

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:43.770 align:middle line:84%
that are so specific
to this space

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:47.830 align:middle line:84%
that Imperial College London,
Johns Hopkins University,

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:51.640 align:middle line:84%
as well as Medicinal Mindfulness
right here in Boulder, Colorado,

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.840 align:middle line:84%
they are putting a lot of money
into just trying to figure out

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.440 align:middle line:90%
where does it take you.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.600 align:middle line:90%
Are these beings actually real?

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And because they seem to
be so vastly intelligent,

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:03.490 align:middle line:90%
could they teach us something.

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:05.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you alert
when you're taking it,

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.400 align:middle line:84%
or are you in more
like a dream state?

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.650 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: When you take it,
there's the ramp up period.

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:14.783 align:middle line:84%
And that ramp up can bring
you all the way to this door.

00:10:14.783 --> 00:10:17.200 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't take enough,
you're rejected at the door,

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.790 align:middle line:84%
and then it just starts to
taper off until you're back.

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:27.670 align:middle line:84%
If you get past the door, you
may be aware of your body.

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:30.130 align:middle line:84%
You may be aware that
you still have a body.

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.260 align:middle line:90%
There's a bit of your sense.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:37.780 align:middle line:84%
You still have consciousness
enough to say that I am here,

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:41.120 align:middle line:84%
I am me, I'm on a
drug called DMT.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.370 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of that you
don't even have time for.

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And some of the beings,
this is another thing

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.620 align:middle line:84%
Terence McKenna said, don't
abandon yourself to amazement.

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:52.500 align:middle line:90%
Meaning, go in with questions.

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.830 align:middle line:84%
Don't just be so
awestruck that you just

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:56.760 align:middle line:90%
sit there with your jaw open.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.820 align:middle line:84%
There are intelligent beings
inhabiting this space.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.570 align:middle line:84%
Ask some questions,
because if you do come back

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:06.680 align:middle line:84%
with vastly more
intelligent information

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:10.320 align:middle line:84%
than you had going in, that
could mean that these are,

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.350 align:middle line:84%
let's say, alien beings or
other dimensional beings.

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:15.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the truth to
that, but what I do know

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:18.080 align:middle line:84%
is that when Imperial College
London, Johns Hopkins,

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:22.220 align:middle line:84%
and other major universities
are asking these questions, that

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:25.400 align:middle line:84%
means that they'll
admit, we don't

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.390 align:middle line:84%
know what the base
layer of reality is,

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:29.730 align:middle line:84%
and DMT might give
us a glimpse of that.

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:31.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it unusual,
then, that people

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:37.620 align:middle line:84%
who experience under DMT all
have this familiar experience?

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:38.420 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:43.750 align:middle line:84%
The familiar-- Well, the
familiarity of the DMT space,

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:45.490 align:middle line:90%
we also don't know why.

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:48.330 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, it could be
that DMT just gives us

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:50.980 align:middle line:84%
a sense of familiarity
no matter where we're at.

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:56.260 align:middle line:84%
Which poses a question, is that
why it's in our brain right now?

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.290 align:middle line:84%
Would this reality--
this what we

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:01.860 align:middle line:84%
call our sober waking reality,
would this seem alien to us

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:04.420 align:middle line:84%
without the presence
of DMT in us?

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:05.350 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And what we do
know is that we're

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:09.670 align:middle line:90%
breeding to ask that question.

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:14.140 align:middle line:84%
Some universities have already
bred mice with a knockout gene,

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:18.030 align:middle line:84%
meaning the fundamental
precursors to DMT are being

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:20.020 align:middle line:84%
knocked out so they
don't synthesize it,

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:22.980 align:middle line:84%
meaning those mice
cannot produce DMT.

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:27.643 align:middle line:84%
And so we're just starting to
study, and I mean, poor mice.

00:12:27.643 --> 00:12:28.810 align:middle line:90%
But we're starting to study.

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:32.440 align:middle line:84%
What does that do to their
perspective of reality.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.350 align:middle line:84%
Do they start
rejecting this reality

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:35.890 align:middle line:90%
as not being real enough.

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:39.750 align:middle line:84%
So we don't know why
does DMT, that space,

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:44.730 align:middle line:84%
feel so wild when we talk about
it, but it feels so familiar?

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:46.560 align:middle line:90%
I wish we had those answers.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.130 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think we're far
from answering those things as

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:52.880 align:middle line:84%
long as we start funding science
that actually asks the deeper

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.880 align:middle line:84%
questions about reality, not
just trying to make medicines

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.270 align:middle line:90%
that can come to scale.

00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:00.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it a protective
mechanism within the body?

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:05.150 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps it gives you
some ability to cope.

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:08.850 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: So one of Rick
Strassman's original theories,

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:11.460 align:middle line:84%
and we do know that
it's a neuroprotectant.

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:14.850 align:middle line:84%
So in anemic or low
oxygen environments,

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:18.950 align:middle line:84%
say, you're drowning or you
have an accident or your heart

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:21.380 align:middle line:84%
stops for any reason
and you stop breathing.

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:25.320 align:middle line:84%
In that low oxygen
environment, DMT increases.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think in the
dying brain of mammals,

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:30.750 align:middle line:90%
DMT increases up to 600%.

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:32.120 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot.

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:34.490 align:middle line:84%
The reason for
that could be just

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:37.350 align:middle line:84%
to protect your neurons to
the very last second, just

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:40.680 align:middle line:84%
in case you can
somehow resuscitate.

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:41.760 align:middle line:90%
But the only thing--

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:45.870 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if that's the only
reason why DMT is in the body.

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:50.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that it's just a
byproduct that DMT transports us

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:56.010 align:middle line:84%
to a very futuristic
virtual reality with highly

00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:59.010 align:middle line:84%
intelligent beings in
there, just because that's

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:02.800 align:middle line:84%
a byproduct of a neuroprotectant
in a low oxygen environment.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't think God would just
have that as a byproduct.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:12.030 align:middle line:84%
For me, I think that that is
the neuroprotectant nature of it

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:15.600 align:middle line:84%
is a byproduct that we
know that people who

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.543 align:middle line:84%
have near-death experiences,
their heart has stopped,

00:14:18.543 --> 00:14:20.460 align:middle line:84%
their breathing has
stopped, but they're still

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.260 align:middle line:90%
experiencing something.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.190 align:middle line:90%
They float up above their body.

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:27.280 align:middle line:90%
They can see omnidirectionally.

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.670 align:middle line:84%
They can hear in
different languages

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:32.380 align:middle line:84%
and understand the languages
that they're hearing.

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:35.040 align:middle line:84%
So there's some
transcended intelligence

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.600 align:middle line:90%
that they're stepping into.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.550 align:middle line:90%
DMT may play a role in--

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:40.900 align:middle line:90%
like I said, being a key.

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:43.060 align:middle line:90%
It gets us into that space.

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And that space is closed
off to most humans

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:49.930 align:middle line:84%
so we can operate in the
mundane world, if you will.

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:52.180 align:middle line:84%
Because if we were
always in the DMT space,

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:54.220 align:middle line:84%
we probably wouldn't
get much done.

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:57.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I guess that we all
know Dannion Brinkley has had

00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:59.350 align:middle line:90%
three near-death experiences.

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Might he be tapping
into his body DMT,

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:07.740 align:middle line:84%
creating more of
these experiences.

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.480 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: We think.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And when I say I mean, the
greater scientific field

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:15.580 align:middle line:84%
and the people who are looking
at DMT and what does it mean.

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:20.350 align:middle line:84%
How is it connected to NDEs,
near-death experiences or OBEs,

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:22.260 align:middle line:90%
out of body experiences.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.630 align:middle line:84%
And to me, the best
of my understanding

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:27.690 align:middle line:84%
is the difference
between an NDE and an OBE

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:30.510 align:middle line:84%
is a near-death
experience is what prompts

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:32.380 align:middle line:90%
you to come out of your body.

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And there's specific things
that happen in that state

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:39.050 align:middle line:84%
that don't happen when you
astral travel or lucid dream,

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:42.940 align:middle line:84%
and that is that you see tunnels
of light, kaleidoscopic tunnels

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:45.530 align:middle line:84%
of light, and you
meet ancestors.

00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:47.140 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people who--

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:49.540 align:middle line:84%
I think it was in the
1960s, they came up with

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:51.250 align:middle line:90%
the defibrillator.

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:53.840 align:middle line:84%
That was the first time when
people went into cardiac arrest.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:57.350 align:middle line:84%
By that point, once they brought
this technology to scale,

00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:59.683 align:middle line:84%
they were bringing people
back from the brink of--

00:15:59.683 --> 00:16:00.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of the death?

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:00.860 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: --death.

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.000 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And then the stories
started flooding in.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.640 align:middle line:84%
Everyone was saying, well,
there was this tunnel of light,

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:13.390 align:middle line:84%
and I was being magnetized or
drawn into this warm, beautiful,

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:16.730 align:middle line:84%
whatever that destination
is at the end of that light.

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And there are
ancestors and beings

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:20.660 align:middle line:90%
that are guiding me there.

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:22.870 align:middle line:84%
Some people with
near-death experiences

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:25.370 align:middle line:84%
said that they're
transported to a hell realm,

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:29.620 align:middle line:84%
and it becomes really scary, but
that they don't feel any pain

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:31.063 align:middle line:90%
when they're out of their body.

00:16:31.063 --> 00:16:32.730 align:middle line:84%
But when they come
back into their body,

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:36.000 align:middle line:84%
that's when they feel the pain
of whatever the accident was.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.880 align:middle line:84%
So in these near-death
experiences,

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:42.590 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that we're
accessing a little bit closer

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:45.920 align:middle line:84%
to source, and that
information makes

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.520 align:middle line:90%
so much sense in these spaces.

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And this is very
similar to psychedelics.

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:51.450 align:middle line:90%
People say, I get it.

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:52.740 align:middle line:90%
Reality is simple.

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:54.720 align:middle line:84%
It's so brilliant
and it's so simple.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.940 align:middle line:90%
It's not complex or complicated.

00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:59.520 align:middle line:84%
But then when you come
back into your body,

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:04.400 align:middle line:84%
for some reason, those wise
little kernels of wisdom

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.150 align:middle line:90%
that we get, they fade.

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:08.010 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how to
put them into words.

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:09.540 align:middle line:90%
They remain ineffable.

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:12.030 align:middle line:84%
So it's something that
we can bring back,

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:15.260 align:middle line:84%
but we don't know how to share
that wisdom that we accessed

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.560 align:middle line:84%
with other people around
us, other than saying there

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.730 align:middle line:90%
is something beyond death.

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:23.970 align:middle line:84%
Life keeps going,
consciousness keeps going.

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:25.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
what the ancients even

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:27.510 align:middle line:90%
knew about all psychedelics.

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they
said psychedelics are

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.670 align:middle line:90%
like a mini death experience.

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:34.180 align:middle line:84%
You get to experience death
without your body physically

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:35.110 align:middle line:90%
dying.

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:35.985 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:17:35.985 --> 00:17:39.430 align:middle line:84%
Wim Hof has various
breathing techniques

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:43.540 align:middle line:90%
in cold water with psychedelics.

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:48.010 align:middle line:84%
Does his technique have
anything to do with this?

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:49.250 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: He says it does.

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:52.400 align:middle line:90%
Wim Hof has a method--

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.650 align:middle line:84%
so he has many different
kinds of breathing.

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:56.020 align:middle line:90%
He has the introductory.

00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
an advanced kind.

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And that advanced kind it's
a lot more incapacitating

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:05.920 align:middle line:84%
because it probably does
upregulate the natural DMT

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:08.770 align:middle line:90%
inside the body.

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:09.800 align:middle line:90%
It is interesting.

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.300 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
there's a correlate,

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:14.810 align:middle line:84%
but your lungs
produce DMT as well.

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:17.320 align:middle line:84%
It turns out your
eyes produce DMT.

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:19.940 align:middle line:90%
And DMT is found in your blood.

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:21.350 align:middle line:90%
It's found in your urine.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:24.680 align:middle line:84%
We're not sure why, but it's
all throughout the body.

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.780 align:middle line:90%
It's in the cerebrospinal fluid.

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And Wim Hof's
method of breathing,

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:35.660 align:middle line:84%
we do know that respiration
influences the fluctuations

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:37.200 align:middle line:90%
of cerebrospinal fluid.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.250 align:middle line:84%
It can possibly mean
that we upregulate

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:43.193 align:middle line:90%
DMT with a breathing method.

00:18:43.193 --> 00:18:45.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It generates the
production, you're saying.

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.600 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Yeah, it
upregulates the amount of DMT

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.340 align:middle line:84%
that we're producing
at any given time.

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:52.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure
exactly why that

00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:55.940 align:middle line:84%
is, because it seems like
in low oxygen environments

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:59.340 align:middle line:84%
when your heart has
stopped, DMT skyrockets.

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And then in hyper
oxygen environments,

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:03.710 align:middle line:84%
when you're doing
a breath practice,

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:06.090 align:middle line:84%
and your blood is
becoming hyper oxygenated,

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:09.150 align:middle line:84%
it seems like you go into
the DMT space as well.

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:12.240 align:middle line:84%
Those things they
seem contradictory,

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:13.680 align:middle line:90%
but perhaps they're not.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:17.330 align:middle line:84%
It seems like when we deviate
from baseline, whether it

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:20.220 align:middle line:84%
be baseline oxygen or just
baseline consciousness,

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:22.710 align:middle line:90%
we're entering the DMT space.

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:25.520 align:middle line:84%
So people like Wim Hof
and the understanding

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.450 align:middle line:84%
that Wim Hof is really just
repackaging old breathing

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:31.280 align:middle line:84%
techniques of Tummo Tibetan
breathing techniques,

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.855 align:middle line:84%
he just repackaged it
to show you listen,

00:19:33.855 --> 00:19:35.230 align:middle line:84%
this is for people
who are trying

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:37.250 align:middle line:90%
to find God on a mountaintop.

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:41.080 align:middle line:84%
You can face freezing
cold water or you

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:45.020 align:middle line:84%
can climb Mount Kilimanjaro
in your underwear

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:48.850 align:middle line:84%
by breathing and visualizing
that you are powerful enough

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:50.450 align:middle line:90%
to rise to this occasion.

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:53.990 align:middle line:84%
DMT likely plays
some role in that,

00:19:53.990 --> 00:20:00.080 align:middle line:84%
and it also probably allows us
to feel familiar with stress.

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.930 align:middle line:84%
Whereas most of us, the
difference between stress,

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:06.340 align:middle line:84%
which is the number one
killer, and eustress, which

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:09.010 align:middle line:84%
is what you experience when you
do a marathon or you work out

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:11.290 align:middle line:84%
and that's good for
you, the only difference

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:12.890 align:middle line:90%
is the story in your head.

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:15.560 align:middle line:84%
The effort on the body
is the exact same,

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.090 align:middle line:90%
but it's the story in your head.

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:18.820 align:middle line:84%
So there's something
about DMT that

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:23.880 align:middle line:84%
might cause you to
feel more meaningfully

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:28.020 align:middle line:84%
connected to the story of rising
to the occasion of whatever life

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:28.960 align:middle line:90%
throws at you.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:32.300 align:middle line:84%
So DMT might actually push
you into your higher potential

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:33.100 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:35.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is DMT verse?

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:36.870 align:middle line:90%
What has that been?

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:39.720 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: That is
a colloquial term

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:42.450 align:middle line:84%
that is used by
people who are also

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:45.340 align:middle line:84%
into talking about technology,
like the metaverse.

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And the metaverse is a
technological virtual realm,

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:53.670 align:middle line:84%
largely built in-- people
like Silicon Valley who

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:57.940 align:middle line:84%
are trying to bring people who
use technology, social media,

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:01.377 align:middle line:84%
but bring them into spaces
that are virtual spaces.

00:21:01.377 --> 00:21:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean,
Zuckerberg gets that.

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:03.760 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yes.

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly why he named
Facebook Meta after a while.

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:14.640 align:middle line:84%
So then the DMT verse is a term
to explain the very structured

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.920 align:middle line:90%
reality of DMT because--

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.670 align:middle line:90%
I can't stress this enough.

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:23.680 align:middle line:84%
DMT does not just blast you
into an anomaly in an evolving

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:24.830 align:middle line:90%
weird space.

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:26.180 align:middle line:90%
It's structured.

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:28.370 align:middle line:90%
It's reproducible.

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:31.550 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people come back
with the same exact stories.

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:35.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've experienced it
and it does feel structured.

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:38.140 align:middle line:84%
And if you zoom
in, in fact, I had

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:39.730 align:middle line:84%
to do a technological
thing which

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:44.710 align:middle line:84%
is on your phone, where you
pinch out to start zooming in

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:46.130 align:middle line:90%
with this infinite scroll.

00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And the more I
pinched out, I started

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:51.830 align:middle line:84%
seeing the deeper detail of
the structured code of reality.

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And there were little mice
with hats for some reason,

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:59.740 align:middle line:84%
building the infrastructure
of this DMT verse.

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:01.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In your mind.

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:03.910 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: If that was
my mind, maybe my mind

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:07.250 align:middle line:84%
stepped out of this body
and into the DMT verse.

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:10.690 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, is I think reality
is a lot stranger than most

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:12.200 align:middle line:90%
people give it credit for.

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think for feelings of
safety, the scientific community

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:21.360 align:middle line:84%
out there, they say,
whoa, let's just

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.650 align:middle line:84%
assume that reality
is reductionist.

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:26.040 align:middle line:84%
There's antecedent causation,
meaning the only thing

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:29.440 align:middle line:84%
that causes what happens today
is what happened yesterday.

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:31.920 align:middle line:84%
That's a safe feeling,
because then we

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.800 align:middle line:84%
get the feeling that we know
how to understand and thereby

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.430 align:middle line:90%
control reality.

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:38.700 align:middle line:84%
I think what's
happening in science now

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:40.380 align:middle line:84%
is we're starting
to realize most

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:44.170 align:middle line:84%
of our fundamental assumptions
of what reality is are false.

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:46.180 align:middle line:90%
So what does DMT teaching us?

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:51.610 align:middle line:84%
That this space of DMT might
be yet another simulation,

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:54.660 align:middle line:84%
whereas baseline sober
reality might just

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:56.770 align:middle line:90%
be another simulation as well.

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:59.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is DMT a reality?

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:03.270 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: It might be a key
into an experiential field

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:04.330 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:07.560 align:middle line:84%
My personal take
on reality is that

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:11.710 align:middle line:84%
the current scientific community
says reality is a fact.

00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:15.900 align:middle line:84%
But reality cannot be seen as
a fact because there's nothing

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:19.880 align:middle line:84%
outside of it that we know that
can reference it or measure it.

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:22.690 align:middle line:84%
So we can't actually
say with any certainty

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:24.080 align:middle line:90%
that reality is a fact.

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:26.390 align:middle line:84%
Reality seems to be
more like a story.

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:29.090 align:middle line:84%
It unfolds through a
sequence of events,

00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:31.910 align:middle line:84%
and there are stories
nested within stories.

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:35.710 align:middle line:10%
DMT seems to be a
key that brings us

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:40.720 align:middle line:10%
into a vastly more structured
and inhabited place

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:44.530 align:middle line:10%
with intelligent beings
than here, because we

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:45.950 align:middle line:10%
call this mundane.

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:48.830 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps if we spent more
time in the DMT space,

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:50.750 align:middle line:84%
we would feel that
that's mundane.

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:54.010 align:middle line:84%
But that's why there are these
new studies out of Imperial

00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:56.170 align:middle line:84%
College London that
are bringing people

00:23:56.170 --> 00:23:59.800 align:middle line:84%
into the DMT space for longer
periods of time to do what?

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:03.340 align:middle line:84%
To study if this space
is actually real.

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:06.550 align:middle line:84%
Because we don't know yet,
we don't have enough evidence

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:09.140 align:middle line:84%
to say that it's just a
distortion of our mind,

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:12.040 align:middle line:84%
because we don't have a
working model of the mind

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:13.790 align:middle line:90%
that's foolproof.

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:15.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why aren't
they studying this

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:17.700 align:middle line:90%
after all these years?

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:18.780 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Well--

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:19.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why not?

00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:21.130 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: --I think
the main reason

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:25.330 align:middle line:84%
is because the scientific
community is driven by money.

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And those who know how to
generate or propagate money

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:30.758 align:middle line:84%
to study things, they
want to know what

00:24:30.758 --> 00:24:32.050 align:middle line:90%
they're going to get out of it.

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:34.530 align:middle line:84%
If they're going to throw
millions of dollars at studying

00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:38.820 align:middle line:84%
DMT, the people who have
historically put money

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:42.250 align:middle line:84%
into scientific studies that
would cost millions of dollars,

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:45.390 align:middle line:84%
they want to know, is there a
product that I can sell that I

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:49.440 align:middle line:84%
can make all that money
back plus 10x, 20x, 30x.

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're getting to the
place where some of my friends,

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:54.690 align:middle line:84%
I'll keep them
unnamed, but they're

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:57.790 align:middle line:84%
putting large amounts of
money into DMT studies.

00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And they're privately
funding it with no hope

00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:03.420 align:middle line:84%
of a return on investment,
simply because they

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.880 align:middle line:84%
want to ask the deeper
questions that scientists

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:07.210 align:middle line:90%
should be asking.

00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:10.600 align:middle line:84%
And that is, what is the
fundamental nature of reality.

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:14.325 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's unusual for
them to do that, isn't it?

00:25:14.325 --> 00:25:17.640 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: For these
private investors, no,

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:22.170 align:middle line:84%
because I think for the science
community, yes because, again,

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:24.240 align:middle line:84%
they want the
feeling of control.

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:26.240 align:middle line:84%
How can I make sure
I make more money

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.530 align:middle line:90%
after the experiment is done.

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:32.030 align:middle line:84%
But these private investors that
are worth hundreds of millions

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:36.090 align:middle line:84%
of dollars, they'll put a couple
million dollars into a study,

00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:38.250 align:middle line:84%
whether their name
is on it or not.

00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:39.960 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes their
name's not even on it,

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:42.300 align:middle line:84%
but they just want
to ask the questions,

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:45.350 align:middle line:84%
and they want reputable
scientific institutions

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:48.720 align:middle line:84%
to ask these questions,
too, because Rick Strassman,

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:52.320 align:middle line:84%
we have Stuart Hameroff,
John Chavez from DMT quest,

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:55.760 align:middle line:84%
whom I've worked with, these are
people who are like, let's just

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:58.910 align:middle line:84%
see how much money we can
scoop together and start asking

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:02.870 align:middle line:84%
real questions and get
science back on board with not

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:04.560 align:middle line:84%
the agenda of how
can we make money,

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:06.215 align:middle line:84%
but how can we
understand ourselves

00:26:06.215 --> 00:26:07.465 align:middle line:90%
and our place in the universe.

00:26:07.465 --> 00:26:11.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ben, what is
extended state DMT?

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:15.120 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: That is what has been
going on for a couple of years

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:16.630 align:middle line:90%
at Imperial College London.

00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:19.840 align:middle line:84%
So, as the name should
suggest, as I said,

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:23.370 align:middle line:84%
DMT take 5 to 10
minutes and you're back.

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:25.810 align:middle line:84%
And you're so back that you
don't feel weird anymore,

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:27.185 align:middle line:84%
other than the
fact that you just

00:26:27.185 --> 00:26:28.413 align:middle line:90%
had the craziest experience.

00:26:28.413 --> 00:26:30.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you're
normal when you come back?

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:31.330 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: 100%.

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:32.760 align:middle line:84%
They call it the
lunch man's high

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:36.570 align:middle line:84%
because you could do it on your
lunch break and you're not--

00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:38.800 align:middle line:84%
there's no recovery
period afterwards.

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.510 align:middle line:90%
Once you're back, you're back.

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:44.070 align:middle line:84%
But beyond that,
the state of DMT

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:46.660 align:middle line:84%
lasts a very short
amount of time.

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And this was very maddening to
people who got past that door

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:54.480 align:middle line:84%
that I mentioned into that
structured reality that's

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.740 align:middle line:84%
inhabited by highly
intelligent beings.

00:26:56.740 --> 00:27:00.300 align:middle line:84%
Imagine coming face to face
with some of the most highly

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:03.090 align:middle line:84%
intelligent beings,
and then by the time

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:05.110 align:middle line:84%
you realize, oh, I
should ask a question,

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:07.020 align:middle line:84%
you're being ripped
back out of that room

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:09.870 align:middle line:90%
because the DMT is wearing off.

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:13.730 align:middle line:84%
Extended state DMT is
intravenously infusing you

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:17.480 align:middle line:84%
with a high amount of DMT to
keep you inside that room,

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.420 align:middle line:84%
basically so you can ask
these beings questions,

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:22.940 align:middle line:84%
and you can come back with
information about the space

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:25.310 align:middle line:90%
and the beings inside the space.

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:26.436 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's fascinating.

00:27:26.436 --> 00:27:29.090 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: It's, I think,
the most fascinating thing

00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:32.150 align:middle line:84%
in science right now,
because it's really--

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:34.950 align:middle line:84%
psychedelics are very
fascinating, but DMT,

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:39.470 align:middle line:84%
specifically, the fact that our
brain produces it all the time,

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:41.910 align:middle line:84%
we should know why
it's in our brain.

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:45.030 align:middle line:84%
We should know what happens
when we massively upregulate it,

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:45.830 align:middle line:90%
and why.

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:49.340 align:middle line:84%
We should know why it brings
us to this very same room

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:54.450 align:middle line:84%
every single time that DMT in
ayahuasca doesn't take us to.

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:56.780 align:middle line:84%
There's DMT in ayahuasca,
but then there's

00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:00.510 align:middle line:84%
also other alkaloids, and it
doesn't take us to this room.

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:05.550 align:middle line:84%
There was yopo, way back in
the day in South America,

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:07.410 align:middle line:90%
there was this green snuff.

00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:09.110 align:middle line:84%
They would insufflate
it up their nose,

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:11.240 align:middle line:84%
and they would have
a DMT experience.

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:13.490 align:middle line:90%
But that's very intense.

00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:15.490 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't take
you to this same room.

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:18.220 align:middle line:84%
So intravenously
or smoked seemed

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:21.700 align:middle line:84%
to be the two ways
of imbibing DMT

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:23.630 align:middle line:90%
that brings you to this room.

00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's the very thing
that Imperial College London,

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:29.860 align:middle line:84%
Johns Hopkins University,
Medicinal Mindfulness, and DMT

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:32.050 align:middle line:84%
quest and my friend
Danny Goler, are really

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:35.300 align:middle line:84%
interested asking about
N, N-Dimethyltryptamine.

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:36.680 align:middle line:90%
What is this room?

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:37.850 align:middle line:90%
How do we study it.

00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:39.530 align:middle line:90%
Are these beings real.

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:42.310 align:middle line:84%
Where do they go when we're
not on high amounts of DMT?

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:44.060 align:middle line:90%
Are they still right around us?

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:45.920 align:middle line:90%
Do they care that we're here?

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.980 align:middle line:84%
Do they care that we're in
their space when we go there?

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:50.840 align:middle line:84%
Because some of them
are not so nice.

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:52.730 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
like tricksters.

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:55.180 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are curious
about why we're there

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:58.190 align:middle line:84%
and that we see them like,
oh, wow, you finally see us.

00:28:58.190 --> 00:29:00.740 align:middle line:84%
Some of them, they
want to mess with us.

00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:04.520 align:middle line:84%
So these aren't just angelic
beings or demonic beings.

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:07.250 align:middle line:84%
It's not just two different
sides of the polarity.

00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:08.550 align:middle line:90%
It's almost like humans.

00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:09.630 align:middle line:90%
They have temperaments.

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:11.010 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes they're curious.

00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:13.710 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they're just
annoyed by our presence.

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:17.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many different
entities are there, three?

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:18.930 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: There are several.

00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:21.540 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to really
say there's only 3,

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:24.770 align:middle line:84%
but there are three
main archetypes that--

00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:26.720 align:middle line:84%
thanks to the
internet, which is odd

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:30.980 align:middle line:84%
because Rick Strassman
studies started right

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:33.000 align:middle line:90%
around the rise of the internet.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And when Rick Strassman studies
about DMT started coming out,

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.550 align:middle line:84%
people started taking DMT
and using the internet

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:44.400 align:middle line:84%
to report their findings of
this space that they go to.

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And so when they
go into this space,

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:49.640 align:middle line:84%
they report meeting these
beings, and some of them

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:50.940 align:middle line:90%
are elves.

00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Now they call them clockwork
elves or machine elves

00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:56.700 align:middle line:90%
because they're not biological.

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:59.390 align:middle line:84%
Parts of them look biological,
but then other parts of them

00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:04.700 align:middle line:84%
look technological, like machine
or synthetic or crystalline.

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:06.920 align:middle line:90%
And we don't exactly know why.

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:08.930 align:middle line:84%
But the elves are
like tricksters.

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:09.740 align:middle line:90%
They're playful.

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:11.470 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they like
messing with you

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:13.970 align:middle line:84%
like a friend that likes
pushing your buttons.

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:16.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does everybody
report seeing the same thing?

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:17.590 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Sometimes.

00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:18.623 align:middle line:90%
They report seeing--

00:30:18.623 --> 00:30:19.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's weird.

00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:20.340 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: --elves.

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:21.560 align:middle line:90%
And elves like beings.

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And when thousands of people
online were reporting,

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:25.940 align:middle line:90%
yeah, I saw elves.

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:27.140 align:middle line:90%
I saw elves, too.

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:28.310 align:middle line:90%
Were they about this big?

00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:29.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, roughly.

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.190 align:middle line:90%
And did they have weird bodies.

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:32.030 align:middle line:90%
Were they tinkering?

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:33.680 align:middle line:90%
Were they building technologies?

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:35.540 align:middle line:84%
Crystalline mechanical
technologies?

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:36.340 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:37.140 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:39.260 align:middle line:84%
Now we have to ask
some deeper questions.

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:41.240 align:middle line:84%
Why are there elves
in this space?

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:42.770 align:middle line:90%
Why are there like tricksters?

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Why do they have a
specific demeanor

00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:46.360 align:middle line:84%
that you can report
back, and thousands

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:48.010 align:middle line:84%
of people who never
met one another

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:49.520 align:middle line:90%
are saying the same things.

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:53.420 align:middle line:84%
There's mantid beings, so they
have bodies like praying mantis.

00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:56.680 align:middle line:84%
There are thousands of
times bigger than however

00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:58.460 align:middle line:90%
big you are in that space.

00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:00.800 align:middle line:84%
They have iridescent
colors to them.

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:02.210 align:middle line:90%
They're very calm.

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:04.450 align:middle line:84%
They can be menacing
because of their size

00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:06.540 align:middle line:84%
and their vast
intelligence, but they

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:10.800 align:middle line:84%
seem to just be observant like
they are ancient intelligences

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.070 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:15.070 align:middle line:84%
I have some personal stories
of encountering them.

00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing is
they will answer questions--

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:22.860 align:middle line:84%
for me, this was my experience,
if you ask your questions

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:26.820 align:middle line:84%
wisely, if you're just asking
a dumb question that you could

00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:29.490 align:middle line:84%
ask anybody back here
in sober reality,

00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:31.150 align:middle line:90%
they'll just remain silent.

00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:34.840 align:middle line:84%
But if you can really formulate
a meaningful, valuable question,

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:36.460 align:middle line:90%
then they'll answer you.

00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:37.499 align:middle line:90%
That's fascinating.

00:31:37.499 --> 00:31:38.957 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
also light beings.

00:31:38.957 --> 00:31:39.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The whole thing is.

00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:41.470 align:middle line:84%
I want to get into your
stories in a moment,

00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:43.950 align:middle line:84%
but we have a brief
clip that looks

00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:46.410 align:middle line:84%
at some of the artistic
representations

00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:47.440 align:middle line:90%
of these entities.

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.760 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:51.724 align:middle line:90%
[BACKGROUND MUSIC]

00:31:51.724 --> 00:32:16.960 align:middle line:90%


00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:18.850 align:middle line:90%
Ben, that's incredible.

00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:21.020 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: That
was done with AI.

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And what's fascinating
about that is AI

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:28.360 align:middle line:84%
seems to understand how to
make visual representations

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:31.340 align:middle line:84%
of the DMT space better
than most artists.

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:33.830 align:middle line:84%
Not all artists, but
better than most.

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Terence McKenna thought that
the psychedelics of the future

00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:41.620 align:middle line:84%
would be more like computers,
and that the computers

00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:43.730 align:middle line:84%
of the future would be
more like psychedelics.

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:45.320 align:middle line:90%
And I found that fascinating.

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:46.490 align:middle line:90%
That was really beautiful.

00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:47.573 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was well done.

00:32:47.573 --> 00:32:51.610 align:middle line:84%
But do people see those
creatures most of the time?

00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:55.460 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Almost every time
that you get past that door,

00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:58.345 align:middle line:84%
you enter an inhabited
structured space.

00:32:58.345 --> 00:33:00.668 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With one of
those things we just saw?

00:33:00.668 --> 00:33:01.960 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Something like that.

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:03.970 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing you
saw were these elves,

00:33:03.970 --> 00:33:06.610 align:middle line:84%
and there was like mechanical
gears moving around.

00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:10.450 align:middle line:84%
It boggles the mind, but
they're highly intelligent.

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:16.620 align:middle line:84%
Some people-- I have friends
that say that AI of the future

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:19.800 align:middle line:84%
might have created
spaces that we can access

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:24.060 align:middle line:84%
on DMT, because there's
also this other theory

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:28.960 align:middle line:84%
that time is less relevant when
you get beyond this reality.

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:32.010 align:middle line:84%
So you can experience the
past, the present, the future

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:34.120 align:middle line:90%
as a simultaneous reality.

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:37.300 align:middle line:84%
So some of what we're seeing
there, some of these beings,

00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:41.680 align:middle line:84%
they may not be present yet
in our conception of time.

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:46.720 align:middle line:84%
But these elves, they have
those gears moving around.

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:49.030 align:middle line:84%
That was a really
interesting representation.

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:51.413 align:middle line:84%
And then the other ones
were the mantid beings.

00:33:51.413 --> 00:33:52.830 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the
funniest things

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:55.620 align:middle line:84%
that I saw there was
one of those praying

00:33:55.620 --> 00:34:00.240 align:middle line:84%
mantis beings was working like a
DJ booth or something like that.

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:02.740 align:middle line:84%
Those are the weird things that
people see in the DMT space.

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:03.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: DJ Mantis.

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:04.340 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right.

00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:05.170 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:10.159 align:middle line:84%
Why are people seeing praying
mantises from Burning Man.

00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:13.130 align:middle line:84%
They're seeing things
that they can relate to.

00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:16.550 align:middle line:84%
And why are these elves
tinkering with technology?

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:19.699 align:middle line:84%
Why aren't they just purely
curious about who we are?

00:34:19.699 --> 00:34:21.940 align:middle line:84%
Because all other
psychedelics, they

00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:23.929 align:middle line:90%
can introduce you to ancestors.

00:34:23.929 --> 00:34:28.400 align:middle line:84%
But those ancestors often
seem to be present with us.

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:32.860 align:middle line:84%
Whereas these beings in
the DMT space, sometimes

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:34.690 align:middle line:84%
they're not even
interested in us.

00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:36.980 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they're
annoyed that we're there.

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:39.620 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they're just like,
yeah, whatever, come follow me.

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:42.199 align:middle line:84%
I followed a mouse one
time, and, in fact,

00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:43.370 align:middle line:90%
there was many mice.

00:34:43.370 --> 00:34:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And then they all turned into
the same big mouse with the hat.

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And it just stared
me up and down

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:52.460 align:middle line:84%
and said, OK, and took off
running as if I should chase it.

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:55.840 align:middle line:84%
And my body was sitting at
the time, so all I had to do

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:59.410 align:middle line:84%
was lean forward and I started
floating towards this mouse.

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And it very much so was like
this very digital infinite zoom

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:08.320 align:middle line:84%
where I'm going into the
space and you can keep zooming

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:10.850 align:middle line:84%
and there's more detail and
more detail and more detail.

00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And I was getting to the
substructure of reality,

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:14.900 align:middle line:90%
but it felt cartoonish.

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:16.430 align:middle line:90%
It felt CGI.

00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:19.280 align:middle line:84%
So I'm personally not
sure what to make of it.

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:22.040 align:middle line:84%
But these beings, the
light beings that you saw,

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:24.080 align:middle line:84%
they're completely
made of light.

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:28.940 align:middle line:84%
They have this childish nature,
not childish, childlike nature,

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:29.870 align:middle line:90%
I should say.

00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:30.890 align:middle line:90%
They're very pure.

00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:31.820 align:middle line:90%
They're innocent.

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:32.810 align:middle line:90%
They're compassionate.

00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:34.480 align:middle line:90%
They're filled with love.

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:36.270 align:middle line:90%
The mantid beings, they're calm.

00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:37.070 align:middle line:90%
They're wise.

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:38.930 align:middle line:90%
But they can be very ominous.

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:40.340 align:middle line:90%
And intimidating.

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:42.200 align:middle line:84%
The elves can be
like tricksters.

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And there are other
beings that go from scary

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:47.380 align:middle line:90%
all the way to awe inspiring.

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:49.510 align:middle line:84%
The only thing is,
we don't know why.

00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know why DMT out
of all the other psychedelics

00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:57.470 align:middle line:84%
brings you to the same space
and introduces you to--

00:35:57.470 --> 00:36:00.860 align:middle line:84%
it seems like the same beings
over and over and over again,

00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:04.660 align:middle line:84%
whereas other psychedelics,
they will introduce you

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:05.570 align:middle line:90%
to an ancestor.

00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:08.410 align:middle line:84%
But somebody sitting right next
to you on the same psychedelic

00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:10.310 align:middle line:90%
will not see that ancestor.

00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:12.560 align:middle line:84%
They'll experience something
completely different.

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:16.130 align:middle line:84%
So why does DMT take you
to a reproducible space?

00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:19.670 align:middle line:84%
That's why science needs
to get involved in this.

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:22.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever had a
situation where you come out

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:27.970 align:middle line:84%
of a DMT experience and you go,
I don't want to do that anymore.

00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:30.250 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Almost every time.

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:32.180 align:middle line:84%
And many psychedelics
can do that.

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:36.200 align:middle line:84%
I think the reason for that is
it's not for the faint of heart.

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:38.660 align:middle line:84%
If you want the wisdom
of the universe,

00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:40.580 align:middle line:84%
there's a rite of
passage involved.

00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:43.940 align:middle line:84%
So all ancestor
shamanic cultures,

00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:46.127 align:middle line:84%
they would send their
children as they

00:36:46.127 --> 00:36:47.710 align:middle line:84%
were going through
puberty before they

00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:49.233 align:middle line:90%
became men and women.

00:36:49.233 --> 00:36:50.650 align:middle line:84%
They would send
their children off

00:36:50.650 --> 00:36:55.750 align:middle line:84%
to do something dangerous
that took some real moxie.

00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:58.590 align:middle line:84%
It took some real might
for them to overcome

00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:01.920 align:middle line:84%
their own internal fear,
to experience something

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:03.370 align:middle line:90%
beyond their fear.

00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's what it means
to step into your own.

00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:10.840 align:middle line:84%
But the psychedelic space
is this isn't your culture.

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:12.450 align:middle line:84%
This isn't your
parents saying, go off

00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:13.950 align:middle line:84%
into the wilderness
for a little bit

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:16.630 align:middle line:84%
and then report back
after a couple of weeks.

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:20.970 align:middle line:84%
This is-- I'm already
on a high amount of DMT,

00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:24.940 align:middle line:84%
and the person sitting
right next to me is saying,

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:26.363 align:middle line:90%
is it really, really intense.

00:37:26.363 --> 00:37:28.780 align:middle line:84%
Yes, this is the most intense
thing I've ever experienced.

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:29.580 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:32.370 align:middle line:84%
Take one more gigantic
hit, and you'll probably

00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:34.440 align:middle line:84%
blast through that
door and you'll

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:36.660 align:middle line:84%
experience something
that you aren't currently

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:38.110 align:middle line:90%
experiencing now.

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:42.760 align:middle line:84%
Yes, most people come back and
they say, that was so scary.

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.800 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I
want to do it again.

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:49.000 align:middle line:84%
But most people will say,
after a little while,

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.950 align:middle line:84%
after they've integrated the
experience, I'm glad I did it.

00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:55.100 align:middle line:84%
Even if I never do it
again, I'm glad I did it

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:58.530 align:middle line:84%
because I witnessed what's
beyond the veil of reality.

00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And once you do that,
you're a changed person.

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:03.710 align:middle line:84%
I've never met anybody
who's done psychedelics

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:05.790 align:middle line:84%
without becoming
a changed person.

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:08.240 align:middle line:84%
I do want to introduce the
caveat that when you're

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:10.460 align:middle line:84%
taking psychedelics,
not just producing it

00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:14.160 align:middle line:84%
inside yourself like Wim
Hof, you need to be careful.

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's far too
many people that just think,

00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:20.240 align:middle line:84%
oh, I saw it online, so I'll
just do a massive amount of DMT.

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:25.380 align:middle line:84%
And they're forgetting that
for tens of thousands of years,

00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:27.870 align:middle line:84%
shamanic cultures
held a safe container.

00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:30.170 align:middle line:84%
There was somebody looking
after your physical body

00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:31.830 align:middle line:84%
while you're journeying
in the astral.

00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:33.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So something
could happen to you?

00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:34.490 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yes.

00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And same thing with
any rite of passage.

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:37.230 align:middle line:90%
It's dangerous.

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:38.580 align:middle line:90%
Psychedelics are dangerous.

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:41.850 align:middle line:84%
If you have a precondition
for schizophrenia,

00:38:41.850 --> 00:38:45.545 align:middle line:84%
psychosis of any kind, if
you're just not in that strong--

00:38:45.545 --> 00:38:46.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: If you a heart ailment.

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:49.860 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Anything, any
precondition whatsoever,

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:53.550 align:middle line:84%
it can push you over the edge
because your psychology runs

00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:54.610 align:middle line:90%
through your genetics.

00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:56.770 align:middle line:84%
It runs through
your entire body.

00:38:56.770 --> 00:38:58.930 align:middle line:84%
So you need to know
what you're doing.

00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:00.430 align:middle line:90%
It's not for the faint of heart.

00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:01.840 align:middle line:90%
It's not just for anybody.

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:04.990 align:middle line:84%
But for those who are
willing and equipped to say,

00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:08.110 align:middle line:84%
yes, I choose to do it the
safe and responsible way,

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:11.370 align:middle line:84%
but I want to go far beyond
where any human has ever

00:39:11.370 --> 00:39:12.400 align:middle line:90%
gone before.

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:15.550 align:middle line:84%
Those are the people that now
science is calling upon saying,

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:17.250 align:middle line:84%
come volunteer, we're
going to put you

00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:20.770 align:middle line:84%
on a massive amount of this
for a long period of time,

00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:22.870 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
study what that is.

00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:25.090 align:middle line:84%
Extended state DMT
is one of them.

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:29.430 align:middle line:84%
And John Chavez from
DMT quest is really

00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:31.590 align:middle line:84%
studying why does
our brain produce it.

00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And what questions
they're asking

00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:37.390 align:middle line:84%
is, can you come back with
information about that space.

00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:40.320 align:middle line:84%
So really these
scientists are signing up

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:44.070 align:middle line:84%
these adventurous pioneers
to go into this space that's

00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:47.370 align:middle line:84%
scary to get to just like
all pioneers have always

00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:48.960 align:middle line:90%
had to experience.

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And to keep their
bearings about them,

00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:55.540 align:middle line:84%
not just go there and lose
themselves to their amazement,

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:58.740 align:middle line:84%
but to really ask questions,
to study it, and then

00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:02.980 align:middle line:84%
come back and recall what you
experienced in that space,

00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:08.310 align:middle line:84%
so we can start building a model
here of what there actually is.

00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:10.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is anybody
else studying this?

00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:13.350 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: All I know is
Imperial College London has done

00:40:13.350 --> 00:40:14.740 align:middle line:90%
studies for a couple of years.

00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:17.650 align:middle line:84%
And they still haven't actually
brought the science out,

00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:19.810 align:middle line:84%
because I don't think they
know what it even means.

00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:22.500 align:middle line:84%
It's starting to shake
the foundation of all

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:24.160 align:middle line:90%
of what we say reality is.

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it scaring them?

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:27.660 align:middle line:90%
The results?

00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: You know who
I think it's scaring,

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:33.420 align:middle line:84%
is the powers that be, if
I were to use that term.

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:35.890 align:middle line:84%
Because the powers
that be have always--

00:40:35.890 --> 00:40:37.950 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter if
it's the pharaohs of old

00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:41.740 align:middle line:84%
or the Wall Street
of present day.

00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:44.580 align:middle line:84%
They like to know
what motivates people

00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:46.770 align:middle line:90%
to behave in a certain way.

00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:50.380 align:middle line:84%
If they know what causes
people to behave a certain way,

00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:53.050 align:middle line:84%
then they feel like they
can control the masses.

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that's
what government

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:56.650 align:middle line:90%
has almost always largely done.

00:40:56.650 --> 00:41:00.580 align:middle line:84%
It keeps you safe, but it
also controls your behavior.

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
psychedelics for 20 years

00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:07.540 align:middle line:84%
was illegal to study at all,
even for science to study it,

00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:11.070 align:middle line:84%
which is very odd, it's one
of the most powerful things

00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:15.160 align:middle line:84%
out there for consciousness
and the study of consciousness.

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:18.520 align:middle line:84%
But we weren't allowed
to study it for 20 years.

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:19.320 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:22.110 align:middle line:84%
Because I think private
interests were studying

00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:24.990 align:middle line:84%
it to see how can we
make sure that this

00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:28.470 align:middle line:84%
doesn't cause people to
want to step out of society

00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:30.760 align:middle line:90%
and say no to our authority.

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:33.090 align:middle line:84%
How can we use the
very same drugs

00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:36.100 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that they
stay in our society?

00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is the idea
of introducing people

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:41.860 align:middle line:84%
into a matrix, a
simulation, if you will,

00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:44.940 align:middle line:84%
where you believe that
the reality you're in

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:47.640 align:middle line:84%
is the only reality
available to you.

00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:49.730 align:middle line:84%
That's what DMT and
these other psychedelics

00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:51.630 align:middle line:84%
are doing is showing
us, wait a minute,

00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:55.200 align:middle line:84%
reality is far more vast
than this sober reality.

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:57.170 align:middle line:90%
So what's out there?

00:41:57.170 --> 00:41:59.360 align:middle line:84%
The powers that
be they're scared

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:03.060 align:middle line:84%
that if average people start
accessing these states,

00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:06.870 align:middle line:84%
it's like another country
coming up with a new weapon.

00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:08.880 align:middle line:84%
They want to be
able to control it.

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:10.650 align:middle line:84%
They want to be able
to keep it secret.

00:42:10.650 --> 00:42:13.710 align:middle line:84%
They want to be able to have
that power for themselves.

00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:15.930 align:middle line:84%
So yes, I think
it scares people.

00:42:15.930 --> 00:42:19.130 align:middle line:84%
But the scientists, the
whole job of science

00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:21.420 align:middle line:90%
is to know why we're here.

00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:22.350 align:middle line:90%
To know who we are.

00:42:22.350 --> 00:42:23.940 align:middle line:90%
To know what our purpose is.

00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:25.860 align:middle line:84%
We need to be asking
these questions.

00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:29.180 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, the science
institutions are a farce.

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:32.478 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're talking
about the New World Order.

00:42:32.478 --> 00:42:34.020 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: For lack
of a better term,

00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:35.820 align:middle line:84%
it's the New World
Order, for sure.

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And where the New World Order,
if I were to use that term,

00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:45.340 align:middle line:84%
is moving us is into a
technologically driven society

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:48.140 align:middle line:90%
that is like a Skinner's box.

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And BF Skinner was a
behavioral psychologist,

00:42:50.570 --> 00:42:56.120 align:middle line:84%
and he found that through
invisible levers of control,

00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:58.390 align:middle line:84%
you can change the
behavior of mammals

00:42:58.390 --> 00:43:02.000 align:middle line:84%
with reward schedules
and punishment schedules.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's technically
what the internet is.

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:07.580 align:middle line:84%
There's a book, Technofeudalism
by Mark Gaffney,

00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:12.280 align:middle line:84%
who shows there's 23 distinct
corollaries between BF Skinner's

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:15.040 align:middle line:84%
work in conditioning
mammals invisibly

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:16.690 align:middle line:90%
to their understanding.

00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And the internet, slot machines,
and scrolling on social media,

00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:25.360 align:middle line:84%
it's the same psychology to
make our behaviors compulsory.

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:27.530 align:middle line:84%
So we don't know
why we're doing it.

00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:29.480 align:middle line:84%
We're just looking
for our reward.

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:30.860 align:middle line:90%
That is the matrix.

00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:35.690 align:middle line:84%
It's just not being in a vat
of goo hooked up to mechanisms.

00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:39.470 align:middle line:84%
It's not understanding that
the internet is intelligent.

00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And it also has
an agenda to keep

00:43:42.830 --> 00:43:46.200 align:middle line:84%
our attention focused on a
very small window of reality.

00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:48.560 align:middle line:84%
That's what the powers that
be or the New World order

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:50.490 align:middle line:90%
have always been trying to do.

00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:52.920 align:middle line:84%
Keep us from seeing
our own power.

00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:56.490 align:middle line:84%
So the real journey, the
real goal of science,

00:43:56.490 --> 00:43:59.790 align:middle line:84%
is to know the self and to
understand how powerful we are.

00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:02.960 align:middle line:84%
That to me is the most scary
thing to the New World Order,

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:05.760 align:middle line:90%
is us waking up to our power.

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:07.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If I told
you I do not want

00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:11.750 align:middle line:84%
to try DMT because I'm
concerned about what

00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:17.300 align:middle line:84%
I might experience, my health,
would you say I'm off base?

00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:22.410 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: No, I would say
if you weren't scared at all,

00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:23.970 align:middle line:90%
I would say you're off base.

00:44:23.970 --> 00:44:29.750 align:middle line:84%
You should feel trepidation of
stepping into a universe where

00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:33.860 align:middle line:84%
everyone's saying it's going to
be scary, but you'll survive.

00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:35.550 align:middle line:84%
It's like jumping
off a diving board.

00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:37.640 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's telling you,
you're going to survive.

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:39.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Altered states.

00:44:39.350 --> 00:44:43.690 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Right, and when you
stare into that 40 foot cliff

00:44:43.690 --> 00:44:45.170 align:middle line:84%
and you know that
water is there,

00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:46.550 align:middle line:84%
you've seen other
people jumping,

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:49.630 align:middle line:84%
you know you can survive it, but
something inside your body is

00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:50.570 align:middle line:90%
saying don't.

00:44:50.570 --> 00:44:52.880 align:middle line:84%
That's a healthy
mechanism to have.

00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:55.580 align:middle line:84%
So if you George, were
telling me, I have no fear,

00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:58.700 align:middle line:84%
I just want to go as far
as I can, then I would say,

00:44:58.700 --> 00:44:59.690 align:middle line:90%
something's off.

00:44:59.690 --> 00:45:03.680 align:middle line:84%
We need to check whether you are
a fit for this journey or not.

00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:07.420 align:middle line:84%
I think having
healthy fear is not

00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:11.840 align:middle line:84%
just the sign of you having
all your screws tightened.

00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:14.710 align:middle line:84%
I think what it also
shows you is that you are

00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:17.000 align:middle line:90%
willing to overcome yourself.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.420 align:middle line:84%
You're willing to overcome
your own obstacles

00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:23.270 align:middle line:84%
and still peer beyond the
veil, which is very scary.

00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:26.960 align:middle line:84%
So I do not think psychedelics
are for everybody.

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:29.180 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, we're all on
psychedelics right now.

00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:31.010 align:middle line:90%
We all have DMT in our brain.

00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:33.130 align:middle line:84%
It's just not at
the loading dose

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:36.170 align:middle line:84%
enough to get us to that
door that I keep mentioning.

00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:38.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
track your work, Ben?

00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:41.700 align:middle line:10%
>>STEWART: You need to go
to benjosephstewart.com,

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:44.250 align:middle line:10%
and that's where you can find
all the films that I've done.

00:45:44.250 --> 00:45:47.370 align:middle line:10%
Almost every film that
I've done is free online,

00:45:47.370 --> 00:45:50.150 align:middle line:10%
because I really just
want to impact society

00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:53.010 align:middle line:10%
in the best way possible
to make the best choices,

00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:56.780 align:middle line:10%
not just for the individual, but
for the health of our species

00:45:56.780 --> 00:45:58.650 align:middle line:10%
and the planet
that we rely upon.

00:45:58.650 --> 00:46:01.203 align:middle line:10%
So go to benjosephstewart.com,
and you'll also

00:46:01.203 --> 00:46:02.870 align:middle line:10%
see that I'm making
a film course, which

00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:06.350 align:middle line:10%
is teaching other people how to
tell the most important stories

00:46:06.350 --> 00:46:09.140 align:middle line:10%
that are connected to
our soul, to move society

00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:11.430 align:middle line:10%
without an agenda,
without propaganda,

00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:13.550 align:middle line:10%
but simply to tell
the stories that

00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:16.380 align:middle line:10%
have real, universal
principles and values.

00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:18.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ben, Thanks for
being on Beyond Belief.

00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:19.920 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: It's so
much fun, George.

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:22.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what would
you do if you tried DMT?

00:46:22.610 --> 00:46:25.400 align:middle line:90%
And what would you experience?

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And would you really want
to come back and tell us?

00:46:28.850 --> 00:46:30.590 align:middle line:90%
Think about that.

00:46:30.590 --> 00:46:33.020 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
