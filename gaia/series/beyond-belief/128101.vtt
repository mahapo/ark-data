>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:50.420 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.810 align:middle line:10%
And what you are about to
hear on this program today

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.010 align:middle line:10%
may be one of the
most shocking stories

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.280 align:middle line:10%
you will ever hear done by
investigator Robert Hastings.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.090 align:middle line:10%
>>Aliens don't want humans
to having nuclear weapons.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.160 align:middle line:84%
That's according to
Robert Hastings, who

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.090 align:middle line:84%
has spent the past
40 years compiling

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.220 align:middle line:84%
evidence of UFOs disrupting
Earth's nuclear weapon's sites.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.090 align:middle line:10%
He has gathered reports through
Freedom of Information Act

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.690 align:middle line:10%
and has spoken to more than
150 military personnel who have

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.390 align:middle line:10%
detailed their experiences.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.100 align:middle line:84%
All the information points to
one undeniable conclusion--

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.080 align:middle line:84%
beings with superior
technology are seriously

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.120 align:middle line:84%
concerned about our
nuclear weaponry.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.900 align:middle line:84%
Robert explains his findings
today on "Beyond Belief."

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What an incredible
story done by researcher Robert

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.360 align:middle line:90%
Hastings.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.110 align:middle line:84%
He's also author of the
book "UFOs and Nukes."

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.840 align:middle line:10%
And Robert, welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:44.970 align:middle line:10%
Good to have you with us.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:45.760 align:middle line:10%
>>ROBERT HASTINGS: Thank you.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.550 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: This is an
incredible subject.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.010 align:middle line:84%
It's incredible because
this is actually

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:56.030 align:middle line:84%
happening at our missile sites
all around the United States.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's happening in
other countries as well.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.970 align:middle line:84%
How did you get
involved with this?

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HASTINGS: My father
was career Air Force.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.390 align:middle line:10%
And in 1966, 1967, we were
stationed at Malmstrom Air

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.039 align:middle line:10%
Force Base Montana.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.180 align:middle line:10%
That is, was then, and is
today a nuclear missile base.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.210 align:middle line:84%
There were rumors circulating
about unknown aerial objects

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.210 align:middle line:84%
maneuvering around
the missile sites.

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.410 align:middle line:84%
That's really all
we knew at the time.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.410 align:middle line:10%
I happened to witness five
of these objects on radar

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.830 align:middle line:10%
because I had a job at
the air traffic control

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.250 align:middle line:10%
tower three nights a week
after high school as a janitor.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.175 align:middle line:10%
And one night, I just
happened to witness a tracking

00:02:33.175 --> 00:02:35.540 align:middle line:10%
of five unknown targets.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.580 align:middle line:84%
So we had suspicions
something was going on.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And by the early
'70s, other people

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.720 align:middle line:84%
like Raymond Fowler,
researcher Raymond Fowler,

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.960 align:middle line:84%
came out and said UFOs are
hovering over our ICBMs

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.030 align:middle line:90%
and causing them to malfunction.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.060 align:middle line:84%
That was what
sparked my interest

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.180 align:middle line:84%
in beginning to seek out and
interview military veterans

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.040 align:middle line:84%
to see how often this had
gone on, where it had gone on,

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.840 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have talked to
about 150 military people,

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:01.770 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HASTINGS: Nearly
160 at this point.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.330 align:middle line:84%
>>HASTINGS: Ranging from
nuclear missile launch officers,

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.690 align:middle line:84%
to targeting officers, to
missile security personnel,

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.002 align:middle line:90%
radar personnel.

00:03:11.002 --> 00:03:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they all
tell you similar stories?

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HASTINGS: Absolutely.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.030 align:middle line:84%
Every missile base in the US,
all through the Cold War era

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.432 align:middle line:84%
and even beyond, have been
repeatedly visited by UFOs.

00:03:22.432 --> 00:03:24.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Paint a
verbal picture for us.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And let's assume
for a moment you're

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.850 align:middle line:84%
one of these military folks
watching our nuke sites.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.030 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.210 align:middle line:84%
What do we see when
these UFOs come in?

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.650 align:middle line:84%
>>HASTINGS: If you're one
of the launch officers,

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.260 align:middle line:84%
they work in pairs in the
underground launch capsules.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.750 align:middle line:84%
They control 10
nuclear missiles.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.490 align:middle line:84%
They get a call from a guard
at ground level saying,

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.776 align:middle line:84%
there's a strange
object hovering over

00:03:47.776 --> 00:03:49.150 align:middle line:84%
either the missile
launch control

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.650 align:middle line:84%
facility or one of the missile
sites out in the field.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And before the launch
officers can say,

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.430 align:middle line:84%
what, suddenly, their missiles
begin malfunctioning, dropping

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.580 align:middle line:90%
offline.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And generally, within
24 hours, they're

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.250 align:middle line:84%
debriefed by an
OSI agent, Office

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.050 align:middle line:90%
of Special Investigations.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.880 align:middle line:84%
Most of them are
sworn to secrecy

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.070 align:middle line:84%
in a written form, a national
security nondisclosure

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.080 align:middle line:90%
statement.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.750 align:middle line:84%
Others are just verbally
warned that this didn't happen.

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.459 align:middle line:90%
Don't ever talk about it.

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And decades pass
before these people

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.390 align:middle line:84%
are willing to come
forward and talk to me.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.690 align:middle line:84%
And again, I remind people
I'm just the messenger.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm just accurately
conveying what

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.100 align:middle line:84%
these witnesses said, what
the documents relating

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.880 align:middle line:90%
to the events have said.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.630 align:middle line:84%
These persons were entrusted
by the US government

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.090 align:middle line:84%
to initiate World War
III if it'd come to that.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.340 align:middle line:84%
They were the ones that would
have turned their keys--

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're
trained for that.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.380 align:middle line:90%
>>HASTINGS: Exactly.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.080 align:middle line:84%
Credible sources-- you know,
psychologically stable,

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.590 align:middle line:90%
high integrity.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And nearly 150-- now over
150 have come forward

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.820 align:middle line:84%
and said, UFOs shut down
my nuclear missiles.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it has
still happening?

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.370 align:middle line:84%
>>HASTINGS: I have strong
suspicions that it is.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't approach
active duty Air Force

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.530 align:middle line:84%
personnel because I don't want
to ruin anyone's Air Force

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:05.480 align:middle line:90%
career.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.450 align:middle line:84%
But I am in touch with
about a dozen civilians

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.180 align:middle line:84%
who live up in Montana in
the Malmstrom missile field.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.550 align:middle line:84%
They have nuclear missile
silos on their property.

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.520 align:middle line:84%
This small network of people
contact me and tell me

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.060 align:middle line:90%
when something's going on.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.610 align:middle line:84%
I have reports from multiple
individuals of UFO activity

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.770 align:middle line:84%
at the sites within
the last two years.

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the message
you think these UFOs that

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.730 align:middle line:84%
are under the command of
obviously intelligent control--

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.417 align:middle line:84%
what's the message they're
trying to impart here?

00:05:35.417 --> 00:05:36.750 align:middle line:90%
>>HASTINGS: It's anyone's guess.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.430 align:middle line:84%
My optimistic
opinion is that it is

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.020 align:middle line:84%
a race of intelligent beings
from somewhere else who've

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.030 align:middle line:90%
monitored the Cold War.

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.310 align:middle line:84%
They know that humankind
had, for the first time,

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.220 align:middle line:84%
weapons capable of precipitating
our own destruction,

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.460 align:middle line:84%
not only of the civilization
that we've created,

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.620 align:middle line:84%
but radioactively
poisoning the planet--

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.670 align:middle line:84%
very dramatic developments
in human history.

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.900 align:middle line:84%
I think they're wagging a
finger at us and the Russians.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.070 align:middle line:84%
We know from documents
that were smuggled out

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.500 align:middle line:84%
of the Soviet Union,
actually Russia,

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.090 align:middle line:84%
via George Knapp,
your colleague.

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HASTINGS: We know the Russians
were having the same problems

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.210 align:middle line:90%
at their missile silos.

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.580 align:middle line:84%
So my assumption, my
hope, is that these beings

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.644 align:middle line:90%
are saying, think twice.

00:06:17.644 --> 00:06:18.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're watching you.

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:19.610 align:middle line:90%
>>HASTINGS: Right.

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.190 align:middle line:10%
Now, I have to say-- and I
tell my lecture audiences

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.870 align:middle line:10%
this-- that is my best guess.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.600 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
these beings may

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.730 align:middle line:84%
have their own interests
here, their own bases,

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:32.630 align:middle line:84%
their own projects, their
own whatever activities.

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And we would, if there
were a nuclear war,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.200 align:middle line:84%
would disrupt what they
have going on in addition

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.050 align:middle line:90%
to disrupting humankind.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So maybe
what they're doing too

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.900 align:middle line:84%
could be a defensive
mechanism on their part.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:48.140 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they want to shut us down
to avoid us attacking them.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.380 align:middle line:84%
>>HASTINGS: I don't think--
their technology seems

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.370 align:middle line:90%
to be so advanced.

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.370 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
radar data, their craft

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.930 align:middle line:84%
can fly thousands
of miles an hour,

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:59.210 align:middle line:84%
do right angle turns
instantaneous, or hover.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they're
worried about our nukes.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.570 align:middle line:84%
They probably have the ability
to neutralize anything we have.

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:07.336 align:middle line:84%
I'd think they are more
concerned about hopefully us

00:07:07.336 --> 00:07:09.460 align:middle line:84%
as well, but they probably
have their own interests

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.650 align:middle line:84%
here that we would disrupt
if there were a full scale

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:12.460 align:middle line:90%
nuclear war.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When they leave,
do we go back online?

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.280 align:middle line:84%
Do things begin to work
again at these sites?

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.614 align:middle line:84%
>>HASTINGS: In most
cases, my sources,

00:07:20.614 --> 00:07:22.030 align:middle line:84%
the missile
maintenance personnel,

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:24.980 align:middle line:84%
say they have to come out and
actually change out hardware.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.730 align:middle line:84%
The guidance and control
systems are usually screwed up.

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:28.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Geez.

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:29.946 align:middle line:84%
>>HASTINGS: Some
of the people say

00:07:29.946 --> 00:07:34.210 align:middle line:84%
circuitry is literally melted,
as if by high temperature.

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:36.586 align:middle line:84%
In other cases, the hardware
just simply doesn't work.

00:07:36.586 --> 00:07:38.210 align:middle line:84%
So they have to
replace what are called

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:42.840 align:middle line:84%
CANS-- GNC CANS, Guidance
and Control System hardware.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And then everything
functions normally.

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:46.960 align:middle line:84%
There are a handful
of cases where

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.549 align:middle line:84%
seemingly, no outside
effort is applied

00:07:50.549 --> 00:07:52.090 align:middle line:84%
to bringing the
missiles back online,

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:55.110 align:middle line:84%
but they suddenly start
working on their own accord.

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:57.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If the Russians
had sent a helicopter

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.637 align:middle line:84%
or jets over our sites, we would
have done something about that.

00:08:01.637 --> 00:08:02.470 align:middle line:90%
>>HASTINGS: Exactly.

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:06.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In this case, did
these UFOs just appear?

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:10.470 align:middle line:84%
Or why aren't we even
attempting to shoot them down?

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:13.570 align:middle line:84%
>>HASTINGS: It all
happens so quickly.

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:16.650 align:middle line:84%
It's a question of the
security guards suddenly

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:19.180 align:middle line:84%
see a little point
of light in the sky.

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:20.532 align:middle line:90%
And a second or two later--

00:08:20.532 --> 00:08:21.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're right there.

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.156 align:middle line:84%
>>HASTINGS: --40
feet in diameter,

00:08:23.156 --> 00:08:25.420 align:middle line:90%
hovering over the front gate.

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:26.920 align:middle line:90%
They're panic stricken.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.250 align:middle line:84%
One of them finally calls down
to the launch control capsule

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:33.640 align:middle line:84%
underground, and tells the
commanders what's going on.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.809 align:middle line:84%
At which point, in some
cases, the missiles

00:08:35.809 --> 00:08:36.919 align:middle line:90%
begin malfunctioning.

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:41.120 align:middle line:84%
In other cases, there seems to
be no impact on the missiles.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.419 align:middle line:84%
And then they're gone, as
quickly as they appear.

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:47.980 align:middle line:84%
So before anyone can even
react, it's all over.

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's your gut tell
you about what's going on?

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:51.956 align:middle line:84%
>>HASTINGS: I think
clearly, we're

00:08:51.956 --> 00:08:54.620 align:middle line:84%
dealing with at least one
intelligent race from somewhere

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:55.550 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:58.150 align:middle line:84%
I do think that
they are attempting

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:00.600 align:middle line:84%
to send a message to
us and the Russians

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.350 align:middle line:90%
and any other nuclear power.

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:04.800 align:middle line:84%
But we know there were
sightings in Pakistan and India

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.890 align:middle line:84%
when they were
saber-rattling in 1998.

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:11.460 align:middle line:84%
So anyone who has nukes is
being visited by these craft.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And at least in the case of
the Americans and the Russians,

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.650 align:middle line:84%
there were disruptions of
the missiles themselves.

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:20.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think, Robert,
that if any nation launched

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.920 align:middle line:84%
against another nation, that
these UFOs would literally

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.190 align:middle line:90%
take the missile down?

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>>HASTINGS: One would hope so.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.780 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know.

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:31.290 align:middle line:84%
If you want to get into the
Big Sur case at this point,

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:35.100 align:middle line:84%
but we have at least one case
according to two former Air

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:39.590 align:middle line:84%
Force officers, Dr. Bob Jacobs
and Dr. Florenz Mansmann,

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:43.960 align:middle line:84%
who were at Vandenberg Air
Force Base California in 1964.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.320 align:middle line:84%
They say that they were
filming missile tests

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.080 align:middle line:84%
with a high-powered
telescopic camera,

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.870 align:middle line:90%
looking at missile performance.

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And on one of these launches,
we think, in September of '64,

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:59.130 align:middle line:84%
they actually captured a
disk-shaped object with a dome

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:02.810 align:middle line:84%
fly into camera frame, circle
a dummy nuclear warhead that

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:05.250 align:middle line:84%
was flying at 8,000
miles per hour

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:08.830 align:middle line:84%
down range to the
Pacific proving ground.

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:13.420 align:middle line:84%
Then this object circled the
warhead and at four junctures,

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:16.440 align:middle line:84%
according to Bob Jacobs
and Florenz Mansmann,

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:21.570 align:middle line:84%
beams of light that resemble
sort of like lightning bolts

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:23.520 align:middle line:84%
came out of the
object to the warhead.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.870 align:middle line:84%
The warhead begin to
tumble into the ocean,

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:29.550 align:middle line:84%
and the object left the scene
at a high rate of speed.

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:32.700 align:middle line:84%
Both gentlemen say that
when they were debriefed

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.470 align:middle line:84%
about this back
at Vandenberg, CIA

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:39.690 align:middle line:84%
came in, quickly confiscated the
film, said this is top secret.

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:41.520 align:middle line:90%
You will not discuss it.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:46.290 align:middle line:84%
Bob Jacobs kept his secrecy,
his silence, until 1982.

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:48.860 align:middle line:84%
When he published an
article about this,

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.270 align:middle line:90%
he actually got death threats.

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:53.370 align:middle line:84%
So someone was quite concerned
about him going public

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:54.170 align:middle line:90%
with this story.

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:56.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your documentary,
"UFOs and The Nukes,"

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:58.760 align:middle line:84%
you talk a lot about
the Big Sur case.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.698 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:11:00.698 --> 00:11:01.510 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:04.270 align:middle line:10%
-Occasionally, those
aboard the UFOs

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:07.330 align:middle line:10%
did more than watch the tests.

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:11.230 align:middle line:10%
While the exact date
remains uncertain, sometime

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:14.930 align:middle line:10%
in the fall of 1964,
an incident occurred

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:18.030 align:middle line:10%
at Vandenberg Air
Force Base California,

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:21.770 align:middle line:10%
which has come to be the best
known, most astonishing example

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:25.280 align:middle line:10%
of deliberate UFO interference
with our nuclear weapons

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.270 align:middle line:10%
systems.

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:30.450 align:middle line:84%
Although the case is still
classified top secret,

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:33.840 align:middle line:84%
a former Air Force
officer, Dr. Robert Jacobs,

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.810 align:middle line:90%
has openly discussed it.

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:39.230 align:middle line:84%
At the time,
Lieutenant Jacobs, who

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:42.990 align:middle line:84%
was assigned to the 1369th
photographic squadron

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:45.130 align:middle line:84%
and held the title
Officer in Charge

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:47.940 align:middle line:84%
of Photo Instrumentation,
was tasked

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.720 align:middle line:84%
with filming missile launches
from a remote mountaintop

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.990 align:middle line:84%
site on California's
Big Sur coastline

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:58.490 align:middle line:84%
using a powerful
telescopic camera.

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:00.780 align:middle line:84%
The ascending ICBMs
would initially

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:03.600 align:middle line:84%
fill the camera frame,
permitting a detailed

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.390 align:middle line:84%
view of engine
performance, staging,

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:08.740 align:middle line:84%
and other aspects
of a given launch

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:12.740 align:middle line:84%
as they raced out over
the Pacific Ocean.

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:15.770 align:middle line:84%
Following one such test
launch, Lieutenant Jacobs

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:19.090 align:middle line:84%
was unexpectedly told to report
to the office of Major Florenz

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:22.380 align:middle line:84%
Mansmann, a photographic
analyst assigned

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:25.640 align:middle line:84%
to Vandenberg's Office of
the Chief Scientist, First

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.550 align:middle line:90%
Strategic Aerospace division.

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:31.330 align:middle line:84%
Upon arriving, he noticed
two mysterious men

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:36.130 align:middle line:84%
in gray suits, who he later
learned were CIA officers.

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:38.840 align:middle line:84%
A motion picture
projector had been set up.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And without explanation,
Major Mansmann

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:45.010 align:middle line:84%
turned it on, telling
Jacobs, watch this.

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:47.980 align:middle line:84%
Jacobs, later a
university professor,

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:50.510 align:middle line:90%
describes what happened next.

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:52.410 align:middle line:84%
-On the screen was
the film we had shot.

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:54.210 align:middle line:90%
The nose cone separate.

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:56.540 align:middle line:10%
The chaff flew out in front.

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:59.930 align:middle line:10%
We saw this as
obviously reflections

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:02.610 align:middle line:10%
of light rippling like that.

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And then we saw the dummy
warhead flying along.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.530 align:middle line:84%
It's going between 6,000
and 8,000 miles an hour

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:09.380 align:middle line:90%
at that point.

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:12.740 align:middle line:90%
And it's on the fringe of space.

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, into
the frame, an object

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:19.640 align:middle line:84%
flew in, chasing the chaff,
the warhead, and so on,

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:20.640 align:middle line:90%
at the same speed.

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And in polar orbit, it fired a
beam of light at the warhead.

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:27.110 align:middle line:90%
The beam of light struck that.

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:29.850 align:middle line:84%
The object flew up, shot
another beam of light

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:32.200 align:middle line:84%
at the dummy
warhead, went around,

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.895 align:middle line:84%
shot another beam
of light at it,

00:13:33.895 --> 00:13:35.270 align:middle line:84%
went down, shot
a being of light,

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:37.220 align:middle line:84%
and then flew out the
same way it had come in.

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:41.060 align:middle line:84%
At which time, the dummy
warhead fell out of the frame.

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:42.590 align:middle line:90%
The lights came on.

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And Major Mansmann said
to me, were you guys

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:47.610 align:middle line:90%
screwing around up there?

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:49.860 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no, sir.

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:52.230 align:middle line:90%
And he said, what was that?

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And I said, it looks
like we've got a UFO.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And he said,
Lieutenant Jacobs, you

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.810 align:middle line:84%
are never to speak
of this again.

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:02.990 align:middle line:90%
It never happened.

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:06.530 align:middle line:84%
-Decades later, Dr. Mansmann,
by then a researcher

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:09.870 align:middle line:84%
at Stanford University,
informed Dr. Jacobs

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:14.080 align:middle line:84%
that after he had left the room,
the two CIA officers quickly

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.010 align:middle line:84%
confiscated the film of
the amazing incident,

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:21.036 align:middle line:84%
telling Mansmann that it
was classified top secret.

00:14:21.036 --> 00:14:22.392 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:14:22.392 --> 00:14:23.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I got to
tell you, Robert,

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:27.930 align:middle line:84%
that's absolutely riveting--
watching Jacobs talk about what

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:28.730 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And the CIA people who visited
him make this thing even

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:34.620 align:middle line:90%
stranger, doesn't it?

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:37.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HASTINGS: It's clear
that something higher

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:39.630 align:middle line:84%
than the Pentagon is involved
with the confiscation

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:40.680 align:middle line:90%
of evidence.

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.790 align:middle line:90%
And it appears to be the CIA.

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:45.410 align:middle line:84%
I suspect the film went
to what's called NPIC.

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:48.140 align:middle line:84%
That's the National Photo
Interpretation Center,

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:50.710 align:middle line:84%
where-- they're the
group for CIA that

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:53.350 align:middle line:84%
discovered the Soviet
missiles in Cuba

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.580 align:middle line:90%
and briefed Kennedy on that.

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:57.802 align:middle line:84%
But I'm sure they analyzed
that film endlessly

00:14:57.802 --> 00:14:59.260 align:middle line:84%
to try to determine
what they could

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.290 align:middle line:84%
about this craft, its
capabilities, and so forth.

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Jacobs did receive death
threats over the telephone

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:11.010 align:middle line:84%
when he released this story to
the media in the early '80s.

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:14.310 align:middle line:84%
To his credit, he's
been extremely brave,

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:18.690 align:middle line:84%
courageous in sticking to his
story, and is of the opinion,

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:21.230 align:middle line:84%
as am I, that the American
people have a right

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:22.254 align:middle line:90%
to know the facts.

00:15:22.254 --> 00:15:23.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They sure do.

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:26.740 align:middle line:84%
And you wonder if these
occupants, the people who

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:29.930 align:middle line:84%
are controlling these
extraterrestrial craft, if they

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:33.910 align:middle line:84%
may be extraterrestrial-- what
the motive is beyond this.

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:37.710 align:middle line:84%
Is it to simply say,
look what we can do,

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:39.964 align:middle line:84%
or if there's something
stronger here.

00:15:39.964 --> 00:15:41.380 align:middle line:84%
>>HASTINGS: I think
at least that.

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And again, because we know that
they played even handed games

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:48.620 align:middle line:84%
with US and the Soviets-- they
interfered with our weapons

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:51.400 align:middle line:84%
on both sides of the ocean
during the Cold War--

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.940 align:middle line:84%
it's not as if they're
playing favorites.

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:55.900 align:middle line:84%
They do seem to have
an overall interest

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.810 align:middle line:90%
in our nuclear capability.

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:00.720 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the Big Sur case,
it seems as if they're saying,

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:03.550 align:middle line:84%
we can shoot these things
down if we need to.

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:06.570 align:middle line:84%
The question remains if
there is a massive launch

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:08.960 align:middle line:84%
of nuclear weapons on
each side of the ocean

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.370 align:middle line:84%
whether they're capable
of knocking them all down.

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:13.520 align:middle line:84%
But certainly in this
case, they demonstrated

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.860 align:middle line:84%
they could take out a
single nuclear warhead

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:16.810 align:middle line:90%
if they needed to.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:18.351 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wonder
if they're watching

00:16:18.351 --> 00:16:19.480 align:middle line:90%
North Korea these days.

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.188 align:middle line:84%
>>HASTINGS: I am almost
certain they are.

00:16:21.188 --> 00:16:23.230 align:middle line:84%
It's so hard to
get information out

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:26.570 align:middle line:84%
of North Korea because of
its totalitarian nature.

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:27.970 align:middle line:90%
But I'm sure.

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These 150 people
that you've chatted with

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:35.180 align:middle line:84%
and interviewed,
what did they feel?

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:41.520 align:middle line:84%
Did they feel as if this is
being done to protect us,

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.340 align:middle line:84%
or that there's
something else afoot here

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:46.047 align:middle line:84%
that we should be
concerned about?

00:16:46.047 --> 00:16:47.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HASTINGS: Most of
them are convinced

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:49.150 align:middle line:90%
that this is extraterrestrial.

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:52.690 align:middle line:84%
They say that the technology
is so beyond anything we have

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:55.090 align:middle line:90%
or any other country on Earth.

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:58.600 align:middle line:84%
There is a diversity of opinions
across that 150 individuals.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.540 align:middle line:84%
Some of them think
this is a good idea,

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:03.837 align:middle line:84%
that someone seems to be
looking out for us-- in effect,

00:17:03.837 --> 00:17:05.420 align:middle line:84%
that if we're foolish
enough to launch

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:07.650 align:middle line:84%
a nuclear war against
another country,

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:09.859 align:middle line:84%
that someone will step
in from the outside.

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:11.680 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
some people feel

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.720 align:middle line:84%
as if it's a jeopardy
to national security.

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.710 align:middle line:84%
People who feel that we
should have the right

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:18.930 align:middle line:84%
to have nuclear weapons
and use them how we want.

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:21.040 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, in the
military, you're

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.930 align:middle line:84%
going to have some
people who feel that way.

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:24.900 align:middle line:90%
So it's a diversity of opinions.

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:26.609 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And of course,
we are not alone.

00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:29.340 align:middle line:84%
As your documentary
portrays, this

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:31.828 align:middle line:90%
happens all around the planet.

in great detail.

00:17:56.790 --> 00:18:00.660 align:middle line:10%
These revelations make clear
that both American and Soviet

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:04.460 align:middle line:10%
nuclear missiles were subjected
to ongoing surveillance,

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:07.390 align:middle line:10%

>>NOORY: So clearly, Robert,
this is a planetary situation

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:23.270 align:middle line:84%
where any country that
apparently has nukes

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:25.360 align:middle line:90%
is being watched.

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:26.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HASTINGS: I
think that's clear.

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:30.720 align:middle line:84%
My opinion is that the
nuclear weapons angle

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:34.930 align:middle line:84%
is one of the primary reasons
the UFO phenomenon has

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:38.010 align:middle line:84%
accelerated its activities
post World War II.

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:39.980 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
history from, say,

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:44.380 align:middle line:84%
the early 19th century through
1945 when World War II ended,

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:46.830 align:middle line:84%
we have a low level of
reports around the planet

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:48.640 align:middle line:90%
of strange aerial phenomena.

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.870 align:middle line:84%
Shortly after we
acquired nuclear weapons,

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:53.170 align:middle line:84%
you have this
dramatic acceleration

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:56.440 align:middle line:84%
of activity in the United
States and other countries.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And we now know from
declassified documents

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:02.090 align:middle line:84%
that as soon as nuclear
weapons were created and began

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:06.530 align:middle line:84%
to be tested and deployed, UFO
activity around those sites--

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:10.874 align:middle line:84%
deployment sites, test
sites, laboratories-- just

00:19:10.874 --> 00:19:11.790 align:middle line:90%
went through the roof.

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:14.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you're on
another planetary system

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:18.490 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of light
years away, and a nuke

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:21.750 align:middle line:84%
is detonated on planet
Earth, how do they know this?

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:23.736 align:middle line:90%
What do they see?

00:19:23.736 --> 00:19:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>>HASTINGS: In my opinion,
whoever are flying these craft

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:28.770 align:middle line:84%
have probably been here for
a long, long time-- perhaps

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:30.580 align:middle line:90%
thousands of years.

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:32.560 align:middle line:84%
Proving that, of course,
is another matter.

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:34.850 align:middle line:84%
But I think they were already
aware of the situation.

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:36.280 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.590 align:middle line:10%
>>HASTINGS: The other thing
that I would point out

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:42.960 align:middle line:10%
is for 100 years or so,
based on Einstein's theories,

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:46.160 align:middle line:10%
physicists have said that
the distances between worlds,

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.880 align:middle line:10%
planetary systems, is so
vast that even if there are

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.590 align:middle line:10%
intelligent aliens out
there, they couldn't possibly

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:53.990 align:middle line:10%
get from their home
to our world and back

00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:56.250 align:middle line:10%
in any kind of regular fashion.

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:59.180 align:middle line:84%
However, in the last
20 years or so, there

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:01.880 align:middle line:84%
are now new theories of
how the universe works--

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.940 align:middle line:84%
cosmic architecture,
something called hyperspace,

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:08.310 align:middle line:84%
higher dimensional space--
that really allows faster

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:09.160 align:middle line:90%
than light travel.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.510 align:middle line:90%
It's a complicated subject.

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:13.360 align:middle line:84%
But the point I would
make is that there

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:17.220 align:middle line:84%
were over 100 peer-reviewed
scientific papers

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:19.730 align:middle line:84%
when I wrote my
book in 2008 that

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:22.090 align:middle line:84%
talked about ways that
faster than light travel

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:22.997 align:middle line:90%
could be achieved.

00:20:22.997 --> 00:20:25.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think they're
bending space and time somehow.

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:25.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HASTINGS: Correct.

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:26.590 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:28.381 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just like the
old movie "Contact."

00:20:28.381 --> 00:20:30.540 align:middle line:90%
>>HASTINGS: Right.

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:34.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your
opinion-- in your opinion,

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:37.919 align:middle line:84%
is what is happening
a good thing?

00:20:37.919 --> 00:20:39.210 align:middle line:90%
>>HASTINGS: My opinion is, yes.

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:42.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, humans are
fallible creatures.

00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:44.850 align:middle line:84%
We have these weapons that
are capable of destroying

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:48.200 align:middle line:84%
our civilization and
doing incredible damage

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.840 align:middle line:90%
to the planetary environment.

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:52.960 align:middle line:84%
Sooner or later, whether
intentional or not--

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.710 align:middle line:84%
if we have these
weapons, sooner or later,

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:58.390 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a very good
likelihood they'll be used.

00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:59.880 align:middle line:84%
The US and the
Russian governments

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:04.020 align:middle line:84%
have now revealed, have
divulged, at least 20 occasions

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:07.479 align:middle line:84%
during the Cold War era, aside
from the Cuban Missile Crisis

00:21:07.479 --> 00:21:09.270 align:middle line:84%
which everyone knows
about, where we almost

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:11.900 align:middle line:84%
went to nuclear war,
20 other occasions

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.670 align:middle line:84%
where we were minutes away
from launching nuclear war,

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:18.210 align:middle line:84%
either us or them, because
we misread the other side's

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:19.770 align:middle line:90%
signals.

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And so I think as long
as we have these weapons,

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:25.190 align:middle line:84%
the potential for
their use exists.

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:28.570 align:middle line:84%
If someone is intervening on
our behalf, whether we like it

00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:33.470 align:middle line:84%
or not, and either telling us
subliminally behind the scenes

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:36.170 align:middle line:84%
to get rid of the
weapons or demonstrating

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:38.680 align:middle line:84%
they're capable of interfering
with their functionality,

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:40.800 align:middle line:84%
that's all to the good
as far as I'm concerned.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.799 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Robert, you've
said time and time again

00:21:42.799 --> 00:21:44.920 align:middle line:84%
that the public needs
to know about this.

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:46.870 align:middle line:84%

it, of course,

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:50.444 align:middle line:84%

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:17.592 align:middle line:84%
The explanations of those where
there is a clear explanation

00:22:17.592 --> 00:22:19.044 align:middle line:90%
have been made public.

00:22:19.044 --> 00:22:21.970 align:middle line:84%
The hearing this morning was
public for just that reason.

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:24.940 align:middle line:84%
-Brown's claims have
now been discredited.

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:28.470 align:middle line:84%
But the strict security measures
imposed on military witnesses

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:30.750 align:middle line:84%
at the time meant
that decades would

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:34.560 align:middle line:84%
pass before the public learned
the facts about UFO activity

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.530 align:middle line:90%
at nuclear missile sites.

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:40.450 align:middle line:84%
In any case, the
next known incident

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:45.320 align:middle line:84%
at Malmstrom Air Force
Base Montana in March 1967

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:48.330 align:middle line:84%
left no doubt that
those aboard the UFOs

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:52.730 align:middle line:84%
were intent on disrupting the
functionality of American ICBMs

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:55.790 align:middle line:90%
in their underground silos.

00:22:55.790 --> 00:23:00.320 align:middle line:84%
On March 16 at Echo Flight,
a missile security guard

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:03.220 align:middle line:84%
reported that a large
round object had suddenly

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:06.340 align:middle line:84%
appeared in the sky and was
hovering at low altitude,

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:09.610 align:middle line:84%
directly over one of
the missile silos.

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:12.770 align:middle line:10%
Moments later, the
entire group of 10

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:17.890 align:middle line:10%
ICBMs mysteriously
malfunctioned.

00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:20.910 align:middle line:84%
This startling fact has been
confirmed by one of the launch

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:25.520 align:middle line:84%
officers on alert that day, now
retired Colonel Walter Figel,

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:28.270 align:middle line:84%
who spoke about the incident
during a taped telephone

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:32.800 align:middle line:84%
conversation with
Robert Hastings in 2008.

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:37.180 align:middle line:84%
Figel said that in response to
the missile guard's UFO report,

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:40.660 align:middle line:84%
he had sent out two security
alert teams, one of which

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:43.210 align:middle line:84%
confirmed the presence
of the object.

00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:46.010 align:middle line:84%
-The strike team that
went out, one of the two,

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:48.080 align:middle line:84%
claimed that they saw
something over the site.

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:49.246 align:middle line:90%
-How did they describe that?

00:23:49.246 --> 00:23:50.930 align:middle line:84%
-He just said a
large round object.

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:52.040 align:middle line:90%
-Directly over the LF?

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:53.610 align:middle line:90%
-Directly over the site.

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:54.610 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:57.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Robert,
absolutely riveting.

00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.930 align:middle line:90%
Riveting.

00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:01.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HASTINGS: It's
amazing to me that it's

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:05.070 align:middle line:90%
been kept secret for so long.

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:08.750 align:middle line:84%
It would be secret still if I
had not taken it upon myself,

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:12.019 align:middle line:84%
foolishly or not, to seek
out these people to get

00:24:12.019 --> 00:24:13.060 align:middle line:90%
them to go on the record.

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:16.410 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe that if
we're going to call ourself

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:18.920 align:middle line:84%
a democracy and
that the public has

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.030 align:middle line:84%
a right to important
matters that

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:24.750 align:middle line:84%
affect its future, its
collective security, then

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:26.880 align:middle line:84%
everyone and his brother
needs to know about this.

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:27.680 align:middle line:90%
It's real.

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:28.700 align:middle line:90%
It's ongoing.

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:30.150 align:middle line:90%
It hasn't gone away.

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And the government is going to
continue stonewalling, clearly.

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:35.500 align:middle line:84%
So hopefully at the
grassroots level,

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:38.720 align:middle line:84%
my film, my book, my public
speaking engagements,

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.580 align:middle line:84%
will at least acquaint
some number of people

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:42.050 align:middle line:90%
with the reality of all this.

00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:44.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are people in
shock when they hear this?

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:45.510 align:middle line:90%
Are they scared?

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:48.070 align:middle line:84%
What is generally
their reaction?

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:52.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HASTINGS: My most regular
contact with the public

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:54.240 align:middle line:84%
is through my
speaking engagements

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:55.700 align:middle line:90%
at colleges and universities.

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:58.280 align:middle line:84%
I get a diversity
of people attending.

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.116 align:middle line:84%
So I get a diversity
of responses.

00:25:00.116 --> 00:25:02.490 align:middle line:84%
All of those things-- some
people are frightened by this.

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:05.210 align:middle line:84%
Some people are angry that
it's been kept from them.

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:08.260 align:middle line:84%
Some people think it's nonsense,
that I'm making all this up.

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:09.900 align:middle line:84%
They won't even
read the documents

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:12.870 align:middle line:84%
or watch the videotaped
testimony of the veterans who

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:14.110 align:middle line:90%
are revealing all of this.

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:16.234 align:middle line:84%
In other words, some people
are burying their heads

00:25:16.234 --> 00:25:17.430 align:middle line:90%
in the sand.

00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:19.172 align:middle line:90%
So I just put it out there.

00:25:19.172 --> 00:25:20.505 align:middle line:90%
I view this as public education.

00:25:20.505 --> 00:25:23.400 align:middle line:84%
And what people do with
it is their own business.

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:26.260 align:middle line:84%
But in principle, I think
that in a democracy,

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:29.980 align:middle line:84%
something of this importance,
dramatic consequences

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:32.270 align:middle line:84%
for humankind, not
only Americans,

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:34.360 align:middle line:84%
is something that should
be addressed publicly

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.030 align:middle line:90%
in an open fashion.

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:39.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do people welcome
this kind of story?

00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:41.960 align:middle line:84%
Or is this something that
they would run away from?

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:44.259 align:middle line:84%
>>HASTINGS: Again, I think
I get both responses.

00:25:44.259 --> 00:25:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do get both.

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:46.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HASTINGS: Yeah.

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:48.303 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's go to some
e-mails for you, Robert.

00:25:48.303 --> 00:25:49.680 align:middle line:90%
People have written in.

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.640 align:middle line:84%
Sandra from Minneapolis
wants to know

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:54.930 align:middle line:84%
if you think the government
will ever come forth and tell us

00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:56.710 align:middle line:90%
the truth.

00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:58.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HASTINGS: My opinion is no.

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:02.880 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
unpredictable consequences

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.020 align:middle line:84%
to announcing that we
have alien visitors.

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, but
they seem to be interfering

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:08.950 align:middle line:90%
with our nuclear weapons.

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:11.180 align:middle line:84%
I think, no government,
no administration,

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:12.760 align:middle line:90%
is going to go there.

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.860 align:middle line:84%
I think the phenomenon
itself is going

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:18.060 align:middle line:84%
to have to do something,
some spectacular, worldwide

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:21.150 align:middle line:84%
demonstration, to make it
clear in everyone's minds

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:22.960 align:middle line:84%
that they're real
and they're here.

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't expect
any administration

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:27.320 align:middle line:90%
to voluntarily take that on.

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:31.990 align:middle line:84%
A former disgruntled CIA agent--
or actually, a supervisor

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:35.290 align:middle line:84%
named Victor Marchetti
in May of 1979

00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:38.450 align:middle line:84%
wrote an article called
"How the CIA Views the UFO

00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:42.780 align:middle line:84%
Phenomenon," Among other things,
he talked about rumors at CIA

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:45.940 align:middle line:84%
about crash UFOs and
bodies of little men on ice

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:47.220 align:middle line:90%
at Wright-Patterson.

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:50.730 align:middle line:84%
But the thrust of his
article was why no government

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:52.490 align:middle line:90%
will be honest about this.

00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:55.810 align:middle line:84%
As much as we want disclosure,
as many people scream for it

00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:58.080 align:middle line:84%
and say it needs
to happen, I think

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.375 align:middle line:84%
it's going to have to
unfold in some other way.

00:27:00.375 --> 00:27:02.620 align:middle line:84%
And Marchetti says
no government is

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:05.040 align:middle line:84%
going to risk the
power that they hold,

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:07.460 align:middle line:90%
jeopardizing the status quo.

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:10.570 align:middle line:84%
They have the control over
their respective citizens

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:11.951 align:middle line:90%
in their own country.

00:27:11.951 --> 00:27:13.450 align:middle line:84%
They're not going
to jeopardize that

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:16.720 align:middle line:84%
by saying we have visitors who
are more intelligent than us,

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.267 align:middle line:84%
more technologically
advanced than us, and so on.

00:27:19.267 --> 00:27:20.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can shut
down anything we do.

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:21.684 align:middle line:90%
>>HASTINGS: Exactly.

00:27:21.684 --> 00:27:23.433 align:middle line:84%
You're just not going
to admit that you're

00:27:23.433 --> 00:27:24.440 align:middle line:90%
essentially powerless.

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
afraid of panic?

00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:27.923 align:middle line:84%
>>HASTINGS: I think
that's still part of it.

00:27:27.923 --> 00:27:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And people say that
wouldn't happen in 2016.

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:35.270 align:middle line:84%
But I say even if 1 in
100 Americans freak out,

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:36.896 align:middle line:84%
that's a lot of
Americans running amok.

00:27:36.896 --> 00:27:37.728 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It sure is.

00:27:37.728 --> 00:27:38.700 align:middle line:90%
>>HASTINGS: Yeah.

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:40.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure is.

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:43.010 align:middle line:84%
Harold from Little
Rock, Arkansas--

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:48.582 align:middle line:84%
are the aliens using our
nukes and materials for fuel?

00:27:48.582 --> 00:27:49.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HASTINGS: I don't think so.

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And I've been asked
that a number of times.

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:55.300 align:middle line:84%
I think clearly, the technology
they have is so superior.

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:59.360 align:middle line:84%
They would not have to rely on
what we might provide to them.

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:02.510 align:middle line:84%
I think it's clear-- cases
like the Big Sur case.

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:04.740 align:middle line:84%
They're not gathering
nuclear fuel.

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:07.050 align:middle line:84%
They're attempting to
shut down our systems

00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:09.800 align:middle line:84%
and demonstrate that they
have that capability.

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:12.224 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think that's
a likely scenario, no.

00:28:12.224 --> 00:28:13.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And Cheryl
writes, from Dallas,

00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:15.970 align:middle line:84%
Texas-- and this is
a great question.

00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:19.760 align:middle line:84%
There was a UFO reportedly
seen over the Chernobyl

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:23.340 align:middle line:84%
nuclear site, one that
had its misfortune.

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:24.970 align:middle line:90%
What have we heard about that?

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HASTINGS: We do have
two articles-- one

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:31.740 align:middle line:84%
in the English version
of "Pravda" magazine,

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:34.990 align:middle line:84%
the chief newspaper in
the former Soviet Union,

00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:38.450 align:middle line:84%
now in Russia, and another
newspaper in Ukraine

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:42.700 align:middle line:84%
in, I think roughly 1991,
published articles saying

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:45.890 align:middle line:84%
that a Soviet radiation
monitoring team that

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:50.260 align:middle line:84%
was on site within three hours
of the explosion at the reactor

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:52.660 align:middle line:84%
in April of '86 have
gone on the record

00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:57.520 align:middle line:84%
and said that they witnessed a
brass colored sphere flying in,

00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:01.570 align:middle line:84%
hover over the damaged reactor
for some three to five minutes.

00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:04.260 align:middle line:84%
At one point, two
crimson beams of light

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:07.710 align:middle line:84%
were seen emanating from this
object down into the reactor.

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:10.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, they had taken
ambient radiation readings

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:12.810 align:middle line:84%
prior to the arrival
of this unknown object,

00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:16.880 align:middle line:84%
and it was 300-- or excuse me--
3,000 milirankins per hour.

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which is huge.

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:19.190 align:middle line:90%
>>HASTINGS: Huge.

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And inexplicably,
when this object left,

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:25.167 align:middle line:84%
the ambient readings in the
air were some 800 milirankins.

00:29:25.167 --> 00:29:26.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They brought them down.

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:28.570 align:middle line:84%
>>HASTINGS: And I've asked
physicists about this.

00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:31.640 align:middle line:84%
I said, do we have any
knowledge of any way

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:35.180 align:middle line:84%
that radioactive decay,
which is a natural process,

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:36.665 align:middle line:90%
can be dramatically reduced?

00:29:36.665 --> 00:29:37.465 align:middle line:90%
And they all said--

00:29:37.465 --> 00:29:38.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There's no way.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.060 align:middle line:90%
>>HASTINGS: They said no.

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:41.614 align:middle line:84%
And yet, someone apparently--
or some technology--

00:29:41.614 --> 00:29:42.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something did that.

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:43.890 align:middle line:90%
>>HASTINGS: --did that.

00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:45.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How about
Fukushima in Japan?

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:47.262 align:middle line:90%
Any reports there?

00:29:47.262 --> 00:29:49.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HASTINGS: I've seen a couple
of very interesting security

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:53.110 align:middle line:84%
cameras of an unknown object
on two different occasions

00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:55.110 align:middle line:90%
maneuvering around the plant.

00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:58.350 align:middle line:84%
I've also heard a lot of bull
on the internet about one thing

00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:59.620 align:middle line:90%
or another that's not true.

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:01.270 align:middle line:90%
There is no basis for it.

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:03.610 align:middle line:84%
But I suspect that
whoever they are,

00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:05.440 align:middle line:84%
they're keeping an
eye on Fukushima, yes.

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:07.815 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and you brought
up something interesting--

00:30:07.815 --> 00:30:08.790 align:middle line:90%
social media.

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:12.530 align:middle line:84%
Does that help or
hurt cases like this?

00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:15.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HASTINGS: I have a very
low opinion of social media.

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:20.620 align:middle line:84%
I think trying to understand
the UFO phenomenon is inherently

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:24.010 align:middle line:84%
a process of separating
the signal from the noise.

00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:26.760 align:middle line:84%
When I go into the
blogosphere or look

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:30.530 align:middle line:84%
at UFO related websites, I
would say it's mostly noise.

00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:32.230 align:middle line:90%
It complicates the situation.

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:35.060 align:middle line:84%
There are people citing
fraudulent documents.

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:37.170 align:middle line:84%
There are people
saying this person's

00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:40.440 align:middle line:84%
a CIA agent given a deathbed
confession, and yet,

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:43.560 align:middle line:84%
having no evidence that this
person ever worked for CIA.

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:46.355 align:middle line:84%
All of that just muddies
the waters, makes me angry.

00:30:46.355 --> 00:30:48.060 align:middle line:90%
It makes my job harder.

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:49.850 align:middle line:84%
It makes the average
person on the street

00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:51.340 align:middle line:90%
not know what to believe.

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:52.970 align:middle line:90%
Everything I have is documented.

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:54.290 align:middle line:90%
You can look at the documents.

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:56.050 align:middle line:90%
You can watch the videotapes.

00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:59.070 align:middle line:84%
But when my information has
to compete with nonsense

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:03.150 align:middle line:84%
like that, it lowers the
credibility of the overall body

00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:04.240 align:middle line:90%
of data, I would say.

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:06.156 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Robert, have
you ever been threatened

00:31:06.156 --> 00:31:08.360 align:middle line:90%
because of the work you do?

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:11.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HASTINGS: I got my first
national publicity in 1991.

00:31:11.450 --> 00:31:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And by February of '82,
when I would call veterans

00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:19.175 align:middle line:84%
on the telephone and interview
them with their permission

00:31:19.175 --> 00:31:23.280 align:middle line:84%
and audio tape conversations,
for months and months

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:27.080 align:middle line:84%
and months throughout '82--
and I think into '83--

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:29.840 align:middle line:84%
when I would get finished
talking to the veteran,

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:32.490 align:middle line:84%
hang up the phone, within
a minute, five minutes,

00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:36.000 align:middle line:84%
I would get a call from somebody
who would not say anything.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.382 align:middle line:84%
I could hear background
noises like machines--

00:31:38.382 --> 00:31:40.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You knew
somebody was there.

00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:41.561 align:middle line:84%
>>HASTINGS: Somebody
was just saying,

00:31:41.561 --> 00:31:42.970 align:middle line:90%
we know who you're talking to.

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:44.310 align:middle line:90%
We know what you're up to.

00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And that went on for--
I think sooner or later,

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:50.670 align:middle line:84%
they figured I was too
stupid to be scared,

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:53.091 align:middle line:90%
and they sort of backed off.

00:31:53.091 --> 00:31:54.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you
haven't backed off.

00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:56.326 align:middle line:90%
>>HASTINGS: I haven't.

00:31:56.326 --> 00:31:58.366 align:middle line:84%
If I had been raised
in the Soviet Union,

00:31:58.366 --> 00:32:00.240 align:middle line:84%
I probably would not be
doing what I'm doing.

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:04.000 align:middle line:84%
But in America, I just
decided that we either live

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.430 align:middle line:90%
in a democracy or we don't.

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And I should be able to do what
I'm doing as long as I don't

00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:10.110 align:middle line:90%
break any rules, any laws.

00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going to continue
to interview these witnesses

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:15.520 align:middle line:84%
and publicize all this
as best as possible.

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:17.860 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Your book, "UFOs
and the Nukes," and much

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:21.280 align:middle line:10%
like the documentary, it's huge.

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:23.840 align:middle line:90%
These case studies are enormous.

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:27.110 align:middle line:84%
How long did it take
you to work on this?

00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:30.490 align:middle line:84%
>>HASTINGS: I began interviewing
witnesses back in '73.

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:33.300 align:middle line:84%
I began speaking about
it publicly in '81.

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:37.210 align:middle line:84%
I began writing the book in
'98 and didn't publish it

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:38.350 align:middle line:90%
until 2008.

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:42.090 align:middle line:84%
So for 10 years, I was writing
and editing and polishing.

00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And this is the best
I have to offer.

00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And again, I'm
just the middleman.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm the messenger.

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:50.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm not theorizing.

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:54.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm not speculating
except very sparingly.

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:57.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm just reporting what these
military witnesses are telling

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.090 align:middle line:90%
me and what the documents say.

00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And anyone who wishes to
dispute anything I say

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:04.580 align:middle line:84%
should keep in mind
that these people

00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:07.340 align:middle line:84%
were entrusted by the government
to launch nuclear weapons.

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:10.330 align:middle line:84%
And yet, dozens
and dozens of them

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:13.760 align:middle line:84%
are now saying UFOs shut
down their nuclear weapons.

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.981 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
surprised with that story?

00:33:16.981 --> 00:33:18.230 align:middle line:90%
>>HASTINGS: At this point, no.

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.510 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:19.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not anymore.

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:21.593 align:middle line:84%
>>HASTINGS: It's just like
going into the office for me.

00:33:21.593 --> 00:33:23.850 align:middle line:84%
I seek out people and
I know basically what

00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:26.150 align:middle line:84%
they're going to tell me
once I vet them and I have--

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're convinced
this is happening.

00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:28.703 align:middle line:90%
>>HASTINGS: Oh, it's real.

00:33:28.703 --> 00:33:32.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are so many
witnesses over so many years

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:35.170 align:middle line:84%
at so many different
bases that they're all

00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:36.150 align:middle line:90%
telling the same story.

00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:40.390 align:middle line:84%
Many of them, before the
advent of the internet and some

00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:43.890 align:middle line:84%
of this began to be publicized,
back in the '70s and '80s

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:47.580 align:middle line:84%
when I would say to a veteran,
thank you for telling me that.

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:50.640 align:middle line:84%
20 other guys have told me the
same story, their jaws drop.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.050 align:middle line:84%
They had no idea
that anyone else

00:33:53.050 --> 00:33:55.680 align:middle line:90%
had those kinds of experiences.

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:58.860 align:middle line:84%
So the government's
been extremely diligent

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:02.170 align:middle line:84%
and/or lucky to keep this under
wraps as well as they have.

00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:04.660 align:middle line:84%
Because there are thousands
and thousands of witnesses

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:06.640 align:middle line:84%
over the decades
who have witnessed

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.600 align:middle line:84%
UFO maneuvering around
nuclear missiles

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:09.840 align:middle line:90%
and even shutting them down.

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:11.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is an amazing story.

00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:15.159 align:middle line:84%
And I've covered a lot in
my broadcast career, Robert.

00:34:15.159 --> 00:34:18.949 align:middle line:84%
When you came forward with
this-- and the credibility

00:34:18.949 --> 00:34:22.679 align:middle line:84%
that you have brought to this
is absolutely staggering.

00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:24.020 align:middle line:90%
And I heard about this story.

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, this is one of
the most incredible UFO cases

00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:29.810 align:middle line:84%
and series of cases
I've ever heard.

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:33.469 align:middle line:84%
We've heard about Lonnie
Zamora, the late police

00:34:33.469 --> 00:34:37.250 align:middle line:84%
officer from Socorro, New
Mexico and his witnessing

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:41.109 align:middle line:84%
of an egg-shaped craft and
little aliens and beings

00:34:41.109 --> 00:34:41.909 align:middle line:90%
over there.

00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:44.300 align:middle line:84%
We've heard about the
story in Rendlesham

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:46.760 align:middle line:84%
in the United Kingdom
about that situation,

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:49.460 align:middle line:84%
and our military literally
getting to the point where

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:51.219 align:middle line:90%
they could touch the craft.

00:34:51.219 --> 00:34:57.060 align:middle line:84%
But this one that
surely shows involvement

00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:59.400 align:middle line:84%
of these
extraterrestrials-- and I'll

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:02.140 align:middle line:84%
call them extraterrestrials--
that they're

00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:06.300 align:middle line:84%
involved in something,
David Jacobs would say,

00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:09.320 align:middle line:84%
the great researcher, there's
something nefarious going on

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.440 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:12.570 align:middle line:84%
You could then look
at this and say,

00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:15.910 align:middle line:84%
they want to shut down our nukes
before some kind of an attack,

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:17.510 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:19.350 align:middle line:90%
But I share your concerns.

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:23.610 align:middle line:84%
I think they're more benevolent
than most people say.

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:27.220 align:middle line:84%
I think they're trying to tell
us, don't screw up your planet.

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:28.930 align:middle line:90%
Don't blow yourselves up.

00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:31.090 align:middle line:84%
Because if you think
you're going to do that,

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:32.430 align:middle line:90%
we're stepping in.

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:33.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HASTINGS: That's my opinion.

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And you know,
again, to be honest,

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:40.105 align:middle line:84%
I can't claim to know
the bottom line answers.

00:35:40.105 --> 00:35:41.230 align:middle line:90%
I don't think anyone knows.

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:44.110 align:middle line:84%
Probably even in the Pentagon
or in the Soviet military,

00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:45.770 align:middle line:90%
they may not know.

00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:49.330 align:middle line:84%
One might even argue
that worst case scenario,

00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:52.144 align:middle line:84%
these aliens are planning to
invade us, take over planet

00:35:52.144 --> 00:35:53.310 align:middle line:90%
Earth, and they don't want--

00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:53.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Possibility.

00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.760 align:middle line:90%
Possibility.

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:56.343 align:middle line:84%
>>HASTINGS: They
don't want to inherit

00:35:56.343 --> 00:35:57.530 align:middle line:90%
a radioactive wasteland.

00:35:57.530 --> 00:35:59.347 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
believe that's true.

00:35:59.347 --> 00:36:01.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People want to
watch the new documentary.

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:02.490 align:middle line:90%
How do they find it?

00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:04.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HASTINGS: It's
at Vimeo on demand.

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:10.610 align:middle line:84%
And if you just go to vimeo.com,
On Demand, "UFOs and Nukes."

00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, you'll
put up the address

00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:15.510 align:middle line:84%
in this program somewhere
for people to look at.

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:17.690 align:middle line:84%
But you can either
rent or buy the film.

00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:21.154 align:middle line:84%
And it represents
my lifetime of work.

00:36:21.154 --> 00:36:22.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:23.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HASTINGS: And if you think
what I'm doing is important

00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:26.517 align:middle line:84%
and you watch the film, that
would be greatly appreciated.

00:36:26.517 --> 00:36:28.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Robert, in
your career-- and you've

00:36:28.350 --> 00:36:31.640 align:middle line:84%
interviewed 160
military personnel

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:34.230 align:middle line:84%
about this incredible
series of cases--

00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:38.320 align:middle line:84%
what's the one story that
sticks out for you the most?

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>>HASTINGS: Big Sur, I
think, is pretty dramatic.

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.630 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to beat.

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:46.180 align:middle line:84%
Another occasion at Ellsworth
Air Force Base, Christmas week

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:49.270 align:middle line:84%
of 1978, there was
a triangular shaped

00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:52.780 align:middle line:84%
object that actually-- I believe
you said it was four-sided,

00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:55.010 align:middle line:84%
so some sort of
parallelogram shaped

00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:57.480 align:middle line:84%
object that hovered
over a missile site.

00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:00.100 align:middle line:84%
A missile targeting
technician named

00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:03.516 align:middle line:84%
John Mills came forward and
said the thing was hovering just

00:37:03.516 --> 00:37:04.640 align:middle line:90%
slightly above the missile.

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:06.630 align:middle line:84%
He was underneath
it with his team.

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:10.040 align:middle line:84%
He said this droning sound
that got louder and louder--

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:12.830 align:middle line:90%
you couldn't hear yourself talk.

00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And they were trying
to make sense of this.

00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:19.960 align:middle line:84%
Is this a SAC exercise--
Strategic Air Command?

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:21.770 align:middle line:84%
What in the hell
is going on here?

00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And he describes in great detail
this huge object hovering right

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:26.730 align:middle line:90%
over his head.

00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:28.410 align:middle line:90%
So that's pretty dramatic too.

00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:31.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How has this affected
some of these personnel,

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:33.820 align:middle line:90%
professionally and personally?

00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>>HASTINGS: Most of the
people that I've talked to

00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:38.680 align:middle line:84%
really didn't come forward
until I approached them.

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:41.830 align:middle line:84%
They had either heard about
me or I heard about them

00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:43.010 align:middle line:90%
and approached them.

00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And after some
reluctance, they agreed

00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:47.471 align:middle line:90%
to be interviewed on tape.

00:37:47.471 --> 00:37:50.000 align:middle line:84%
But most of them-- many
of them have told me,

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.514 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned this to my
wife or to my best friend,

00:37:52.514 --> 00:37:53.680 align:middle line:90%
and they laughed in my face.

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And I never mentioned it
again until you showed up,

00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:57.200 align:middle line:90%
Mr. Hastings.

00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:59.920 align:middle line:84%
So I think a lot
of people just--

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:03.350 align:middle line:84%
they're still reeling with the
fact that it actually occurred.

00:38:03.350 --> 00:38:05.520 align:middle line:84%
They certainly don't
need to be and don't

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.732 align:middle line:84%
want to endure the
ridicule of others,

00:38:07.732 --> 00:38:09.190 align:middle line:84%
people that weren't
there who think

00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:10.850 align:middle line:90%
that this is all nonsense.

00:38:10.850 --> 00:38:12.740 align:middle line:84%
So most of them have
been very, I think,

00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:15.640 align:middle line:84%
reticent and shy
about being candid.

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:17.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we hear so
many of these cases--

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:21.210 align:middle line:84%
'47 Roswell, the
Kecksburg case, Rendlesham

00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:23.960 align:middle line:84%
that I mentioned in
the United Kingdom.

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:28.360 align:middle line:84%
They all seem to be connected
with a common denominator.

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And that is
something is going on

00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:34.295 align:middle line:84%
and this planet
is being watched.

00:38:34.295 --> 00:38:35.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HASTINGS: I
think that's right.

00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:38.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
circumstantial evidence

00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:41.700 align:middle line:84%
is we have multiple races
here from different worlds.

00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:43.810 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
reports of landed craft

00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:46.360 align:middle line:84%
where cops of one
description or another

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:49.360 align:middle line:84%
see a landed craft and
creatures walking around it,

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:52.210 align:middle line:84%
if you accept that some number
of those cases are credible,

00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:55.340 align:middle line:84%
the descriptions of the entities
vary dramatically-- three foot

00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:58.770 align:middle line:84%
tall, seven foot tall, human
appearing, insect appearing.

00:38:58.770 --> 00:39:02.040 align:middle line:84%
So if there's any merit to
those reports from these cops

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:04.730 align:middle line:84%
all around the world over
a several decade period,

00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:07.060 align:middle line:84%
we seem to have multiple
visitors from different worlds

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:07.860 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:10.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That person watching
"Beyond Belief" right now

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:15.370 align:middle line:84%
and he hears this incredible
story of UFOs shutting down

00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:19.270 align:middle line:84%
our missile sites, what
is he or she to take away

00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:20.500 align:middle line:90%
from all of this?

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:23.110 align:middle line:84%
What do you want them to
take away from this interview

00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:23.910 align:middle line:90%
right now?

00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:25.284 align:middle line:84%
>>HASTINGS: I
always asked people

00:39:25.284 --> 00:39:26.740 align:middle line:90%
not to take my word for this.

00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:29.480 align:middle line:84%
If you go to my website,
ufohastings.com,

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:33.240 align:middle line:84%
go to the document page, you
can see the FBI, the Air Force,

00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:37.350 align:middle line:84%
the CIA talking about all of
this, going back to the 1940s.

00:39:37.350 --> 00:39:39.970 align:middle line:84%
Anyone can write to these
agencies under the FOIA

00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:42.060 align:middle line:84%
and get these documents
for themselves.

00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:44.570 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the video of
the veterans I've interviewed,

00:39:44.570 --> 00:39:46.070 align:middle line:84%
these are the
gentlemen, again, that

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:47.600 align:middle line:84%
would have initiated
World War III

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:50.190 align:middle line:90%
by launching their missiles.

00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:52.190 align:middle line:84%
Don't take what I'm
saying at face value.

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:54.400 align:middle line:84%
Look at what they're saying
and the way they say it,

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:55.900 align:middle line:90%
with the seriousness.

00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:58.040 align:middle line:90%
And draw your own conclusions.

00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:02.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it a false sense
of security to sit back and go,

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:04.620 align:middle line:84%
oh, if the Russians
launch against us--

00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:08.380 align:middle line:84%
or the Chinese, or
North Korea-- we're

00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:11.480 align:middle line:84%
going to be saved by
the extraterrestrials,

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:12.730 align:middle line:90%
or is that realistic?

00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:14.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HASTINGS: I think
that is wrong.

00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:17.330 align:middle line:10%
We have evidence that they're
capable of shutting down

00:40:17.330 --> 00:40:19.320 align:middle line:10%
missiles on a small scale.

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:21.660 align:middle line:10%
In the Big Sur case, they
shot down a single dummy

00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:23.220 align:middle line:10%
warhead in flight.

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:25.110 align:middle line:10%
Whether they could--
if we launched

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:27.860 align:middle line:10%
thousands of weapons on the
Russians or some other country

00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:29.890 align:middle line:10%
launched large
numbers of weapons,

00:40:29.890 --> 00:40:32.170 align:middle line:10%
could they handle the
whole overall situation?

00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:33.330 align:middle line:90%
We simply don't know.

00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:35.660 align:middle line:84%

being on "Beyond Belief."

and his documentary

00:40:42.290 --> 00:40:45.090 align:middle line:84%
absolutely incredible
work about what

00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:49.220 align:middle line:84%
is happening on this planet
right under our noses.

00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:52.450 align:middle line:10%
But if somebody
does launch, do they

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:56.720 align:middle line:10%
have the capability of shutting
down that missile instantly,

00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:59.370 align:middle line:10%
protecting the planet?

00:40:59.370 --> 00:41:01.340 align:middle line:10%
Let's hope it never
comes to that.
