00:00:05.264 --> 00:00:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.266 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:11.596 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:11.596 --> 00:00:13.240 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.710 align:middle line:84%
>>It felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.670 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.255 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:26.312 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.312 --> 00:00:28.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.180 align:middle line:10%
It's good to have you back.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.420 align:middle line:10%
You know, we have been talking
about so many different issues

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.230 align:middle line:10%
on "Beyond Belief" over
the last couple years,

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.000 align:middle line:10%
but this one is a scary one.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.360 align:middle line:90%
It's Ebola.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.650 align:middle line:84%
To date, nearly
6,000 people have

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.560 align:middle line:84%
died across this
planet from Ebola.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, that might not seem
like a lot of people,

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.790 align:middle line:84%
but the problem is, is
that 70% of the people who

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.560 align:middle line:90%
seem to contract Ebola die.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.410 align:middle line:84%
Our special guest
on "Beyond Belief"

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.170 align:middle line:84%
is the author of "Pandemic"
and "Bowling for Ebola,"

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.370 align:middle line:84%
infectious disease
expert Dr. Gary Ridenour.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.900 align:middle line:84%
Gary, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GARY RIDENOUR:
Thank you, George.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.393 align:middle line:90%
Pleasure to be here.

00:01:06.393 --> 00:01:10.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is a
very, very tense moment

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.590 align:middle line:90%
on this planet with Ebola.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.870 align:middle line:84%
Can you take us
back a little bit?

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.880 align:middle line:84%
We've had Ebola
scares and outbreaks

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.030 align:middle line:84%
before, but never
quite like this one.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.120 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.180 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: Well, the original
Ebola happened in 1976,

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.720 align:middle line:90%
and it was near the Ebola River.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.990 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, not a large
population density.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.390 align:middle line:90%
It was easily controlled.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.010 align:middle line:90%
It was studied.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.070 align:middle line:84%
There were a couple a more
little teeny outbreaks.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.650 align:middle line:10%
And in this one, the
virus is from an area,

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.040 align:middle line:10%
like, 1,000 miles away and
suddenly popped up in Liberia.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And with the dense population
and with the people

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.170 align:middle line:84%
being about maybe 50% literate,
it got a good foothold,

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.130 align:middle line:84%
and took off, and spread
to other countries.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is it
so resis-- resilient?

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.524 align:middle line:90%
It is so powerful.

00:02:02.524 --> 00:02:03.940 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: Well,
the main problem

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.980 align:middle line:84%
is is that it's
very, very simple.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:12.570 align:middle line:84%
It's one strand of RNA that
has only seven genes on it.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And once it gets into your
body, it gets into the cells,

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:22.050 align:middle line:84%
hijacks your DNA, and gets
your own DNA to replicate more

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.930 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.370 align:middle line:84%
But it gets into nerve cells,
liver cells, stomach cells,

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.680 align:middle line:90%
intestinal cells.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.995 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it infects
every cell every cells.

00:02:31.995 --> 00:02:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And as a result,
horrible, bloody vomiting.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.540 align:middle line:90%
You can hardly walk.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.040 align:middle line:90%
The diarrhea is just--

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.695 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They bleed
out of the eyes?

00:02:41.695 --> 00:02:43.111 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: Bleed
out of the eyes.

00:02:43.111 --> 00:02:47.000 align:middle line:84%
Explosive diarrhea
14, 20 times a day.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.094 align:middle line:84%
So without the proper
equipment over there--

00:02:50.094 --> 00:02:52.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they got them in
tents, and they're on cots,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.550 align:middle line:84%
and they're trying
to feed them soup.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.570 align:middle line:84%
Without IV therapy
and good machinery

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.564 align:middle line:84%
to see what the
sodium potassium is,

00:03:01.564 --> 00:03:02.730 align:middle line:90%
they're going to die on you.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.890 align:middle line:84%
Because they're going to
be dehydrated, or kidneys

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:05.690 align:middle line:90%
shut down.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.020 align:middle line:90%
And that's the end.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the difference
between a virus and a bacteria?

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.360 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: OK.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.780 align:middle line:84%
One bacteria is about 100
times bigger than a virus.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.050 align:middle line:90%
A bacteria is living.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:24.330 align:middle line:84%
Inside a bacterial cell, it has
a good manufactured covering

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.160 align:middle line:90%
on it.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.870 align:middle line:84%
It may even have a little tail
on the back called a flagella

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.940 align:middle line:90%
to make it move around.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.440 align:middle line:84%
Inside, it has chemicals
and other parts

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.600 align:middle line:84%
of regular human cells that
allows it to have metabolism.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.000 align:middle line:90%
It has eight chromosomes in it.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And what they do
is that they get

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.990 align:middle line:84%
in the spaces between
tissue and grow,

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.910 align:middle line:84%
and then they divide
and then divide again.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.450 align:middle line:84%
And it also sends off
a chemical messenger

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.770 align:middle line:84%
so that the area's flooded
with white blood cells

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.520 align:middle line:84%
and antibiotics seem to work
quite well against them.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when you
say bacteria is alive,

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.330 align:middle line:90%
what do you mean by that?

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.420 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: Well, it's
kind of hard to-- alive

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.400 align:middle line:84%
meaning that this thing
requires nutrition.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.130 align:middle line:90%
It requires water.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.790 align:middle line:84%
It has a complex
chemical reaction in it

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.540 align:middle line:84%
to make the chemical
for power for the cell.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.760 align:middle line:90%
It's mobile.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.370 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it'll meet
up with another cell

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.670 align:middle line:84%
and they'll exchange RNA
material between each other.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.250 align:middle line:84%
So on the technical
side, because it

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.980 align:middle line:84%
can do all these things, they
consider it a living organism.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.320 align:middle line:90%
And it's pretty prehistoric.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.570 align:middle line:90%
They were here before we were.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it have--
this may sound silly,

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.820 align:middle line:90%
but does it have its own brain?

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:49.760 align:middle line:90%
Does it think?

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:50.985 align:middle line:90%
Does it reason?

00:04:50.985 --> 00:04:51.610 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: No.

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:58.680 align:middle line:84%
Once again, it's simplified only
to get enough nourishment so it

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.350 align:middle line:84%
can divide into two more
cells and replicate itself.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And then 20 minutes later,
you've got four cells.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.330 align:middle line:84%
And then 20 minutes later,
you've got more cells.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.852 align:middle line:90%
So it grows very quickly.

00:05:11.852 --> 00:05:13.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, does
it get to the point

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.840 align:middle line:84%
where-- I mean, this
is really fascinating.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.440 align:middle line:84%
Like, if an antibiotic--
assuming some of them

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.610 align:middle line:84%
work-- pops its way into your
body, does the bacterium say,

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.120 align:middle line:90%
"oh no!

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.350 align:middle line:90%
An antibiotic is coming my way."

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.210 align:middle line:84%
Is it smart enough to
try to get away from it?

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.470 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: Antibiotic
resistance is well known.

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:38.660 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things is, is
that at its division rate,

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.200 align:middle line:84%
it's probably going through
over two million years

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.190 align:middle line:90%
of evolution in one year, OK?

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.250 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to turn
into worms or anything,

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.630 align:middle line:84%
because they don't
have enough DNA.

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.340 align:middle line:84%
But because they're
replicating so fast,

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.580 align:middle line:84%
they run into an
antibiotic, they

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.680 align:middle line:84%
may be able to adjust to be
resistant to the antibiotic.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What came
first, the bacteria

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.770 align:middle line:84%
or the cells that would be
the building blocks of life?

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.240 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: That
goes back to what

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.970 align:middle line:84%
came first, the
chicken or the egg,

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:12.470 align:middle line:84%
and the farther we get
back, it gets controversial.

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.390 align:middle line:84%
They may have been
together at the same time,

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.430 align:middle line:84%
but they think
the bacterial cell

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.470 align:middle line:84%
borrowed some other
free floating cells,

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.980 align:middle line:84%
like mitochondria, and
brought them inside of them.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.560 align:middle line:84%
The Ebola can be found
in the fossil record.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.550 align:middle line:90%
That's how old it is.

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:31.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And let's jump ahead,
then, to a virus.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.835 align:middle line:90%
What is a virus?

00:06:34.835 --> 00:06:35.460 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: OK.

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.700 align:middle line:90%
A virus is very, very simple.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.820 align:middle line:84%
There's a package,
and the package

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:46.090 align:middle line:84%
is made by the
cell it is in, OK?

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And inside the package is
simply a number of RNA strands.

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:58.170 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is the
virus attaches to a cell,

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:05.720 align:middle line:84%
opens its way up, and the RNA
goes in and hijacks our DNA.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.554 align:middle line:90%
And our own cell--

00:07:06.554 --> 00:07:07.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Cell by cell.

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:10.850 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: Starts
replicating viruses like crazy

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.190 align:middle line:84%
until, usually, the
cell wall explodes.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:14.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The virus,
though, is not alive.

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.870 align:middle line:84%
So how in the hack
can an inanimate

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:23.190 align:middle line:84%
object, like a virus, that's
not alive do these things?

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:25.580 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: It's because
of its genetic programming.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:30.830 align:middle line:84%
The genetic programming is
superior to being a life form.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.390 align:middle line:84%
This thing is designed
to do only one thing.

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:36.340 align:middle line:90%
It's eliminated locomotion.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.530 align:middle line:90%
It's eliminated brain.

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:43.620 align:middle line:84%
It's eliminated any
metabolism or anything.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.160 align:middle line:84%
It's just nothing
but a container

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.580 align:middle line:84%
to get in and do
what all things do,

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.370 align:middle line:84%
which is to
replicate themselves.

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:54.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it like computer
software, whereby the software,

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:57.500 align:middle line:84%
it's not alive, but it
sure functions and does

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:58.310 align:middle line:90%
a lot of things.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:07:58.570 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: Yeah.

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of like the
virus in computer software,

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:05.280 align:middle line:84%
where the virus gets in,
and gets into programs,

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.510 align:middle line:84%
and then replicates off to other
programs and disables them.

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:12.240 align:middle line:84%
But the average
person with Ebola

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:17.900 align:middle line:84%
puts out about 23 billion
Ebola viruses a year.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, so when
you try to kill a virus,

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.200 align:middle line:90%
that's not even a right phrase.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.780 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't
kill what's not alive.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.550 align:middle line:84%
So how do you eradicate
something that's not alive?

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:32.640 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: Well, one thing you
can do is expose it to heat.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:36.780 align:middle line:84%
Five minutes at boiling
will destroy it.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:39.700 align:middle line:84%
Having it out on a
dry surface, it'll

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.700 align:middle line:90%
stay for four to six hours.

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And because it's dry and
warm, the virus will die.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:51.720 align:middle line:84%
Chlorinated water, like the
equivalent of pool water,

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:52.591 align:middle line:90%
will kill them.

00:08:52.591 --> 00:08:54.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which you shouldn't
drink at that rate.

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:55.600 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: No.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.584 align:middle line:84%
But you can spray it
all over yourself.

00:08:58.584 --> 00:08:59.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Kills it instantly?

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:00.947 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: Yeah.

00:09:00.947 --> 00:09:02.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Again, I said it again.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.330 align:middle line:90%
I said kill.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:04.414 align:middle line:90%
I got to stop saying that.

00:09:04.414 --> 00:09:05.330 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: Eliminate.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:06.121 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Eliminate.

00:09:06.121 --> 00:09:07.880 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: It eliminates them.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.500 align:middle line:84%
And so that's very,
very efficient.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.989 align:middle line:84%
The problem is is not
so much killing them.

00:09:14.989 --> 00:09:15.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: See?

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:16.630 align:middle line:90%
You said it, too.

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:17.810 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: I know.

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:19.660 align:middle line:90%
Eradicating them.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:21.790 align:middle line:84%
The problem is is
that they're talking

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:23.990 align:middle line:84%
about trying to get
a vaccine for it.

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:28.440 align:middle line:84%
The problem is is that there
are four subtypes to the virus,

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:36.460 align:middle line:84%
and when it's replicating 250
trillion replications a day,

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.370 align:middle line:84%
which virus are you
going to go after?

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.220 align:middle line:84%
Because this thing may be a
different animal next week.

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how does
Ebola differ from,

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.710 align:middle line:90%
for example, the AIDS virus?

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:49.450 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: AIDS virus
is also an RNA virus.

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:53.000 align:middle line:84%
It also gets in,
it affects cells.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.640 align:middle line:84%
Tends to hit more of
the immune system.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:59.120 align:middle line:84%
So you die from secondary
infections and things.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:02.390 align:middle line:84%
Also Ebola, when it
gets in your body,

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:04.290 align:middle line:90%
it goes into your lymph nodes.

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:07.170 align:middle line:84%
It goes into your
nervous system.

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:09.840 align:middle line:90%
It's a very efficient infector.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who would
invent this stuff?

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:12.610 align:middle line:90%
Who came up with it?

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:13.870 align:middle line:90%
The Creator?

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:15.200 align:middle line:90%
And why?

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.570 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: Good question.

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:18.570 align:middle line:90%
It could be the Creator.

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:23.160 align:middle line:84%
It could be just a series
of accidents that happened

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.280 align:middle line:90%
and this stuff appeared.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:31.540 align:middle line:84%
The farther we get back in time,
the murkier the whole subject

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:32.110 align:middle line:90%
becomes.

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:35.140 align:middle line:84%
Because they're still
fighting like dogs and cats

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.850 align:middle line:84%
about who came first
and who did what.

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:40.231 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have
much evidence on that.

00:10:40.231 --> 00:10:41.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk
now about what's

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:45.570 align:middle line:84%
been happening in Sierra
Leone, Liberia, Guinea,

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:49.000 align:middle line:84%
and now Mali is getting
affected-- 6 plus cases.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.050 align:middle line:84%
About a month ago, Gary,
I was at the Four Seasons

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:53.190 align:middle line:90%
in Los Angeles.

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:56.410 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting there,
and there's a guy.

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:59.000 align:middle line:90%
He's an art salesman from Mali.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.110 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying to myself, God,
I wonder if he's got Ebola.

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, there
were no cases in Mali.

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:10.250 align:middle line:84%
Now that's an area that the
World Health Organization

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:14.220 align:middle line:84%
and the United Nations is
very concerned about as well.

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.737 align:middle line:84%
It does seem to slowly
spread, doesn't it?

00:11:16.737 --> 00:11:17.820 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: Yeah, it does.

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is
that they're talking

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:24.930 align:middle line:84%
about 21 day quarantines
and stuff for people

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:26.540 align:middle line:90%
flying in from those areas.

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And you and I have talked
before about the fact

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:33.350 align:middle line:84%
that why don't we have the
people in, let's say Liberia,

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:36.840 align:middle line:84%
you buy a plane ticket
three weeks in advance.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And most Ebola patients
develop symptoms in 10 days.

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:46.600 align:middle line:84%
So you'd be two periods of
possibly developing Ebola.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.840 align:middle line:84%
So when you get to
the gate, chances

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.530 align:middle line:84%
would be that you
would be clean.

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:52.192 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Unless you
just got it, right?

00:11:52.192 --> 00:11:53.650 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: Unless
you just got it.

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:54.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's the problem.

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And then you contaminate the
plane and everything else

00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:58.952 align:middle line:90%
in them.

00:11:58.952 --> 00:12:00.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
you eradicate this?

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:03.600 align:middle line:84%
How do you-- worldwide,
how do you stop this?

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.510 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: Well,
you have to-- we're

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:07.130 align:middle line:90%
going the wrong way right now.

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:14.035 align:middle line:84%
The United States government--
Obama's got a $6 billion

00:12:14.035 --> 00:12:15.710 align:middle line:90%
bill he wants to put through.

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to cost
close to $40 billion.

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:24.170 align:middle line:84%
You've got to get out into the
bush and get into every village

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:26.720 align:middle line:84%
and show them how
to wash their hands.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.940 align:middle line:10%
And four weeks ago,
missionaries were

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:32.670 align:middle line:10%
chopped to death in a village
because the villagers thought

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:36.111 align:middle line:10%
that they were the evil ones
bringing in the disease.

00:12:36.111 --> 00:12:37.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They chopped them up?

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.401 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: They chopped
them up and killed them.

00:12:39.401 --> 00:12:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And so now a lot of people who
have Ebola keep mom at home.

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:47.970 align:middle line:84%
Because the guy down
the street got Ebola,

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:52.160 align:middle line:84%
and the devils in the plastic
suits came and took him.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And then five days later, they
brought him back in a body bag.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.040 align:middle line:90%
Well, what did they do to them?

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:03.335 align:middle line:84%
So we're not going to let
mom go with these devils.

00:13:03.335 --> 00:13:04.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a
way, Gary, that you

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.827 align:middle line:84%
can build your immune
system to fight off a virus?

00:13:08.827 --> 00:13:10.160 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: No, not on this one.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:14.950 align:middle line:10%
And of course, naturally,
with this panic

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:16.600 align:middle line:10%
there's a lot of
companies out there.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.470 align:middle line:90%
Take mine, take this, take that.

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And what the Ebola does once
it gets in the lymph nodes,

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:27.010 align:middle line:84%
it stimulates a couple
of chemical messengers

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:31.890 align:middle line:84%
and produces something which
we call a cytokine storm.

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And if you have a really
good immune system,

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:40.720 align:middle line:84%
that cytokine storm will destroy
the cells with the virus in it

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.290 align:middle line:90%
and other cells, too.

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:44.270 align:middle line:90%


00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And what it does to
stop that, the Ebola

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:50.370 align:middle line:84%
infects so many
of the lymph nodes

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:53.027 align:middle line:84%
that your immune system
actually goes down.

00:13:53.027 --> 00:13:54.110 align:middle line:90%
That's all there is to it.

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:56.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's been talk
that Ebola was created

00:13:56.220 --> 00:14:00.580 align:middle line:84%
in a laboratory and set
loose to try to wipe out

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:03.460 align:middle line:84%
these third world
nations, as they

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:06.420 align:middle line:84%
said about AIDS a
long time ago as well.

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:09.707 align:middle line:84%
Conceivable that this was
concocted in a laboratory?

00:14:09.707 --> 00:14:11.290 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: Don't
think so, because we

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:13.420 align:middle line:84%
can find it in
the fossil record.

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:18.160 align:middle line:84%
So unless somebody 200 million
years ago was doing it,

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.030 align:middle line:90%
it's been around.

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:23.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you, as an
infectious disease expert,

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.660 align:middle line:84%
would you go to these
troubled nations

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:28.280 align:middle line:90%
right now if they asked you to?

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:30.600 align:middle line:84%
Or would you be a
little skittish?

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.580 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: Skittish.

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:36.440 align:middle line:10%
The main reason is, is that the
gloves, the boots, the hats,

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:39.050 align:middle line:10%
and all that stuff you
put on to go in and take

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:44.960 align:middle line:10%
care of a patient, that's
70-year-old technology, OK?

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.460 align:middle line:84%
And so what you
need to do is to go

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:51.860 align:middle line:84%
into a completely
self-contained suit,

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:54.790 align:middle line:84%
and go in, and take
care of the patient.

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:58.770 align:middle line:84%
Then come out, and you could
stand, put your arms out

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:01.830 align:middle line:84%
in the shower, and get washed
down with chlorine water

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:05.620 align:middle line:84%
really well, take the
suit off, get washed down

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:09.030 align:middle line:84%
with the chlorine water, get
your feet, wash everything.

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Take your clothes,
and throw them out,

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:15.550 align:middle line:84%
and get into a paper
jumpsuit, and then head out

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:17.090 align:middle line:90%
to get your regular clothes.

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:18.880 align:middle line:84%
What these people
are doing is, is

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.950 align:middle line:84%
that when they come out
of the contaminated room

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:23.970 align:middle line:84%
to the clean room, they just
start grabbing the stuff

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:25.310 align:middle line:90%
and pulling it off.

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:27.980 align:middle line:84%
And there's a little bit
of secretion on this glove.

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:28.960 align:middle line:90%
They don't see it.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:30.740 align:middle line:90%
It gets on their fingertip.

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:33.560 align:middle line:84%
They go out to lunch and
put it in their mouth,

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:34.440 align:middle line:90%
and away it goes.

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:38.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm told, Gary, that
UV light, ultraviolet light,

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:43.229 align:middle line:84%
can kill-- there we go again--
can eradicate this virus.

00:15:43.229 --> 00:15:44.270 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: Yeah, it can.

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:48.470 align:middle line:84%
We've known for 100 years that
ultraviolet can kill bacteria.

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And there's a new
machine out there now

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:54.780 align:middle line:84%
called a Xenax machine,
and it has developed

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:58.740 align:middle line:84%
an ultraviolet light that's
25,000 times stronger

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:01.120 align:middle line:90%
than regular ultraviolet light.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:05.900 align:middle line:84%
And the machine will come into
a room, and it starts flashing.

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And in five minutes, it's
flashed the entire room.

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.520 align:middle line:84%
A person that's
really conscientious

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:16.900 align:middle line:84%
and is really cleaning with
a rag and chlorine water

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:19.830 align:middle line:90%
is only about 70% efficient.

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:23.310 align:middle line:84%
This Xenax machine,
everywhere that light hits,

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:26.280 align:middle line:84%
there's no bacteria,
fungus, or viruses.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's very good
at killing Ebola.

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:30.970 align:middle line:84%
So, example, you could
take this machine,

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:33.780 align:middle line:84%
roll it down the aisle
of an empty plane

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:36.250 align:middle line:90%
and just flash all the seats.

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And on the way back, flash
all the backs of the seats.

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:40.070 align:middle line:90%
Your plane's clean.

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:42.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And light, of
course, will hit everything.

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:42.780 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: It does.

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:43.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:46.865 align:middle line:84%
And they've got a couple of
them out in a couple hospitals.

00:16:46.865 --> 00:16:49.000 align:middle line:84%
The reports have
been really good.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And they're working on
a more portable version

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:56.920 align:middle line:84%
now so that the health care
worker comes and stands

00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:00.550 align:middle line:84%
in front of the machine and gets
flashed, and then turns around

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:03.280 align:middle line:84%
and gets five minute
of flashings this way.

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:04.510 align:middle line:90%
They're completely clean.

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:06.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what
does an Ebola virus

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:10.310 align:middle line:90%
look like when it's functioning?

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And then what does
it look like when

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.829 align:middle line:84%
you've zapped it
with a UV light?

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:15.500 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: OK.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:16.820 align:middle line:90%
What it is is that viruses--

00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:18.195 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
see a difference?

00:17:18.195 --> 00:17:18.903 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: Yeah.

00:17:18.903 --> 00:17:20.560 align:middle line:84%
Viruses come in
different shapes.

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:24.329 align:middle line:84%
And the Ebola virus, it looks
like a shepherd's crook.

00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:27.520 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a filament and
it has little hook on the end.

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:35.330 align:middle line:84%
Inside of it is your seven
genes wrapped on RNA.

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:38.730 align:middle line:84%
And there are little
bitty mucus plugs

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:43.150 align:middle line:84%
on the outside of the gene
so that it'll stick to a cell

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:45.820 align:middle line:84%
and help to dissolve, to
make a hole in the cell

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:48.600 align:middle line:90%
so the virus can go in.

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And what the
ultraviolet light does

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:56.120 align:middle line:84%
is that it messes the
genetic code up on the genes

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.170 align:middle line:90%
so they won't replicate.

00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:01.254 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what does it look
like after you've zapped it?

00:18:01.254 --> 00:18:03.420 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: I would say
it's going to look like kind

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.723 align:middle line:84%
of a slightly
shrunken up looking--

00:18:05.723 --> 00:18:07.056 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: More shriveled up and--

00:18:07.056 --> 00:18:09.730 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: Yeah,
shriveled and cooked.

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:11.300 align:middle line:90%
That would be the best way.

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:14.266 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So why even have
these viruses on this planet?

00:18:14.266 --> 00:18:15.640 align:middle line:84%
I've always believed
that there's

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.270 align:middle line:90%
a reason for everything, right?

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:18.680 align:middle line:90%
Or it shouldn't be here.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:22.680 align:middle line:84%
Even the mosquito-- god
forbid-- but the birds eat them,

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.130 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:27.085 align:middle line:84%
What's the purpose of a virus
like Ebola for crying out loud?

00:18:27.085 --> 00:18:28.460 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: Well,
it's definitely

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:31.910 align:middle line:84%
not intelligent design, I mean
for those who believe that,

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:37.440 align:middle line:84%
but they came at the
beginning of life

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:43.190 align:middle line:84%
and developed themselves
through trial and error

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:48.270 align:middle line:84%
to become a virus, and to
just replicate themselves

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:51.370 align:middle line:90%
every time they get into a cell.

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:54.820 align:middle line:84%
But they could have been
in prehistoric animals way

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:56.529 align:middle line:90%
before they were inside of us.

00:18:56.529 --> 00:18:57.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:57.970 align:middle line:90%
I come to you.

00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:59.020 align:middle line:90%
I have Ebola.

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:01.500 align:middle line:84%
You're an infectious
disease expert.

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:02.660 align:middle line:90%
What happens to me?

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:03.970 align:middle line:90%
What do we do?

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:06.870 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: Well,
unfortunately, a lot of places

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:10.340 align:middle line:84%
stall and have no idea
what they're doing.

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:11.782 align:middle line:90%
Put a mask on you--

00:19:11.782 --> 00:19:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do I come
through an emergency room?

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:14.690 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: Most people would.

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:16.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And people
are panicking, right?

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:16.560 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:17.700 align:middle line:90%
This guy's got Ebola.

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:18.340 align:middle line:90%
Get out!

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:20.960 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: And
that's the big bugaboo

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:24.590 align:middle line:84%
about this is is that the
test is called a PCR test.

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:27.040 align:middle line:90%
And not everybody has it.

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:30.580 align:middle line:84%
So you come in and you're sick,
we'll wear gloves and kind of

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:32.230 align:middle line:90%
be careful with you.

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:35.190 align:middle line:84%
But it could be hours
or days before I

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:37.240 align:middle line:90%
get my Ebola test back.

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.720 align:middle line:90%
So we put you in isolation.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I'm
getting worse, right?

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:42.635 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: Yeah.

00:19:42.635 --> 00:19:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And, naturally, from the
explosive diarrhea and things,

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:49.760 align:middle line:84%
you've got to pour tons
of fluids into them.

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.560 align:middle line:84%
And you look at their
sodium and potassium levels

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:55.260 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that you're
getting the right amount in,

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:58.720 align:middle line:84%
and just saturate
them with the fluids.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:19:59.860 align:middle line:90%
There's no known treatment.

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:02.820 align:middle line:84%
There was an antibody
called Zmapp,

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:08.970 align:middle line:84%
and that was developed by the
US Army Medical Research people

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:12.480 align:middle line:84%
under a black project for
three years and $10 million.

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:17.110 align:middle line:84%
They developed an antibody that
when you gave it to monkeys

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:18.730 align:middle line:84%
on the first day
of their infection,

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:20.560 align:middle line:90%
they had 100% survival.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:23.830 align:middle line:84%
As you go out, the
survival rate goes phew.

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:25.460 align:middle line:84%
So when they heard
they were going

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:28.360 align:middle line:84%
to bring that first
doctor back, they, quote,

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:32.800 align:middle line:84%
humanized the virus and
gave it to the doctor.

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And he was so many days out
I don't think it worked.

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And nobody's banging their
drum that that antibody worked.

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:45.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can the human
body fight it by itself?

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:48.310 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: No, because it's
overwhelming the human body.

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:50.350 align:middle line:90%
It's killing your immune system.

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:55.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So even one virus, one
tiny little virus in the body,

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:57.080 align:middle line:90%
would replicate and grow?

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.050 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: Yeah, exactly.

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:01.400 align:middle line:90%
If it could make it in.

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.900 align:middle line:84%
Not only does it destroy
your immune system,

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:05.940 align:middle line:90%
it's in your nervous system.

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:10.620 align:middle line:84%
The diarrhea could be
15, 20 times a day.

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:14.290 align:middle line:84%
You see people coming into
clinics not wearing pants,

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:17.240 align:middle line:90%
because they can't control it.

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.130 align:middle line:84%
So what you've got
to do is that you're

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:21.710 align:middle line:90%
looking at extreme dehydration.

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And so even if you
had an immune system,

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:26.160 align:middle line:84%
it wouldn't be
able to get around,

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.319 align:middle line:84%
because there's no
fluids in your body.

00:21:28.319 --> 00:21:28.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:30.110 align:middle line:90%
What about probiotics?

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:31.450 align:middle line:90%
Would they help you?

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:32.810 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: No.

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:38.170 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there's a big push
right now to develop vaccines.

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:43.410 align:middle line:84%
And I saw a panel discussion,
and Dr. Osterholm,

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:47.930 align:middle line:84%
who has a site called
cidrap, C-I-D-R-A-P,

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:50.610 align:middle line:84%
and he stopped all the
experts and just went,

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:52.700 align:middle line:84%
there isn't going
to be a vaccine.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:55.730 align:middle line:84%
And then a man in the
audience stood up and said,

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:57.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm from Liberia.

00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:58.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm a US citizen.

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:01.190 align:middle line:84%
12 of my family
members have died.

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:04.270 align:middle line:84%
You guys haven't talked
about Africa at all.

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Osterholm
said, there's a strike

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:10.430 align:middle line:84%
on right now in Liberia
because the health care

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:13.110 align:middle line:84%
workers can't get
gloves or masks.

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:17.240 align:middle line:84%
He says, I can order
an iPhone and have

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:19.860 align:middle line:84%
it made in Canada--
I mean, in China,

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:23.210 align:middle line:84%
and have it in my
hands in one week.

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:25.230 align:middle line:84%
He goes, is that
telling you something

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:28.900 align:middle line:90%
about what's going wrong here?

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:33.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a secret
conspiracy behind any of this?

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: I-- yeah,
I will say, yes.

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:41.540 align:middle line:84%
Because it's becoming
a political football.

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:44.720 align:middle line:84%
Before the elections, that's
all you heard about was Ebola.

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.280 align:middle line:84%
Elections were over, it
just fell off the strain.

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And so you've got to get
on the net to follow it.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:55.520 align:middle line:84%
And the reason it's going to be
a little conspiracy thing is,

00:22:55.520 --> 00:23:01.670 align:middle line:84%
is that Obama's Keystone
Pipeline was blocked,

00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:03.550 align:middle line:90%
and it's not going anywhere.

00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:06.670 align:middle line:84%
And the Republicans
are mad about that

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:08.020 align:middle line:90%
because there were backing it.

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:11.350 align:middle line:84%
So when Obama comes
out with a 6.2 billion

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:16.800 align:middle line:84%
dollar plan for Ebola,
they're going to gun it down.

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's just-- they asked
the experts if you've got it

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:24.761 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have
symptoms, could you

00:23:24.761 --> 00:23:25.760 align:middle line:90%
give it to other people?

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:27.980 align:middle line:90%
And they went, we don't know.

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:30.575 align:middle line:84%
And they went, what about
the dog carrying it?

00:23:30.575 --> 00:23:32.040 align:middle line:90%
You know, they shot a dog?

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:32.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:36.170 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: And they went, uh,
we don't know about that one

00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:36.870 align:middle line:90%
either.

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:41.380 align:middle line:84%
And, basically, we're
jumping into it.

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:43.550 align:middle line:84%
We got the 101st
Airborne over there.

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:46.119 align:middle line:84%
And you're just
jumping off a cliff,

00:23:46.119 --> 00:23:47.910 align:middle line:84%
because you have no
idea where the bottom's

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:49.400 align:middle line:90%
at with this thing.

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:52.054 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me about your
book "Bowling for Ebola."

00:23:52.054 --> 00:23:52.970 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: All right.

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:55.550 align:middle line:90%


00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:58.840 align:middle line:84%
"Bowling for Ebola" is--
the reason I call it that is

00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:02.570 align:middle line:84%
is that every time Ebola
comes up and throws the ball,

00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:03.870 align:middle line:90%
it's a strike.

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:06.780 align:middle line:84%
Every time the world
comes up, the ball

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:10.180 align:middle line:84%
goes backwards into the
crowd, or your fingers

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:13.340 align:middle line:84%
get stuck in the ball,
or it goes in the gutter,

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:15.500 align:middle line:84%
or it goes halfway
down and stops.

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And we haven't knocked
a pin over yet.

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:20.495 align:middle line:90%
All we're doing right now--

00:24:20.495 --> 00:24:21.328 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No strikes.

00:24:21.328 --> 00:24:23.580 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: We're just
doing supportive care.

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:26.920 align:middle line:84%
But in Liberia, you
get a cot and they

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:29.170 align:middle line:84%
try to bring you
soups and things

00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:32.220 align:middle line:84%
to drink because they
have no IV fluids.

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And Liberia-- 90% of the people
in Liberia are unemployed.

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:41.080 align:middle line:84%
Most places have no
electricity, sewage, or water.

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And the police and
fire departments

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.140 align:middle line:90%
gave up a long time ago.

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:46.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So why
would this virus seem

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.790 align:middle line:84%
to hit these areas, these
poor areas in West Africa?

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:54.040 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: Well, first
theory-- and they're still not

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:59.050 align:middle line:84%
sure on this one either-- is
that there is a fruit bat that

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:02.580 align:middle line:84%
is rather large, and
they catch the bat,

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:06.660 align:middle line:90%
and they cook him for protein.

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:12.060 align:middle line:84%
But they also take the bat,
cooked bat, into the cities,

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:14.530 align:middle line:84%
and they sell it as
what's called "bushmeat."

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:17.940 align:middle line:84%
So people eat that
contaminated bat,

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:20.740 align:middle line:84%
and they get Ebola
that way, too.

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And then the other theory is
that the monkeys' droppings are

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:28.180 align:middle line:84%
falling on food that
somebody may eat and get it.

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:35.120 align:middle line:84%
So, basically, it's just
more of a geological thing.

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:39.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you got heavy rains,
jungle area, this is all great.

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And the unfortunate thing,
there are 15 countries

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:47.140 align:middle line:84%
across the center of Africa
that are prime places

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:49.660 align:middle line:90%
to grow the bacteria.

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:55.285 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will the virus travel
in water, or will it die?

00:25:55.285 --> 00:25:56.910 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: It'll
travel in secretions.

00:25:56.910 --> 00:25:58.400 align:middle line:90%
It'll travel in water.

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.140 align:middle line:84%
That's the one of
the problems with it.

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:03.130 align:middle line:84%
They had the rainy season,
and a lot of these villages

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:04.740 align:middle line:90%
have no bathrooms.

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And, like I said, over
50% illiteracy rate.

00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:11.700 align:middle line:90%


00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:13.320 align:middle line:84%
So trying to go to
a village just to

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:16.370 align:middle line:84%
show them how to
wash their hands.

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:19.740 align:middle line:84%
We're so far behind
with these people

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:21.890 align:middle line:84%
that it just naturally
keeps moving.

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:25.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gary, the virus
Marburg, is that like Ebola?

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:26.770 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: It is somewhat.

00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:30.040 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when Ebola
first came out,

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:31.886 align:middle line:90%
they thought it was Marburg.

00:26:31.886 --> 00:26:35.060 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't.

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:38.290 align:middle line:84%
Marburg is still out there
and causing some infections

00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:39.280 align:middle line:90%
in Saudi Arabia.

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:40.696 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's very
similar, right?

00:26:40.696 --> 00:26:41.740 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: Yeah.

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:44.120 align:middle line:84%
But Saudi's got
good health care.

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:46.050 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they've got sewages.

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:50.270 align:middle line:84%
They've got good doctors,
and so it's contained.

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:53.330 align:middle line:84%
Right now, some states
in the United States

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:59.100 align:middle line:84%
have a doctor ratio of one
doctor to 1,900 people.

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:01.750 align:middle line:84%
Liberia right now, has
a ratio of, I think,

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:04.059 align:middle line:90%
one doctor per 100,000.

00:27:04.059 --> 00:27:04.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:05.400 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to happen.

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:06.240 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: Yeah.

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:10.790 align:middle line:84%
And you got 15,000 people
infected right now.

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:13.910 align:middle line:84%
If you want to take
care of those 15,000,

00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:17.510 align:middle line:84%
you have to bring
50,000 people in

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:19.610 align:middle line:84%
to give them nursing
care around the clock.

00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:21.026 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not
going to happen.

00:27:21.026 --> 00:27:24.110 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: Doctors, chemistry
machines, good buildings,

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:29.310 align:middle line:84%
lots of IV solutions, people
to bury these people, people

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:31.340 align:middle line:84%
to go out and find
them in villages

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:34.910 align:middle line:84%
and probably have to fight to
get them out of the village

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:36.470 align:middle line:90%
and get them in.

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:43.020 align:middle line:84%
So it's just an impossible task,
because before the CDC a week

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:46.290 align:middle line:84%
ago, before the elections,
they said worst case

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:49.436 align:middle line:90%
scenario 1.2 million by January.

00:27:49.436 --> 00:27:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know what the
elections had to do with this,

00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:55.310 align:middle line:84%
but after the elections,
the CDC pulled in and went,

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:56.540 align:middle line:90%
we're wrong.

00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:57.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Too high.

00:27:57.290 --> 00:28:00.920 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: Worse case
scenario's going to be 100,000.

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:02.280 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make any difference.

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:06.020 align:middle line:84%
A million or a 100,00, we've got
no capabilities to handle that.

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:07.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it airborne?

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:10.200 align:middle line:84%
If I sneezed on you and had
Ebola, would you get it?

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:12.130 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: Hot topic.

00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:13.620 align:middle line:90%
CDC said no.

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And first, CDC said
that if you put Ebola

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:20.770 align:middle line:84%
on a table top, three
to five hours it's gone.

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:26.150 align:middle line:84%
Now it's four to six days
they've picked it up.

00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:27.636 align:middle line:90%
The airborne--

00:28:27.636 --> 00:28:29.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can't
see it, right?

00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:29.160 align:middle line:90%
You can't see it.

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:29.500 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: No, you can't.

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:30.059 align:middle line:90%
No, well.

00:28:30.059 --> 00:28:30.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Too small?

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: It is
100,000 times smaller

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:37.540 align:middle line:90%
than the diameter of a hair.

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:38.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Aww,
you'll never see it.

00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:39.550 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: Never see it.

00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:40.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Look down there,
you wouldn't see Ebola.

00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:41.965 align:middle line:90%
>>RIDENOUR: No.

00:28:41.965 --> 00:28:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And so for a while they were
saying, oh, it's not airborne.

00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:52.430 align:middle line:84%
We're very afraid that it
may mutate to being airborne.

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:54.990 align:middle line:84%
Then the CDC
backtracked and said,

00:28:54.990 --> 00:29:00.220 align:middle line:84%
uh, but if a guy's got
Ebola and he sneezes at you,

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:01.540 align:middle line:90%
you're going to get it.

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:02.230 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:04.594 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they've
changed their posture.

00:29:04.594 --> 00:29:07.010 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: But then they go,
but it's not really airborne

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:07.510 align:middle line:90%
yet.

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:12.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So if you were on a
plane next to someone who just

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:15.240 align:middle line:84%
seemed to have sniffles
and wheezing and coughing

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:18.590 align:middle line:84%
and came from that
region of West Africa,

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:20.710 align:middle line:84%
would you want to
get up and move?

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:23.509 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: That might be
a good idea, to move away.

00:29:23.509 --> 00:29:25.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what do you
say the flight attendant?

00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:27.454 align:middle line:84%
I think this person
has Ebola, and they're

00:29:27.454 --> 00:29:28.620 align:middle line:90%
sneezing on me or something?

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:31.220 align:middle line:84%
>>This gentleman's very
sick, and he's bothering me,

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:33.537 align:middle line:84%
and I don't want to
get what he's got.

00:29:33.537 --> 00:29:34.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sorry, sir.

00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:37.680 align:middle line:84%
The plane is full, and you're
going to have to sit there.

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:39.090 align:middle line:90%
And we're already in the air.

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:41.240 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: Can I
sit in the toilet?

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:42.901 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's the problem.

00:29:42.901 --> 00:29:44.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You really want
to go into the restroom

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:46.580 align:middle line:90%
after he was in there?

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:51.110 align:middle line:84%
>>RIDENOUR: Well, that's why
the Xenax machine goes down

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:53.611 align:middle line:84%
the aisle of a plane and
sterilizes all the seats

00:29:53.611 --> 00:29:54.860 align:middle line:90%
and carpeting on the way down.

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:56.050 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You just aim it?

00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:56.760 align:middle line:10%
>>RIDENOUR: Yeah.

00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:57.530 align:middle line:10%
You drive it.

00:29:57.530 --> 00:30:00.160 align:middle line:10%
It's like R2D2, and
it's about that tall.

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:03.704 align:middle line:84%
Head comes up, and you sterilize
all the seats going down.

00:30:03.704 --> 00:30:04.370 align:middle line:90%
You turn around.

00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:05.786 align:middle line:84%
On the way back,
you get the backs

00:30:05.786 --> 00:30:07.360 align:middle line:90%
of the seats and the carpeting.

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:09.519 align:middle line:90%
And it's clean.

00:30:09.519 --> 00:30:10.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, thank you, Gary.

00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:13.150 align:middle line:84%
The information
is very valuable.

00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:14.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, not a lot
of people understand

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:17.540 align:middle line:84%
Ebola and what it
does, what causes it.

00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:20.850 align:middle line:84%
But if you listen to an
expert like Gary Ridenour,

00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:24.350 align:middle line:84%
you get a better idea
of what this is, just

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:26.450 align:middle line:90%
to protect you and your family.

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:28.390 align:middle line:10%
